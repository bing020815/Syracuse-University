<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, the GOP, the Grand Old Oil Party, is up to it again. Now, it is as if the first six years of the Bush administration never existed. The Republicans controlled the House, the White House, and the United States Senate. 
   Vice President Dick Cheney, at the President's behest, met secretly with the oil and gas industry and other energy producers and proposed an energy policy, a Republican energy policy. That policy was passed by the Republican House of Representatives, adopted by the Republican Senate, and signed by the Republican president. We have been living under it now for a couple of years, and it is having the predictable results. We are now more dependent upon foreign oil. And many of us who voted against that Republican energy policy said it was pushing the country in that direction. We are seeing prices jacked up to unbelievable levels. Many of us predicted at the time that the Bush/Cheney Republican energy policy would have those results. 
   They didn't mandate increases in fuel standards. They didn't mandate development of alternative fuels. They had a few pretend things about hydrogen which was far enough off in the future that it didn't upset their benefactors in the oil industry because they know hydrogen is 20, 30 years off. But things that we could have been moving toward quickly they were against. 
   Now suddenly they are all for action. They are all for action. 
   What do we need? We need more leases on the Outer Continental Shelf. Well, what about the fact that the industry today is sitting on leases that can access 80 percent of the known reserves of oil and gas off the United States of America? But they are simply not developing them. 
   Now, the industry says, well, they just don't have enough deep water drilling rigs and other things. But last year Enron, I mean--sorry. That is another guilty party here. But ExxonMobil made more money than any corporation in the history of the world, $40 billion. And what did they do with two thirds of their profit? Did they put it into new supply? Did they put it into new drilling equipment? Heck no. They bought back their own  stock to enrich their board and their execs. The president who retired got a $400 million retirement, and he bought an oil field in Africa with his retirement. Now that is where their profits and their money went. 
   They are in no hurry to develop new resources. But they would like to lock up what might still be out there while Bush and Cheney are in the White House so that they can get sweetheart deals like the one proposed yesterday for oil shale, because these are their oilmen in the White House. Plain and simple. That's what this bum's rush is all about. 
   The American people need short-term price relief. It isn't going to come through letting more leases in sensitive areas that the industry sits on. It would come from breaking the back of the speculators, something they don't want to do, closing the Enron loophole. 
   Remember Ken Lay, head of Enron from Texas, the President's biggest political benefactor throughout his entire life?

   Mr. DeFAZIO. The Enron loophole was created for him to trade oil and gas off the books. Well, Ken Lay is dead, before he went to prison. Enron is bankrupt, and the loophole lives on, and that is the price we are paying at the pump today because of commodity speculation. 
   Take on the speculators, break their back. Break their back any way you can. Re-regulate them or take oil out of the SPR. Break the back of the speculators. That will give us short-term price relief. Develop our resources in the midterm, and new energy future for the long term, not dependent upon oil and foreign oil.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. The Bush-Cheney energy policy has led America to a dead end, increasing dependence on imported oil and price gouging by big oil companies. 
   The new direction in energy policy to be considered here today puts America on a new path to energy independence and sustainability. It will be great for American consumers, saving billions at the pump; our businesses; our economy. And it will be great for the environment. 
   But it will be even better for millions of Americans in rural counties across  America. This bill also includes funding for critical county school payments. 780 counties in 42 States will get critical funding for law enforcement, search and rescue, and struggling rural schools. 
   My district, the Fourth Congressional District of Oregon, will avert a disaster if this legislation is adopted. 
   I thank the Democratic leadership for leading us in a new direction on energy and fulfilling their commitment to rural counties. 
   The ball was dropped by the Bush administration and by the Republicans. We're taking it up for all America here today by passing this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   There are a lot of reasons we're in this pickle we are today. But let's just remember one. George Bush elected 2000; Dick Cheney's secret meetings with the oil and gas industry. They formulated an energy policy. That energy policy was adopted by the Republican House, the Republican Senate, and signed by the Republican President. That was in 2005. Many of us said it was shortsighted, it would make us more dependent upon imported oil, and it has. 
   When George Bush was elected, 52 percent of our oil was imported. Today it's 58 percent. Many of us said it would drive up the price. It has. When George Bush was elected, it was $1.46 a gallon. Today it's $4.39 a gallon in my district. 
   So they're saying now suddenly, Whoa. It's the Democrats' fault. No. We're living under the failures of the Republican oil industry energy policy. There's actually 164,968,695 reasons why we're living under that. That's the amount of money the Republican Party has received from the oil industry in the last 18 years, $164 million in political contributions. Now, that's a pretty big motivation. 
   There's another thing going on here. Since George Bush took office, the profits of the oil industry have been $511 billion in this country. That's $511 billion out of Americans' pockets and into the oil industry's pockets. They made more money under 7 years of George Bush than they made in the entire quarter century preceding his presidency. Yeah. There's something a little bit rotten here. 
   They talk about drilling offshore and all of that stuff. Well, let's talk about short-term relief. 
   There's three ways to get short-term relief. One is release our oil. Release our oil. We have paid to put oil in the Strategic Reserve for emergencies. This is an emergency. It's been done three times: 1991, the price went down 33 percent; 2000, it went down 18 percent; 2005, it went down 9 percent.     
   That would give relief today at the pump, and there's another thing that we could do, but they're against this, too. 
   The gentleman from Texas talked about, oh, they want to file a complaint against OPEC. Well, you know, we probably do, but George Bush isn't going to do that, that's for sure. Here's George Bush holding hands with King Faisal of Saudi Arabia when he was over there begging them to increase production. 
   OPEC's production, with a doubling in the price of oil, is down 2 1/2 percent. They have colluded to drive up the price of oil and limit the supply, and we have a legal option, which the President refuses to use. He refuses to file a complaint in the World Trade Organization for a clear violation of the rules of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, article 11, by the OPEC countries.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. That would have an immediate impact for the American people. And then there's the speculators. 
   Today, the largest holder of oil resources in the United States of America is not ExxonMobil, not Shell, not Conoco, name all of our oil companies. No, it's Morgan Stanley on Wall Street, through their speculative activity, followed by Goldman Sachs and followed by others who are speculating and driving up the price of this market. 
   We have credible testimony from Wall Street experts, if we reined in the speculation which was created by the Enron loophole--remember Enron? Texas corporation, Ken Boy Lay, the President's best friend. He's dead. Enron's bankrupt. He would have gone to jail for fraud. But the loophole lives on, and we're all paying at the pump. An estimated 50 percent, according to Wall Street experts, is going into speculative activities, but they don't want to take on speculative activities. They just want to talk about one thing, and that is, they want to drill in ANWR. 
   Well, guess what, ANWR was made a national wildlife refuge in 1950. The Naval Petroleum Reserve was made a petroleum reserve by Warren Harding. Now, why was this a natural preserve and this an oil preserve? Because they know there's more than 10 billion barrels of oil under here. Republicans change it from a naval reserve to a national reserve, and Bill Clinton actually leased it. And yesterday, George Bush announced he's going to lease more of it. 
   There's 10 billion barrels of oil under this. That's our Saudi Arabia. They've drilled 25 wells, but they haven't tried to connect to the Alaska pipeline. They've capped the wells and they're sitting on them. And why are they sitting on them? Because they think if they keep manipulating the market they can make as much money as possible today and even more down the road. They are sitting on supplies of oil, and they are failing to develop what they could.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I had to come to the floor when I heard the gentleman from Texas and he talked about the Democrats' plan is working. No, actually, we're living under the Republican energy plan. Remember that in 2001 DICK CHENEY had secret meetings with all the executives in the oil industry and other energy producers. And in 2005--the gentleman has a short memory--the Republicans, after 4 years, passed an all-Republican energy policy written by DICK CHENEY, passed by the Republican House and the Republican Senate and signed by George Bush. 
   And it is working exactly as some of us predicted. We said it would make us more dependent on Saudi oil. It did. Fifty-two percent imports when George Bush took office, 58 percent of our oil is imported today. We said it would raise the price. It did. When George Bush took office, gas was a $1.47 a gallon. Today it is $4.39 a gallon in my district. 
   But it raised one other thing that is vitally important to the Republican Party. Their friends in the oil industry have made a pile of money since George Bush took office. Five hundred eleven billion with a ``B'' dollars profit for the oil industry since George Bush took office. So, yes, this is intentional. And yes, it was designed, signed, sealed and delivered by the Republican Party when they controlled all of Washington, D.C. We are living under their energy policy. 
   We are trying to set a new, sustainable energy future for this country. And in the interim, yes, we want to develop domestic resources with the DRILL Act to help us with that transition. But we want to break the dependence. You don't. You made it worse.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   In 1923, President Harding took the Saudi Arabia of the United States and put it into the Naval Petroleum Reserve. There is a huge pool of known oil, over 10 billion barrels underneath what has now been called, and the Republicans changed it from the Naval Petroleum Reserve to the National Petroleum Reserve. And yes, indeed, President Clinton did let the first leases in that more than a decade ago. 
   The companies have drilled 25 test wells to find out there is indeed oil under there, but they have not connected over here to the Prudhoe Bay pipeline and there is no construction going on and no active drilling going on. 
   Now this area that they want to argue about, in 1950 it was made into a wildlife reserve. Now this was made into a Naval Petroleum Reserve because it has huge amounts of known oil. This was made into a wildlife reserve because it has huge amounts of known wildlife. President Harding didn't make ANWR into the Naval Petroleum Reserve because no one knows if there is any oil under there. They try to pretend that they know that there is oil there, but the Bush administration's own Mineral Management Service says there is a 50 percent chance of recoverable oil under ANWR. 
   So why not drill here in NPR-A? Why don't the Republicans and the oil companies want to fully exploit these 10 billion barrels of oil? I think there is a pretty simple answer to that, because they are doing really well under the Bush-Cheney energy policy. Remember, written in secret, voted on and put into law by the Republican Congress, signed by George Bush. During George Bush's tenure, the profits of the oil companies have been $511 billion, a new record every year George Bush has been in office, more money in 7 years than in the preceding quarter-century. 
   This system is working quite well for them. They don't want to increase supply. In fact, they are working hand-in-glove with OPEC and others who are colluding to restrict supply. 
   Drill responsibly in leased land. Exploit America's resources.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Back when George Bush was elected in 2001, gas was $1.48 a gallon, and we imported 52 percent of our oil. Today, gas is $4.39 a gallon in my district, and we're importing 58 percent of our oil. In the meantime, what's been done? 
   Well, we adopted the Republican energy plan, formulated in secret by DICK CHENEY--yet another oilman along with George Bush--and some people say, Well, it's not working. I think it's working. Record profits for the oil industry and their friends, $551 billion since George Bush took office and more dependence on imported oil from Saudi Arabia and other friends of the President. 
   We need a new energy policy in this country, and we're striking out in that direction. We've already passed new mandates for fuel efficiency. We tried to move us towards renewables. But we need some interim supply. That's why we have the DRILL Act up today. We need interim supply, but Big Oil is sitting on leases that can access 80 percent of our estimated reserves in Alaska and the Outer Continental Shelf, and they're not drilling it.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Despite the fact that America has been at war--we are in the sixth year in Iraq--the President is continuing to attempt to hide the true cost to the American people. He is asking Congress to declare an emergency to pay for the troops' salaries, to provide them with body armor, ammunition, and other needs in the war. It is certainly not an emergency. It certainly could have been anticipated, particularly given the fact that he is so stubborn about not setting any plan to get the U.S. out of that quagmire. But, to add insult to injury, the President says the war in Iraq is an emergency, and $108 billion is what he wants to borrow but not a penny more for domestic emergencies or needs; not a penny more, the President says. He will veto the bill if any of that money is spent here in the United States of America to help Americans' suffering, high gas prices, to help my counties and schools that are losing their Federal money, to help fishermen who have been deprived of their living this year with emergency closures. Those aren't emergencies in George Bush's book, but the ongoing war in the sixth year in Iraq is. 
   Unfortunately, it appears that the Democratic leaders of Congress are going to cave in to Bush's strong-armed tactics and his unreasonable attitude, and will send him a bill that he can sign instead of putting forward Democratic priorities to the President: Extended unemployment benefits, a little bit of energy assistance for the American people who are suffering because they are being gouged by the oil and gas industry, my critical county and school payments, disaster assistance for salmon fishers on the west coast, and others. They appear like they are ready to cave in to the President on this and send him a bill that he can sign. That's wrong. 
   As Democrats, we are here to defend the priorities and the needs of the American people. We know Bush is there for the corporations. We know he is there for his war in Iraq. Let's demonstrate that. Let's send him a bill. 
   Now, in terms of the county and school payments, the Republican Congress and the Bush administration allowed the law to expire. That has created a crisis. Last year, we did get emergency spending despite Bush's then veto threat to help the counties and schools through one more year as we worked on a longer term fix. In December, the House did pass a longer term fix. Unfortunately, since the Senate is not a democratic institution, 40 Senators--40 Republican Senators--were able to strip the critical county and school funding out of that bill. So, again, we languish without authorization for payments in the coming year. 
   So this is an emergency. We are going to see counties that are very large, counties in my district almost the size of New England that are going to be deprived of sheriff's patrols in rural areas. We are going to see jail beds closed and prisoners put out on the streets. We are going to see animal control ended. This is a crisis. These counties have no alternative. They are more than half-owned by the Federal Government. It is the Federal Government's policies that have brought them to this place. That was recognized by the former President as he put in place a plan to make up for the lost revenue from the changes in Federal policies. 
   It is time for this administration to agree that those counties need some  help. I have written to the President. I have asked him to change his mind and allow counties and schools to receive at least some amount of funding this year as a true domestic emergency, not to draw a line in the sand and say he will only borrow money to pursue an open-ended war in Iraq, but he will not borrow a penny for the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, finally, I have some grounds for agreement with the President, at least rhetorically. He says he is committed to balancing the budget by 2012. Unfortunately, after that statement, our disagreements begin. 
   First and foremost, he forgets or neglects to tell the American people that he achieves this so-called balance by borrowing $1.2 trillion of Social Security surplus, spending it and replacing it with IOUs. 
   Remember, just last year, the President was shocked, shocked, when he went to Parkersburg, West Virginia, that the Social Security trust fund consisted of nothing but IOUs. 
   Now, the Federal Government is pretty good for its debts unless you run up such a mountain of debt and you cut revenues so much with tax cuts for the wealthy that you can't afford to meet those obligations; you can't afford to cash in the bonds or the IOUs to Social Security. And I believe that is his long-term plan, to bankrupt Social Security, Medicare and other New Deal programs that this administration viscerally hates because they don't encourage people to stand on their own. They say it would be a more productive society if we just didn't have all those social support programs or guarantees of Social Security. 
   I think they give people an opportunity. They allow people to take chances during their life because they know, if they don't make it in that business or something else they are trying to do, at least they have got a foundation there for their later years. So we should not jeopardize Social Security; the President should not borrow and spend the entire Social Security surplus just before the baby boomers retire. 
   But even after he does that, the President's budget does not achieve balance. Far from it. The President's budget assumes there will be no cost for the war in Iraq or the war in Afghanistan after 2009. I guess he has a withdrawal plan he has not told us about. 
   What about the much vaunted war on terror? No money in the future budgets for that. He assumes all that goes away, you know, the incredible amounts of money we are spending there. 
   He further assumes that if we cut taxes more for the wealthy, that the government will get more revenues. Now, isn't that a beautiful world? If we could just eliminate taxes for the wealthy, I guess we would go back to having surpluses for the Federal Government under the bizarre economic theories followed by these neoconservatives who thus far have been proven to be pretty wrong on a host of things, starting with Iraq and on down to their bizarre theories that, as you reduce revenues, your revenues increase. They don't. 
   Plain and simple, the wealthiest among us have to start paying their fair share to support this country particularly in a time of crisis. Why shouldn't they sacrifice? Like the young men and women, many of whom are in the National Guard because they needed an income. Yes, they wanted to serve our country, but they also needed the income; many of whom are in the military, yes, because they want to serve our country but also because they hope to get those education benefits and some training to do better when they come out. 
   But the wealthiest, they are given a total buy. They have been given tax cuts, the first tax cuts in a time of war in the history of the United States of America. But the President doesn't think we should ask anything of the wealthy, and he pretends that if we extend their tax breaks forever, if we eliminate taxes on estates worth over $5 million, then in fact the government will have more revenues. Unfortunately, it is not true. It will increase the deficit wildly beyond the numbers in his budget. 
   So he borrows all of the Social Security surplus, robs the trust funds, spends the money, replaces it with IOUs, cuts taxes for the rich people. How else does he pretend to get the balance? By cutting Medicare.     
   That will help. $252 billion cut in Medicare, cutting Medicaid health care for poor people, that will get us to balance, would not want to ask the rich people. 
   The tax cuts for the rich people so far exceed the cuts that he is making in Medicare and Medicaid, we could fully fund those programs and just ask to restore a fraction of the taxes on people who earn over $300,000 a year and have estates more than $5 million, but the President does not want to do that. 
   He goes on through the entire budget slashing. Again, I agree with what he said. Unfortunately, he did not deliver. He said he would increase Pell Grants. His budget does not increase Pell Grants. It does not increase opportunity for young people to go to college. He does not take on the student loan programs where, if we converted from a bank subsidy program to a national direct student loan program, like I got when I went to college, we could give lower interest rates and make money for the taxpayers. No, he would rather give 17 cents of every dollar of every loan to the banks as profits and subsidies and take it out of the pockets of the students. 
   This is not an opportunity budget, it is not an honest budget, and it will take this country further down the road toward bankruptcy. That will be George Bush's legacy.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE IS ABYSMAL -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the commission which Congress created during the enactment of the surface transportation, the SAFETEA-LU bill, reported its results to the Congress in terms of the state of the Nation's infrastructure. The short version is that the state of the Nation's infrastructure is abysmal. We are seeing dramatically increased congestion. We are seeing bridges collapse. We are losing ground. We are not even maintaining the investment made by the Eisenhower generation in the Nation's interstate system let alone other vital national needs. It needs immediate attention. 
   And, of course, investment in our infrastructure will produce jobs. Large numbers of jobs will be produced should we go ahead with this needed construction, not only construction jobs but suppliers, small businesses, communities will benefit. The economy as a whole will benefit in terms of our economic productivity and competitiveness with just-in-time delivery and other concerns. And the American people will benefit in terms of more time at home, less time in commutes, less fuel wasted in congestion and backups in traffic. These are investments that need to be made. 
   The commission, a bipartisan commission, by a large majority said we need to be investing between $220 and $335 billion a year from all sources, Federal, State, local, and private, in the Nation's transportation infrastructure.     
   And today we're investing about $87 billion, about a third of the minimum they think is necessary. This is a wake-up call that's long overdue to this Congress, to this administration, and to the country about how we're losing ground. We're headed toward Third World status in terms of our Nation's transportation infrastructure. That is not acceptable. 
   Unfortunately, the Bush administration, the headquarters of the head in the sand folks, are saying no additional Federal investment is necessary; that all of that $220 billion can come from privatizing the Nation's highways; tolling and pricing people off the roads will help mitigate congestion. Yes, they want to toll existing highways, paid for by taxpayers, they want to put extortionate tolls on where they would charge more at rush hour. Now, if you happen to live on the east side of town and work on the west side and have to travel a congested highway, from George Bush and Mary Peters, Secretary of Transportation, the message is, quit your job, move, or tough luck, suck it up. That's not acceptable for America. We are not going to solve this problem through the fantasies of this administration. You're not going to solve it with the privatization of our existing network. 
   Now, in certain areas, tolling, congestion pricing and private-public partnerships, done properly, protecting the public interest, can contribute a small amount. The estimates are, generously, maybe 10 percent. But the Bush administration is saying that can do 100 percent because they're saying they will never ever support any increase in any taxes to increase any investment in the national transportation infrastructure. That's a shame. That's an incredible shame. And it is doing an amazing disservice to the future of our economy. 
   And as we stagger in this recession created by the policies of this administration, one of the best ways that we can begin to build out of it and to make ourselves more productive in the future and prevent future recessions is investment in our infrastructure. You can justify borrowing money to build things that are going to last 30, 50, 100 years and benefit all of the American people and our economy. They want to borrow money to give more tax cuts to the few rich people, many of whom have done fabulously well, some of whom lost their shirts with speculation in this recent market. Other sides of the speculators made hundreds of millions and billions of dollars by speculating on the collapse of the housing market, while the Bush administration and Alan Greenspan and everybody watched the bubble grow and grow and grow and grow and did nothing. 
   We need a concrete investment for the future, an investment in our transportation infrastructure, despite what Mary Peters and George Bush think is one of the best ways to promote the long-term health and competitiveness of the United States of America. We should begin to make those investments.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, President Bush and Vice President Cheney have made much on the talk shows of the last 2 weeks saying the Congress--the Democrats--are trying change direction in Iraq and should listen to the military professionals. Now, if only this administration had taken its own advice. If they had listened to the military professionals and the intelligence professionals, we would never have gone to war in Iraq. The trail of this administration to the sad fourth anniversary of Mission Accomplished is littered with professional, military and intelligence advice that was either ignored, discarded or deliberately distorted. 
   There were no links to 9/11 and al Qaeda. That was recently declassified in a report on April 6 of this year. 
   There were no weapons of mass destruction, despite statements from the likes of Vice President Cheney. ``We believe Saddam has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons.'' 3/16/2003. 
   The war has drug on for 4 long years since the President--dressed as a fake fighter jock--landed on the deck of an aircraft carrier and declared Mission Accomplished. Since that day, more than two U.S. soldiers have died every day for 1,460 days. Three thousand three hundred forty-two have died, 3,205 since George Bush proclaimed mission accomplished. 
   Now, they have been so wrong all along with their inside advice, their made-up intelligence, their own neocon theories. They were wrong about, again, ``We will, in fact, be greeted as liberators. I think it will go relatively quickly, weeks rather than months.'' Vice President Cheney. 3/16/2003. 
   ``We're dealing with a country that can finance its own reconstruction and  relatively soon.'' 3/27/2003, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, who was promoted to the World Bank so he could get his girlfriend a job. He was kind of wrong, too. 
   Now the scandals are unfolding about what little reconstruction has been done and how poorly it was done. But Halliburton has benefited tremendously--over $25 billion of no-bid contracts which has probably boosted Vice President Cheney's portfolio quite a bit. So there have been some successes in this effort. 
   Our troops have done everything that was asked, many of them now on their second and third tour of duty. They are mired in the midst of a 1,400-year-old sectarian conflict--a civil war. The Iraqi government has delivered on no promises to take meaningful steps to end that civil war. There is not a singular military solution to this conflict. There must be a political solution in Iraq. There must be diplomacy in the region. And yes to the President and the Vice President--we need a new direction. 
   And this Congress is listening to the professionals. Unfortunately, mostly we have to hear from the retired generals and the others because those who are still in uniform are being gagged by this administration from giving their true opinions about the changes that are necessary to extract our troops from the midst of that conflict. 
   This is a sad fourth anniversary. But it is the first anniversary of attempts by this Congress to stand up for its constitutional obligations and begin to try and change course, to end the stay-the-course, open-ended commitment of George Bush and DICK CHENEY who have been wrong every step of the way. 
   Someone else needs to push for change in Iraq, because it will never come from this White House.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (TIME FOR A CHANGE IN COURSE -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. The Republican minority would say take the advice of the professionals. Well, if this administration had taken the advice of the military professionals, remember General Shinseki, ``400,000 troops on the ground or you'll have an insurgency,'' they fired him because he talked about reality. 
   From day one they've been dumb: firing Shinseki; delusional: ``we'll be greeted as liberators'' and the war will be short; and deliberately deceptive: Saddam Hussein had links to 9/11 and they had weapons of mass destruction. 
   It's time for a change in course. They want status quo, stay the course. It's not working. Our troops are mired in the middle of a civil war. Someone needs to take the role of leadership here. It's not going to be Bush and CHENEY. It can be the United States Congress reasserting itself as a third co-equal branch of government and the only branch which has the authority to declare war and set limits. Yes, set limits on a war, and bring it to an end.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman. 
   We are talking about a Federal mandate here. It is good policy. We need to protect our critical clean water resources. But this is a Federal mandate put on our local communities. 
   The Republicans, for 12 years, have failed to reauthorize this law and have consistently cut funding to our communities in the face of this unfunded Federal mandate. The backlog has grown from $300 to $500 billion over the next 20 years to maintain, rehab and, yes, do some new construction for population growth. 
   We have here a very aptly named ``SAP'' from the White House. The White House says $14 billion is excessive. Let's see, that is about 3 to 5 percent of the demonstrated need in this unfunded mandate on our communities, and the White House says, 3 to 5 percent, that's excessive. And then they go on with this ideological claptrap: ``It will distort market signals by discouraging utilities and their consumers from moving toward full cost pricing, and they will delay undertaking projects.'' My community is under consent agreements under law, under Federal law to do this. They can't delay. What a bunch of claptrap. They are trying to take care of Wall  Street here and not Main Street. Wall Street wants to be able to issue these bonds in the private sector. They don't want the government to help these communities. They can make a little bit of commission there. 
   And they want to drive down the wages of the workers. Why do you hate the middle class so much? Why don't you think people should earn a living wage? What claptrap. ``The market should set wages altogether. We shouldn't have a minimum wage.'' Come on, what planet are you people from? Who do you represent? Do you represent the special interests, or do you represent average and working families in this country? 
   Look at the communities in my district. Coburg, a thousand people; $95 debt retirement, plus user fees. Not exactly a wealthy community. Sweet Home, 7,500 people, a depressed timber community in the mountains, $220 a month if they don't get some help for their fees. Gardner, 340 people on the coast; $2.5 million for 340 people. And the White House says helping them would be excessive and it would distort the market. 
   Why do you hate the middle class and our communities so much? And guess what, businesses are going to suffer, too, if we don't make this investment.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (A FAILED STRATEGY -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, Vice President Cheney, on the looming war in Iraq, of which he was a principal architect, he and his staff are responsible for the manipulation and manufacturing of intelligence that misled people into believing there was a threat of weapons of mass destruction or there was some ties to 9/11. Neither of those things was true. Vice President Cheney said we will, in fact, be greeted as liberators. I think it will go relatively quickly. Weeks, rather than months, said Vice President Cheney, and he still does not believe that he was wrong. 
   He is still a principal architect of the surge, of an escalation of the war in Iraq, of continuing a war without end, a war that President Bush said last November it will be up to the next President to determine when U.S. troops might come home. 
   A failed strategy, a strategy that fails our troops. Our troops have done all that we have asked and more under difficult conditions. They started with inadequate equipment, and Congress had to push the administration to give them the equipment they needed. They have been put on brutal rotations, stop/loss orders, and they have done more than was asked. 
   But the leadership has failed. Donald Rumsfeld is gone. He should have gone a very long time ago. Vice President Cheney is still there pulling the strings. We will be greeted as liberators, he said. 
   Then the President two months later said major combat operations have ended, 1st of May. Nearly 3,000 American troops have died since the President gave that speech. Over 12,000 have been seriously wounded, very seriously wounded; and yet their answer is more of the same, stay the course, to escalate the conflict. They will not engage in meaningful diplomacy, and they will not change direction in Iraq. Their strategy will not bring a successful end to this war. 
   They are now again trying to tie it to 9/11 and al Qaeda. Yet they are contradicted, in fact, by the Director of National Intelligence, a Bush appointee. When he was asked, Mike McConnell, if al Qaeda would establish itself in Iraq and they would launch attacks from there, I would not go so far as to say al Qaeda would necessarily believe that. They want to reestablish their base and their objective would be in Afghanistan. 
   Remember Afghanistan? Remember Osama bin Laden? Remember 9/11? Remember the Taliban? They are still out there. They are planning and plotting. Afghanistan is going in a bad direction because the President diverted our attention, our troops, our resources away from a battle that was supported by all the major nations in the world to eradicate those who had attacked us so grievously on 9/11 into a discretionary war in Iraq, and still, the President would put the emphasis on Iraq. 
   His National Security Adviser says this is a charade what they would do in the House of Representatives, a charade. If it is a charade, why are they fighting so hard? For the first time, Congress is going to exert its constitutional responsibility as a third and coequal branch to say enough failed leadership is enough and we want a new direction. 
   The Speaker came to the well earlier and laid that out in detail, what that new direction would be, and this bill that we will vote on later this week would move us in that new direction. That is not a charade. That is the first meaningful challenge to the failure of leadership by Vice President Cheney and George Bush that have put that region at risk, that has put American troops in the middle of a civil war, which is now admitted by the Pentagon. 
   We did not go there to be referees in the middle of a 1,400-year-old sectarian conflict in a civil war. The Iraqis are going to have to resolve those issues themselves. 
   I wrote to the President 2 years ago February and said you need to set meaningful timelines to force the Iraqis to come together and begin to resolve their differences. They still do not want to do that. 
   Americans should not be the surrogates. We should not be in the middle. Our troops should not be in the middle. 
   This bill is extraordinarily important. Yes, the President might veto it, but we are going to challenge him again and again and again until we get a new direction that better serves our country, our troops, that region and the world.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the Republicans belittling the 100 hours, say, well, we really didn't do much. It is low hanging fruit. Well, if that is so, why in the last 12 years did the Republicans not raise the Federal minimum wage? In fact, they didn't even allow a vote on raising the Federal minimum wage in the last decade, and they would belittle that because they don't care about working people in this country. 
   They said a year ago, their leaders in face of the Abramoff scandal which enveloped the Republican Party, that they would have ethics reform on the floor and passed before the end of February. Well, February came and went. We got it done in January, a year later, after we took control. They couldn't even clean up their own mess. And they belittle what we are doing. 
   A year ago, they jammed through legislation to raise the cost of student financial aid to pay for tax cuts for wealthy investors, to extend those tax breaks from 2008 to 2010. Yesterday, we passed legislation to cut the costs of interest and student financial aid in half. We took on big banks, and we will take on the wealthy investors. There is a big difference in this Congress, and the Republicans are whining.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (LAPSE OF SAFE AND SECURE COUNTY RURAL SCHOOLS ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, as I speak here on the floor of the House today, layoff notices are being prepared for teachers, for county sheriff deputies, and other workers in counties in the Pacific Northwest and indeed, across America. This is a result of the lapse of something called the Safe and Secure County Rural Schools Act, legislation that was enacted in a bipartisan way when Bill Clinton was President of the United States and the Republicans controlled the House and the Senate. And this legislation was adopted in recognition that many counties across America are substantially owned by the Federal Government. And the Federal Government is obviously exempt from taxes. And because of major changes in Federal environmental laws, timber harvest in those counties has dropped dramatically, in some cases to near zero. Therefore, the shared revenues, under a compact with the Federal Government, of these counties and schools have shared in the revenues with the Federal Government. And now, for many counties, these revenues would be near zero without the guarantees that were enacted in the last year of the Clinton presidency. I argued at the time that they should be made permanent. Unfortunately, lobbying by the timber industry and some county commissioners who hadn't thought this through, who thought they could drive a crisis and maybe get a change in forest policy, they were made temporary. They have expired as of the 1st of October and that is why the layoff notices are being prepared now. 
   Congress must act to renew this legislation. Congress needs to hold up its end of the bargain with these counties and these schools across America. The formula is based on historic timber harvest, and historic timber harvest has dropped dramatically, as I said earlier. Some criticize Oregon saying, well, you get a lot of the money. Well, we have the highest Federal ownership of forest lands and the highest timber harvest on Federal lands, and we also have something that is very unique called the ONC lands, which are a vestige of a failed railroad and revestiture of Federal lands and the agreement between the counties and the Federal Government. Quite complicated. 
   But the bottom line is, we are just asking the Federal Government to make good on its commitment, its partnership. Otherwise, we are going to see, essentially, counties in southwest Oregon who have very little other opportunity to raise revenues, and none regarding the Federal lands. They don't get PILT payments or anything else. We are going to see them laying off vital service providers. There are large parts of southwest Oregon that could become virtually lawless with our State cutbacks in State police and the question of whether or not we will be able to have county sheriff patrols in large areas. In my home county, the size of the State of Connecticut, you know, once when this happened previously, because of a depression in the timber industry, we had no deputies in an area the size of the State of Connecticut, outside of the cities. With the meth epidemic in rural areas in the West and other things, this would be very bad, not only for Oregon and those counties, but for the entire western United States. It is in the public interest. 
   We are hopeful, we have asked the President to put it in his budget. Last year he sort of haphazardly put it in his budget after ignoring the issue for a number of years. Unfortunately, the financing mechanism that the President chose was immediately criticized by Republican Senators, and declared to be a nonstarter. There are indications it may be in the President's budget this year. We are hoping that the President has found a more suitable offset, something that we can bring to the Congress and begin to move this legislation through. 
   We need to look at the emergency supplemental for the possibility of a 1-year extension, and then I am committed to moving a permanent extension through a committee on which I serve, the Resources Committee. Greg Walden and I did that 2 years ago very quickly. But the bill stalled out in Agriculture. Hopefully, this time after we get it out of the Resources Committee, that it will move more expeditiously through the Agriculture Committee for the deliberation of the entire Congress. It is not just the Pacific Northwest at risk. It is hundreds of counties and school districts, from Florida to Maine, all across America, who are at risk. And this Congress and this President need to act to fulfill this commitment and this promise.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, who would have ever thought that the Republicans would be defending welfare queens on the floor of the House of Representatives, but they are. 
   Lee Raymond, just-retired CEO, ExxonMobil, $400 million, part of it in tax subsidies, part of it in royalty forgiveness, and part of it gouging consumers at the pump. But they are standing up here today to defend poor little ole Lee Raymond with his $400 million pension and ExxonMobil, his company, that only made $29.2 billion last year, the largest corporate profit in the history of the world. 
   They need those subsidies or they will not go out and explore for oil, the Republicans will tell us. Here they are defending welfare queens, subsidies to the most profitable industry in the world. It is sad to see the Republicans come to this. 
   Now, they laughably say this will lead to higher prices. Oh, higher prices, unlike the price gouging after Katrina where gasoline went over three bucks a gallon in Oregon and we do not even get any supply from the eastern United States? Or the price gouging that goes on day in, day out? The price fixing that goes on day in, day out in this industry? The collusion between the American companies, the foreign companies operating in America, and the OPEC cartel to drive down the supply, to drive up the price, which gives them an excuse to go even higher at the pump? 
   What about a trade complaint to the WTO? No, the Republican administration does not support that, but George Bush does support two provisions of this bill, saying those are tax breaks that are not necessary to the oil industry. The oil man in the White House says the oil industry does not need this, and the Republicans are down here fighting hard to preserve it, to drain money from the taxpayer, to not take royalties. Unlike any other owner of public resources, the United States would be the only one not to take royalty. 
   Now, they talked about communism. That would be communism if we did not get a fair return for our taxpayers, if we did not get a fair return for depleting our resources. 
   Pass this bill and begin to turn back the inordinate influence of Big Oil on this government.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, we are going to give the Republicans another chance today. They have been standing up for Big Oil this week and their obscene profits, but we are going to give them a chance one more time. Twice they have killed legislation on the floor of the House to rein in energy speculators. Now they are creating this fantasy that George Bush lifting the moratorium on offshore oil drilling drove down the price of oil. 
   Well, no. Actually, the price of oil started to drop when we first debated reining in energy speculation on the floor of the House. It had already dropped considerably before Bush lifted the moratorium. 
   Oil 10 years out is doing nothing for this year's speculation. Going after the speculators by releasing oil from the SPR and breaking their backs, or just reining them in with regulation, which this administration hates, which has brought about the crash on Wall Street, will bring much more immediate relief to the American consumers. 
   If we rein in speculation, then we won't see these obscene run-ups again next year around Memorial Day. $600 billion of speculative money flooded into that market. When it started flowing out, the price of oil dropped. 
   Rein in the speculators. Come on, GOP; stand up with us and take on Wall Street.

   And there's one more little cruel joke hidden in here. He doesn't tell them about that tax deduction which would also allow them to take a deduction against their Social Security. For a family or a person earning $30,000 a year, it would cut their Social Security benefits in half. The President will do anything to help his friends in the insurance industry; he doesn't care much about those who are uninsured or who need help with health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (THE RISING PRICE OF GAS -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. As I speak on the floor today, across America citizens are being gouged at the gas pump once again. Every year, as certain as Memorial Day is celebrated at the end of this month, the oil industry jacks up prices. 
   On the west coast in Oregon, I paid $3.43 a gallon for regular in Springfield. My colleague, Greg Walden, paid $3.99 on the east side of the mountains. The local paper accounts for this by saying ``unexpected refinery maintenance.'' Hmm. Maybe they could schedule maintenance at a different time of year. No, that wouldn't be quite so profitable for the industry. In fact, the industry has been colluding for more than a decade to close down refinery capacity so they can have these wonderful price spikes and gouge American consumers. 
   There was an industry memo back then saying how the refinery sector wasn't particularly profitable, but through mergers the industry has managed to do away with more than 100 refineries. Now we have a refinery shortage. And if they just close one down to sweep the floors, the price of gas goes up 20 cents a gallon and the industry execs cry all the way to the bank and to their bonuses. This has to stop. We have to get back in charge of this industry. We've got to break up these huge conglomerates. Start with a moratorium on further mergers. Break 'em up. Impose a windfall profits tax. Unless they invest in more refinery capacity, unless they invest in new fuels or energy efficiency, confiscate the money from them through a windfall profits tax which they have taken from the American consumers through price-gouging and reinvest it to bring down prices and make this country more energy-efficient in the future. We need both a short-term and a long-term strategy to deal with this industry. 
   We have to take on the OPEC cartel. Now, this President is all about free trade. All about free trade. He wants more free trade agreements. Seven of the members of OPEC are in the World Trade Organization, highly touted by this President as a rules-based trade organization to promote free trade. They are conspiring and colluding among themselves and with Big Oil to jack up the price of oil. That's illegal under the WTO. Why won't President Bush file a complaint against OPEC? Perhaps because he's a little too tight with the Saudis, the royal family that runs that country and others. And they obviously, as well as industry execs, are profiting immensely from this situation. 
   We need to, as I said earlier, ban further mergers. My bill would establish a commission to study market power and suggest remedies to that. To me the simplest remedy is antitrust and to break up some of these giant conglomerates and again begin to bring a little bit of competition back to this industry. 
   The windfall profits tax I mentioned earlier, impose a windfall profits tax on these folks and take that money and reinvest it in energy efficiency and new fuels and research unless they will spend the money on energy efficiency, new fuels, and refinery capacity which is needed in this country. 
   If we don't take action, it isn't going to happen. ExxonMobil is making $4.6 million per hour, $109 million per day, $3.2 billion a month and $40 billion last year. One corporation. Last quarter they set yet another record. And you can bet with the price-gouging going on today, they're going to set yet another record. Every quarter is a new record. But the President talks about free market forces. These aren't free market forces. These people are conspiring to gouge the American consumers and drive up prices at the pump. We need real price relief soon. This Congress must act and the President must stop stonewalling and protecting his friends both domestically and internationally who are involved in the oil cartel.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL OIL AND GAS LEASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, this is a little lesson about one of the largest finds of oil in the United States. We have known about it since 1923. 
   In 1923 this large area of Alaska was designated as Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 4. Why? Because we knew there was a huge pool of oil under it. Estimates are the current figure is up to 15, ``b,'' billion barrels of oil. That's a lot of oil. So the President, I believe it was President Harding at the time, designated that as a Naval Petroleum Reserve. 
   This little area over here, the one they don't want to talk about, was designated as a wildlife refuge. Why was that? Well, because we didn't know there was any oil under it. So the oil's here, make it an oil preserve. There's wildlife here, make it a wildlife preserve. Now they say they want to drill in the wildlife preserve, but they're kind of neglecting this one over here. 
   Now, it was a Naval Petroleum Reserve until 1996. In 1996 the Republican Congress voted to open it up to drilling by the oil industry. Bill Clinton signed the bill, and, in fact, the Clinton administration let the first 3 million acres of leases in the year 2000. Eight years ago the industry got 3 million acres of land leased over a pool of 15 billion barrels of oil. They have drilled 25 wells and capped them. That's it. The Bush administration is going to lease another 4 million this next year. 
   If we don't have this bill, maybe they'll drill some more wells and cap them. They have no plans. Now, they say they want to drill over here. You will notice actually this area is closer to the existing pipeline than this area over here, but they want to debate this area over here with no known oil reserves and no pipeline and neglect this area over here with massive reserves and no pipeline and apparently no plans to build a pipeline. 
   If we pass this bill today, that will all change. They won't be able to sit on the largest single pool of oil in the United States territory anymore. They will have to begin in good faith to develop it. But guess what. The industry really doesn't want to do that because they're making a bucket of money the way it is now by pretending there's a shortage and not drilling. 
   Now, that's just the Alaska issue. If we go offshore and look elsewhere, as Mr. Markey said earlier, 80 percent, according to the United States Minerals Management Service, 80 percent of the oil and gas that's known to exist off of the Continental United States is accessible from existing leases. Unfortunately, 6,491 of those leases are sitting idle. On different days you get different excuses: ``Oh, it takes a really long time.'' Well, if it takes a really long time, why do we want to let new leases when it's taken a really long time to develop the old leases that they're sitting on, that have known pools of oil under them? They're taking a bucket of money now. They don't want things to change; we do.

The oil industry has the leases; they have drilled 25 wells; they have capped them. They have no plans to connect it to the existing pipeline and bring that oil here to consumers. 
   But they are saying, no, we want to go over here, we want more leases over here in ANWR. We don't even know if there is any oil under ANWR. How about they deal with the known 10 billion barrels here and provide us some relief at the pump? Then we can talk about other places they might want to go in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman of the full committee for his outstanding work over the many years for transit. How prophetic many of his positions have been. I remember during the last reauthorization fighting to just get a tiny bit more for transit. We didn't get what we wanted and said we would need, but we did get a little more, despite a particular opposition from a number of Republican Senators. 
   We are loving our transit systems to death today. Americans of necessity, or with changes in life-style, are flocking  onto mass transit at record rates, rates not seen in half a century in the United States of America. That's the good news. 
   The bad news is so many Americans are flooding onto our transit systems, the most in 50 years, that our transit systems are having to curtail service and cut routes. There is something very wrong with this picture. 
   At the very time that the American people are demanding an alternative because they can't afford the $4.50 a gallon for their car or they are tired of the congestion and commute, which have not yet been effectively dealt with because of our lack of investment in other infrastructure, they are turning to transit as an alternative. 
   But transit is confronted with, if it is a bus, a doubling of the cost of diesel. And other modes that are electrically driven have seen their energy costs go up. But beyond that, the rate of utilization, the people crushing on, are wearing the equipment out even faster and we haven't been keeping up with the replacement cycle because of the under-investment in the system. 
   I was talking to someone who came in from Rockville today. They said you wouldn't believe how packed it was. I said I think we are going to have to adopt the Japanese system where we hire little guys with white gloves to start pushing people onto our Metro cars, or our MAX cars in Oregon, because there are so many people who want to get on, we have to utilize what isn't enough capacity. 
   So this bill is the first, little, baby, incremental step to giving some assistance to those transit agencies who want to give assistance to an American public that is hurting because of failed energy policies. 
   I am not going to re-debate the energy policies with the gentleman from Florida, but that was an incredibly creative recapitulation of the failed energy policies of the Bush-Cheney administration over the last 6 years.     
   So we need now to deal with some of the results of those failures. 
   And we've debated other bills to help provide relief to the American consumers there. But here we have to provide relief and help to our transit agencies who are going to extend a hand to our American commuters and families. Unfortunately, this is, as yet, only a promise. It's an authorization. And the budget is a little tight around here unless you're one to fund a war with emergency funding. The President won't declare a transit emergency, I don't think. Maybe we can get him to do that. But we need to get some funding and flesh out the bones of this bill.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. I believe it's April Fools Day here on the floor of the House. To hear the members of the GOP, the Grand Old Oil Party, talking about how they are there for the consumers, they want to do something to help American consumers, the same party that benefits disproportionately from massive campaign contributions from the oil and gas and coal industries, the same party that holds the White House, with two oil men in the White House, the same party that on the Senate side defeated our energy provisions because they would have, God forbid, made the oil and gas companies pay taxes like other members of the corporate community. It would have taken away subsidies. 
   They are crying crocodile tears about the massive profits their buddies are making. They are campaign contributors, they are sponsors, and the President, the oil man, the Vice-President, the oil man supply services company. 
   Now there's a few things we could do. The President is a big free trader. He is trying to push us into more free trade agreements. He says they work great. He wants rules-based trade. Well, we are in the WTO. They have rules. The rules say you cannot restrict the supply of a commodity simply to drive up the price. That is what OPEC is doing. Now five members of OPEC are in the WTO. 
   Will this President, the oil man, the friend of the Saudis and the others, will he file a complaint with the World Trade Organization against OPEC? No. I wrote to him 3 years ago asking him to do that. The answer was no. The Saudis and the OPEC countries want to get together to collude and drive up the price of oil. That is just fine with George Bush. He is all for free trade and rules-based trade, except when the rules might hurt some of his buddies, and then the oil industry just piggybacks on top of that. 
   Now there is another thing they could do. They could help us with the provision we put in the farm bill, which is stalled in the Senate, which would close the Enron loophole. Remember Enron? Ken boy, the President's favorite guy. He just died before he went to jail. Well, the Enron boys convinced the Republican Congress to give them a special loophole, to deregulate energy commodities to allow for massive speculation. And there is widespread agreement in the financial community that about 50 cents of the price that is being paid at the pump today is being paid purely because of speculation brought about by the Enron loophole. 
   You really want to do something about the high price of oil? Help us close the Enron loophole. Get your President to file a complaint against OPEC for colluding to drive up the price of oil. Help strip out the taxpayer subsidies to the oil, coal, and gas industry. You're taking it out of their wallets while you take it out of their pockets at the pump.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. The dollar is dropping like a rock. We're borrowing $2 billion a day from overseas to buy things we don't make anymore. We've lost 4 million manufacturing jobs. Millions of middle-class Americans are seeing their pay stagnant or declining. 
   Our current trade policy is a dismal failure. It's a failed engine for our economy. Now comes the Peru Free Trade Agreement. The advocates tell you the burgeoning middle class of Peru, all three of them, are going to go out and be a huge market for the goods we don't make in America anymore. 
   They tout the breakthroughs on modest labor and environmental provisions. Well, the destructive multinational-written chapter 11 provisions remain at the center of this trade agreement. If trade is the engine that drives our economy, it needs an overhaul. Instead, with this bill, we are getting a new hood ornament, some side-view mirrors and a misbegotten cousin of NAFTA as a trade policy.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. In May, the Appropriations Committee included language in the FY07 supplemental to impose requirements on the Department of Transportation before they open the U.S. border to Mexican trucks, giving them free range across the United States of America. This language by the committee was the first step in ensuring that the Department of Transportation considered safety and security ramifications before allowing cross-border traffic and before rushing into a pilot. And unfortunately, the Bush administration immediately declared that they were in compliance with the law, making no changes in their program.     
   This is a paper-based program. They have not inspected physically one Mexican truck. They have not interviewed one Mexican driver. In Mexico, they have no system of drug testing, unlike the United States of America, and no certified drug-testing laboratories, unlike the United States of America. They have no hours of service in Mexico. Mexican drivers are frequently required to drive as long as 72 hours. They take drugs to do it. They freely admit that in the Mexican press.

Horrible unemployment numbers today, and not a penny of this $700 billion is going to do anything to put anybody back to work, to keep anybody in their home, to put underpinnings on the crumbling values of housing in this country. No, it will give unprecedented, unbelievable authority to Henry Paulson, a Wall Street speculator who created the financial weapons of mass destruction and now says he knows how to disarm them. He can buy any asset he deems appropriate from anybody at any price. 
   I heard a much more sensible plan from William Isaac, head of the FDIC under the Reagan administration. Declare a banking emergency. Use the same insurance provisions they used for the Wachovia general creditors. Insure all general creditors and depositors in all banks in America. That would free up the lending, we would save $700 billion, and then we could begin to invest that money in putting America back to work.

I heard such a plan again last night from the head banking regulator under the Reagan administration, William Isaac: Use the emergency powers of the FDIC. Extend the same insurance given to Wachovia to the depositors and creditors of all banks. That would immediately free up interbank lending and credit. Granted, it doesn't solve the problem of the Wall Street speculators, but it does solve the problem of loans for business and Main Street.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   That was an extraordinary and revealing exchange. I was also going to point out that Mr. Price was supporting the recent mandatory rulings of the Republican-run SEC for disclosure, but then deprive the public, the stockholders, from being able to do anything meaningful once they find out about scandalous levels of executive compensation or board compensation. 
   Everyone talks about the board as the remedy. The board is often a part of the problem, being paid huge amounts of money for showing up once or twice a year at meetings. 
   So, now, I mean, at least this is a little more honest. They don't even want the stockholders to be able to find out how much the executive is being paid, out of fear that somehow they might be able to do something about it, I guess. I mean, this is absolutely extraordinary. 
   I heard some other things. They say, if a corporation feels it is warranted, the gentleman from Georgia says, they can vote on executive salary. Oh, the board, who got a sweet deal, who are supporting the CEO who has got a sweet deal, if they feel it is warranted, they will allow those little peons, the stockholders, to vote on it. This is America. These are public corporations. 
   Now, would the gentleman say if someone inherits some stock, or someone has been a lifelong investor in a company, and there is a coup by some  corporate raiders, and they install a board, and they just start dumping an excessive, as the gentleman said, sometimes greater than warranted salary on a CEO, that they should not have the power to do something about it? 
   He says, well, you know, they can elect other people to the board. Well, no, because the election to the board process is fixed too. You get either to vote for the nominees or withhold. But if they get a single vote, and their buddy sitting next to them is going to vote, they will get their own stock for themselves. They are elected to the board. Ninety-nine percent of the people may have withheld, 99.999 may have withheld. That one person votes for himself. He is still on the board. 
   That is the way the rules work now. Apparently you think that is just fine. You admit that there is excessive salary being paid here, excessive compensation. No one can look at those numbers and say that they aren't, the gentleman even admitted, greater than warranted in some cases. 
   Well, then, give the stockholders a meaningful remedy. That is all we are doing here. We are just saying, it is not even mandatory, just that you can have, once you get the mandatory disclosure put in place by the Republicans, we Democrats are saying the stockholders should be allowed to have a referendum on that and not have a runaround by the board or not have their capability to put a measure before the corporation denied by the board.     
   I have a major stockholder of Bank of America stock in my district, and he has been constantly frustrated in attempting to move forward questions about board compensation, about executive compensation, about governance. And he is a major stockholder, as are the rest of his family. But he is thwarted. It is a little bit like the old Soviet Union: They are in charge, they don't have to listen to him. It is not democratic. 
   But the gentleman from Georgia says, well, sell your stock. That is a great remedy. Let the corporate raiders take it over, sell your stock. Now, come on. Give people recourse. And, you know, the reason that some investors are going to Europe is because they have more regulation in Europe and they have less excessive compensation to boards and CEOs, and they know that their dollars and/or pounds or Euros are being better cared for within that investment. That is why we are losing people overseas, not because of disclosure of excessive compensation or the possibility stockholders might be able to vote on it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   First, since the gentleman from Georgia wouldn't allow me to correct his mischaracterization of my position, I guess we are having a little issue over the meaning of the word ``fix.'' Now, if he means ``fixed'' as in ``setting,'' that is, setting the salary, he is totally wrong. I never said that, and that is not what this bill would do. It would just allow a referendum by the owners of the company on the package being paid to the corporate executive. 
   Now, if he means ``fixed'' in terms of what he stated on his own, he said some are greater than warranted and then he talked about correction; if we are talking about that kind of ``fix,'' he is absolutely right, and that is what this bill would do. It would allow the stockholders a vote. He doesn't want to allow them to vote on that compensation.     
   Then how are you going to fix it? That is extraordinary. 
   Now, Mr. Putnam makes an interesting argument. This poor CEO, whoever he was who totally underperformed who would receive compensation under his amendment that would be exempt from a vote, saw his compensation, having screwed up the corporation and making the board of directors mad and underperforming, losing money for the stockholders. He  didn't get that $6.75 million. He only got $3 million. Wow. He was penalized. Well, maybe the stockholders would rather he was fired and he got nothing. Three million bucks for screwing up. That is not exactly a corrective action. I don't know what world you folks live in over there, but for people in my district, that would be like winning the lottery big. Three million bucks. And this is for a guy who didn't do his job properly. And that is the kind of, and that would be exempt from the stockholders, because that is corrective action. He only got three million. Don't worry. He only got three million. And only three million came out of your assets to go to this guy who lowered the value of your investment and messed up the company, probably fired a bunch of workers and who knows what else he did that messed things up. So it is just extraordinary. 
   So now you are getting in the weeds here. You are actually determining what sorts of compensation would be voted on and what wouldn't. You are getting into fixing something, regulating something. We are just saying we want to allow a referendum. It is kind of the democratic process that most of us understand around here. If people are part of a public corporation, they should get a vote on executive compensation. They should also be allowed to put other measures before the board in a meaningful way. But the Republicans apparently don't believe in corporate democracy.

No, I'm not a weather forecaster. It's going to be a gloomy day because of record extortionate and manipulated prices at the pump. Guess what? Crude oil prices are down over a year ago, but somehow gas is up 50 cents a gallon at the pump. How is that? The refineries are making four times, four times their normal margin on refining. Why is that? They said, oh, well, gosh, we couldn't have known people were going to start buying gas around Memorial Day. We had to close down some of the refineries to maintain them and to clean them. Does Exxon translate into Enron? Remember when Enron was doing the same thing in California? High demand, shut down the generating plants. Exxon, high demand, shut down the refineries.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, we started here a week ago with the Paulson plan. It was simple: Give him the keys to the Treasury and suspend all the laws. What we are doing, or proposing here today, is infinitely better, and the Democrats have labored hard to put in taxpayer protections and provide consequences for Wall Street executives. 
   But what we consider today is still built on the Paulson-Bush premise; that is, President Bush and his Treasury Secretary, Mr. Paulson, say that dumping $700 billion of taxpayer-financed debt--we'll borrow the money--on top of Wall Street and buying up Wall Street's bad debts will solve the liquidity problem. It will trickle down through the economy to benefit small business. It will solve the underlying problem with the housing market, and it will stem job loss. 
   I don't buy it. There are less expensive, less risky, targeted regulatory reforms and programs that could work better. 
   But bottom line, President George Bush and his Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, insisted on a top-down Wall Street bailout solution. It's sort of like the financial surge strategy. And just like the surge in Iraq, as we go into it at the outset, we know it's not sustainable and we know it won't solve the underlying problems. 
   Even worse, President Bush and Secretary Paulson and the Republicans insisted upon watering down the most critical portions of the bill. There is no mandatory way to pay for this bailout, no fee, no tax, just a proposal from a future President to a Congress that a Congress might think about to help take taxpayers off the hook. That's not protection. The golden parachutes, yes, they were exchanged for camouflaged parachutes. The execs on Wall Street are still going to get millions. Look at the loopholes there. We have added back in, at the insistence of the Secretary, credit card debt, auto loans. 
   We can do better. We should start again on a new package, come back next week.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (SECRETARY PAULSON'S BAILOUT PLAN -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, just a week ago, Secretary Paulson sent an insult down to Congress, an insult to the American people, an insult to the Constitution, an insult ultimately to the economy of the United States. He sent down a bill that said, in 3 pages, give me $700 billion and suspend all the laws, and I will do with it as I see fit and I will fix this problem. 
   Now, one problem with that is, of course, Mr. Paulson reigned as the head of Goldman Sachs while these financial weapons of mass destruction were being created, and he amassed tremendous wealth, taking a bonus of $39 million in 1 year, accumulating $750 million when he left Wall Street to go into public service. So people would say, oh, that's just Hank, he's a tough negotiator. That was an absurdity. And it's based on a premise that if the American tax borrows money, $700 billion, and we take their junk--some pundits called it ``cash for trash''--that somehow this would create liquidity on Wall Street and then from there it would ultimately trickle down to Main  Street, to car loans to small businesses to student loans. I never believed that premise, and I think the House of Representatives rejected that premise today. 
   We have, I think, credible alternatives before us. Mr. William Isaac, appointed by Jimmy Carter but reappointed by Ronald Reagan as head of the FDIC during the previous worst financial crisis in the United States, the savings and loan crisis, Mr. Isaac addressed a number of us in the skeptics caucus and a number of Republicans yesterday and others and said there's a regulatory way to get at this. There's a problem right now. A lot of the banks are actually in pretty good shape. In fact, a lot of these subprime assets, 75 percent of them, are still paying their bills. But they are basically being required to value them at zero right now because of an accounting rule. Change the accounting rule, he said, and suddenly a lot of banks that look like they're insolvent would not be insolvent and they would have money to lend. That would take care of the so-called liquidity crisis, the credit crisis that's out there. Further, he goes on with another technique that was used by him when he was head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to basically help the banks get through this period with an exchange of documents and a subordinate position on their fair value, not their fair market value when a market doesn't exist, on all their assets after bank examiners looked at it. He used that technique, and he solved a $100 billion problem with the potential of 3,000 banks going into receivership with the Federal Government, ultimately only at a cost of about $2 billion. That's a lot better than the Paulson plan, the Paulson premise. We should listen to Mr. Isaac and look at that approach as we revisit this issue. 
   Further, if we were going to go down the Paulson path, and I don't want to, if we really felt we had to throw money at the top on Wall Street and buy their bad assets, then we shouldn't put the taxpayers on the hook. I proposed something this week and I was told the Street wouldn't like it. ``The Street wouldn't like it.'' The street is coming to us hat in hand. The Street moguls who hate government are on top of their mansion roofs crying for the government to come get them with a financial helicopter. ``The Street wouldn't like it.'' A 1/4 of 1 percent fee on every security transaction, something that we levied from 1914 through the Great Depression. In fact, Congress, over the objections of ``the Street,'' doubled the security transfer fee during the Great Depression, and we kept it until 1966 when it just lapsed in the beginning of this deregulatory era. That would raise $150 billion a year, more than enough for our regulatory institutions to engage in a very active form of assuring the liquidity of Wall Street firms, more than enough to pay for Mr. Paulson's misbegotten plan. 
   And then there's another approach, a Democratic approach, used by another President, FDR, in the Great Depression. Instead of dumping money on the failures on Wall Street, FDR said, I'm going to rebuild the economy from the bottom up. He invested in roads and bridges. He invested in hydroelectric systems, jobs, the WPA program. He put America back to work. And as they began to consume and the banks and everyone and small businesses did better, guess what. The wealth percolated up to Wall Street. Trickle down isn't working real well for average Americans day in, day out when you see the disparities in this country that are growing and growing and growing, and Democrats should not engage in financial trickle down, which is what Mr. Paulson proposed. 
   So a simple regulatory approach paid for, if you are going to do the Paulson approach, by Wall Street itself; or, even better, something to solve the underlying parts of the problem with the economy, an FDR-type approach.

I believe today gives us an opportunity to step back and begin again to construct a package that does not put the taxpayers at risk for $700 billion. 
   William Isaac headed up the FDIC during the savings and loan crisis. He took a $100 billion problem and he solved it for $2 billion; he says we can do the same thing here, pennies on the dollar. And then, that would leave a lot of borrowing capacity to help begin to inject money into public works projects, infrastructure in this country, other things that benefit average Americans, put us back to work, and make us a more competitive economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, this House will take up a critical piece of legislation, H.R. 3058. This legislation would extend the secure rural schools program for 4 years. If this legislation is not adopted, we expect that more than 7,000 teachers in rural districts across the United States of America will be laid off. We expect that in more than 600 counties critical services such as sheriffs deputy patrols, jail deputies who perform services in the jail, and other critical emergency services will end. Road funds will be impacted in terms of critical road and bridge maintenance. This is must-pass legislation. 
   But we also recognize that the United States of America is in a fiscal bind here. So the Democrats have reimposed something pretty simple most Americans live by called pay-as-you-go. So we had to figure out a way to pay for this. We've gone through a whole ream of proposals, and we've found one that works, and I think in this time of record-high oil and gas prices, it's particularly appropriate. 
   We would have in place a renegotiation of existing leases which omitted a price trigger at $35 a barrel or impose a conservation resource fee if those companies would renegotiate. A number of good citizen companies have renegotiated, including Shell, BP and Conoco. A number of other not-so-good citizen companies, those which are extorting incredible amounts of money from the American consumer, such as ExxonMobil, have refused to renegotiate, and they're trying to take their unintended windfall. 
   Now, many on the other side of the aisle are going to say this is unconstitutional. Well, I would urge my Republican colleagues to read the CRS Report for Congress, No. RL 33974. It addresses those issues in depth. It's not a taking. It doesn't violate the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. It doesn't violate substantive due process and equal protection. And it doesn't cause a breach of contract. 
   In fact, CRS finds that the government, but of course not this administration, the Bush administration, may have a cause of its own under a section called unilateral and mutual mistake. 
   Everyone admits these provisions, these triggers are supposed to be in the bill. At $35 a barrel, that's about $100 a barrel ago, the subsidies were supposed to go away for these oil companies. They didn't because some bureaucrat messed up. So, in fact, the preponderance of evidence is that the government has a cause of action to reinstate lawful charges against those oil companies. This bill would do that, and it would assure the future of more than 600 counties, hundreds of school districts, 7,000 teachers. 
   If we don't pass this, if you lean on the slender read, if you're concerned about the wealth of the oil companies, I refer you to ExxonMobil's and others' most recent statements. I refer you to the Wall Street Journal to look at the price of oil hovering in the upper $120 a barrel when this fee was supposed to come in at $35 a barrel. 
   You can't lean on the unconstitutional read, but if you do want to side with the oil companies over and above rural schools, public safety, maintenance of roads, bridges and highways in rural counties across America, then you will side with the oil companies in this vote tomorrow. 
   I hope a majority of my colleagues join me on the right side of this issue.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have before us very important legislation. It is bad enough that NAFTA has caused the United States to hemorrhage more than 1 million jobs; but now the administration with the NAFTA trucks proposal would add insult to injury. Not only would it put in jeopardy more American jobs, those of American truck drivers, but it would also jeopardize the safety of the traveling public on America's highways. 
   I want to congratulate Representative Boyda for bringing such an important issue to the Congress so early in her congressional career and Representative Hunter on the other side of the aisle for his contributions to this issue and to this legislation. 
   We have here what is called a SAP. It is a statement of administration policy. They take us for saps if they believe we will believe the information they have conveyed to us in this letter.  
   They say that the safety standards, including hours of service, driver medical standards, financial responsibility, and drug and alcohol testing, will all be remedied by their program. There is and are no hours of service regulations in Mexico. We have heard anecdotal evidence from Mexican truck drivers that they are often forced, as they are exploited down there working for relatively low wages compared to truck drivers in the U.S., to drive for 48 to 72 hours at a stretch. How do they do that? They laugh and they say ``dust.'' What is dust? Drugs, uppers. They are commonly used in Mexico. There are no meaningful hours of service regulation. There is no drug testing in Mexico, and illegal substances are frequently used for these extended trips. 
   But the administration would have us believe that by signing a piece of paper and waving a magic wand and having in place paper provisions on drug and alcohol testing or hours of service, that these things will happen meaningfully. Suddenly, there will be a tremendous change in the culture of the American trucking industry. 
   They go on to say there will be an in-depth safety inspection before they are allowed to operate in the United States. Well, that is interesting because in testimony before my committee recently, the administration admitted that when a new bus carrier, and we are having a problem with illegally run bus service, what is called ``curb service'' here in the Northeast, it takes them up to 18 months to get out and certify that company actually exists and look at the papers in a filing cabinet. They never go out and look at the buses. Never. 
   We have the same thing going on with the American trucking industry. Only a tiny fraction of trucks are inspected on an annual basis. But somehow, magically, an agency that is totally overwhelmed by the volume of traffic is going to inspect each and every truck meaningfully in Mexico, inspect the credentials of the Mexican truck drivers in depth, certify the nonexistent drug testing programs, and certify tracking of the nonexistent hours of service in Mexico. And then they say that this will all be made available to the American public. 
   Here is the form in which it is made available. It is right here in the Federal Register. They are saying we are requiring publication, and they say it would be redundant to have all of the safety audits in detail published in the Federal Register because they put up this page. It has a date. That is good. That is a good start. It is up for 7 days, by the way. 
   And in order to access this page, you have to know the MX docket number. You have to know the particular docket number of that Mexican carrier. You have to know specifics to get nonspecific information that will only be posted for 7 days. And if you get through that maze and you happen to hit the 7-day window, because it goes down after 7 days, I guess they don't have enough memory capacity down there at DOT to leave it up longer for the public to review to, you get this, a form that has the applicant information, business address, and status. Quote: ``Provisional authority issued.'' 
   That is the in-depth information that FMCSA is going to put up for the American public to review to understand that these audits are being conducted and these carriers are safe. 
   We need this legislation so we can be assured that we are protecting the safety of the American public.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   My good friend from Florida, the ranking Republican member of the committee, made a point that NAFTA was promoted by and passed during the Clinton administration. That's true, and I have continually castigated that administration and that President for that act. 
   However, he does need to remember that the agreement was negotiated by the first Bush administration, adopted by the Clinton administration, unfortunately, and to the discredit of the Clinton administration, and passed the House of Representatives with a large majority of Republican votes. Yes, it was a Democratic House, but a very substantial majority of the Democrats opposed the legislation. 
   So this is truly a bipartisan problem. But if he wants to attribute blame, the Republican Members of the House would bear that, and not the Democratic Members, although we were in the majority. He also talked about unfair portions of the agreement. 
   Well, the President has the authority to give 6 months' notice at any time that we are going to withdraw in order to require renegotiation of provisions of the agreement. So if this President felt any of the provisions were unfair, or they felt they were under duress to allow the Mexican trucks into this country, they have the tools to renegotiate that agreement. I wish they would use those tools. But they won't because this administration is all about killing off American jobs and American labor. That's what this is ultimately intended to do. 
   You can get a Mexican truck driver to work for a heck of a lot less than a Teamster in the United States. You can get a Mexican dock worker to work for a heck of a lot less than a longshoreman in the United States. 
   That's what this ultimately is designed to do. The dream of the NAFTA proponents is that the goods, all the goods, the things we don't make in America anymore, will be imported from China to a port in Mexico, avoiding the U.S. ports, the U.S. longshoremen, and loaded on Mexican trucks, avoiding U.S. trucking companies and U.S. drivers and brought up into America's heartland. 
   This bill is about protecting the safety of the American traveling public. That's what's before us today. I would love to renegotiate and revisit NAFTA any day of the week, but today we are all about the safety of the American public. That's what we are ensuring with this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is truly a compendium of technical corrections. When you look at a bill the magnitude of SAFETEA-LU and its extraordinary importance in our economy, and I believe the signature accomplishment of the last Congress, there are bound to be some drafting errors and other minor concerns in the legislation. We recognized those quite early on and had hoped to pass this bill, this technical corrections bill, during the last Congress; but it was never considered by the Senate, as are so many things that we do around here. Hopefully, this time we will get this needed work done. 
   There are some essential things to be accomplished in this legislation. There is an oversight in the bill that results in the Surface Transportation Research Development and Deployment account being oversubscribed. People say, who cares. 
   Well, actually it means that critical programs for the Federal Highway Administration Legacy Research and research programs will not be funded, and that creates a major problem. For instance, this would mean that we would not get the biennial ``Conditions and Performance Report.'' If we are going to maintain and improve our Nation's transportation infrastructure, we need to understand its status, its condition, and its need for future investment as we move toward yet another transportation bill in the coming Congress. 
   It provides appraisals of highways, bridges, and transit finance, their expenditures in those accounts, and compares it to the needs we have, operational performance and future investment requirements. 
   It also would free up additional funding for the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, something that was created as part of SAFETEA-LU and has yet to get its work accomplished. We have charged them with both looking at and assessing the future needs, building on the requirements I just mentioned, the annual reports of the Department of Transportation, but even going beyond that to determine our infrastructure needs both to maintain the current infrastructure, to enhance it, and to mitigate congestion and to move toward a less congested and more fuel-efficient transportation future. 
   They have also been charged with looking at how we pay for these vital investments and assessing the current revenue source, the gas tax, and some assorted excise taxes with future needs. This is again critical work to be done by that commission. 
   This will better fund their work and give them some of the staff assistance they need, give them the capability of obtaining the data that they need, and extend the deadline for the report to Congress, which will be a crucial building block in the next transportation bill, by 6 months. We have now set a deadline of December 31, 2007. 
   The bill also clarifies something regarding a sense of Congress regarding the buy America requirement. We feel that the Federal Highway Administration is not implementing the Buy America Act consistent with our, Congress's, statutory intent. They are beginning to break projects down into segments in a way that was not anticipated so that they can basically go around some of the buy America requirements. We want to reinforce here that the separate component test is not what we intended, and the amendment included in this bill is intended to clarify congressional intent and provide guidance to the Federal Highway Administration in the implementation of that section of the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I want to thank the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) for his leadership as chairman of the full committee as we went through that process in the last Congress, and also the fact that he is willing to get out front at the beginning to begin to try to address what is actually an investment deficit so far as it goes to transportation in the United States, something that can be easily recognized if one travels to other countries and sees how committed they are, particularly to competitors like China and the investments they are making which are absolutely on a massive scale to make their economy more efficient to move their people more efficiently. 
   We need to not only maintain what we have and live on the benefits of our past investment; we need to ensure more robust future investments. I assure the gentleman I have begun a series of hearings that are on two tracks in the subcommittee I chair to look both at the future investment needs and also potential ways to raise the funds we need to make those investments. 
   I look forward to working with the gentleman and others as we go through that process. 
   I do want to assure Members since there is a new sensitivity around here about PAYGO that H.R. 1195 complies fully with House budget rules; and although it only addresses changes to previously authorized projects, not new projects, it also fully adheres to the new House Member earmark disclosure requirements. 
   This is legislation that I recommend wholly to my colleagues, and they can vote for it in good conscience. It will help build our future and realize the full dream of SAFETEA-LU as we move through its full term.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the Chair. 
   Well, Vice President Cheney was in form last weekend in Florida addressing a small group behind closed doors. He attacked the House of Representatives for passing the Iraq Accountability Act. I am not certain whether it is because he objects to the fact that we are going to make this administration review the readiness of our troops, their equipment, before they're rushed to Iraq in an attempt to escalate the war. They don't want that kind of accountability, because it failed our troops, from day one, on equipment and readiness. 
   And then maybe it's the other part, the part where we are going to demand accountability of the Iraqi Government. Time and time again President Bush sets benchmarks. ``Those benchmarks will be met.'' They are never met. There has to be a diplomatic and political component. You cannot resolve a civil war with military force in Iraq. But time and time again the Bush administration has let the Iraqi Government skate. This bill says they will meet the President's own chosen, President Bush and al Maliki's, own chosen guidelines and benchmarks or we will begin to bring our troops home. Plain and simple, not a war without end, not a war that will be settled by future Presidents, as George Bush said a year ago, but if this administration and the Iraqi Government fail to do what's necessary for our troops, we are not going to strand them in the middle of a civil war. 
   But the Vice President objects to those things. He says if they really support the troops, then we should take them at their word and expect them to meet the needs of our military on time, in full, no strings attached. 
   Let's review the administration's record on those issues. Let's review how the Bush-Cheney administration met the needs of our troops. First of all, it was an unnecessary war. They were pursuing a necessary war against al Qaeda, the Taliban, Osama bin Laden. Remember them? Dead or alive? Dead or alive? They abandoned that war for an unnecessary war launched under false pretenses in Iraq. 
   Now, something called the Office of Special Plans phonied up the intelligence. Dick Cheney put together the Office of Special Plans with some of his own hand-picked people, I think one of whom is now on the way to jail, in fact, Scooter Libby. In fact, he personally, unprecedented for a Vice President, kept visiting the CIA and saying, no, they didn't have the intelligence right yet. I.e., they didn't say what he wanted. Niger yellow cake, Chalabi, all that stuff. He was so wrong. And then he said, ``Simply stated, there's no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.'' Vice President Cheney in August of 2002 as he was pushing us toward war. 
   But then on the eve of the war, even after their myths about weapons of mass destruction, the yellow cake, the aluminum tubes had started to fall apart, he said, ``We believe that Saddam has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons.'' Vice President Cheney. A man who has been so wrong and put our troops in harm's way unnecessarily, jeopardized the security of the United States by distracting us from the real fight in Afghanistan, challenges this Congress on the Iraq Accountability Act? No, I think last November the American people started to ask about accountability for him and his supposed boss, George Bush. 
   And then let's look at their military planning. General Shinseki, a good man. They fired him. It was said we didn't need 350,000 people. Rummy said, ``Oh, don't worry. We can do it with 100,000 or so.'' Shinseki said, that would lead to strife, civil war and chaos. He was right. They fired him. But presidential economic adviser Larry Lindsey said, ``It's going to be very expensive. Very expensive.'' No, Cheney and his cohorts said, ``No, don't worry. Iraq can pay for it themselves.'' Well, we are now at $2 billion a week, hundreds of billions of dollars on this war. So wrong. 
   And then our troops, how did they serve them? Vice President Cheney again, ``We believe we will, in fact, be greeted as liberators. I think it will go relatively quick. Weeks rather than months.'' So they didn't give our men  and women body armor, didn't have armored Humvees, they didn't have the equipment they needed. Congress had to uncover those scandals after we heard from the troops in the field. We had to provide it over the objections of this administration, and this guy has the gall to say we aren't serving the troops as they want to keep our troops mired down forever in the middle of a civil war? 
   This is extraordinary. And, most recently, Vice President Cheney last year, no, 2 years ago, ``I think they're in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.'' I guess he still believes that. 
   These people have done an extraordinary disservice to our troops, our country, our national security and the fight against true terrorism that attacked us on 9/11. We will not be distracted or bullied anymore. The Iraq Accountability Act is a strong response to their mismanagement and it offers the United States a way to bring this war to a successful conclusion and soon. 
   Bring the troops home.

This is an economic, social and public safety crisis if these funds are not reauthorized. They are now preparing layoff notices for teachers in rural school districts, for deputy sheriffs in search and rescue, for people who maintain our critical road and highway infrastructure in the western and other States across the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. No one's district, with perhaps the exception of the other gentleman from Oregon, is impacted more than mine by the issue of counties and schools. And no one has worked harder to try to get it included. And actually it was said yesterday that we didn't have a vote in the House on county schools. We did, actually, in May, and the Republicans chose to side with Big Oil instead of with counties and schools. I got 218 votes, but I needed a two-thirds majority to pass it. 
   And it was also included in an energy package last year, a major energy initiative sent by the House to the Senate which was filibustered by 41 Republican Senators, again, over the issue of protecting Big Oil. 
   So the record's pretty clear here. I appreciate the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee saying he's going to work with us and try to help us with this vehicle or other vehicles in the closing days of this Congress to get this critical funding, and I take heart with that because he's an honorable man. 
   We've got another problem, and it is downtown. It's called George Bush. Here is the President's statement on county schools: ``Finally, the administration opposes new, mandatory funding for payments in lieu of taxes, and believes that any extension of rural community payments should be phased out, as it has previously proposed. The administration urges Congress to eliminate all such provisions from the final bill.'' All such provisions. That's the President's position. 
   If this President would lift one pinky, we would have county school funding. He muscled $465 million in foreign aid into the continuing resolution that passed the House yesterday because he wanted $365 million for Georgia, but he didn't ask for a penny for county schools here in the United States of America. And by the way, that wasn't Georgia the State, that's Georgia the country overseas; one of his favorite places, I guess. 
   If we just had a little bit of help downtown, we could get this done. And we're not done here yet. We're going to fight like heck in the next 2 days to get it.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman. 
   The oil and gas industry contributed $166 million to the Republicans since 1990, 75 percent of their political contributions. Fact: When President Bush took office, gas cost $1.47 a gallon. Today gas costs $3.79 a gallon in my district. Fact: In 2002, the oil companies made $30 billion in profits. In 2008, it's projected they will make an unbelievable record $160 billion in profits, every penny of that extracted from American consumers and American small businesses and borrowed from overseas, putting us in huge trouble. 
   The oil companies took care of their Republican cronies and the Republicans legislated on their behalf. When they controlled everything, the House, the White House and the Senate, they passed the so-called energy bill. It took them 5 years to write it. And they passed it. We're living with the consequences, which is the huge increase in profits and the huge increase in prices to consumers. 
   The choice is clear. Do we pass a bill written by Democrats who are not beholden to Big Oil, or do we pass another Republican bill, those who legislated this mess in the first place? Do we break our dependence on fossil fuels and mandate renewal energy, or do we ignore the ravages of global warming, drill, dig, burn and borrow our Nation to debt and dust? 
   Today I will vote for energy independence, sustainability and affordable energy prices. Many of my Republican colleagues will vote yet again for bigger oil company profits. Congratulations to the Grand Old Oil Party. They're very consistent.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   If you listen to the Republicans here today, you would think that Detroit can't make more efficient automobiles, something the Republicans blocked for 12 years, which we did within the first year of taking back power here in the House. 
   They are saying that our electric generators can't produce 15 percent, one-sixth of their energy from renewable resources. In the United States of America in the 21st century, we can't get 15 percent from renewables? We have to rely on fossil fuels? 
   Do you believe that they say that the oil companies can't afford to pay the American taxpayers fair royalties for the nonrenewable resources they are extracting from our Federal land? If you do believe all that, then you probably believe that they do have a plan for independence and energy sustainability for the future. 
   Now the gentleman there spoke earlier, the gentleman from Washington, a good friend, about a fig leaf hiding an embarrassing fact or problem. There is one huge fig leaf over this debate today, and here is what is under the fig leaf: George Bush, holding hands with the King of Saudi Arabia. 
   Now the Bush administration, last time I checked, same party affiliation as that side of the aisle, the Republicans, led by Vice President Cheney, last time I checked, a member of the Grand Old Oil Party, wrote an energy bill in secret. They pushed for it for 5 years. 
   When the Republicans controlled everything, the House, the Senate and the White House, they jammed through their energy bill over the objections of many on our side of the aisle who said wait, no, this isn't a forward-looking energy policy. It's going to make us actually more dependent on imported oil, and it's going to make us more dependent on fossil fuels, and it's not going to give us a new energy future that the American people need. It's not going to make us more efficient, more sustainable and more affordable. 
   Now they are trying to hide that fig leaf. Now they have also talked about the price per gallon, that when Speaker Pelosi became Speaker almost 2 years ago, there has been a big run-up in prices. 
   Whoops. Here is when George Bush took office. Gas was about $1.45 a gallon; today, bumping back up, over $4 in some hurricane areas. 
   Now there is something else that goes along with that that they don't want to talk about, and this is what's really going on here, folks.     
   They want to talk about relief for American consumers. They don't give a fig leaf about relief for American consumers. 
   This is what the debate is all about. Look at the obscene growth in profits of the oil industry since the oil men in the White House, George Bush and Dick Cheney, took over; from $30 billion a year to $160 billion this year, every penny of that extracted from the pockets of American consumers and American business. An unbelievable, unprecedented breath-taking run-up in profits. 
   And they say now they are concerned and want a change. They don't really want a change. They don't want this to change. They want us to continue to be dependent on oil and foreign oil and, yeah, maybe a smidgeon more of domestic oil. 
   Now they have a few other whoppers out there today. They say no drilling in Alaska. Whoops, sorry, wrong, guys. Actually, this bill would push the industry to get off its rear and begin to extract oil from the former Naval Petroleum Reserve, renamed the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska by the Republican Congress and put out for leasing. It has been leased. Bill Clinton, in fact, did the first leases. But guess what, 10 years later not a drop of oil, even though the known reserves, and why was it the Naval Petroleum Reserve for 80 years, because we knew there was a pile of oil under there, a huge pool of oil under there, more than 10 billion barrels. 
   No one knows if there is any oil under the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, but they want to talk about the refuge. They don't want to talk about the fact that their friends in the hugely profitable oil industry have failed to extract any oil from the known 10 billion barrels of reserves in the Naval Petroleum Reserve Alaska. 
   This bill would push for production there, push them to connect it to the existing pipeline, and push them to bring that oil down to the lower 48. 
   As Members on my side said earlier, we need a transitional fuel. We need to enhance our oil supply; this bill would do that. We also need to go after natural gas in a much more robust way, a cleaner fuel, a fuel of which we have significantly more reserves here in the United States of America which we don't need to import if we develop those reserves. This bill would do that.

And for 6 years they labored and they brought forth the Bush-Cheney energy policy. I voted against it, as did most Democrats. We said it would make us even more dependent upon Saudi Arabia--one of the President's best friends here, the King of Saudi Arabia--and it has. It has worked exactly as they designed. 
   Now they're born again into caring about other forms of energy and energy independence and American consumers. It's just a smoke screen to cover for their continued addiction to the contributions of the oil industry and to fighting for the oil industry to continue that addiction. 
   We're bringing forward a bill to break that dependence, to break the enslavement to OPEC, and to move this country toward true energy independence on domestic resources and new technologies and jobs. I don't think anybody believes that they really care about the American consumers.

   We spent all week trying to figure out a way to protect the American taxpayers with his faulty plan. There really is no way to do that, except for one: Make Wall Street pay to bail out itself. 
   From 1914 until 1966, there was a tiny fee assessed on every transaction on Wall Street. In fact, the Congress, over the objections of Wall Street, doubled it in 1935 at the height of the Great Depression. It had no impact on Wall Street. It could raise the money Wall Street needs to heal itself. 
   Let's remember all that rhetoric about bootstraps and all that. Let Wall Street pull itself up by its own bootstraps, and assess a minuscule fee on every stock transaction. It is done in London; it can be done in the U.S. Wall Street can pay for its own bailout. Call now.

The end of those payments means 8,000 teachers have been laid off in rural counties across America, and thousands of deputy sheriffs, police and public safety officers. People will die because these payments aren't being extended. 
   The authorization expired when the Republicans controlled the House, the White House and the Senate.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this issue has been highlighted and brought to the attention of the committee by the ranking member, Mr. Duncan. It is his resolution and he has been an activist on the committee in highlighting the problems of safety with 15-passenger vans. I appreciate his work on this issue. 
   We are intending to hold a hearing on safety issues, and include some testimony from individuals who have had family tragedies because of these vans. The vans have had particular problems with single-vehicle rollover crashes. They have higher rollover fatality rates than any other passenger vehicle type. From 2001 to 2005, the death rate for 15-passenger vans was 250 per million registered vehicles compared to 151 per million for all other registered vehicles. 
   The committee had formerly noted problems with this, and in the SAFETEA-LU legislation which was amended by technical corrections earlier by the House, Congress directed the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to test 15-passenger vans as part of their rollover resistance program. 
   We also prohibited schools from purchasing, renting or leasing 15-passenger vans to transport students. But there are still a lot of these vans on the road. It is imperative that drivers be alerted to the increased risk of driving a 15-passenger van compared to a regular passenger vehicle. There have been cases even when the occupants, particularly children, because of their smaller size, were wearing lap and shoulder belts where tragic deaths occurred in some of these rollover crashes. 
   I look at this resolution as a first step in raising public awareness, and I hope that the committee and other committees which have jurisdiction in this area will take more definitive action in the near future. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would again congratulate the gentleman. It is sad that such a tragedy occurred to one of his constituents. But the best we can do to try to make sense of that tragedy is to try and prevent future tragedies as a result of these sorts of vehicles. 
   It has been fully my intention as chairman of the committee to hold hearings on both these vans and some other related safety items that have come to the attention of the committee. The reason the hearing has been delayed is because the head of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has been on administrative leave for personal reasons. We expect her back in the not-too-distant future, and then intend to go ahead. 
   But in the interim, by passing this legislation we can at least send the message that we have concern and we can try to alert the American public, we can try and avert more tragedies. 
   I would also point out that our colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee have substantial jurisdiction in this area. And hopefully as they cast their votes for this initiative, this resolution here today, they will think about their jurisdiction and perhaps they too will join with us in raising concerns. 
   With that, I have no further requests for time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (NO ESCALATION OF THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, in a few hours the President will address the Nation and talk about his plan to escalate the war in Iraq, to try and salvage the abysmal failures of his administration and the unnecessary war which they sold to the Congress and the American people. 
   Now, in leading up to this, just last month the President said, ``It is important to trust the judgment of the military when they are making military plans. I am a strict adherer to the command structure.'' President Bush. 
   Well, I guess he is, because he is the commander-in-chief, and he is ignoring the advice of the uniformed services. The President's chief military advisers oppose this escalation in the war. 
   General John Abizaid, who was then head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee November 15, ``I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the corps commander, General Dempsey. We all talked together. And I said, in your professional  opinion, if we were to bring in more American troops now, does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no.'' 
   But the decider wasn't listening. The reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It is easy for the Iraqis to rely on us to do this work. I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own future. 
   The President didn't like what he had heard, the decider being an adherer to the military chain of command, so General Abizaid is being shown the door. As a Lebanese American who is fluent in Arabic, I think his understanding of the region far exceeds that of any of the advisers that the President may be depending upon to make this misguided proposal to escalate the war. 
   General Casey has also been removed as commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. It started with General Shinseki, who told the President he would need 500,000 troops to occupy the country and avoid the abyss into which we have fallen, a civil war, insurrection, insurgency. He also was fired because the decider didn't believe his advice. 
   It is time to change course in Iraq. 
   And the President is not only continuing a failed policy and sending more U.S. troops to a mission that is very unlikely to succeed, according to the advice of his uniformed commanders, who he is ignoring, he is also going to undermine the effort in Afghanistan. 
   Things are going bad in Afghanistan. Remember, that is where Osama bin Laden planned 9/11. That is where the Taliban supported and harbored al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. We, with NATO and the world behind us, decided to take them out. Remember that? Osama bin Laden, dead or alive; dead or alive. You don't hear that from the White House much anymore. 
   But Osama bin Laden is still planning attacks on the United States, and the one-eyed Omar is coming back to Kandahar. They are planning a spring offensive. They didn't withdraw this winter. The NATO forces are ineffectual. And what is the President's response? He is going to withdraw U.S. troops from that region. 
   So we have the heart of darkness, Afghanistan, and the President is ignoring that problem to continue his failed policies in Iraq. No escalation of the war in Iraq by the adherer-decider, President Bush.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (WHERE DEMOCRATS REALLY STAND ON THE ISSUES -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from North Carolina who preceded me in the well was saying, ``Those Democrats, they just want to raise taxes and spend.'' I would look at the legislation we passed today with 124 Republican votes as an example of where Democrats really stand on the issues. 
   Just about 1 year ago today, almost exactly a year ago today, the Republican Party passed legislation called reconciliation that actually raised the cost of student financial aid, dramatically raised the cost of student financial aid. It also did one other thing to ``save money'' or ``create revenue,'' which is it cut medical care for needy Americans. 
   Now, we have got to be fiscally responsible, but what they did with this money was cut taxes for wealthy investors, extend tax cuts for wealthy investors that were going to expire in the year 2008, not exactly an immediate problem, to 2010. They paid for that by raising the cost of student financial aid; i.e., taxing students and cutting medical care for poor Americans; i.e., taxing poor people or taking away needed health care. That is his model. He says we are the ``tax and spend'' folks. 
   Well, look at what we did today in legislation that passed with 124 Republican votes. We said it was wrong for the Republicans to jack up the cost of student financial aid. The cost of a higher education is beyond reach of too many Americans and we think people should have a chance at the ladder of success. Key to that is education, and we want to make education more affordable and more accessible. Today was the first step, and only the first step in our plan to help make higher education more affordable. 
   So I guess he would say we are taxing the banks; i.e., we are asking the banks to pay part of the cost here to lower the interest rate on student financial aid. 
   Now, these bank private loans are losers for the taxpayers. We have in fact a government study that says if we converted the whole loan program in this country to national direct student loans administered by the universities and overseen by the government, we would make money, even with the defaults. But in order to continue the subsidized bank program which he was up here defending, we are getting back 84 cents on the dollar. 
   The American taxpayers are subsidizing banks to offer loans on which they make a pile of money, and now he is aggrieved that we have asked the banks to lower the interest rate over 5 years. I would like to lower them tomorrow, and they shouldn't have been raised. The Republicans shouldn't have raised the cost of student financial aid to fund tax cuts for wealthy people. 
   Now, if they want to have more tax cuts for wealthy people, then they ought to find a way to responsibly finance that. Personally, I don't think wealthy people need more tax cuts. In fact, I think they have gotten way too many. 
   And he did not talk about the fact that we are borrowing money to finance tax cuts for the wealthy, that we are dinging people who need medical assistance to finance tax cuts for the wealthy, that we are heaping the costs onto students to finance tax cuts for the wealthy. If that is what he calls tax and spend, then that is what I am.

Now, I might understand that because they just doubled student financial aid interest rates 1 year ago to pay for tax cuts for wealthy investors, so I guess they already took a position on that and they don't want to have to be forced to vote to provide help to students. 
   Then they say, well, no, we want to do Pell Grants. Well, you were in charge for 12 years; why didn't you increase Pell Grants during the 12 years you were in charge? We are going to cut student financial interest rates in half and take on the big banks, and we are going to increase funding for Pell Grants, something the majority failed to do in 12 years.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. The gentleman is extraordinarily confused. Domestic propaganda? Propaganda to convince the elected officials of the people of the United States or the voters of the United States that some misbegotten objective will be good for the country? That's what you're talking about. 
   We're not talking about using intelligence or using our own auspices overseas, the Voice of America, whatever, to spread the voice of freedom and democracy around the world. But we are talking about deceiving the United States Congress and the voters of the United States of America in violation of the law, a law that was passed in reaction to the Soviet empire. 
   You are advocating the position of the Soviet Union in the 1950s, propaganda to deceive your own people. That is unbelievable to me on this floor. 
   Since the 1950s, since the height of the Soviet Union and the Cold War, we have prohibited propaganda directed at the people of the United States using taxpayer dollars by the Pentagon. 
   What happened here was a violation of that law, and that anybody would stand here on this floor and say that that law, which we have had in place for more than 50 years, should be repealed or undermined by one narrow-mined administration or Vice President Cheney or anybody else who wants to manipulate intelligence, the Congress and the American people into a war that should not have been initiated is unbelievable at this point in time. 
   An informed, free and fair press is critical to our system of government to have informed decision-makers here. Maybe you don't want to hear the truth, but I do, and to have informed voters who are voting based on the truth and choosing their elected representatives based on decisions that they fully understand and that they have been fully informed on and not propagandized. 
   It's extraordinary to me in the 21st century anybody would advocate the use of propaganda against the voters and the people of the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue and for this amendment. I think this is very necessary. This is not a fine debate about semantics or definitions, it's an issue about the integrity of the intelligence process in the United States of America. 
   It's well-known now that because of a focus that was created by Vice President Cheney in the lead-up to the Iraq war and the exclusion of the broader views of the intelligence community, that the intelligence that was provided to the Congress and other decision makers was not comprehensive and not accurate. So the question arises about the language in the bill. 
   Instead of taking the newly formed and reformed national intelligence agencies and getting their opinion on the capabilities of Iran, it would single out one component of those agencies, the Department of Defense, to write a new opinion. I, for one Member, can speak for myself, am concerned that this is an attempt to redirect our intelligence and to get intelligence that is only coming from a small portion of the intelligence community, the same failing that led to the lead-up and the faulty intelligence for the Iraq war. 
   We have reformed the intelligence process. We have confidence in our National Intelligence Director, and we should allow him to do his job and compile the advice from all the intelligence agencies of the United States Government, as was done last fall, which contradicted previous opinions on Iraq. We don't want to send any message or direction that we are unhappy with that. We want them to do their job, do it properly, properly inform us, and there is no reason why any sort of additional evaluation should be restricted only to the Department of Defense. That just doesn't make sense. 
   So it's not an argument about semantics, it's about the fact we were failed in the run-up to the war by cherry picking and focusing of intelligence. We don't want to be failed again. We want the full opinion of the national intelligence agencies.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support on this amendment. It's quite simple. The Department of Defense spends nearly $1 billion a year moving freight and cargo around the United States of America. Much of that moved on truck. Many shippers these days, or brokers, are charging shippers, including the Department of Defense, a fuel surcharge or a fuel-related adjustment, as DOD calls it. 
   It has come to the attention of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee that oftentimes those surcharges that are charged to the shippers are not passed on to the truckers who have got to buy the fuel. Hundreds of trucking firms have gone out of business this year. We are looking at record diesel prices. 
   This amendment simply says that when DOD is charged a fuel-related adjustment, a fuel surcharge, that that must be passed on to the person who has to buy the fuel, generally the trucker, and it has to be posted visibly on the Internet by the broker so that it is known to the trucker and others who purchase the fuel that a fuel surcharge was in place. 
   I thank the gentleman for his support on this important issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (SECRETARY PAULSON AND THE BAILOUT LEGISLATION -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, 2007 was a great year on Wall Street, 2007, bonuses of $38 billion to themselves. Secretary Paulson came to us just having received a $39 million bonus from Goldman Sachs, came here to the applause of the Wall Street elites and others. 
   His first crisis was Bear Stearns. He bailed out Bear Stearns, or he had them acquired with Federal guarantees. But he said, don't worry, the fundamentals of our economy are sound. Then along came Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He wanted Congress to give them an unlimited line of credit, but don't worry, it's only a crisis of confidence. Their fundamentals are sound. They probably won't even need the line of credit. Congress went along with that. I voted ``no.'' The fundamentals of America are sound, he said. 
   A month later he had to take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, unprecedented, accumulating maybe $5 trillion of debt onto the books of the Federal Government all at once. But not to worry. We'll work our way through it. The fundamentals are sound. 
   Then came Lehman Brothers. It's just one firm, he says. Let 'em go, let the market work. Our fundamentals are sound. Two days later AIG, a big company, a lot of money in insurance, annuities, other things, too big to fail, broke a 50-year precedent, put Federal money into an insurance company. But not to worry, this is just a little blip. Our fundamentals are sound. 
   Then Thursday night he has a closed-door meeting with congressional leadership, and he says, if we don't do a bailout plan tomorrow, the economy is going to collapse. 
   Now, wait a minute. This guy has been consistently wrong and out of touch or he has been lying to Congress and the American people about how sound our fundamentals are. Now he wants us to trust him with the keys of the treasury and no restrictions on how he would spend the money in his next bailout. He is compromised, in my opinion, because of his relationship with Goldman Sachs and Wall Street, not with Main Street America. My small banks are not clamoring for this. My credit unions aren't clamoring for this. They are still making loans. They're saying there's a credit crunch. Guess what, if you've got good credit in Oregon, you can go to the credit union, you can go to a small bank, and then the small bank can sell the loan to the Federal Government, that is, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, thanks to Mr. Paulson. 
   But he's saying to us here I've got a deal for you. Let's think of Henry Hank Paulson as a realtor. Here's the deal: He's got a great house he wants to sell you. Now, the thing about that is he can't give you an appraisal on the house. There are no market comparables. And he can't tell you what it's going to cost. But it is a great deal for you. 
   That is the bailout he is proposing, to take this junk from Wall Street that no one understands and put it on the Federal books. What if we spend, borrow $700 billion and the market continues to go down? That's what the Asian market said yesterday. They said, wait a minute, it sounded good at first, but where is the U.S. going to get the $700 billion? Who's going to lend it to them? Or are they just going to print it and cause inflation? And what if it doesn't work? What will they do then? We aren't dealing with some of the fundamental underlying problems that we have now. 
   And now I find out by reading the Washington Times that very quietly they have folded in all student loan debt, all automobile debt, and all credit card debt. So the Federal Government is now not only going to be in the housing business, it's not only going to be in the insurance business, suddenly we are going to be in the repo business, out there collecting cars around America so we can sell them to try to get back some of the taxpayers' money. 
   This is nuts. Congress should not do this this week. We need to understand what's going on. They can't be slipping in little things like this and trying to jam this bill through. This is way too much like the rush to war when Congress was under pressure to go home for elections. Forget about the elections. This is about the future of the United States of America and our financial system. And if we have to stay here every day in October to understand this and get it right, we should.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair and my good friend for yielding. 
   This bill will end the war in Iraq. This is the first enforceable challenge to the President's plan to escalate and continue a stay-the-course, open-ended commitment to a war, a war that was launched with massive deception, and an unnecessary war. 
   One gentleman questioned Congress' power. Congress' power under Article I, section 8 is very broad. We have the ability to modify the original authorization for war, and that is essentially what we are doing here by saying there will be an end to this war. 
   A year ago, just 1 year ago this March, the President said it will be up to ``future Presidents,'' plural, not just the next one, plural, ``and future governments of Iraq'' to determine when our troops might come home. That is not acceptable. 
   Our troops are mired in the midst of a civil war. Oh, they have dragged out the old, If we don't fight them there, we'll fight them here. Well, unfortunately, the Republicans are contradicted by the Bush-appointed National  Intelligence Director who says al Qaeda is not looking to have a base in Iraq and al Qaeda would be extraordinarily unlikely to attempt, and has no capability to attack the United States from Iraq; but they are looking to move back into Afghanistan, Afghanistan where we should have stayed focused, a legitimate war against the Taliban, al Qaeda, and Osama bin Laden. Remember him? Dead or alive; dead or alive. He is still planning attacks against the United States of American, and Bush wants to mire us down day after day in a civil war. 
   The Iraqis have to want to end this war. This bill will give them a motivation to begin to lay aside their ages' old grudges and begin to meaningfully cooperate and coordinate and share their oil wealth. That is the only way this is going to end. It is a civil war. They have been fighting it for 1,400 years. We need this bill. We need to motivate the Iraqis to bring an end to this war, and we need to refocus on the real threats to America.

   Do you know what it would cost to catch up with our bridge problem over the next 20 years? We would have to invest a lot of money, an incredible amount of money. Two weeks in Iraq every year is what it would take to fix the bridge problem in the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution reaffirming our national commitment to our national transportation infrastructure. Two hundred years ago, a farsighted President, Thomas Jefferson, commissioned Secretary Gallatin to provide a report and a vision for transportation in America, to knit together the then-young Nation and to better facilitate the movement of its people, its goods, its commerce and people, and to better compete in the international economy. 
   For 200 years, or nearly 200 years, that vision has been maintained and has been the prevailing view here in Washington, DC. 
   Unfortunately, we now have an occupant of the White House and a Secretary of Transportation who do not share that vision. A recent report detailing the extraordinary state of disrepair into which our transportation infrastructure has fallen from a commission created by this Congress in the SAFETEA-LU legislation pointed to the need for a massive increase in investment at all levels, Federal, State and local, because in order just to maintain the existing infrastructure, we would have to spend more than we are spending today. We are not even treading water. We are not even maintaining a deteriorating infrastructure; we are deteriorating towards Third World status. While our competitors around the world are leaping ahead with major investments in transit and roads, bridges and highways, and with major investments in ports and waterways, we are falling behind. 
   In response to that, unfortunately, the Secretary of Transportation joined with a minority in dissenting from the report and essentially proposed that we phase out any Federal role or investment in our national transportation infrastructure. 
   I can think of nothing more wrong-headed, shortsighted, or more destructive for the future of our country than to pull back from these extraordinary needs. So that's why I think it is so important that we look back, we look back over 200 years of history, we look back to the Gallatin Report, we look back to the successes that have followed upon that vision that we have been building upon for 200 years, and we set a course for the next 200 years so that we can again boast of having the state-of-the-art, most efficient, most energy-efficient transportation network in the world, which is far from the condition in which we find ourselves today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   It's already been referenced earlier by the Speaker, and by Mr. Blumenauer, that one thing we could do for the ailing American economy to put people back to work, quite quickly this year, this construction year, would be investment in our infrastructure. These would be American jobs with American products. They can't be exported. The benefits are here at home. It will make our country more competitive in the international marketplace. They help businesses with just-in-time delivery. You're now seeing trucks detoured by 100, 200 miles because of failing and weight-limited bridges. There's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done. 
   It would also make us more energy efficient by helping to obviate some of the congestion that we're currently suffering from, the detours that I already mentioned. 
   If we set a goal, for instance, of looking at our largest cities, having 10 percent of people take transit to work, we could save 40 percent from the oil that we currently import from the Middle East. That would be tremendous for national security, our balance of trade, and great for the American people and good for the environment. 
   Now, some might say that's too ambitious. Well, I just came back, or I took the committee on a trip to Europe. In London, more than 85 percent of the people ride transit to work. And in Barcelona, they're investing more money in one addition to their subway system, which is at capacity right now, than we're investing in all transit in the entire continent of the United States of America. 
   We are not pushing the margins here in terms of our investment. We can do better and we can learn from the past and, at the same time, look to a more transportation efficient future by observing this commemoration of Gallatin and beginning to construct our own version of a Gallatin report as we move to the reauthorization of the surface transportation and transit legislation in 2009.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, after 9/11, the House of Representatives voted in unprecedented near unanimity with one dissenting vote to invade Afghanistan and go after the perpetrators of 9/11, Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and also their host, the Taliban. The U.S. Forces with real allies quickly accomplished that mission, displacing the Taliban, Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda. 
   Unfortunately, because of the administration's diverting its attention already toward Iraq and failing to send adequate troops into Afghanistan and overly relying upon untrustworthy Afghan warlords, Osama bin Laden escaped, as did the one-eyed Omar of the Taliban, al-Zawahiri, his deputy. 
   They are still at large. They are still planning attacks in the United States. In fact, they are resurgent. For the first year since our invasion of Afghanistan, the Taliban didn't shrink back into Pakistan for the winter. They have set up sophisticated forward bases in Southern Afghanistan.  
   We are hearing a plea for reinforcements from the NATO forces, from U.S. troops on the ground. And what is the President's reaction? Remember the President, ``Osama bin Laden, dead or alive; dead or alive, we are going to hunt him to the ends of the Earth''? He does not talk about that anymore, does he? The Taliban, Afghanistan. He is totally focused on his failed policies in Iraq, where there was no al Qaeda, where there were no weapons of mass destruction, where there was no Osama bin Laden.     
   And now the President, as part of an attempt to paper over his failed strategy yet once again and pretend there is possibly a military solution, he is going to take U.S. troops out of southern Afghanistan and send them to Baghdad, despite the warnings that the one-eyed Omar and the Taliban intend to try and retake Kandahar against the pathetic NATO troops that are defending that region, hobbled by extraordinarily restrictive rules of engagement. 
   There is a possibility that there will be a new sanctuary and there will be a resurgence in place for the terrorists to go, but it is not Iraq. The President, in his blind obsession with Iraq, is failing to see the real threats against the United States of America. The President should not, and this Congress should not, support an escalation of the war in Iraq, sending 21,500 troops in Iraq, some of whom are vitally needed in Afghanistan who will be displaced as part of that number because we have taxed our military so heavily. 
   This is wrong policy for Iraq, wrong policy for America, and wrong policy for the much-touted war in Iraq. We must refocus our efforts on Afghanistan, and we must work more broadly for a solution in Iraq, following many of the recommendations of the Hamilton-Baker report rejected by the President in favor of doing the same thing again and again and again. 
   This is not a change in policy. It is the same failed policies of the past.

Ten years later, Oregon's most persistent champion of wilderness, Jim Weaver, was elected to the United States Congress. Despite the fact that he represented the largest public timber-producing district in the country, Jim engaged in a battle over the next 10 years to set aside some of Oregon's most beautiful forests for future generations. He engaged in the first fights to preserve old growth, fights which are continuing to this day. 
   The Forest Service originally recommended 370,000 acres for wilderness designation in Oregon. Jim upped the ante a little bit to 1.2 million. He had very, very tough and difficult negotiations with the Senate, and in the end he and Senator Hatfield were able to settle on 861,500 acres, not everything Jim wanted, but a tremendous legacy for our future. 
   At the very last minute, Jim got Grassy Knob added and Monument Rock protected. And then one of the toughest things that he had to do, he was asked by Senator Hatfield did he want Hardesty Mountain or did he want Waldo. Jim chose Waldo. And so it's extremely appropriate that this House acts today to name the trail which encompasses pristine Waldo Lake as the Jim Weaver Trail. And future generations of Oregonians utilizing that trail will begin to understand the history and the fight that went into preserving some of their most precious wildlands, a fight which I'm attempting to continue with wilderness legislation this year, and a fight with the BLM over their attempts to harvest the last of our precious old growth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Oregon Surplus Federal Land Act requires the Commandant of the Coast Guard to transfer the Cape Arago Light Station and the surrounding area in Coos County, Oregon, in my congressional district, to the Secretary of the Interior to hold in trust for the benefit of the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians. 
   Under this bill, the Confederated Tribes will assume responsibility for maintenance of the light station and must provide reasonable public access. 
   I would also like to point out that H.R. 6370 leaves it to the Secretary of the Interior and the Commandant of the Coast Guard to determine the exact amount of land that will be transferred and to develop the appropriate maps. This body has passed similar bills in the past. 
   H.R. 6370 clearly leaves all authority of the transfer and trust with the relevant agencies. The Coast Guard and the Coos County Commissioners support the transfer. And this bill will put an historic piece of land to good use while protecting and preserving its cultural significance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I thought that we could have this issue resolved before we came to the floor. Unfortunately, the Coast Guard has to actually contract for a survey, which, through the Federal procurement process, takes a while. But I can assure the gentleman that there are a number of other bills I'm familiar with, mostly under the jurisdiction of the Resources Committee, that have had similar problems, and these issues were resolved before the interagency transfer was finalized and took place. That just is sort of logical; they need to know what they're transferring, and they need to have a legal description and map. So I assure the gentleman, to the best of my ability as a member of the legislative branch, that the administrative branch will fulfill their duties in this matter.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (WALL STREET BAILOUT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, Secretary Paulson has submitted a simple proposal to Congress. This is it, three pages. It is about $1 billion a word, and it is quite simple: Secretary Paulson gets the key to the Treasury, can start off by borrowing $700 billion in the name of the American people, maybe more later, and it waives all laws. All laws. No oversight, no one looking over his shoulder, no conflict of interest rules. Not even court review. A pretty simple proposal. 
   He insists this has to be done, without meaningful discussion or debate or any change by the Congress, sort of an immediate authorization for use of financial force. Does this remind anybody of anything, like the rush into Iraq on election eve a number of years ago? It is all too familiar. 
   He wants to take care of Wall Street's illiquid assets, as what he nicely labels them. Nice charitable pundits have said Cash For Trash. Wall Street could then return to business as usual. That is Mr. Paulson's plan. He is of, by, for, and about Wall Street, former head of Goldman Sachs. He wants to go back to the way things were. 
   They should never go back to the way things were. There need to be consequences, and there needs to be major change in the financial structures and the financial instruments and the regulation of Wall Street, something this administration still continues to deny, or says, oh, we'll do it later after we give them everything they want up front, after we bail them out. 
   Now, many want a condition on what will happen here. They want to have oversight. That is good. They want to limit executive compensation for any firm that takes a bailout. That is good. They want a linkage to a Main Street stimulus package and jobs. That is good. Those are all good. But we have got to question and take our time here to question the basic premise: Should we just take all their junk that people like Hank Paulson created, exotic instruments, the big party they have been throwing? Should we just take that and give it to the taxpayers and borrow the money from who knows where? Or, should we take an equity stake in these firms? That is what the government did when it bailed out Chrysler. It said, okay, we'll bail you out, but we own you; and when you come back, we're going to make money for the taxpayers. 
   Secretary Paulson wants to set it up so that the taxpayers at best, and in an all likelihood this wouldn't happen, might break even some day. No. We need to take an equity assurance in these firms, or we need to extend them loans, have them marked down as junk to market. There's a market for it. It's about 22 cents on the dollar. Make them mark it down. And then if they're threatened and they're liquid, they can come to us and ask for a loan, and the terms are going to be stiff. And we aren't going to give it to just any one of these firms. No. We need to do this. We need to do it with oversight, and executive compensation is key no matter which way we go. 
   Oh, let the boards of directors control. Come on, boards of directors are all like first cousins and closer. These people are all feathering each other's nest. Hank Paulson himself got a $50 million bonus for 1 year, the same year Wall Street rewarded itself with $60 billion in bonuses. That is not a mistake. Billion dollars in bonuses in 2006. 
   These people are out of control. They don't understand the real world. And for them to talk about Main Street and pretend they're populist and they care about Main Street and student loans and homeowners' equity is a bunch of BS. 
   We need major structural reform, and we are the last bulwark here, the House of Representatives, the United States Senate. Because if we pass this bill as they propose it, we will be doing an incredible disservice to the American people, to the world economy. And what if his bet doesn't work? Yeah, the execs come out whole and they scoot that money offshore into hidey-holes or into gold or something else. But what if it doesn't work? And we have extended our credit about as far as it will go. Where are we going to borrow $700 billion? What is the next step? 
   We need a much more targeted, deliberative approach. Congress can't come up with it in 3 days or 4 days. We shouldn't be rushed into this. If it takes a week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, a month, the world will wait. They will wait for a thoughtful plan that cures the disease in addition to getting us beyond this initial problem. That is the  job of this Congress. We should not be rolled by our Wall Street exec who is masquerading as Secretary of the Treasury.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6524, a bill to authorize the administrator of General Services to transfer a parcel of real property in Eastlake, Ohio, to the city of Eastlake. Further, the bill authorizes the transfer of real property in the Koochiching Army Reserve Training Center in Koochiching County, Minnesota, to the County of Koochiching. 
   The city of Eastlake will compensate the General Services $30,000 for the real property transfer and the County of Koochiching also will compensate the General Services $30,000 for the real property transfer. The General Services Administration will forward to the Secretary of the Army the net proceeds for the transfer. 
   The parcel of real property in Eastlake is an approximate 10-acre site, which includes the John F. Kennedy Senior Citizen Center. In 1964, the city of Eastlake purchased the property and, consistent with the deed restriction, used the site for recreational uses for over 40 years. The bill will lift the deed restrictions and thus allow the city to use the property for economic development purposes. The senior center has been moved to a better location. Further, the city has purchased over 17 acres for parks and recreational uses, increasing the overall acreage devoted to open space and parkland. 
   The first parcel in Minnesota is 5 1/2 acres, which includes the U.S. Army Armory Building, which will pay to have the roof replaced, install a new boiler and heating system, and make extensive repairs to the ceiling. The Army reported the property excess in January 2006 and GSA accepted the report of excess in February 2006. GSA screened the property with other Federal agencies, but there were no expressions of interest. Likewise, no expressions of interest from homeless shelter providers were received by GSA. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend both Chairman Oberstar and my colleague, Congressman LaTourette, for working on these essential pieces of legislation and for ensuring compensation will be made to the General Services, and the Federal taxpayers will be fully protected. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   It was just about 2 years ago this month that we were struggling with the final details of the SAFETEA-LU legislation, in my opinion the signature legislation of the last Congress, bipartisan legislation, to improve the transportation efficiency of the United States of America, investing nearly $300 billion. 
   But, as good as the bill was, there were technical problems, and we are correcting those here; and, as good as that bill was, we must do better in the future. 
   As chairman of the subcommittee, I have already begun hearings looking toward the reauthorization which we would hope to have accomplished by the expiration of this legislation, October 1, 2009. We hope not to go through multiple continuations and extensions as we did in the last Congress. 
   We also need to find new resources to better address the infrastructure needs of our country. The Bush administration's own Department of Transportation estimated before the consideration of the last bill that we needed $375 billion, not $283 billion, just to keep up with the deterioration and the growth needs of the country, as pointed out by the gentleman from Minnesota. 
   We need to deal with congestion to improve American's lives, to become more fuel efficient, and to deal with just-in-time delivery for our businesses, to become a better competitor in the international community. Other nations are investing much more. We must do better. This is an interim step as we correct the bill from the last Congress, and I look forward to working with both sides of the aisle as we develop the next bill for 2009.

It isn't going to help with declining housing prices, foreclosures, job loss, income disparity, or lack of health care. None of those things will be addressed. It doesn't address the crumbling infrastructure. It is not aimed at the real economy. It is aimed at the fraud, the speculative activity and the bad bets made by Wall Street executives. 
   Now they purport this is necessary to free up credit, and some are going to say I am voting for the bill because it lifts the FDIC limit. The administration can do that without spending $700 billion. They are going to say I'm doing it because it changed the mark-to-market rules. Those two things are critical to my banks at home in Oregon, but you can do that without spending $700 billion with a stroke of the pen. 
   It leaves out one other critical measure, the certificate's net worth that it would use for the savings and loan. That would take legislation, and that is not in here. 
   We are going to spend $700 billion to solve a problem that could perhaps be resolved for no cost to the American taxpayer. If we are going to borrow money, borrow it to invest in America's Main Street, not Wall Street.

   On Sunday, we had unidentified sources saying that the highest levels of the Iranian Government have directed use of weapons that are killing U.S. troops. No information was provided to substantiate the charge; administration officials yesterday deflected requests for more details, even as they repeatedly implied Tehran's involvement. It may or may not be true, but they have got a pretty bad record on intelligence. And now MG Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said yesterday that he has no information indicating Iran's government is directing the supply of lethal weapons to Shiite insurgent groups in Iraq. It sounds like the Iraq war intelligence all over again, phony intelligence leading us down the path to disastrous involvement.

And we would pay for it by stripping the wildly profitable oil and gas industry of some tax subsidies from the American people, and the Republicans object to that too.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I have listened to some of the debate on this resolution. I have been disappointed by the misleading talking points and faulty analysis that have been repeatedly used by those who support the President's escalation of the war in Iraq. 
   Many speakers have tied Iraq to the broader war against al-Qaeda. These are two distinct wars. Iraq had not declared war on the U.S. Al-Qaeda had. Iraq did not attack the U.S. Al-Qaeda did. Iraq did not harbor al-Qaeda leaders. The Taliban in Afghanistan did. By shifting military and intelligence resources out of Afghanistan before the Taliban and al-Qaeda were wiped out the administration has actually undermined the important war against al-Qaeda. The administration's blunders mean the U.S. is at risk of losing two wars at once: Afghanistan and Iraq. The war in Afghanistan is salvageable and winnable. The war in Iraq will not be won by military means alone. Vigorous diplomatic efforts within the Gulf region, in addition to a political realignment within Iraq will be necessary . 
   U.S. intelligence agencies, including military intelligence agencies, have refuted the claim that the conflict in Iraq is driven by al-Qaeda. It is not. The violence is driven by a civil war, primarily between Iraqi Sunnis and Shias. The recent National Intelligence Estimate should definitively put that issue to rest. 
   Even the President has recognized that al Qaeda is not the driving force for violence in Iraq. In a speech on December 12, 2005, the President made important distinctions between the insurgent elements in Iraq. He mentioned ``rejectionists,'' which are mostly Sunnis who miss the privileged status they enjoyed under Saddam Hussein. He mentioned ``Saddamists'', who are former regime elements who want to return to power. Again, they are Sunni. And, he mentioned foreign terrorists affiliated with or inspired by al Qaeda, which even the President acknowledged was the ``smallest'' element of the insurgency. The one huge element he left out was nationalist Shias, such as those influenced by radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. 
   The President and his allies justify the continuing U.S. presence in Iraq by claiming that if we don't fight there, we'll have to fight here at home. However, the Iraqi Sunni rejectionists, Saddamists, and nationalist Shias, who combined make up the vast bulk of the insurgents and militias committing violence in Iraq, have no interest and no capability to attack the U.S. homeland. They just want U.S. military forces out of their own country. U.S. forces are a target of convenience in their escalating civil conflict. It is deceitful to argue that if we don't fight there, we will fight them in the streets of the United States. 
   The war in Iraq is not a part of the war against al Qaeda. And, in fact the war in Iraq is undermining our fight against al Qaeda. 
   Some in this debate have made the ridiculous argument that if the U.S. leaves Iraq that somehow Osama bin Laden will take control and establish a safe haven for terrorists to attack the U.S. There is no chance that the Shias and Kurds, who represent around 80 percent of the population in Iraq, will allow Sunni foreign terrorist elements like al-Qaeda to take over the country. Even many Sunnis have grown tired of foreign terrorists operating in Iraq, with several Sunni tribes fighting al Qaeda operatives. 
   Iran and al Qaeda are the primary beneficiaries of the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the two entities that most want the U.S. to stay there. With respect to Iran, the U.S. removed a threatening neighbor of Iran's and helped put in power a fellow Shiite regime, in addition to tying down the U.S. military and sowing international discord that has limited our options in confronting Iran's nuclear program. With respect to al Qaeda, U.S. intelligence agencies have noted that Iraq is serving as a training ground for terrorists and a recruiting poster that is swelling the ranks of terrorist organizations and inspiring attacks around the world.  
   It is past time to end the open-ended commitment the President has made in Iraq. As long as the U.S. military remains stuck with the President's pledge of open-ended support, Iraqi politicians and security forces will use the U.S. presence as a crutch. They will continue to fail to take the necessary steps to solve their differences, establish an effective and inclusive government, end sectarian violence, and create the foundation for a secure and prosperous society. 
   Democracy and stability cannot be imposed on unwilling parties. As New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman said on Meet the Press, a stable, pluralistic democracy in Iraq is everyone's second choice except ours. The Shias want power for themselves. The Sunnis want power. And the Kurds want power and independence. What they don't want to do is share that power. The President's stay-the-course, more-of-the-same, status quo policy provides no incentive for the parties to reach the political compromises that are necessary. 
   Negotiating a timeline for bringing home U.S. troops with responsible parties in the Iraqi government would also boost the Iraqi government's legitimacy and claim to self-rule, and force the Iraqi government to take responsibility for itself and its citizens. Negotiating a withdrawal time line and strategy with the Iraqi government could, more than possibly anything else, improve the standing of the Iraqi government in the eyes of its own people, a significant achievement in a region in which the standing of rulers and governments is generally low. 
   As the Iraqi National Security Advisor, Mowaffak al-Rabaie wrote in the Washington Post on June 20, 2006, the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, ``will help the Iraqis who now see foreign troops as occupiers rather than the liberators they were meant to be. It will remove psychological barriers and the reason that many Iraqis joined the so-called resistance in the first place.'' He went on to write, ``Moreover, the removal of foreign troops will legitimize Iraq's government in the eyes of its people ..... the drawdown of 
   foreign troops will strengthen our fledgling government to last the full four years it is supposed to.'' 
   Being confronted with the reality of a U.S. withdrawal should force the Iraqi factions to reach the political compromises necessary to move their country forward. If not, there is no reason to prolong the U.S. involvement in Iraq if we want a stable country more than the Iraqi people and their elected leaders do. The U.S. cannot force Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds to make peace or to act for the common good. They have been in conflict for 1,400 years. Nor should the U.S. military be forced to remain in Iraq essentially as an army for one side of a civil war. Supporters of escalating the war may pretend that they're doing it for the Iraqis, but large majorities of both Sunnis and Shias approve of attacks against U.S. troops and want us to bring them home. 
   The President believes that the U.S. needs to escalate the war in Iraq by sending more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq. I think that is a mistake. It will not bring stability to Iraq, and I oppose it. That is why I will vote for the resolution on the floor this week. 
   The administration blunders in Iraq are well-known. They went in with too few troops against the advice of military leaders like General Shinseki. They disbanded the Iraqi army. They failed to understand the ethnic tensions and power bases in Iraq. They purged the Iraqi government of the bureaucratic experience necessary to have a functioning government, among others. 
   I do not believe there is any level of U.S. troops that could stabilize Iraq at this point and resolve the underlying ages old sectarian conflicts. The time when more troops might have made a lasting difference has come and gone. There might be a small, temporary reduction in the chaos in Iraq, but the escalation will not solve the deep and underlying political conflicts that are preventing a long-term resolution to the violence. 
   The administration already increased the number of U.S. troops in Baghdad last summer in Operation Together Forward and has increased the number of troops throughout Iraq at other times as well, yet the violence against our troops and Iraqi security forces and civilians continues to increase. Short-term improvements in security in the wake of U.S. troop increases have always given way to the long-term trend of increased violence and a growing civil war. 
   Based on historical analysis, counterinsurgency experts, including General Petraeus, who is now the top U.S. General in Iraq but also recently rewrote the Army's counterinsurgency manual, estimate it takes around 20 U.S. troops per 1,000 inhabitants to successfully fight a counterinsurgency. To achieve that ratio in Baghdad alone would require 120,000 troops. Even with the increase proposed by the President, the U.S. would only have a third of that at best. For all of Iraq, it would require 500,000 troops. General Shinseki's original estimate that it would take several hundred thousands troops to invade and stabilize Iraq was based on this counterinsurgency literature. After the escalation we'll only have around 160,000. 
   The bottom line is that a proposal to increase U.S. troop levels in Baghdad or Iraq more generally by more than 20,000 is not a serious effort to restore stability to Iraq. As General John Abizaid, then the head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on November 15, 2006, ``I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the corps commander, General Dempsey, we all talked together. And I said, in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in more American Troops now, does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no. And the reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It is easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own future.'' Essentially, the President is proposing to put more lives at risk with virtually no chance of changing the dynamic in Iraq. 
   A better strategy for Iraq is to announce a timeline negotiated with the Iraqi government for bringing our troops home over the next 6 months to a year. The administration has always set timelines for political developments in Iraq--for elections, for the drafting of the constitution etc. The administration argued such timelines were necessary to focus the energy of Iraq's leaders and to force compromises. We need to do the same on the military side. 
   In the interim, I have also proposed that U.S. troops be removed from front line combat positions in Iraqi cities and towns, turning over daily security patrols, interactions with citizens, and any offensive security actions to the Iraqis themselves. 
   The training and equipping of Iraqi security forces should be accelerated and the sectarian balance must be improved.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, JOHN MCCAIN, has a solution to skyrocketing gas prices. 
   Is he going to take on Big Oil, their price gouging, and their obscene profits? No. Is he going to take on OPEC and their collusion to restrict supply and drive up the price in violation of international trade law? No. 
   Is he going to take on the hedge fund speculators on Wall Street that are driving up the price unnecessarily 50 cents a gallon so then they can make money? No. 
   He is going to be the GOP nominee, the Grand Oil Party nominee. He can't take that money. He has a solution. Suspend the Federal gas tax. 
   In 1993, the Federal gas tax was 18.3 cents and a gallon of gas was a buck. In 2008, a gallon of gas is $3.50. The Federal gas tax is the same 18.3 cents. It's dropped to 5 percent of the cost. 
   If we follow his plan, we will cancel hundreds of needed bridge projects and highway projects across the country, throwing construction workers out of jobs, an already hard-hit sector, or maybe he is just going to borrow the money after he cancels the gas tax, because the only thing going up faster on the Republican administration than the price of gas is the national debt.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, the Grand Oil Party is at it again. $500 billion in profits to the oil industry since George Bush, the oil man, and Dick Cheney, the oil man, took office. Remember what they told us? They could deal with the industry. They'd talk the prices down. They could deal with OPEC. They'd talk the prices down. OPEC is violating international law. The President won't file a complaint in the World Trade Organization for their illegal constraint of production which is driving up the price. The President refuses to take any action against his friends in the OPEC consortium or cartel. 
   Now the big oil companies, $40 billion in profits for one, ExxonMobil, last year, their generous campaign contributors, the GOP, Grand Oil Party, is doing very well. But now they're crying crocodile tears here on the floor and saying they really care about consumers, after the Bush-Cheney energy bill, which gave subsidies to ExxonMobil who made $40 billion last year after the Republicans refused last year to strip those subsidies from the oil companies? They complain about the high price to consumers. They're born-again consumer advocates. That's great. 
   I've been a consumer advocate for a long time. I have consistently supported a windfall profits tax. I've also consistently said we've got to go after the OPEC cartel and file the complaints. And we need new technologies, and we need new fuels, and we need conservation. None of those things were in the Bush-Cheney energy bills written behind closed doors by big oil and the GOP, the Grand Oil Party. 
   But now, their presumptive political nominee, Mr. McCain, has come up with a great idea, let's suspend the gas tax. Now, let's see. In 1993, the gas tax was 18.3 cents a gallon, and gas was $1.05 a gallon. Today, in my district, gas is $3.50 a gallon, and guess what? The Federal gas tax is still 18.3 cents a gallon. That money is a tax. It's a tax going to big oil and OPEC and to hedge fund speculators who are driving up the price of oil. That's the tax the American consumers are paying. They won't take on OPEC, and they sure as heck aren't going to take on their friends in big oil. 
   We're willing to do that. And suspending the gas tax, now I would ask the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. McCain, if we suspend the gas tax, how many highway projects and bridge projects are you going to cancel? How many thousand people are you going to put out of work when you already have a deficit in the trust fund? If you want to give relief to the American consumers, target the real culprits. It is not the gas tax that's been flat for the last 15 years; it's big oil and it's the OPEC companies and the hedge fund speculators on Wall Street. Let's go after them.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, to address criticisms raised on the first amendment, this would not prevent retaliation for an attack upon U.S. troops. It would not prevent going into Iran to retrieve captured troops. But what it would do is say that we have not authorized, as some in this administration allege, a preemptive war against Iran because of the Iraq resolution or the 9/11 resolution. That simply is not true. They were not that all encompassing. 
   Further, it would also challenge a letter I had on April 18, 2002, from then-White House counsel, the esteemed Mr. Gonzales, who claims that the President has unilateral war-making authority under the Constitution. 
   No. This simply restates the Constitution of the United States and the War Powers Act. It is law, 93-148, and article I, section 8, of the Constitution. 
   This is not about whether or not military action against Iran is wise or necessary. Regardless of how you come down on that question, I urge you to support the amendment. It is not about binding the President's hands so he couldn't retaliate if they are involved in attacking our troops or capturing our troops in the area. It allows, as does the War Powers Act, in the event of any attack by Iran on the United States, its territories or possessions or Armed Forces, it is fully within the President's purview to respond. 
   There are many who are concerned about the growing nuclear capability of Iran, and I share those concerns. But the question that some day possibly in the future they might have a missile that could work, they might have nuclear weapons, does not dictate that we should have a preemptive war now; and if the President wants to make the case that that warrants a preemptive war, he should come to the war-making body, the Congress of the United States, make that case, present his evidence and have a lawful vote. 
   Plain and simple, that is all this amendment does, although I am certain other allegations will be made.

   The President is not reading in full the War Powers Act. It says the President's constitutional powers ``are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.'' 
   My amendment actually allows that exact language. If our troops are attacked, if we are attacked, if our territories are attacked, then the President could retaliate. So I am restating the war powers. 
   In this case we also heard about a declaration of war from the gentlewoman from Nevada. The Congress has the authority to take up a declaration of war tonight, tomorrow, anytime it deems fit against Iran. Nothing in this amendment would prevent a Congress from declaring war. 
   It is just saying if you want to have a preemptive war under the Constitution of the United States, a preventive war, then you need to come to Congress under article I, section 8. 
   If you believe in the Constitution of the United States and the powers of this branch, vote for this amendment.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. I fear tomorrow that the House of Representatives, the people's House, will be rushed into making a risky $700 billion taxpayer financed bet on Wall Street, a big bet built upon a very shaky foundation, on the premise that Bush's Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, who presided as the Chair of Goldman Sachs while these weapons of financial mass destruction were created, is the only one who has a plan to disarm them. 
   Despite the best efforts of the Democrats to change this plan, what we will vote on tomorrow at its core is still the Paulson-Bush plan that is still based on his idea that taxpayers should borrow $700 billion and buy all of Wall Street's bad bets and that all will be well. It's sort of a financial surge strategy. Like the surge in Iraq, it might look in the short term like it's working, but it won't be sustainable, and I fear it will not in any way resolve the underlying problems of a weak economy and of a deteriorating housing market. More likely, it will lower the value of the dollar and drive up interest rates and drive up the price of energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (TOWARD A MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT FUTURE WITHOUT BEING PRICE-GOUGED ON WAY THERE -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the Chair. 
   I am going to continue the discussion the previous Member started with perhaps a little different orientation and, that is, our dependence upon oil. I would agree with the gentleman that we need to break our dependence upon imported oil. We need to look toward a more energy-efficient future. That is going to mean new sources of energy, new technologies. I am on a number of bills to make those investments. But more immediately, I want to talk about the situation we are in today. On the path to that more energy-efficient future, we don't need to be fleeced by the oil cartels, which is what is going on now. I am not just talking about OPEC but I'll get to them in a moment, but I'm getting to the big oil companies--ExxonMobil, record profits last year, $3.2 billion a month, $40 billion for the year, $109 million a day, $4.6 million an hour of profits for one corporation. Throughout the industry, it was repeated. 
   Now, the President, an oil man, a failed oil man, and the Vice President from Halliburton, another oil man, say there's nothing they can do about it, nothing the government can do about it. This is just market forces. Market forces. 
   Hmm. Let's see. You make gasoline out of crude oil so if the price of crude oil goes up, the price of gasoline goes up. Yeah, I understand that. That's good. The price of crude oil is up a whopping 3 percent over last year. That is about inflation. That's not too bad. That's today on the market. Unfortunately, the price of gasoline on the west coast is up 20 percent. Now, where did the rest of that market force come into play? 
   No, what we have here, plain and simple, is price gouging, market manipulation and collusion. A number of years ago there was a famous memo in the industry that said, you know, the refineries are not particularly profitable, but if the industry were to engage in mergers, buy out the independent refiners, close them down and decrease the refinery capacity in America, that could become a very profitable sector. It is. In fact, profits in the refining sector because of collusion by Big Oil are up 250 percent. It isn't the guy at the corner gas station who's making the money. It's the corporate execs in a vertically integrated industry which they're manipulating. The same way that Enron manipulated the energy markets in California to drive up the price, Big Oil is doing it and they're doing it in the western United States right today and across America. They're building up toward that orgy of price gouging that happens every year around Memorial Day and during the summer driving season. And they say, ``Oh, these are just market forces.'' These are not market forces and this government needs to address this in a number of ways. 
   We need to file a complaint against OPEC. The gentleman before me mentioned them. They get together, they collude, they decide to constrain the price and drive up the price of crude oil. That's where this all starts. Well, it just happens that a number of the major OPEC producers are in the World Trade Organization. Our President, a big free trader, wants rules-based trade. Well, guess what, the rules don't allow OPEC to do that. But will this President file a complaint against OPEC? No. I have written to him a number of times and said, President Bush, they're violating the World Trade Organization. File a complaint. People complain about the United States there all the time. Why don't we use that tool to benefit our consumers. No, the President refuses to do that. My bill would force the President to file legitimate complaints and break up the OPEC cartel. That would help. But then we have got to go after the big oil companies themselves. Impose a windfall profits tax on these companies, unless they are investing in expanding refinery capacity--which they cut in order to increase the profitability--exploration or alternative fuels. Make our vehicles more efficient. Give incentives to consumers to buy more efficient vehicles. Mandate new fleet fuel economy standards. Put a ban on more mergers by the oil industry. In fact, my bill would name a commission to investigate the market power of Big Oil and maybe we have to think about breaking them up and turning this back into a somewhat competitive industry. 
   Yes, we need to move toward a more energy-efficient future, but we don't need to be price-gouged on the way to that goal. And that's what is happening today. 
   So I am introducing a package of bills oriented toward market manipulation, price gouging by Big Oil and OPEC, and also bills that would give consumers an incentive and actually help consumers to purchase more efficient vehicles in the interim and also push Detroit and other manufacturers toward making more efficient vehicles. They won't go there until we push them. We had a big fight over fleet fuel economy standards. I am very sympathetic to American workers. I remember the guys in from Ford, and they said, You don't understand. The execs told us, if you make them make more efficient vehicles, they'll lay us off. Guess what: They all got laid off because Ford didn't make more efficient vehicles. 
   It's time for some action on the part of this Congress and this government to defend American consumers and lead us toward a more energy-efficient future without being price-gouged on the way there.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 2262, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007, introduced by my good friend, Chairman Rahall. In 1991, I introduced the Mining Law Reform Act of 1991, which was very similar to the legislation that we are considering today. The following year, I introduced an amendment to another mining reform bill--also introduced by Chairman Rahall--that would have put a 12.5 percent royalty on hardrock minerals mined on Federal public lands. It is beyond belief that for the past 135 years, the law has allowed these minerals to be extracted with no royalty paid to the American people, unlike the royalties paid by oil, gas, and coal developers. 
   So, I am very familiar with the issues involved in hardrock mining and the efforts to reform the antiquated 1872 mining law. 
   Unfortunately, none of these previous measures became law. Today, however, we have a real chance at mining reform. I am glad for that. 
   H.R. 2262 is a vast improvement over the 1872 mining law that currently guides mineral development on our public lands. Still, it could be improved further. 
   In the markup of this bill held by the Natural Resources Committee, I offered an amendment that would have clarified that the royalty  provisions of H.R. 2262 do not apply to small miners, many of whom reside in my district in Oregon. The Bureau of Land Management estimates that there are approximately 3,400 small miners in Oregon that hold 10 or fewer claims, who engage in casual use of the public lands for hand panning, nonmotorized sluicing, and other small, recreational mining activities. Unfortunately, my amendment was not approved by the committee, although Chairman Rahall agreed to work with me to address my concerns. 
   I intended to offer the same amendment to H.R. 2262 here today on the floor, to do just that. The Rules Committee, however, did not make my amendment in order. Therefore, I rise today to speak on this issue. 
   I am told by Chairman Rahall and his staff that the underlying bill does not apply to recreational miners, or those miners engaged in casual use of the public lands; i.e., those mining activities that do not ordinarily result in any disturbance of public lands and resources. Sections 302 and 304 of H.R. 2622 indicate that miners engaged in casual use do not have to get a permit to mine, and section 103 states that miners who hold less than 10 claims are exempt from paying the maintenance fee required under the act. 
   I am told that this language, combined with existing regulations, means that recreational miners are not subject to the royalty provisions of H.R. 2622. I remain unconvinced that this is the case, which is why I wanted to offer my amendment. If it is true that small miners are not covered by this legislation, then adding clarifying language should not have been a problem. If the bill is in fact unclear, my amendment would have clarified it. In addition, my amendment would have addressed concerns raised by Chairman Rahall that exempting small miners from royalty payments was a slippery slope, and that the exemption would have reduced revenues to the Federal Government. Nevertheless, I was not permitted to offer my amendment. 
   Therefore, let me be clear now, it is not my intention that the royalty provisions of H.R. 2622--specifically, section 102 of the legislation--apply to small recreational miners engaged in casual use of the public lands for mining. Hand panning, the use of hand tools, and other similar activities that work public lands for enjoyment or to supplement one's income is a time-honored tradition in this country, and explicitly anticipated by a variety of Federal laws governing the multiple use of these lands. While a revamp of the 1872 mining law is more than overdue, including placing royalties on the minerals extracted from Federal lands, we must ensure that small, recreational mining opportunities are not lost. My amendment would have guaranteed protection for small miners. I am disappointed that I was unable to offer it today. 
   I have made my concerns known to my colleagues in the Senate, and have provided them with copies of my amendment. When this legislation reaches their Chamber, I will call on them to ensure that small miners are not subject to the royalty provisions of this bill. Until then, I will reserve my judgment on whether I will support a final conference report on mining reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this issue and for bringing this both to the attention of the House and the American people. Obviously, we don't need to do much to communicate the level of concern with people at home and in our districts, or even in hundreds of counties scattered across America. 
   In fact, across America, over 4,400 rural schools in 40 States will lose funding if this legislation is not reauthorized. 4,400 rural school districts. You can bet most of those rural school districts are already hurting trying to provide the next generation of young Americans with a good education. In some counties all the rural schools will be closed due to a lack of funding if this legislation is not reauthorized. 
   My colleague from Oregon already talked earlier about the highly publicized search and rescue that went on back at the end of last year, the beginning of this year, for the Kim family. You know, this is not, this was a difficult search and rescue mission, since we didn't know where that family was. They were difficult to locate until later they were found by high-tech tech means. 
   But the fact is that we will not even have the capability to begin those searches in many counties in southern Oregon and, indeed, across the West and some other parts of the country if this legislation is not reauthorized. Deputy sheriffs are already receiving layoff notices. Counties don't have the same fiscal year as they have here in Washington D.C. 
   For many counties, the money authorized last October is going to run out about 3 months into their next fiscal year, so we have to begin now to send out layoff notices. We will have hundreds of thousands of square miles of the western United States with no rural law enforcement. What a mecca for meth dealers, organized crime and other criminal elements, potentially even terrorists, if our counties cannot support basic rural law enforcement services; 780 rural counties will lose funding for roads, roads that provide the movement of the trees to the mills that provide the movement of Americans to recreate in 
   their great public lands. Those funds would dramatically cut and in some cases almost eliminate it. 
   Yes, we are talking about a lot of money here, you are right. It is a lot of money where I come from. It is a lot of money for most Americans: $400 million a year is invested in counties and rural schools across America, and the return is many times that. 
   Let me talk about an element of something we haven't talked about yet. It is not just critical services, not just schools, not just law enforcement, not just search and rescue. It is actually benefits to the public lands. Here on chart 1, I have before and after photos of hazardous fuels reduction near Eureka, California, in an at-risk community adjacent to public lands in northern California, obviously before, after. That will cut fire fighting costs, it will save lives, it will save resources. 
   Here we have another that depicts peeled logs that are being used for temporary utility poles, actually in the southeastern United States after the Katrina disaster. Again, these came out of a watershed improvement program, a fuel reduction program, funded by these payments. 
   Then finally I have here, yes, economic diversification, local economic development, small investments in peeling logs and creating posts here at the Hayfork South Highway Three Fuels Reduction Project in California. 
   So these investments benefit the resource. So we are not just talking about crucial public services. We are also talking about money that we have put back into the resources. We live there. We know how valuable these resources are. We want to save them and improve them for future generations; but without these funds, some of that investment will be put at risk.

And yet at that time, in a county this size, and we have to relate this to our colleagues back here, they cannot understand how big our districts are, a county which is just one of my counties, the size of the State of Connecticut had no rural law enforcement patrols outside of contract deputies and a couple of small communities, a county the size of the State of Connecticut.

   Now, some people will say, look, why don't these counties just suck it up and take care of their own problems, raise the taxes? Well, in Oregon, our local property tax structure is dictated by the State because of a property tax initiative similar to the one that passed in California. The local commissioners do not have any options when it comes to that. 
   Now, if Curry County was going to grow its way out of this problem, a county that today has 12,000 houses valued at about $250,000 each, they would have to add 35,000 houses valued at $350,000 each, quadruple the size of the county. And, unfortunately, since they are constrained by public lands----

There would no longer be a rural law enforcement, which obviously jeopardizes the traveling public and, again, raises the potential, as the gentleman from southern Oregon who represents also eastern  Oregon pointed out, of a vacuum into which some of these gangs that are highly organized in this country, some of which have come across the border from Mexico could infiltrate for methamphetamine production or even growing marijuana.

This legislation would protect some of the last remaining stands of Port-Orford-cedar in the Elk River watershed, which has the distinction as one of the most productive salmon and steelhead rivers outside of Alaska. This is rugged, wild territory, and I am hopeful that it may finally become wilderness in the 110th Congress: 
   Renowned among fishermen, the Elk River watershed is one of the last intact watersheds on the southwest Oregon Coast and is widely regarded as Oregon's last, best coastal salmon and steelhead stream. Oregon State University researchers have concluded that the Elk River is one of the healthiest habitats in the lower 48 states for anadromous fish, and the stream is home to chinook salmon, winter steelhead, coho salmon, cutthroat trout, and rainbow trout. 
   One of the things about this legislation about which I am most proud is that diverse stakeholders have been working together for more than a decade to gain broad support for protecting the Copper Salmon area. H.R. 3513 enjoys backing from Curry County Commissioners, local elected officials, the local Chamber of Commerce, hunting and fishing groups, tribes, the timber industry, and all local conservation groups. This is a model for the community-based consensus approach to designating wilderness. 
   Copper Salmon is truly a rare coastal Oregon gem. It is almost entirely intact ancient forest, which supports healthy fish runs and great elk herds, blacktailed deer, bears, and other wildlife. It is adjacent to the existing Grassy Knob Wilderness, and combined, these two areas will be one of the largest intact areas of forest in the Coast Range. This is an area that deserves protection for the enjoyment of future generations. 
   I am a proud advocate of protecting the Copper Salmon area, and urge my colleagues to join me in the passage of H.R. 3513, the Copper Salmon Wilderness Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, the simple answer to Mr. Flake is, this saves the taxpayers money. And I know that is a concern to the gentleman. 
   We have here certified breeding stock that was donated to the Government of the United States of America by the Australian Customs Service that has a great line of dogs that are easily trained and have a low failure rate once they reach maturity. 
   The gentleman obviously doesn't know much about dogs. And in fact, I would say there might even be a security risk. There are not a lot of breeders in the U.S. who are training for this specific purpose. In fact, many police agencies now have to buy their dogs from Germany. 
   Remember the Hamburg cell? Do you want them infiltrating our dog program, maybe with secret German commands that we don't know? I mean, come on. This is a national security issue, to have a little fun with the gentleman. 
   But the point is, these dogs are great stock. It is less expensive. They go to a foster home for a year. That isn't a year that you would have to pay for with a breeder, and then they get their final training. They have a very low failure rate. That again saves money for the program. 
   We are saving money here. We are providing a vital service. The gentleman doesn't strike the previous section of the bill, 201, which requires a dramatic increase in dogs for the program, which is fully warranted because they are extraordinarily effective deterrents, and they are very good at detecting problems, explosives, drugs and other contraband. 
   So I would say that the gentleman really should withdraw his amendment if he is interested in saving the taxpayers money. Privatization for private profits' sake is not the way to serve our taxpayers and our security well in this matter.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   First, to correct the gentleman, it is not a new program. It is an ongoing program. 
   However, we are going to add an element. No longer will it just be competitive. It will be risk-based. 
   Now, he is true. On the Republican watch, when they controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House, there were scandalous and wasteful expenditures of funds by the early startup of the Department of Homeland Security, which actually I opposed creating that giant new bureaucracy. I thought we could have done it in a much more effective way. 
   However, I serve on the committee now that has jurisdiction over that. We are cleaning up the mess you guys created. This is a risk-based program. It is competitive. 
   Now, are we are telling the 800 million people a year who ride buses in the U.S. they are third or fourth class? The gentleman says it is a private undertaking; they shouldn't even be able to get risk-based competitive grants. Well, would you abandon aviation security, too? That is also a private industry. Rail? Well, most of that is private, with the exception of Amtrak. All of maritime is private, so I guess we will sort of abandon the ports. 
   If you follow that principle to its illogical conclusion, we would not spend public taxpayer dollars to defend any mode of transportation in this country, with very narrow exceptions. That is not the criteria that we need to apply here: risk-based, competitive. 
   Now, what happened after 9/11? How did people get around the country? We need alternate modes. 
   An important Federal official was here on 9/11. He had to get back to Oregon. He took Amtrak. Other people took the bus system. So you have got to understand redundancy. You have got to understand risk. And, hopefully, we will provide the oversight that was lacking before to make sure that we don't have any more of those scandalous things that he talked about. Those are the past. That was on the all-Republican watch. We will do better.

We are still confronted with the Bush administration. But I feel that the new TSA administrator is the best we have ever had, and let's give him the tools he needs to do his job properly. Risk-based, competitive grants. If he doesn't find there is risk in the intercity bus service, then he shouldn't give out the grants. I think he will find plenty of meritorious, risk-based, competitive grants that will help better protect the traveling public in this vital mode of transportation.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. George Bush and the Republicans have spent our country to the verge of bankruptcy. They have doubled our foreign debt. They have increased our national debt by 60 percent. George Bush has accumulated more debt than every President who preceded him in the United States of America and they have done it on the credit card. 
   And guess who is going to get the bill in their world after they eliminate taxes for the wealthy? It's going to be the middle class, and they're going to get hit twice. They're going to get the bill, and their kids and grandkids are going to get the bill. And the programs that middle-income Americans need like tuition assistance for their kids to go to college, the Bushies cut those. That's their sense of fiscal responsibility. 
   The other side over here, the gentleman from North Carolina is saying, oh, the largest tax increase in history. 
   No. We're allowing the tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, people who earn over $250,000 a year, people who have estates worth more than $5 million, we're asking that once again they pay their fair share. There will not be a penny increase on middle-income families. They can make up anything they want, but it's not true. 
   But, yes, the wealthy would pay a little bit more. That's why they're squealing so much, because the Republicans get their money from the wealthy to try and maintain control of our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, on our side of the aisle the Democrats over the last 3 years have identified some gaping holes in our Nation's security, even in aviation where we have spent the most money. You can do it in two ways: you can have state-of-the-art equipment and not a lot of people, or a lot of people and not very good equipment, or a mix of the two. 
   The Republicans have chosen to do neither. They haven't been willing to buy the equipment we need: state-of-the-art explosives detection equipment at passenger checkpoints. They haven't been willing to invest in the inline screening for baggage, and they put a totally arbitrary cap on the number of screeners. There are gaping holes. We are going to plug those. A quarter of a billion dollars for explosives screening at passenger checkpoints, a known threat. A billion dollars for inline screening which the Republicans have refused to fund. 
   For 4 years, airports across America have begged for inline screening grants. None have been forthcoming from the Republicans. They are saying they have taken care of everything in such a great bipartisan way. 
   Now my friend from Florida got up and waxed poetic about San Francisco and said it was due to two things: private screeners and inline screening. Well, the inline equipment I agree with him, and we are going to fund it, unlike the majority. We will install it in every airport in America. 
   But I disagree on the privatized screening because actually it turns out now that the private screeners at San Francisco were tipped off before the inspectors came through. They don't do any better, and maybe would do worse without those tips, than our public employees. We are going to give them the tools they need. 
   On containers, Assistant Secretary Michael Jackson said they want to screen every container before they leave a U.S. port for the interior. Why? Because they might contain threats. 
   And we said, What does that make our ports, a sacrifice zone if they have a nuclear weapon contained in them? 
   We want to screen containers on the other side of the ocean. Now we hear people on that side get up and say hundreds of billions of dollars to screen these containers. Actually, it is 30 to $50 per container. There are 11 million containers. That is somewhere between 300 and $500 million a year, paid for by a modest fee on the shippers, not by the taxpayers of America. 
   We are going to make America more secure. We are going to plug the holes you left in our security and fix the problem.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. It's a beautiful day within the D.C. beltway. And under the dome, another day, another free trade agreement. But on Main Street America, things are not so bright. The dollar is dropping like a rock with skyrocketing oil and gas prices. 
   We are borrowing $2 billion a day from overseas to buy things that we don't make here in America anymore. We have lost 5 million manufacturing jobs, 40,000 in Oregon. But this isn't the same old failed trade policy, they tell us. Not yet another platform to exploit cheap labor. It is decorated with negligible evironmental and labor protections. 
   And the burgeoning middle class in Peru, all three of them, are going to go on an orgy of buying U.S. goods after this passes. But the destructive, multinational, corporate-written chapter 11 core that led to the failure of NAFTA, CAFTA and other trade agreements remains at the center of this policy. 
   This agreement is by, for and about Wall Street, plain and simple. It doesn't address our current economic crisis. It is not in the best interest of American workers, the U.S. economy, or our national security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I realize that the other side is reserving a point of order on this because of a previous objection to an amendment which would have allocated $425 million into the Safe and Secure Rural Schools program, a program which I very much support. I am on the authorizing committee and I can assure them that the authorizing committee is determined to move forward on, one of the authorizing committees at least, in the near future. In the last Congress, the Resources Committee did act and the Agriculture Committee did not on reauthorizing this program. 
   So we are engaging in that process in good faith and hope to be working with our friends on the Appropriations Committee in the not-too-distant future to extend this program for a number of years as we phase it down. 
   But in the interim, the Appropriations Committee and this Congress did, in the emergency supplemental, approve 1 year of temporary funding, which was excellent. It staved off disasters in county after county in terms of closed jails, loss of rural sheriffs patrols and many, many other vital services. 
   But, unfortunately, in doing that there was an oversight, and it is a simple oversight, easily rectified if there is not an objection. One of the most beneficial parts for the Federal taxpayers generally beyond the services that are provided within the counties and school districts across America is the Resource Advisory Committees, committees made up of a broad cross-section of communities across the Western United States, both environmental, timber interests, general community members, who have come forward, worked collaboratively, and have put 15 percent of the funds under the program, reinvested it back into the Federal lands, providing tremendous benefits ecologically to those lands, economically, in terms of thinning projects and other things, things that were not within the budget of the United States Forest Service or the Department of the Interior in the case of the O&C lands. 
   Unfortunately, since these committees, which are widely applauded in a bipartisan way across the Western United States, were not reauthorized, this language simply would give them authorization to monitor the ongoing activities. 
   It is extraordinarily noncontroversial, and it would be extraordinarily regrettable if in some sort of a misplaced tit for tat there was an objection to this bipartisan amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden).

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. My amendment presents the Members with a very simple choice: Do we want to continue to fund a government agency whose mission is obsolete, and whose expertise the President, the Pentagon and the House have all said will never be called upon, or do you want to fund a program that has a presence in every State in the Union and the territories, and helps small businesses, creates jobs and returns $2.82 in Federal revenue for every dollar invested? 
   Seems a simple choice to me. Perhaps not, but we'll see when we get to the vote. 
   Thirty years ago Jimmy Carter created and reactivated the Selective Service System. Now, he said this was symbolic, to send a message to the Soviet Union which had invaded Afghanistan. Well, today the United States of America is in Afghanistan in pursuit of the Taliban and al Qaeda and attempting to pacify that country. Surely that symbolism is no longer needed. 
   No one, no one in this House, two people, in fact, the last time we voted, said they wanted to reinstitute the draft. No one downtown at the administration says they want to reinstitute the draft. No one at the Pentagon says, under any scenario, that they envision reinstituting the draft. They prefer the All-Volunteer Force. 
   So if we were to transfer $10 million from this obsolete, Cold War, symbolic bureaucracy which has no function in today's society, in today's world, and is not necessary for today's readiness, we could create tens of thousands of jobs across America and assist small businesses to begin to create even more jobs. 
   I believe it's a very simple choice: $10 million from Selective Service, and add  $10 million to the SBDC. The Congressional Budget Office says it's budget-neutral. There are 1,100 SBDC offices, all 50 States, DC., Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They're a collaborative effort. This is not a bureaucracy. This is not dumping money into the maw of Washington, DC. 
   State, local governments, the private sector and education community serve more than 1.3 million small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs a year. Every Federal dollar, as I said earlier, invested in Small Business Development Corporations yields $2.82 in additional revenue to the Treasury. A new business is opened by an SBDC in-depth client every 33 minutes in the United States of America. Our entrepreneurs need this help. 
   Similarly, these clients create a new job every 7 minutes and generate $100,000 in sales every 9 minutes. What a great return on a Federal investment, to help American entrepreneurs put people to work in this country and make us competitive in the international community. 
   In my home State of Oregon, the SBDC has created 3,300 new jobs, generated new wages of more than $53 million. The SBDC has served more than 6,000 small businesses in Oregon alone. Across the Nation those numbers are obviously much larger. 
   The Association of Small Business Development Centers requested funding of $110 million for SBDCs for fiscal year 2008. That would essentially provide a catch-up for all the years in which their budget was restrained or cut by the previous Congress and the administration. That could create 110,000 new jobs, save an additional 110,000 jobs, and make $11.7 billion in new sales, preserve $8.4 billion in existing sales, and obtain $4.5 billion in financing to grow businesses, and generate $310 million in new Federal revenues for economic growth. 
   This, I believe, is a great investment in America. We do not need to continue dumping maw down the bureaucracy of the Selective Service System. They've been incompetent since day 1. Commercial databases could better provide the data we need if ever a draft were needed. And even if a draft were needed, guess what? We have no training capacity, so the people who were drafted would have to wait 6 months to a year in any case. 
   So we don't need an active, on-the-edge Selective Service System in this country for a draft that no longer exists and only two Members of the previous Congress thought should exist. 
   I believe this is a commonsense amendment. Put Selective Service in deep stand-by and help the Small Business Development Corporation live up to its full potential creating jobs and economic potential for this country. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I will leave it to the gentleman from Tennessee to carry the major part of this legislation for which he is responsible, but I would just like to reflect on it for a moment. 
   I think it's very telling that we are here to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Tennessee Valley Authority, something that was created by Congress and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the Great Depression. They had a little different philosophy back then. 
   It wasn't shower money on Wall Street and hope things get better for people on Main Street and around the country; it was invest in America, invest in our infrastructure, build dams, roads, bridges, WPA projects. My region is a tremendous beneficiary from something called the Bonneville Power Administration, a wonderful gift that is still paying dividends to the American people that was key in our World War II effort and was there for the aluminum plants and for our nuclear weapons development to end the war. 
   This is a different philosophy. Today, unfortunately, we seem to be going down the path that the way to fix the economic problems on Main Street in America is to shower money on Wall Street, buy up their bad investments and hope maybe someday taxpayers get their money back. 
   What if we took the $250 billion they are talking about as an initial down payment on this faulty plan and we doubled our investment in our roads, bridges, highways and transit in America? Would that put more people back to work? Would that instill more confidence in the American economy? Would that maybe even drive up the value of stocks on Wall Street? I think so. 
   I think it's incredibly appropriate that Mr. Cohen has brought this bill here to the floor today, and I thank him for doing that.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. The problem with what Congress is trying to fix is that Paulson's premise is wrong, that if we take and dump $700 billion into Wall Street, buying up their bad assets, somehow the benefits will trickle down to Main Street and prop up our struggling housing market. As Mr. Isaac, the former head of the FDIC says, ``Having financial institutions sell the loans to the government at inflated prices so the government can turn around and sell the loans to well-healed investors at lower prices strikes me as a very good deal for everyone but U.S. taxpayers. Surely we can do better.'' He proposes a credible alternative, similar to something done during the savings and loan crisis. 
   There are many cheaper alternatives out there that don't put taxpayers on the hook. But if we are going to go ahead with the Paulson premise, then it should be paid for by Wall Street with a modest one-quarter of 1 percent transfer tax on securities, something we had from 1914 until 1966. The Brits apply a one-half of 1 percent tax, and they use that money just to fund their government. Here we would use it to help Wall Street heal itself. 
   Some are saying, well, the initial payment is only going to be $250 billion now. $250 billion would double our investment in infrastructure in the United States for 5 years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Last Saturday, September 6, marked a dark day in the transportation history and the safety of the traveling public in the United States of America. It was the 1-year anniversary of the so-called cross-border demonstration project of the Department of Transportation under the Bush administration. 
   When this pilot program began, 1 year and 5 days ago, they assured us it would be a 1-year pilot. They further assured us that they would fully evaluate the program before opening our border to all Mexican trucks. Unfortunately, Secretary Peters, under the tutelage of the Bush administration, announced last month that they intend to continue the program for two more years. 
   You know, given the fact that they have ignored Congress' will on this issue repeatedly, I wasn't surprised. But I am outraged. I am outraged that the Bush administration, for political purposes, would jeopardize the safety of the traveling public in the United States of America. 
   Since the beginning of this idea in the Bush administration, there has been strong and bipartisan congressional objection to the program. There are a number of concerns regarding Mexico's less stringent or nonexistent regulations on hours of service, vehicle safety, driver training and licensing, their nonexistent commercial driver's license database, or the meaningless database that they contend is a registration of commercial driver's licenses, and the fact that there is not  one single certified drug testing laboratory in Mexico. 
   And I am further concerned that our government, under the leadership of the Bush administration, has said that, don't worry; they'll take care of all of these problems at the border. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will inspect every truck every time, or so they purport. 
   There are questions about whether or not they're delivering on that pledge. There are also certainly questions of diverting our already inadequate force of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration officials, officers to the border to just inspect the trucks of a few Mexican companies that want to drive long distance in the United States. 
   The House has already voiced opposition on the implementation of this pilot program in three separate pieces of legislation: H.R. 1773, the Safe American Roads Act of 2007, which the House passed in May 2007 by an overwhelming vote of 411-3, and we'll hear a little bit later from the author of that legislation. 
   Provisions were also included in the 2007 Iraq war supplemental spending bill to impose strict measures to ensure the pilot program adheres to safety and security guidelines. 
   And then finally, last December, Congress included a provision in the 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act to prohibit DOT from using funds to, unfortunately, using the Senate's language instead of ours, establish a cross-border motor carrier program. The Bush administration argues that it was already established and they are just continuing it. The legislation that the House had passed would not have allowed them to parse those words and to continue to violate what is the very clear intent to Congress, despite the bungling of the wording by the Senate. 
   Because of DOT's blatant disregard of congressional intent, I introduced this bill, H.R. 6630, in July, to ensure the Mexican truck pilot is terminated, and that the results are fully evaluated before the program is either expanded or continued, and to reassert the authority of Congress in this matter. So this is something that should be virtually noncontroversial in this House, this House having spoken previously on this issue, this House being, on a bipartisan basis, fully concerned with the safety of the traveling American public, unlike the administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to point out that I believe that this is a long-standing desire on the part of both the President--whose name shall not be mentioned at least on the Republican side of the aisle--George W. Bush and other members of his administration. In fact, as early as December 26, 1996, the headline  of the Journal of Commerce, Texas, ``Governor Berates Clinton Over Delay in Border Opening.'' And then June 17, 1996, Texas Governor George W. Bush, now the President of the United States, issues a call for the start of NAFTA trucking. 
   George W. Bush has long been an advocate of fully opening the border. In fact, before 9/11 he wanted to move to a borderless state between the U.S. and Mexico. Security concerns overrode him there. But he's trying to do it with trucks. 
   And hand-in-glove with the President is Secretary of Transportation, Mary Peters. Her track record on this is disingenuous at best, deceitful, or perhaps she perjured herself. She said in her Senate confirmation hearing, ``There are no immediate plans to pursue a pilot program.'' 
   But since she made that statement, we find that while she was head of the Federal Highway Administration from 2001 to 2005, plans were well underway by the Bush administration to open the border. It was first raised in the fall of 2004 between former Secretary Mineta and Mexican Secretary Cerisola in November of 2004. 
   And in early 2005, DOT actually was crafting a proposal. In a document entitled, ``Implementing NAFTA's Commercial Motor Carrier access Provisions--A Pilot Approach,'' outlined early plans for pilot programming. And it said, ``The essence of a pilot would be to create a crack in the current impasse and allow the pressure of time, and most importantly, the Mexican carriers not participating in the pilot, to enlarge the crack, to a point that a complete liberalization of the border becomes a fait accompli.'' 
   They used French despite their disdain for the French position of not invading Iraq. 
   However, you know, as I said, Ms. Peters contradicted that. 
   So what we have here is an administration that is dead set to defy the will of the United States Congress as expressed in a bipartisan way to protect the safety of the American traveling public and to prevent the continuation and/or expansion of this program. 
   We should, Mr. Speaker, pass this bill with hopefully a unanimous vote or near unanimous vote to send yet one last message to this Bush administration and the law defiers and the dissemblers downtown and tell them to bring this program to a halt as they promised. It would have halted on September 6, 2007. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I had hoped to restrict this debate to the failings of the Republican Bush administration in protecting the safety of the American traveling public and the jobs of American truckers. Unfortunately, the gentlelady before us apparently has amnesia because she forgets that the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House for 6 years. And during those 6 years, Vice President Cheney wrote an energy policy in secret with the big oil companies.     
   George Bush walked hand-in-hand with the King of Saudi Arabia, and they designed a policy. That policy that was actually designed to make us more dependent on foreign oil rather than less, and many of us who opposed it then in the minority said this is not a solution to America's energy problems. You are going to make us more dependent on foreign oil, and we are, exactly as was designed by Vice President Cheney, endorsed by President Bush and passed by the Republican House and the Republican Senate. That's the energy policy we're living under, that. 
   Now, today, they're born again as defenders of the American consumers, and they pocket hundreds of millions--sorry, hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars in contributions from Big Oil. They want to rush forward yet again with a shortsighted policy while giving lip service to a long-term solution to our energy needs. 
   We will have a comprehensive bill on the floor later this week, and we will see where the Republicans really stand on this issues. Do they stand with the American people, with American consumers? Will they look forward to the future and finally freeing us from the trial and enslavement to the OPEC nations? We will see later this week. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman for returning to the subject at hand, which is the safety of the traveling public and American jobs which the Bush administration would disregard by continuing their pilot program, violating their promise to only continue the program as a pilot for 1 year, 1 year having expired last Saturday, further violating and ignoring the intent of the Congress which has on numerous occasions expressed concerns regarding this program and its effect on the traveling public. 
   So I would hope that, on a bipartisan basis, we can send a message to the Bush White House by passing this bill unanimously, or nearly unanimously, and say that the Congress cares about the safety of the traveling public. The Congress cares about the fact there's no meaningful commercial driver's license database in Mexico. We don't really know who these people are. 
   The Congress cares about the fact that there is no meaningful hours of service program in Mexico and that many of these drivers may be crossing the border fatigued to the point of endangering public safety. 
   The Congress cares about the fact that there is no certified drug testing laboratory in Mexico, no meaningful program of testing for drugs of truck drivers in Mexico. 
   The Congress cares about the potential for insurance fraud and other things as mentioned by our colleague from California (Mr. Filner). 
   And the Congress is determined that this administration, the administration of George W. Bush, this Republican administration, should stop violating the law and violating the law and jeopardizing the American public for their own ideological ends in their hope that they can pry this program open wide enough that a future Congress or a future administration won't be able to slam it shut again.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, you have got to admit it's a great system. The oil companies fill the Republican coffers with campaign contributions, and the Republicans pretend that they care about consumers while the Republicans stonewall steps to rein in price-gouging market speculation. 
   Remember the Enron loophole? That's 50 cents a gallon at the pump today. Ken Lay is dead, but it lives on. 
   They are protecting OPEC against World Trade Organization complaints that the President refuses to sign. He goes over and holds hands with the Saudi princes, but he won't file a complaint against market collusion. 
   Refineries, you are right. We have got a shortage. ExxonMobil says they are doing just fine. They have no plans to build a refinery. They are making obscene profits, 6,492 leases, no development. Eighty percent of the Outer Continental Shelf reserves are available, no plans to drill. Naval Petroleum Reserve, it is 8 years since Clinton leased it, zero percent production. There is a sea of oil under it. 
   Market forces, 11 bucks in 1 day for a barrel of oil, while consumption is way down in the U.S. It's not market forces, it's collusion and price gouging. The Bush-Cheney Republican caucus and the OPEC cartel are doing just fine the way things are. They pretend they want change, but they don't.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, here we have the Republicans engaging in fuzzy math again. 
   Unlike the eight budgets submitted by George Bush, which are taking this country toward bankruptcy, they're so incredibly out of balance, unlike the 12 budgets given to us by the Republican majority here, this budget gets us to balance by 2012. And guess what? It has nothing to do with the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, it's not an issue in the budget. You want to have that debate, let's have that debate in the Resources Committee and other appropriate venues. 
   But if you want to have that debate, I've got a few things to say. I serve on the Resources Committee. We have 6,669 leases that are out there with the oil and gas industry that aren't producing; 30 million acres of land that's covered by that and offshore. We have nearly a quarter of a million acres in the Naval Petroleum Reserve. Bill Clinton leased our Naval Petroleum Reserve to the oil industry. Guess what? They're not yet developing the Naval Petroleum Reserve. There is a tremendous amount to be developed there. But you want to jump and leapfrog somewhere else for imaginary bits of oil. 
   Under the most optimistic estimates, there's 100 days in ANWR. Now, we could do better if every American properly inflated the tires on their cars and their trucks and their SUVs. Try and find an air pump these days, they're darn hard to find. You want to do something? Let's have a Federal program to put air pumps out there and get people to fully inflate their tires. There is a sustainable way to cut demand. But the fantasy of ANWR, which the Republicans want to engage in, is to distract us from the speculation, the profiteering by the oil companies, speculation of the commodity markets driving up prices 50 cents a gallon--legislation they passed for Enron, now bankrupt and defunct. And then we have the issue of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We have come together on a bipartisan basis to say let's lower the price of gas at the pump by not buying the most expensive oil in history. They don't agree with us on going after the OPEC countries. 
   So, you know, let's not talk about something that's potentially 10 years out, that doesn't have anything to do with the budget. Let's talk about real measures on energy. And let's talk about a real budget to get this country back on the path to fiscal sustainability and responsibility.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, the presumptive Republican nominee for President, John McCain, wasn't kidding when he said he didn't understand the economy. He has proposed a gas tax holiday. Now let's think about it for a minute. Gas today costs three times as much as it did in 1993, but the Federal gas tax hasn't changed since 1993. So what is the cause of the big run-up? 
   Well, it might be the $40 billion record profit at ExxonMobil and the $400 million exit given to their last CEO. That might be part of it. 
   It might be the OPEC cartel colluding to drive up the price of oil and restrict demand. Or it could be the hedge fund speculators and others on Wall Street driving up the cost unnecessarily so they can make money. 
   But the nominee of the Grand Oil Party, the GOP, he's not going to take on Big Oil. He's not going to take on Wall Street. He's not going to take on OPEC. What he is going to do is cut Federal investment in our crumbling infrastructure, put hundreds of thousands of construction workers out of jobs, and condemn even more Americans to being jammed on congested highways that need improvement and bridges that are collapsing where we don't have the money to rebuild.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, there is no ban on offshore oil drilling. In fact, there are 33.5 million acres offshore leased to the oil industry from which they are extracting nothing and they are not developing. They say, well, they don't have the drill bits or they don't have the time or whatever. The Republicans say they need more leases. 
   They don't need more leases. They need to develop what is out there, plain and simple. Think of the former Naval Petroleum Reserve. It is right up there in Alaska next to ANWR, 13.4 billion barrels of known reserves, drilled and capped by the oil industry, leased by Bill Clinton, not producing a single drop. 
   But, oh, let's go to ANWR. There might be some there. 
   Come on, guys. They are not developing what they have now. There is a 20-year supply out there underneath their idle leases that could double our domestic production, and, plain and simple, they haven't developed it. Then when they are done with that, then we can have a debate about more leasing in other places.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I agree with the gentleman. We should be doing more drilling in the United States. The oil companies should begin to develop the 6,391 offshore leases they already have that are environmentally approved, that are sitting idle, but the industry is not moving to develop those leases despite the vast resources available. In fact,  the estimates of the Minerals Management Service are that they could access 80 percent of the available oil off the shores of the United States of America from their existing leases. They just don't want to do it. Now, why might that be? 
   Well, maybe it has something to do with their making piles of money the way it is. So why would they want to provide relief to the American consumer by cutting into their obscene profits? 
   Second, there's some pressure on that side to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. There may be a fair amount of oil under there. We don't really know. There was one exploratory well drilled 30-some-odd years ago. Proprietary. No one knows. But we do know that right next-door to the west of the pipeline is a vast area that used to be called the Naval Petroleum Reserve. Why was it called that? Because we know there is a huge amount of oil under there. We've known that for 70 years. In fact, Bill Clinton, as President, decided to lease that to the industry to bring on line over 10 billion barrels of oil, of U.S. oil, for the American people. 
   Now, first, of course, we have to do away with the little loophole the Republicans created when they allowed the ban on the export of Alaska oil to lapse. I have a bill, and I've had a bill for a number of years to reinstate a bill on the ban of the export of Alaska oil. 
   But how about that known 10-billion-barrel reserve? The oil industry has drilled 25 exploratory wells and then has capped them, and they have no plans to provide transit from there to the existing pipeline, which is just to the east of that reserve. 
   So how about the industry takes some of the 20-30 billion barrels that are available off of their existing leases that could double our domestic supply for the next 20 years and then develop that? Then we can talk about more leases or, hopefully, by then, we will have transited into a new energy future that isn't going to require the same massive amounts of oil that the current economy requires. 
   There is something else the Republicans have left out. Had we started down a new energy path after 9/11, the lesson there would have been we don't want to be dependent upon the Middle East and Saudi Arabia. Most of those were Saudis who attacked us. 
   Who's giving hundreds of billions of dollars a year to the Saudis? Well, unfortunately, American consumers are, and we're dependent upon them, and the President goes over and begs for oil. Even though they're violating international law, he won't file complaints against them. We treat them with kid gloves. We need to be free of those people, so we need to be looking toward a different energy future, but in the short term, we don't need to be price-gouged, which brings up a third point which the Republicans don't want to address. 
   It's estimated that 50 cents of every gallon today is pure speculation for Wall Street. We could do away with that by closing the Enron loophole. Remember Ken-Boy Lay, the President's principal financier throughout his political career? He's dead now. Ken-Boy ran Enron. He wrote our energy policy behind closed doors with Dick Cheney. Enron is bankrupt, but the Enron loophole lives on, and other major firms on Wall Street--Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and others--are now fully utilizing that loophole. 
   According to today's Washington Times, 99 percent of the premium crude in America is controlled not by ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and others but by Wall Street and futures speculation. They're making a pile of money at the cost to American consumers. So let's close that loophole. But, no, the Republicans never want to take on Big Oil and make them do what they should do, which is to develop existing leases which they're sitting on, and they don't want to take on Wall Street and close the loophole that was created for Enron's Ken-Boy Lay, the President's best buddy. 
   Those are things we could do to provide short-term relief of, virtually immediately, 50 cents a gallon. Then in the medium and short term, by developing the 6,391 offshore oil leases and the former Naval Petroleum Reserve, with known reserves of over 10 billion barrels, we could make them develop that. Use it or lose it. 
   I think we're going to have a discussion about that later this week. Let's see where the Republicans come down on that. These are already let leases, and they can be developed much more quickly than new leases could be. Let's see what they're really all about.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, this evening the President, in bowing to the electoral reality of last November and, with finally some recognition of real problems confronting our Nation and our citizens, is about to begin, in his State of the Union, to address the issue of the need for an expansion of health insurance. Forty-six million Americans lack health insurance, 1 million more per year every year this President has been in office. He will also address the issues of energy efficiency, energy independence, and global warming; and we welcome some remarks from the President in those areas. And he is going to address the debt and the deficit. 
   We welcome this new focus on these extraordinarily important and difficult issues that have been pretty much ignored during his Presidency. Unfortunately, his rhetorical U-turn is not going to be matched by the reality of his proposals. In order to provide health insurance to 46.1 million people who don't have it, he says we should tax people who do have health insurance. 
   Now, that is interesting because the President, of course, gets his health insurance for free. And his proposal would also extend tax benefits to the wealthiest among us because many people who don't have health insurance can't benefit from tax breaks. They don't pay Federal income taxes. 
   That is not a real solution. A real solution would be to take on the antitrust immunity of the insurance industry, estimated to raise $45 billion, saving consumers that money. That is the cost of uninsured health care in America. 
   Energy efficiency and independence, well, we will wait and hear what the President has to say. But remember a year ago, he talked about our addiction to oil, and all his policies have been designed to further that addiction thus far. 
   On the debt and the deficit, he still wants to cut taxes for the wealthiest among us. He wants to extend, to make permanent, all of his tax cuts; exempt all estates from taxes; and says he is going to balance the budget. Well, if he was really going to do that by the year 2012, he would have to eliminate the Federal Government except for the Department of Defense, a little bit of the Department of Homeland Security, because the projected deficit is as large as about the rest of the discretionary budget if his tax cuts are maintained. You have to begin to raise revenues from the wealthiest among us to address this gaping maw hole, the deficit. 
   And then there is one very important problem where he isn't even pretending to change direction, one where a majority of the American people and a majority of the United States disagree with the President's nostrum, and that is his desire to escalate the war in Iraq as a way out. Defying his own Joint Chiefs of Staff and the senior officers and advisers in the military; defying the Prime Minister of Iraq, who said we shouldn't put more Americans into Baghdad; defying the American people; and defying this Congress, the President is going to offer us more stay the course in Iraq and try to spin it into a new policy that will lead to success. 
   We want to succeed, but to succeed, the Iraqi Government has to be willing to take on some of its own problems. The Shiias and the Sunnis have got to stop slaughtering each other trying to settle a 1,400-year-old grudge and putting us in the middle of their civil war. They have got to begin to meaningfully share power, and they have got to begin to resolve their own issues. And the U.S. sending more troops is not going to lead them down that path. 
   So I fear that what the President is proposing there will lead to more conflict. It may look good in the short term, but long term it is not going to resolve this very difficult issue. 
   I hope that the President offers us some real changes in direction tonight and not just a rhetorical U-turn to bow to the reality of the elections.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (HEALTH CARE INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, the President has discovered that we have a problem with health insurance in the United States of America, and that is good news. Approximately 1 million more Americans have become uninsured for health care every year that the President has been in office, a record 46.1 million have no health insurance, 8.3 million of them are children, 609,000 people of them in my State of Oregon, alone. 
   The President goes on to say, having discovered this problem, that we must address the rising costs so that more Americans can afford basic health insurance. I think there is a lot of room for agreement there. Unfortunately, the solutions the President is offering are straight out of the neoconservative and right-wing think tanks. 
   The same people who told us we would be greeted as liberators in Iraq are now giving the President the solutions for the uninsured in America. They are saying the problem is those who are insured have too much insurance. We should tax middle-class Americans, particularly union members, who have good health plans, those that actually provide for some dental and vision coverage, in order to provide health insurance to those who don't. 
   Now, what the President is ignoring here are a few problems with the wildly profitable insurance industry. First off, it is exempt from the antitrust law. There are only two industries exempt from the antitrust law, baseball and insurance. Now, I don't care that much about the baseball exemption, but insurance should not be exempt from antitrust. They should not be allowed to meet together and collude to jack up prices, collude to determine who they will cover and who they won't cover. Now those are big problems. If we dealt with those problems, that would dramatically drop the cost of health care. 
   The President is a free market forces guy; well, let's have free market forces in health care. We don't today; it is a cartel. They collude to set the prices; they collude to decide who won't get coverage. Those are big problems. They want to cherry-pick. They only want to insure people who aren't going to file claims. We all know about that with our homeowners insurance now; you file a claim? Whoops, sorry; we don't want to insure you anymore even though you have been paying us a premium for 20 years. This is an industry that must be reined in. But no, that is not what the President is going to do. He is going to tax middle-class people. He is going to tax union members, people who have decent health care so that some money could then be provided as tax deductions for those who don't have health care. Well, there is another problem with that; of the 46.1 million people, remember, 8.3 million are children, no earnings there. And many of them come from families that earn less than $50,000 a year. What is a Federal tax deduction worth to those families? Zero, nada, zip. Of course, the President doesn't understand that. 
   Actually, this will provide tremendous benefits to young, healthy people like, say, people who are millionaires at Google who have chosen not to buy health insurance, they will get a nice $15,000 a year tax break. But for the family that earns $50,000 a year, they will not get a tax break because they are not paying Federal income taxes. So the President's plan is worthless for those who most need it. It penalizes those who are getting by. 
   And who is the President to talk about gold-plated health care plans? He has socialized medicine. He doesn't pay a penny. He gets a $20,000 physical exam for free every year, in addition to any other health care he might need. And he is talking about Americans, families with gold-plated plans who can actually take their kids to the dentist and get partial payment? Seniors who can actually get some new eyeglasses so they can see again? That is gold-plated in the President's world. Those people should pay taxes so that we can give a phony benefit to the uninsured. This is not the way to solve the problem. 
   If the President had any guts he would take on the insurance industry. He would join me in proposing to take away the antitrust exemption from the insurance industry, stop them from redlining people and cherry-picking, and that would make health insurance  cheaper for all Americans, not the preposterous proposal he is putting forward.

   No, this is the unfinished business of the 109th Congress, the Republican Congress led by the Republican President in the White House, who allowed county and school payments to lapse without lifting a finger. Nothing was done. 780 counties are on the brink of losing essential services, closing jails, laying off deputy sheriffs, no rural law enforcement, no public health, other essential services jeopardized, thousands of jobs. 4,400 rural schools, already underfunded, struggling to make ends meet for their kids, are going to lose money if these payments aren't renewed. And the President says that does not meet any reasonable definition of an emergency. 
   Well, I guess if you live in the White House and you ride in motorcades protected by the Secret Service and you fly in a private 747, you're not too worried about cops in rural areas. You're not too worried about public health. You get free health care up at Walter Reed. You're not too worried about educating the Nation's kids and the kids in rural areas. But I am, and I represent that district. This is long overdue. This is an emergency. 
   And then for them to denigrate the emergency assistance to the fishermen? We had to drag the administration kicking and screaming last year to finally declare an emergency when they closed down the season and people couldn't work and they are losing their boats. Now they say it is unwarranted funding for the fishermen.

   The gentleman from New Jersey talked about a transition from a petroleum-based economy. I think there's some grounds, small grounds, for agreement there. 
   But I guess, and I think most American people would agree with that, they know we can't, you know, drill big and burn our way out of this problem. We've got to cut our dependence to OPEC and other foreign sources of oil, and we've got to mitigate the damage on our economy. 
   But then that's where the disagreement starts because mitigating the damage to consumers today means taking some tough votes in this House of Representatives. One tough one was May 20 of last year, rollcall 332. Now, that seemed a no-brainer to me, but it was really tough on the Republican side, and the gentleman from Illinois voted against it. 
   It was to have the Justice Department, United States Justice Department, investigate collusion by the OPEC Nations to unnecessarily constrain supply and drive up the price for American consumers. That was a tough vote for the gentleman from Illinois. He voted ``no.'' He didn't think the Justice Department should investigate. I also have a bill saying the President should file a complaint against the OPEC countries in the WTO. 
   You know, the Bush administration, in fact, is now investigating collusion by OPEC. They still haven't filed a complaint in the WTO. So the Bush administration is taking a step that the gentleman from Illinois opposed, investigating collusion which is gouging consumers. We need a new energy future, but we don't need to allow our consumers to be price gouged on the way there. 
   Mr. Wu raised another issue which the gentleman just brushed off, which is the whole issue that credible analysts say, because of the Enron loophole--remember, Ken Boy? He might be dead but his memory lives on, and about 50 cents a gallon for the American people. Ken Boy Lay of Enron, one of the President's best buddies, got a special loophole from this Republican Congress deregulating derivatives in energy trading so that they could speculate. Well, he's dead, Enron's bankrupt, but the speculation is rampant. 
   And experts tell us probably 50 cents on every gallon, 50 cents on every gallon today, you want to give immediate relief, reregulate the commodities market. You're not regulating the price of gas. You're just saying you can't have derivatives and you can't have Morgan Stanley holding more futures contracts and more fuel than ExxonMobil. Just reregulate the market. They can't self-deal. Just reregulate the market. Just bring some regular trading back to that market that existed before 2000. You could save tomorrow 50 cents a gallon. 
   Now, you can talk about ANWR, and he talked about it with great certainty. I've been sitting in on debates for 20 years over ANWR. One well was drilled. What was there we don't know. It was proprietary. There are estimates from a little bit to a lot of oil. But he knows exactly how much is there, interesting, and how much revenue it would bring, even more interesting, since right now oil from Alaska can and is being exported from the United States of America. I guess he's worried about the Chinese energy problem because that's most likely where any additional supply from Alaska would go until we develop more refinery capacity, which the industry refuses to do. And there are ways to drive them to make that investment, but the gentleman doesn't support that legislation either, which I've introduced. 
   So we're hearing a lot of bloviating and talk on that side of the aisle because Republicans are running scared because their coffers have been filled by this industry for years and they were put into power and Bush was put into the White House and Dick Cheney was put into the Vice President's mansion by this industry. And this industry is kind of unpopular right now. 
   So they want to pretend they want to do something 10, 15, 20 years out. Let's even bring it a little closer in. The gentleman again talked about ANWR. Well, right just a little way away from ANWR, guess what, there's something Bill Clinton leased called the Naval Petroleum Reserve. We know there's oil  under that. Bill Clinton leased it. Bill Clinton's been gone seven-and-a-half years. How time flies. 
   How many producing wells are there in the Naval Petroleum Reserve drilled by American companies who have leased that reserve? None, not one, not a single one. 
   So, if the need is to get more production going in Alaska, how about they drill the wells in the Naval Petroleum Reserve where we know there's oil as opposed to pretending there might be oil in ANWR, and we could drill way over there, and it's also a lot further from the existing pipeline and other shipping capabilities. 
   So there's a heck of a lot of stuff, as I said earlier in my 45-second response--I regret I didn't have time at that point to yield to the gentleman. He's not here now. I would have given him at least 30 seconds--to develop out there, but the industry isn't developing it. Ten thousand permits that haven't been actuated, and they start talking about Illinois. 
   These Federal leases aren't in Illinois. I'm not aware of any Federal leases in Illinois for oil exploration. These are off the coast where 80 percent of the supply is accessible through existing leases. The industry just hasn't seen fit to develop it. Why not? Because it's working really well for them right now. Record prices. They don't really care about supply. They sure as heck don't want more supply to bring down the price. 
   Plain and simple, they're extorting the American people. They're extorting through collusion with OPEC. They're extorting through speculation in the energy markets, and they're extorting by withholding their drilling from leases they already have while pretending they need more. Plain and simple, it's a scam. 
   And I'm really disappointed that the gentleman is going to oppose my bill later when he talks about all the revenue that could be realized, when right now royalty-free oil is flowing out of the gulf because of a bureaucratic error, and he doesn't want to fix that problem because he thinks the oil companies need the money more than my counties and schools, and we'll hear more about that later.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. There are 36.9 billion reasons why we aren't doing more to protect consumers today, why we haven't filed the complaints against OPEC, why the Republicans voted against investigating collusion by OPEC, why the Republicans created loopholes in energy trading so that Enron could get rich--well, they went bankrupt, actually, but others can speculate in the market, driving up gas 50 cents a gallon today. And they don't want to close that loophole because their rich buddies benefit from it, just like their rich buddies in the oil industry benefit from the lack of supply. 
   But I was shocked to hear the gentleman talk about needing to loosen up regulations in order to get more refinery capacity. A few years ago, George Bush offered to let any oil company that wanted to build a new refinery build it on a closed military base and waive all the environmental laws. How many takers did he get? Big goose egg, zero, none. 
   What did the head of Exxon Mobil say just 2 weeks ago? We're not interested in building refineries; we're doing just fine the way things are. They are restraining, and they have restrained over the last decade, refinery capacity in collusion to drive up the price. It's yet another excuse to drive up the price. 
   So they don't want to build refineries and give relief to the American consumers. They don't want us to take on the collusion of OPEC because they're making money off of it. They don't want us to stop the speculation in the commodities market because Big Oil and big Wall Street are making money off it. 
   And then they want to shift to this fatuous debate about ANWR. They know exactly how much oil is there, unlike anybody else in the world except the one company that drilled the one proprietary well 25 years ago, they're the only people who know if there is or isn't anything there. But we do know underneath the former National Petroleum Reserve, set aside by a much more far-sighted administration 70 years ago, there is a sea of oil underneath the National Petroleum Reserve. And Bill Clinton leased that to the oil industry because they were carping about the need for new places to go and drill for oil. Bill Clinton has been gone 7 1/2 years. How many producing wells are there in the Naval Petroleum Reserve? Goose egg, zero, same as the number of new refineries, goose egg, zero, because they're making huge profits the way it is. Why should they give relief to the American consumers because relief means lower extortionate profits for them. They have no intention of giving relief to the American people. This is a red herring.

   First off, it was the head of ExxonMobil, the most profitable industry in the history of the world, who said he has no intention of building a refinery. He didn't mention regulations or bureaucracy. He said they're doing just fine the way it is, why would they build another refinery? And other CEOs of oil companies have said the same thing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is incredibly important legislation, and I hope it doesn't devolve into the partisan debate that's been going on earlier today to point the fingers of blame on the current high cost of gasoline at the pump. 
   This is about another crisis the American people are experiencing, not as widespread as the cost of fuel, but the impact will be even heavier on more than 600 counties in 42 States and hundreds of school districts across America. This is the issue of whether or not we should continue to compensate these counties for the fact that they have very high ownership of Federal lands and Federal forests. Federal forest policy has changed, and their revenues have diminished dramatically, and many of them have no alternative, under their State constitution or other laws, to go out and replace those funds, particularly in the short term. 
   It's expensive. It would cost $1.9 billion over 4 years. But being sensitive to the fact that many of us on this side of the aisle feel that the policies of recent years have put the country on the verge of bankruptcy, we pay for it. In fact, with the value of what we have in here as a so-called offset in Washington speak, the way we pay for it, with fees on offshore oil leases that were inadvertently omitted by the Clinton administration, would raise $3.3 billion. That means we pay for rural schools and counties. That's 7,000 teachers. That's hundreds of deputy sheriffs, hundreds of corrections officers, many roadworkers, other critical public safety folks, public health, all across 42 States in America and 600 counties. We pay for that with this bill. In fact, we would help reduce the deficit, which is something we're handing off to our kids and we do need to deal with, by $1.4 billion. 
   Now, some will object to the offset, that the oil companies shouldn't be required to pay a fee even though they got this royalty relief without a cap inadvertently, by mistake, by a previous administration. I really hope that they don't take the debate down that path. That does not do the counties, the schools, the teachers, the police, the deputies, and the others justice. 
   Let's focus on the issue at hand. They have an alternative to fund this. I have been trying desperately for more than a year. It's been quite some time since this bill came out of committee, and Mr. Walden and I joined in a bipartisan way earlier this year in a letter on January 18 to the majority asking that this bill be brought up. And then Mr. Walden on May 1 came to the floor with Mr. Blunt and asked that  the bill be brought up. In fact, he sent out a press release saying it's been 44 legislative days and over 3 months, that it's a strongly bipartisan bill. I hope it stays bipartisan. To extend county payments has been ready for a vote on the House floor. I simply do not understand why the Democratic leadership has not scheduled a vote. 
   Well, the Democratic leadership has now scheduled a vote. And I hope that we can get back to the bipartisanness. I hope we can get back to the focus of this debate. Let's pass this bill and move it over to the Senate. If you don't like the way it's paid for, if you want to protect the royalty relief for the oil and gas industry, then vote ``present,'' send the bill to the Senate, and see if they can come up with, as they claim, a better way to pay for it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   This is a difficult choice. It is always difficult to choose between your constituents and your patrons. The patrons heavily to that side of that aisle have been Big Oil. This would hurt Big Oil. They would actually have to pay a fee for leases that were written improperly where they don't pay any royalties to the American taxpayers at a time of record prices. That hurts. 
   Yes, it is true. So far, a bare minority of Senators have rejected it, previously. Maybe they won't this time. Maybe with oil at $125 a barrel they will go along with it and say we can get some good out of this for a change. We can help kids get an education. We can keep teachers employed. We can provide money to police our counties and to keep people in jail who need to be there, and for other public services and public works. We can do those things. But we have got to have some guts. Every once in a while you have got to stand up. 
   We hear all this stuff, all we need is more leases. Their staff boycotted a meeting last week. They sprung a proposal last night, which is a Republican bill, not a single Democrat on it, and would open up offshore oil drilling, which is not acceptable to the Republican Governor of California, to the Republican Governor of Florida, and many others. It is a nonstarter. Come on, guys, let's get real. This is your choice. This is it. 
   There are 6,312 nonproducing leases on the OCS. This bill would make those companies begin to produce, or pay a fee for not producing. If you want to help provide more supply, which is what a lot of the debate has been about today, let's impose a fee on those 6,312 wells. And, in the meantime, let's get some good of that money for the American people. Help 7,000 teachers, help the kids in rural schools, help our deputy sheriffs, help our people who do corrections, help the people who have a backlog of road and bridge projects all across rural America. Help 42 States. Help 600 counties. 
   This is your only vote. This is your time. Sometimes you have to make tough choices. I urge an ``aye'' vote on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (DESIGNATING THE JIM WEAVER LOOP TRAIL AT WALDO LAKE IN WILLAMETTE NATIONAL FOREST -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 247, a bill to rename Forest Service trail number 3590, which circumnavigates the world-renowned Waldo Lake, as the ``Jim Weaver Loop Trail'' in honor of former Congressman Jim Weaver. The legislation would also designate this 22 mile trail as a national recreational trail under the National Trails System Act. This legislation has special significance to me because Mr. Weaver was not only my predecessor as the representative of Oregon's Fourth Congressional District, but he was also my boss--both here in Washington, D.C. and back home in the district--and is a friend. I am pleased that the legislation is cosponsored and supported by all of Oregon's five House members. In addition, it is supported by the Forest Service and a number of local interest groups. 
   Jim Weaver has been an Oregonian for nearly sixty years. He represented the southwest portion of the state in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1975 to 1987. During his time in Congress, Mr. Weaver made natural resource conservation one of his signature pursuits. He was a tireless advocate for outdoor recreation, and the protection of some of Oregon's most treasured natural features. 
   He was the leading force responsible for the inclusion of new wilderness areas north of Waldo Lake in the Oregon Wilderness Act of 1984, and worked tirelessly with then Senator Hatfield to ensure that these lands received protection. 
   The 10 square mile Waldo Lake is considered ultraoligotrophic, meaning it's ranked as one of the purest bodies of water on Earth, and is comparable to distilled water. According to the Forest Service's Water Quality Report, two of the main reasons for its purity are the low levels of sedimentation and lack of development in the area, two characteristics which should be credited to Mr. Weaver's efforts. 
   Waldo Lake and the surrounding area, including the loop trail, is a popular recreation destination. Naming this trail for Mr. Weaver is a fitting tribute to the legacy of Congressman Weaver and his commitment to protecting Waldo Lake and the surrounding area. 
   This legislation gives long-overdue recognition to Congressman Weaver and forever associates his name with an area that he loves and worked hard to protect. I want to thank Chairman RAHALL and his Staff Director, Jim Zoia, and Ranking Member YOUNG for their efforts in dicharging the bill for today's floor action. I look forward to the Senate taking up the bill expeditiously, and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman. 
   We are debating a simple, straightforward resolution. Clause 1 says, ``Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or have served bravely and honorably in Iraq.'' 
   Every Member of Congress, despite outrageous allegations from the Republican side of the aisle from some, fully supports our troops and wants them to have the best equipment available to accomplish this mission. The disagreement is over the strategy that determines their mission. 
   The Republicans don't want to have a debate over that strategy. They are trying to conflate support for the troops with support for the President's failed stay-the-course strategy dressed up with a little bit of escalation. 
   But as President Theodore Roosevelt said during World War I, standing by a President, whether right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, it is morally treasonable to the American public. 
   Supporting the troops doesn't require supporting the failed policies of this President and his administration. The Republicans don't want to debate the conduct of the war and the future strategy in Iraq. The former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Peter Hoekstra, wrote a letter to his colleagues saying, ``This debate should not be about the surge or its details. This debate should not even be about the Iraq war to date, mistakes that have been made, or whether we can or cannot win militarily. If we let the Democrats force us into a debate on the surge or the current situation in Iraq, we lose.'' 
   So change the subject. Make things up. 
   There is a massive propaganda effort on the part of many Republicans to distract and dissemble. They have trotted out the tired and thoroughly discredited catch phrase, ``If we don't fight them there, we will fight them here,'' invoking the specter of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. However, U.S. intelligence agencies, including military intelligence agencies, have refuted that claim that the conflict in Iraq is driven by al Qaeda. It is not. The violence is driven by a civil war primarily between the Iraqi Sunnis and Shias in a 1,400-year-old conflict, and our troops are caught in the middle of that civil war. The recent National Intelligence Estimate definitively put that issue to rest. The Iraqi Sunnis and Shias have no interest in or capability of attacking the United States. 
   Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and their Taliban allies are still alive and active on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, thanks to the Bush administration and the massive diversion of our troops and resources from Afghanistan to an unnecessary war in Iraq. We do need to reinforce our troops in Afghanistan in order to end, once and for all, the threat posed by al Qaeda and the Taliban leadership. 
   Our Nation and our troops were led into the war in Iraq by the distortion of intelligence, dissembling by the President, and senior members of the administration. It is time for the truth. The Bush administration has saddled our troops with a failed strategy in Iraq. It is that failed strategy that hurts our troops, not the words of those of us who have pointed out the obvious failures by this administration. 
   I don't believe there is a level of U.S. troops that could stabilize Iraq at this point and resolve these underlying ages-old sectarian conflicts. 
   The President remains optimistic. However, optimism is not a strategy. Staying the course and repeating the failures of the past is not a new strategy. Vice President Dick Cheney, despite the grim National Intelligence Estimate acknowledging the civil war in Iraq, dismissed suggestions that Iraq is a disaster, saying, ``The reality on the ground is that we have made major progress.'' Vice President Cheney. 
   Optimism, stay the course, and delusion and denial, those do not serve our troops well. We need a real change in strategy. 
   A better strategy is to announce a time line negotiated with the Iraqi Government to bring our troops home over the next 6 months to a year. 
   The administration has always set time lines for political developments in Iraq, for the elections, for the drafting of the constitution. The administration argued such time lines were necessary to focus the energy of Iraq's leaders and to force compromises. We need to do the same on the military side. Negotiating a time line for bringing home U.S. troops with responsible parties in the Iraqi Government would boost the Iraqi Government's legitimacy and claim to self-rule, and force the Iraqi Government to take responsibility for itself and its citizens. Negotiating a withdrawal timeline and strategy with the Iraqi Government could more than possibly anything else improve the standing of the Iraqi Government in the eyes of its own people, a significant achievement in a region where the standing of rulers and governments is low, and it could also abate the insurgencies of both Sunnis and Shias. Too many Iraqis view us as an occupying force. Large majorities of both Sunnis and Shia want U.S. troops to withdraw, and approve of attacks on our men and women in uniform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. The Bush administration presided over the creation of the housing bubble and the underlying exotic financial instruments with their typical ``hands off'' regulatory approach. Now it has exploded, and some in the administration are recognizing that the economy is in trouble, something that middle-income America and average Americans have known for quite some time. 
   Finally, the President and his appointees are talking about some stimulus. But they are drawing a line. They are saying yes, we will do some stimulus, but we will not invest in America. There will be no infrastructure investment. They are saying that would be bad. So far, there's no indication either that they intend to bring any regulatory discipline to the bizarre, exotic, over-leveraged, and opaque financial markets, something that also cries out to be done. 
   Stimulus, yes. I believe we can reach agreement on that. It needs to be targeted toward those who have been hurt the worst: Middle-income and working families. The best way to do that, the most progressive way to do that would be through a payroll tax holiday. Nearly half of the people in this country pay more in payroll taxes than they do Federal income taxes. It's a flat, regressive tax. Forty-four percent pay more in payroll taxes than they do income taxes. Lower income Americans, seniors in particular, who work part-time jobs to augment their retirement Social Security, pay no taxes, and would not get any rebates under the President's plan. They need help too. They are struggling with higher costs of medical care, fuel, and heating like everybody else in this country. 
   So a payroll tax holiday would be the fairest way to get money to the people who need it the most, who would be most likely to spend the money, and provide some short-term stimulus to the economy. That is short-term. But long-term we need to reinvest in America, and it is strange the President draws a line in the sand there. It is not so strange, I guess, since the Secretary of Transportation last week, Mary Peters, recommended phasing out any Federal role, any Federal investment in our roads, bridges, highways, and transportation systems in this country. She said the financial markets will take care of that, they will lend us the money, the same financial markets that are totally in the tank and having to go overseas now, the same big firms that are borrowing money from Saudi Arabia and other state funds in order to stay afloat because of all their speculation. No. We need investment in America.  
   Unemployment among construction workers is up to nearly 10 percent, and nearly a million are unemployed. If we just spent $15 billion on ready-to-go and needed infrastructure projects in this country; roads, bridges, highways, water and sewer systems, we could put 712,000 people to work. That's 712,000 people. We could basically wipe out unemployment in the construction trades. But the President says no. He won't borrow money to invest in America, he will borrow some money to provide some short-term consumption. 
   Of course, part of the problem with that is those who won't just use it to pay bills, or essentials, which many will, will be buying things that aren't made in America any more. So that money is going to leak overseas to China when they buy that flat screen television with the $600 or $800 rebate the President is proposing. 
   So we need both. We need a stimulus, and that will help some if it's targeted to those most in need, but we also need a long-term reinvestment in our country. It will make us more economically efficient, it will save fuel, and it will put people to work. It's worth borrowing money to do that.

   Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 772, a resolution to congratulate the American Highway Users Alliance on the occasion of its 75th anniversary. 
   Founded in 1932 as the National Highway Users Conference, in 1970 the group merged with the Automotive Safety Foundation and were renamed the Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mobility, and in 1995 they took on the current name of American Highway Users Alliance (``the Highway Users''). 
   The Highway Users has always been an outspoken proponent for adequate funding for our Nation's highway infrastructure and a consistent voice for motorists and those who depend on our highways for commercial purposes. 
   For the past 75 years, Highway Users have expressed the interests of motorists and businesses on all major national highway and traffic safety legislation, including strong support for the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized the Interstate Highway System, established the Highway Trust Fund. Since then, it's been an unwavering force for protecting the integrity of the Federal Highway Trust Fund and State Highway Trust Funds. 
   As we received a report last week on the state of the Nation's infrastructure from a commission that was created by the passage of the SAFETEA-LU bill, we find that we are dramatically in deficit in investing in the Nation's infrastructure. And the current administration is dramatically in denial about the deficit in investing in infrastructure, so there will be a lot of work to be done by the American Highway Users Alliance and other advocates for an improved transportation network in the United States of America.

Res. 866) honoring the brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard whose tireless work, dedication, and commitment to protecting the United States have led to the Coast Guard seizing over 350,000 pounds of cocaine at sea during 2007, far surpassing all of our previous records. 
   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (HONORING THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the United States Coast Guard provides extraordinary service to our Nation on a daily basis. They are providing for homeland security. They are providing in this case that we will talk about in some depth a drug interdiction to keep our citizens safe and deprive drug traffickers of easy access to the United States, and they also provide life-saving services, in addition to other routine law enforcement and monitoring activities. 
   This seizure is fairly extraordinary: 350,000 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of about $4.7 billion. That is more than half the budget of the United States Coast Guard. It is extraordinary for this, the smallest of our uniformed services, to have provided that much protection for our country. 
   There are 41,000 men and women in the Coast Guard who patrol our Nation's shores, gather and process intelligence from around the world every single day of the year, as I mentioned earlier, both a homeland security purpose, and in this case, to interdict drug smuggling. 
   Though most Americans may not often see the Coast Guard at work along our 95,000 miles of coastline, you can be certain that the effects of the service's essential work ripple down into even local neighborhoods. Drug dealers are feeling the effects of the Coast Guard's good work as they complain of short supplies in more than 35 major U.S. cities. 
   The Coast Guard has been guarding our coasts and securing our borders since 1790. They do so without need for special recognition. They execute their missions daily, whether it is maritime safety, environmental protection, search and rescue, maritime law enforcement or homeland security. 
   Due to the Coast Guard's aggressive enforcement in monitoring the Caribbean drug routes, drug smugglers have now had to resort to much more dangerous and expensive tactics providing a deterrent. They've had deterrents to specific routes, which takes them more than 1,000 miles offshore, which costs them more money and presents logistical difficulties, and yet again, gives the Coast Guard further opportunities to interdict. 
   Although the Coast Guard is the smallest of the seven uniformed services, it is the Nation's leading maritime enforcement agency. Interdicting drugs is an Interagency effort. The Coast Guard relies heavily on their partnerships with numerous Federal and State agencies, including the Department of Defense, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration and Customs and Border Patrol to extend their law enforcement authority. 
   These partnerships are a critical component of their interdiction success. They have also negotiated international bilateral agreements to allow them to conduct operations and stop illegal smuggling outside of U.S. territorial waters. 
   H. Res. 866 honors the brave men and women of the Coast Guard whose tireless work, dedication and commitment to protecting the United States resulted in this extraordinary interdiction of illegal drug shipments in 2007, and on a daily basis protects our Nation and our citizens. 
   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 866 and urge adoption of the resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 TO RESTORE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank my good friend and colleague for yielding the time. 
   Madam Speaker, this is an extraordinarily serious problem. Americans today are already familiar with the problems of our transportation infrastructure. On a daily basis, trucks are detoured because of weight-limited bridges. Individuals are sitting idling in traffic in congestion because of inadequate and obsolete infrastructure. People are flooding on to transit at a record rate. Transit ridership is reaching levels that haven't been seen since we had a decent system of transit in this country 50, 60 years ago. 
   But the stress on the system is extraordinary. People are trying to escape the high cost of gas. But our transit systems are struggling to pay the bills themselves. So this is not the time to begin to reduce our already pathetic and inadequate investment in our transportation infrastructure in the United States. The gas tax was 18.4 cents a gallon in 1993 and gas was a buck a gallon. Today, the gas tax is 18.3 cents a gallon, and gas was $4.29 in my district last weekend. And that is not the cause of the run-up in price. And the buying and purchasing power of that small amount of tax is about half of what it was 15 years ago. So this is not the time to begin to think about even less investment. And that is what looms before us if this bill doesn't pass today and isn't signed into law by the President. 
   Less investment. My colleague, Earl Blumenauer from Oregon, corrected me after his speech. I said, you know, America is falling to a third-world status in terms of its investments in transportation infrastructure. He said, no, actually that was pretty insulting to a lot of third-world countries who are investing more than we are. So I have begun to call us ``fourth world.'' That is a formerly first-world infrastructure falling even behind many countries in the third world in terms of investment. 
   150,000 bridges in America are either functionally obsolete or structurally deficient. I think we should post every one of those bridges with a sign so people know every time they drive over it.  This is not the time to begin to talk about doing less work to maintain our bridges and deal with the structural deficiencies and the functional obsolescence. This is not the time to begin to pull back on meeting our commitments to surface transportation infrastructure. 
   I'm so pleased that the Ways and Means Committee has chosen to act and replace funds that were raised out of the gas tax, intended to be only spent on transportation infrastructure, but transferred to the general fund and spent on who knows what. This will put us back in compliance with the law and the principles of the United States of America. 
   As we raise money dedicated to transportation, to be spent on transportation, there is a lot of investment that can be done. This is a needed bill. Pass this bill today.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. For a Republican minority, and particularly the gentleman from California, who whine day in and day out about their inability to offer amendments to even the most minor of bills, I've never seen a group so eager to give up their right, in fact, the right of every Member of this House to offer an amendment to this trade agreement in a rush to rubber-stamp yet another failed so-called free trade agreement. 
   As one Republican pointed out, yeah, its been the policy since 1974. Guess what? 1974 we were the manufacturing colossus of the world. We ran trade surpluses. We had a robust middle class in America. It was bad policy then. But after 24 years of that bad trade policy, our manufacturing's cut in half. The middle class is losing ground. They're unemployed. We're borrowing $2 billion a day from the rest of the world, including Communist China, to buy things that we used to make here in America, and they think we should do more of the same. 
   I've heard this and played this game before. I've never voted for one. But every President since I've been here, Republican and Democrat, says, hey, we negotiated this deal in secret. You can't fail us now. Yeah, it's got big problems, but we'll fix them later. 
   Guess what? Later never comes. Because this Congress, until today, has never had a spine to stand up to the special interests that are pushing failed trade policies, policies that fail the American people to benefit a few on Wall Street. This is about Main Street. 
   The House is growing a spine today. This is a great day and the beginning of a new trade policy for the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (TRADE POLICY IS CREATING A CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, today, for the first time in 4 decades, the House of Representatives stood up against yet another bad trade agreement. Our trade policy is creating a crisis. It's eroding the incomes of the middle class. We're losing our manufacturing base in this country. We're borrowing $2 billion a day from overseas making us vulnerable to countries like China and others who do not have our best interests in mind as they amount huge piles of our dollars because of the trade deficit. 
   Now, all the pointy-headed economists out there, they have a theory. The theory is when your dollar or your currency declines, at some point you kind of get to a point where your idled capacity ramps up, your goods become less expensive, and the world begins to buy your goods and your trade deficit goes away. 
   I confronted an economist over that vision a couple of years ago, and I said, well, that was an interesting theory, you know, 50 years ago. Maybe it even worked. 
   But what I said to him was what happens to the country that doesn't make anything anymore? Doesn't that mean, in fact, as your currency drops, you're still addicted to buying the goods made overseas or you're just not going to have those goods because you don't make them in the U.S. anymore? 
   There is no idle capacity to ramp up. Our companies of wholesale exported their manufacturing capacity to Mexico and China in the chase for ever cheaper, more exploitable labor around the world which has been encouraged by our trade agreements. Every other nation on earth has a trade policy to take care of the people of their own country. The United States has a trade policy to take care of the corporate elite in the United States of America and to heck with the rest of our country or even national security. 
   So why do I come to the floor today to talk about this? Two things: One is because we finally stood up against the free trade agreement and the fast-track gimmick that has jammed those things through time and time and time again. The President negotiated it in secret. You, Congress, you can't mess that up. We will lose respect around the world. You're just gonna take it. You can't amend it. And we'll fix it later. And later never comes. 
   But the second reason I come to the floor is because today, to the great surprise of those pointy-headed economists, our trade deficit got bigger even though we're in a recession and the dollar is dropping like a rock toward the value of a rupee, which it will soon achieve if we don't do something to turn the tide. 
   So our trade deficit grew 5.7 percent to $62.3 billion. We could be headed for a record trade deficit. Now why's that? Because those same goods that we don't make here anymore are more expensive now because we're still buying them with a depreciated dollar. 
   Of course, the nightmare scenario is the day when oil becomes denominated in somebody else's currency and countries refuse to take our currency and refuse to continue to lend us $2 billion a day. And that day of reckoning may not be far off. 
   It's time for a new trade policy in America, one that brings and keeps high-value jobs here at home and gives us a future as a great power and a manufacturing power, not as a has-been.

<DOCNO>Mr. DeFAZIO. (TAXPAYERS SHOULD NOT BAIL OUT THE BARONS OF WALL STREET -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the American taxpayers should not be asked to bail out the barons of Wall Street, Henry Paulson's best friends.  
   Plain and simple, Wall Street should pay for itself. There is ample precedent. This country assessed a securities transfer fee in the Civil War, Spanish-American War, and from 1914 until 1966. A modest fee, one-quarter of one percent, the same fee assessed on the London Exchange, would raise $150 billion a year from stock trades and commodity trades on Wall Street, which could more than pay for the bailout. That is, Wall Street can pay for its own excess and can pay to bail itself out. 
   Main Street should not get stuck with the bill for the huge party that was thrown on Wall Street.
