<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in strong support of S. 2565, the Law Enforcement Congressional Badge Bravery Act of 2008. 
   This excellent measure establishes a formal process by which Congress will be able to recognize acts of bravery of all of our Nation's law enforcement officers who become injured in the course of their duties. 
   Of the more than 70 Federal law enforcement agencies, only two have an awards programs to recognize their officers. Such scant recognition for the sacrifices that these officers make is simply unacceptable. 
   This legislation builds on legislation the House passed in April, H.R. 4056, authored by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Ellsworth), to accord Congressional recognition for the dangers Federal law enforcement officers face for our safety each day. H.R. 4056 would have established a meaningful and long-overdue system to honor deserving officers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6531, the Vessel Hull Design Protection Amendments of 2008, makes technical corrections to the 1998 Vessel Hull Design Protection Act for the purpose of clarifying Congress' intent that the design of an original vessel hull, separate from a vessel deck, may be protected. 
   In 1998, the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act established sui generis intellectual property protection for original vessel hull designs. That Act sought to address the problems of copycats who make molds of popular boat designs in order to produce knock-off versions. These knock-offs obviously cut into the market of the original manufacturers who had invested substantial time and resources in designing and testing their boats. Nevertheless, some copycats--mostly operating overseas--have exploited a flaw in the language of the 1998 Act. 
   As defined in the Act, a protected ``hull'' consists of both the hull and deck of a vessel. In determining infringement, the courts have interpreted this to mean that an allegedly infringing design must be substantially similar to both the hull and the deck of the protected design taken together. This means that a vessel with a hull identical to a protected design but with a different deck is not considered an infringement. This loophole has allowed copycats to continue to take and use popular hull designs of others with impunity. 
   To correct the problem, H.R. 6531 explicitly extends protection to a hull, a deck, or both, as the original manufacturer chooses. If a manufacturer elects to protect just the hull, infringement will be judged based on whether the hull of the alleged infringer is substantially similar. The same applies also if only the deck is protected. 
   If a manufacturer elects to protect both the hull and the deck, infringement will continue to be judged on whether the combined hull and deck design is substantially similar.     
   It is anticipated that the Copyright Office will promulgate regulations and a registration form that will clearly indicate that a deck, a hull, or hull-and-deck combination can be protected in one application. 
   H.R. 6531 also amends the 1998 Act to ensure that any vessel manufactured by or on behalf of the Department of Defense is governed by that agency's general procurement law, notwithstanding vessel hull design protection. 
   Passage of H.R. 6531 will finally provide boat manufacturers with the protection that Congress intended to give them a decade ago. 
   And one point, Mr. Speaker, the bill does not address the problem of fashion design policy that is hurting U.S. designers. But given the complexity of developing the appropriate protection scheme for fashion designs, it would be better addressed in a more thorough manner the next Congress. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this important measure this time. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 923, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. This important bill enjoys wide bipartisan and bicameral support. The bill will assist Federal, State, and local governments with the important task of solving unsolved civil rights-era crimes. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the recent joint hearing held by the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security and the Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, we heard from six excellent witnesses. The most moving of these were Mrs. Myrlie Evers Williams and Mrs. Rita Schwerner Bender, both of whose husbands the Ku Klux Klan assassinated because of the import civil rights work they were doing. The Klan assassinated Medgar Evers on June 12, 1963, and Michael Schwerner on June 21, 1964. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) has asked us to take up this act now because it coincides with the anniversary of these two important events. In both cases it took government authorities decades before the killers were convicted of these brutal murders. 
   Unfortunately, these cases were not isolated incidents. There are dozens of cases, probably hundreds, like these, some of which have never been acknowledged, investigated, or prosecuted. Indeed, we don't even know how many people were murdered during the 1950s and 1960s, because retaliation was so common that many families did not dare report that their loved ones had been murdered. The FBI has identified more than 100 cold cases that should be investigated and, when possible, charges should be brought against the accused killers. 
   I support H.R. 923 because it will hold the Department of Justice and the FBI accountable for following through on these investigations and prosecutions. The act requires the Attorney General to appoint a specific high-ranking employee in each agency to be accountable for this work. The act also requires the Department of Justice to report to Congress annually on the progress it has made towards solving these cases, and the first such report is due 6 months after the bill becomes law. 
   Lastly, the bill authorizes funds to the Department of Justice, the FBI, and when appropriate, State and local enforcement agencies, to investigate and prosecute these cases. 
   The FBI has already made a start in investigating these cases when it kicked off the Cold Cases Campaign in February of 2006 and expanded on this campaign in February 2007 when it solicited assistance from major civil rights organizations. However, there is still much more work that needs to be done, and Federal resources are necessary to do it. H.R. 923 will provide these necessary resources. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

   As many of our student veterans have come to realize, the current Montgomery GI Bill falls far short in meeting the needs of today's college students. The current program is designed as a benefit for peacetime service and was never intended as a wartime benefit. 
   The 21st Century GI Bill in this bill will give our men and women in uniform who have served multiple tours of duty and extended tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan the educational benefits similar to the ones earned in World War II. Our veterans today have served multiple tours of duty. They are getting pulled away from school, their jobs, and their families. The current GI Bill does not honor their service sufficiently. This bill will. 
   I commend our bipartisan cosponsors, especially my Virginia colleague, Jim Webb, for writing this bill. This bill will honor the service of our veterans. We need to pass this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (BAIL BOND FAIRNESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2286, the Bail Bond Fairness Act of 2007. The legislation was introduced by Representative Wexler and Representative Keller on May 10 of this year and largely mirrors several other bipartisan bills introduced in the last three Congresses. 
   Historically, bail has been issued for the sole purpose of ensuring a defendant's appearance in court as ordered. In recent years, however, Federal judges have ordered bail bonds forfeited even when the defendants, in fact, appear in court, but they have violated collateral conditions of pretrial release. 
   Although actual bail forfeitures of bonds for violating collateral conditions are rare, and one of the reasons is that bail bonds, in fact, are rare, one reason cited is that some Federal judges now allow defendants to deposit their own funds in amounts that would be equal to the premium of a commercial bond underwriter, making the commercial bond unnecessary. Even so, the practice of attaching ancillary conditions to the issuance of a bond has created a barrier to pretrial release, because the risk of bond forfeiture has forced many commercial bond underwriters to avoid the Federal system altogether.  
   We find that commercial bond underwriters will opt to offer their services to defendants in the State system where a risk of loss is lower because they only have to be concerned about the defendant's appearance, not his behavior, or where they also maintain that friends and family of defendants are reluctant to post a bond for defendants because they cannot risk their homes or life savings based on a person's behavior. They may be able to risk it assuming he will show up in court. 
   H.R. 2286 would return the use of bail bonds to the historic purpose of limiting a judge's authority to order a bond forfeited to a defendant's failure to appear physically in court. It is important to note that the bill does preserve a judge's authority to impose conditions of release and to revoke the pretrial release and order pretrial custody, should a defendant violate any conditions of pretrial release. But so long as a defendant actually appears in court, the bond should not be revoked. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, thousands of vulnerable older adults go missing each year as a result of dementia, diminished capacity, foul play, and other unusual circumstances. 
   For example, the Alzheimer's Foundation of America estimates that more than 5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease. It is estimated that 60 percent of these men and women are likely to wander from their homes. If they do, the disorientation and confusion may keep many from finding their way back home. Their safe return often depends upon them being found quickly. If not found within 24 hours, roughly half risk serious illness, injury, or death. 
   Three Members of Congress, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Myrick), and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), individually introduced legislation to address this serious problem in separate bills. H.R. 6064 combines the best parts of these bills into one. 
   Title I, the National Silver Alert Act, establishes a national program patterned after the successful Amber Alert program for children. 
   It creates a national Silver Alert coordinator responsible for developing voluntary guidelines, standards, and protocols for States to consider in the creation of their local Silver Alert plans. 
   It establishes the Department of Justice grant program to help States develop and implement local Silver Alert programs. 
   And it establishes the Sammy Kirk Voluntary Electronic Monitoring Program which will provide grants for voluntary electronic monitoring services for elderly individuals. 
   Title II reauthorizes the Kristen's Act which expired in 2005. That act provides for competitive grants to both public and nonprofit private agencies for a national resource center, information clearinghouse, and database for tracking missing adults, training and other related activities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Doggett, Mrs. Myrick and Mr. Bilirakis for their hard work and bipartisan efforts to address this critical problem of missing adults.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 410 recognizes the great accomplishments, sacrifices, and service of the men and women of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the occasion of the Bureau's 100th anniversary. 
   In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt and Attorney General Charles Bonaparte established a new Federal investigative agency consisting of a small force of special agents to assist States in combating crimes occurring across State lines. Little could they have envisioned that their idea would have evolved into one of the most foremost investigative agencies in history. It is fitting that we honor the men and women who have brought the FBI that stature. 
   Over the course of its existence, the Bureau's men and women have proven time and again that when the Nation calls upon them, they are ready to meet any challenge. They have worked tirelessly to stem foreign threats against the United States during two world wars and the Cold War by investigating espionage and sabotage on American shores. The FBI helped to keep our Nation safe, and over the course of time became one of the foremost professional espionage investigative agencies in the world. 
   The FBI's been called upon on numerous occasions to protect the civil rights of Americans and to bring justice to those who violate them. Today, the FBI remains the foremost Federal law enforcement agency for investigating serious civil rights violations. 
   The FBI has been called upon to investigate various types of violent crime, organized criminal enterprises, international fraud schemes, and financial and other forms of white-collar crime. 
   Today, as the Internet has so vastly expanded and transformed the world communication and commerce, we have tasked the FBI with protecting us against cyber-based attacks and high technology crimes. The Bureau, for example, investigates computer fraud, child pornography, theft of intellectual property, and worldwide computer intrusions. 
   The FBI has responded to threats to public safety posed by violent extremist groups, both domestic and international, tirelessly working to prevent crimes of terrorism against Americans at home and abroad. Their accomplishments are nothing less than extraordinary. 
   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, these accomplishments have not been without a tragic cost. Since its inception, 34 FBI special agents have made the ultimate sacrifice: giving their lives in the line of service. Every day, FBI special agents face the risks and endure the hardships to make our Nation safe. They truly personify the Bureau's motto: Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity. 
   So it is fitting that we congratulate the men and women of the FBI on the 100th anniversary of the Bureau. We honor their heroic commitment and sacrifices and thank them for their past and continued efforts to keep America safe. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Gohmert, the sponsor of the resolution, the committee chairman, Mr. Conyers, and the committee ranking member, Mr. Smith, for their leadership on this measure. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6855 extends for 5 years existing authority for the Supreme Court Police to protect the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Court, as well as officers and employees of the Supreme Court who are performing official duties while they are away from the grounds of the Supreme Court building. 
   When the Supreme Court first moved to its own building just over 70 years ago, we sent them a small contingent of Capitol Police officers commissioned as ``special policemen'' for the protection of the Court. It wasn't until 1982 that Congress provided the force with statutory recognition as the Supreme Court Police. That statute also gave them authority to patrol the Supreme Court buildings and grounds, make arrests, carry firearms, and protect the Chief Justice and any Associate Justices, official guests, and employees of the Court while performing official duties. 
   In that statute, the Congress also expanded the Supreme Court Police force's authority in a way very similar to what we had granted the Capitol Police the previous year. In 1981, we authorized the Capitol Police to provide protection to individual Members and officers of Congress, as well as their families, on or off the Capitol grounds. Likewise, in 1982 we authorized the Supreme Court Police to protect the Justices and the employees of the court while they're away from the court building anywhere in the United States. 
   When we first gave this authority to the Supreme Court Police in 1982, it was subject to a 3-year sunset provision. Since then, we have extended this authority 7 times, and this bill will continue that tradition. 
   In the 26 years since this authority was first granted, threats to all three branches, from terrorists and others who want to disrupt our government, have only increased. That is why it is imperative that we should not allow the authority of the Supreme Court Police to sunset at the end of this year. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation so that the Supreme Court Police can continue to perform their critical mission effectively. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we honor the life and musical legacy of Isaac Hayes, a passionate humanitarian, whose prolific songwriting and distinctive baritone were loved across generations and around the world. 
   He overcame humble beginnings and personal obstacles to make excellent contributions in many endeavors. He was a true Renaissance man, an extraordinary singer, songwriter and music producer who also achieved success as a pianist, saxophone player, cookbook author, radio show host, and television and motion picture actor. 
   Born in Covington, Tennessee, tragically orphaned as an infant, and raised by his maternal grandparents, Isaac Hayes came to know the pleasures of country life but also the hardships of rural poverty. 
   Shortly after his family moved to Memphis for the greater opportunities in the ``big city,'' his grandfather passed away. To help his family survive, Isaac Hayes worked in cotton fields, cut lawns, and cleaned bricks at two cents apiece, all while going to school. He even shined shoes on Memphis' famous Beale Street. 
   Despite experiencing rural, and then urban, poverty, he found ways to bring music into a central role in his life. At the age of five, he began singing in his local church and before long had also taught himself to play the piano, electronic organ, flute and saxophone. 
   He dropped out of high school for a time, but never lost sight of the critical role that education plays in improving one's life. He returned to school and proudly graduated at the age of 21. 
   After graduating, he played piano for Floyd Newman, a saxophonist bandleader. This work led to his becoming a studio musician for a new label called Stax Records, where his first paid sessions were with Otis Redding. These sessions were so successful that he became a ubiquitous presence at Stax. 
   While at Stax, he met David Porter, who became a long-standing friend and collaborator. As a result of their collaboration as songwriters and producers, they made more than 200 songs, including such classics as ``B-A-B-Y,'' ``Soul Man,'' and ``Hold on, I'm Comin'.'' 
   Perhaps the musical accomplishment that Isaac Hayes is best known for is the groundbreaking score and theme song that he wrote for the movie ``Shaft.'' His smooth baritone vocals and iconic style carried that song to the top of the charts, nationally and internationally. 
   During his life, he received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, two Grammy Awards, the NAACP Image Award, and the Edison Award, which is Europe's highest musical honor. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005. 
   He was not content to rest on his musical laurels, probably because of his roots in both rural and urban poverty. A passionate humanitarian concerned about the underprivileged throughout the world, he saw education and literacy as the keys to freedom and prosperity. 
   Based on that belief, he founded the Isaac Hayes Foundation, whose mission  it is to promote literacy and education and other programs throughout the world. 
   The foundation, among other endeavors, built an 8,000-square-foot education facility in Ghana, West Africa, and supported education efforts in Tennessee. In recognition of his humanitarian work and educational and economic contributions, in 1994 Isaac Hayes was crowned a king in Ghana. 
   Last year, Isaac Hayes and David Porter came to Capitol Hill to speak to Senators and House Members about the importance of protecting the intellectual property rights of their fellow songwriters and performing artists. 
   He was an excellent advocate for his fellow songwriters and vocal artists. He was humble, well-spoken, and passionate about protecting creative works, not just for the benefit of artists, but also for the benefit of our national economy. 
   There is so much more that I could say about this man, but for time's sake, I'll just end with this observation. 
   Isaac Hayes' achievements and influence made him a cultural icon, and his humanitarian work also made him a great human being. With the fatal stroke that took his life at the age of 65, Isaac Hayes leaves behind a legacy of monumental significance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues from Tennessee, Mrs. Blackburn and Mr. Cohen, for their leadership on this measure. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is being returned to us from the Senate with an additional title added. The House of Representatives passed the Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008 under suspension of the rules in June, as a much-needed permanent solution to reauthorize the protection of former Vice Presidents and their families. 
   As amended by the Senate, the bill now also includes a new title addressing the problem of cybercrime. These additional provisions provide needed tools to law enforcement to address the growing and evolving crime of identity theft, as well as other types of cybercrimes in several critical aspects. 
   First, the bill allows victims of identity theft to seek restitution in Federal court for the loss of time and money spent restoring their credit and remedying the harm caused by this crime. This helps ensure that identity-theft victims will be made whole financially. 
   Second, the bill updates criminal laws with respect to identity theft schemes so that they reflect current technologies, and can therefore better respond to the sophisticated aspects of these crimes. For example, to address the increasing number of computer hacking crimes that involve computers that may be located within the same State, the bill removes the current proof requirement that a computer's information must be stolen through an interstate or international communication. The fact that you are using Internet will still satisfy the interstate commerce requirements of the Constitution. 
   In addition, the bill addresses the increasing number of attacks on multiple computers by making it a felony to employ spyware to damage 10 or more computers. The new tools provided in this bill should be of significant help to law enforcement in providing a more effective deterrent against identity theft and other computer crimes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, to agree to the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2352, the School Safety Enhancements Act of 2008, is a vital piece of legislation aimed at ensuring the safety of the students in our Nation's schools. 
   Over the last decade we've seen horrific school shootings and violence in at least 27 States. Ensuring the safety of our students and teachers at all levels is obviously a priority. 
   Sponsored by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman), H.R. 2352 addresses this problem by providing increased funding for improving school security and making the grant program more accessible to schools in poor communities. 
   Specifically, the bill raises the authorization level of Federal grants from $30 million to $50 million for Fiscal Years 2009 and 2010. It also decreases the matching non-Federal funds requirement from 50 percent to 20 percent, raising the Federal portion from 50 percent to 80 percent. This change in funding ratios brings the percentage more in line with the traditional split for school grants, and would bring much-needed help to many schools. 
   Finally, the bill amends the Higher Education Act to require participating institutions to conduct annual campus assessments and develop and implement a campus emergency response plan. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Justice and Victims of Torture and Terrorism Act, introduced by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak), will enable American POWs and civilians to hold the Government of Iraq liable for the physical and emotional injuries they sustained while held captive by Iraqi officials during the Gulf War. 
   During the Persian Gulf War, American pilots captured by Iraq were brutalized in horrendous ways. They were starved, exposed to extreme temperatures, severely beaten, and subjected to mock executions. 
   Because Iraq believed that these pilots had more sensitive information, they were subjected to especially brutal treatment. They sustained long-lasting physical and emotional injuries. 
   American civilians who had the misfortune of being held in Iraq at the time it invaded Kuwait were held hostage as ``human shields,'' used as leverage to interfere with the campaign to liberate Kuwait and defeat the Iraqi forces. These civilians were held in cruel and degrading conditions and forced to live in constant fear. 
   While Congress has supported giving terrorism victims the right to obtain effective relief, the executive branch has allowed State Department sensitivities to overshadow the fundamental rights of these victims to fair redress. 
   In amending the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in 1996, Congress intended to create a Federal statutory cause of action for American victims of terrorism, so that they could hold foreign States that commit or provide material support for terrorist acts accountable in United States courts. 
   Congress reaffirmed that intent last December in the National Defense Authorization Act. Unfortunately, the President vetoed the bill on that basis and insisted that the Congress give him waiver authority for Iraq, which he promptly exercised, once again placing relief out of reach for these victims. 
   In its introduced form, the bill simply rescinded that waiver authority. It has now been amended, with the assistance of the sponsors, as well as the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), working with the victims and their families. 
   The bill we are considering today would give the Iraqi Government 90 days after enactment to satisfactorily settle the claims of American victims to prevent the waiver authority from being rescinded. 
   The waiver authority would also survive if the President certifies that Iraq has no settlement claims of non-Americans that are similar to the claims of the POWs and human shields and has not settled commercial debts to foreign corporations. 
   The amended bill also specifies limits on the damage awards, to remove any argument about potentially open-ended liability. The specified amounts are a fraction of the outstanding judgment awards and pending claims. 
   Under this proposal, the Iraqi Government would be required to pay approximately $415 million. The amount of recovery sought is de minimis relative to the 20 to $32 billion in commercial claims that Iraq has reportedly settled with the corporations in Japan and Korea. It also amounts to perhaps 1 percent of the Iraqi Government assets held in United States banks. 
   I believe that holding Iraq accountable is an essential element in its full rehabilitation in the community of nations. This holds true to well-settled international law, as well as the Geneva Convention. 
   I commend my colleagues, Mr. Braley and Mr. Sestak, for their leadership and unwavering dedication in bringing this important legislation forward. I also commend the Judiciary Committee ranking member, Mr. Smith, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) for their leadership in making this a bipartisan effort.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (NOAA LAND SALE -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5350, a bill authorizing the Secretary of Commerce to sell or exchange certain National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration property in the City of Norfolk, Virginia. At the request of the City of Norfolk, I introduced this legislation in February of this year, along with my colleague from Virginia's Second Congressional District, Thelma Drake, who also represents part of the City of Norfolk. 
   Over the last decade, the City of Norfolk has experienced tremendous economic growth. Downtown Norfolk has reemerged as the urban center of the Hampton Roads region through revitalization and new commercial and residential development. 
   For several decades, NOAA has been an important Federal partner in downtown Norfolk's development. NOAA's Atlantic Marine Operations Center and NOAA's Chesapeake Bay office are both located downtown in an area referred to as the Fort Norfolk district, which is one of the last remaining undeveloped waterfront areas of downtown Norfolk. 
   Nearly a decade ago, the city recognized the strategic location of the Fort Norfolk district for development and revitalization and the city began discussions about its desire to purchase a parcel of property from NOAA located at 538 Front Street, directly across from NOAA's primary Norfolk facility. NOAA currently uses the property for storage and staff space for the Norfolk field operations office of NOAA's National Geodetic Survey. These discussions stalled when NOAA ascertained that congressional authorization was required to proceed. 
   H.R. 5350 simply authorizes, but does not require, the Secretary of Commerce to sell or exchange the NOAA property located at 538 Front Street in Norfolk to the City of Norfolk. The bill clearly states that NOAA may only sell or exchange the property if the Secretary of Commerce determines that the conveyance would be in the best interests of the Federal Government. The bill also requires that the property be sold at a value not less than the fair market value, as determined by the Federal Government. 
   The bill does not delineate or support any particular agreement or contract. The details of any future agreement between NOAA and the City of Norfolk would have to be worked out. This legislation would simply permit that process to move forward, and if a mutually agreeable contract is decided upon, this land sale or exchange would allow Norfolk to continue its tremendous economic growth by developing the land for commercial and residential purposes. The authority granted to the Secretary of Commerce to enter into this agreement with the City of Norfolk will expire 2 years after the date of enactment of H.R. 5350.  
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairwoman of the Fisheries Subcommittee, Ms. Bordallo, and the ranking member, Mr. Brown, as well as the Natural Resources Committee chairman, Mr. Rahall, and ranking member, Mr. Young, for getting this bill to the floor. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation that protects both the interests of the Federal Government and the citizens of Norfolk.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6503, the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program Reauthorization of 2008, helps to address the serious problem of seniors who go missing each year as a result of dementia. 
   The Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program was created in 1994. While Congress has continued to support and fund it, its formal authorization expired in 1998. This legislation, sponsored by the gentlelady from California (Ms. Waters), will reauthorize the program. 
   It authorizes the Attorney General to award competitive grants to nonprofit organizations for the planning, establishing, and operating locally based programs to protect and locate missing persons with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other problems. 
   This is an excellent measure that responds to a critical problem. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1011, the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act of 2007, introduced by my colleague from Virginia's Ninth Congressional District, Congressman Rick Boucher. I am proud to have been an original cosponsor of this important conservation legislation in this Congress and in the last Congress and I commend Congressman Boucher for all his hard work on this bill over the years. 
   This bipartisan bill will protect approximately 54,000 acres of the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia through the designation of additional wilderness areas and the creation of new National Scenic Areas. Although mechanized traffic and equipment would be prohibited in much of these areas, recreational activities would be permitted and encouraged throughout these new designations contributing to the local economy of Southwest Virginia. Protecting these additional acres of pristine forest will ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Southwest Virginia. We must also be vigilant in protecting environmentally sensitive areas by promoting responsible land use plans, which this bill does. 
   The bill before us today was reported out of the Natural Resources Committee by voice vote, is endorsed by the U.S. Forest Service, and is supported by Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, members from both parties in the Virginia delegation, both of Virginia's Senators, John Warner and Jim Webb, the Board of Supervisors in Bland County, Craig County, Montgomery County, and Smyth County, and various environmental organizations, including the League of Conservation Voters, the Garden Club of Virginia, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, and the Virginia Wilderness Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is vitally important to conservation efforts in the Commonwealth of Virginia and to guaranteeing that future generations of Americans can experience the natural wonder and beauty of Southwest Virginia. I applaud Congressman Boucher and his staff for all of their hard work on this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support the legislation and I encourage each of them to experience firsthand the pristine natural beauty of Southwest Virginia.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (COMMEMORATING THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAILING OF THE NAVY'S ``GREAT WHITE FLEET'' -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 261, introduced by my friend and colleague from Virginia's Second Congressional District, Congresswoman Thelma Drake, to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the sailing of the Navy's ``Great White Fleet'' from Hampton Roads, Virginia. 
   On December 16, 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt dispatched sixteen new battleships at the 1907 Jamestown Exposition on a global deployment to show the world that the United States had emerged as a global naval power. These sixteen ships were painted white, with gilded scrollwork on their bows, and became known as the ``Great White Fleet.'' 
   Made up of four squadrons of four battleships each and manned by 14,000 sailors, the ships sailed 43,000 miles and made 20 port calls on six continents in 14 months. The fleet helped shore up American diplomatic efforts and friendships around the world, proving the success of pragmatic diplomatic policy. The fleet was greeted enthusiastically in nearly every port, where people in the thousands turned out to see America's new fleet. The fleet also responded to one of the worst earthquakes in European history by diverting to Sicily to offer humanitarian aid to the people of Italy. 
   On February 22, 1909, President Roosevelt returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia to witness the triumphant return of the ``Great White Fleet.'' President Roosevelt saw the fleet's successful global voyage as one of his administration's major accomplishments by enhancing the role of the United States in international affairs. Few can deny the historical importance of President Roosevelt's decision to deploy the ``Great White Fleet'' around the world. 
   Seven of the 16 great battleships that constituted the ``Great White Fleet'' were built in my hometown of Newport News, Virginia at Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, today known as Northrop Grumman Newport News. Although the ``Great White Fleet'' demonstrated that America was an emerging seapower, the success of the ``Great White Fleet'' made Newport News and the Hampton Roads area a powerhouse for shipbuilding. One hundred years later, Northrop Grumman Newport News is still leading the way in the shipbuilding industry by building some of the most powerful and advanced ships for the United States Navy. Northrop Grumman Newport News has already begun work on the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, the newest  and most advanced generation of air craft carrier, to lead the U.S. Navy into the 21st century. 
   Mr. Speaker, the voyage of the ``Great White Fleet'' has proven to be a pivotal event in the history of this great Nation. While impacting the entire United States, the impression of the ``Great White Fleet'' can be most felt in Hampton Roads, Virginia. In addition to being home to one of the Nation's most important shipbuilding facilities at Newport News, the world's largest naval base is located just across the Hampton Roads in Norfolk, Virginia. The citizens of Hampton Roads should feel very proud about the role of our region in one of the most important nautical voyages in American history. I urge my colleagues to support this important concurrent resolution.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak today in support of the bill S. 1315, the Veterans Benefit Enhancement Act of 2007, which contains a provision that gives veterans' benefits to Filipinos who fought under the U.S. flag during World War II. 
   As the only Member of Congress with any Filipino ancestry, I'm pleased to speak today in support of these benefits for Filipino veterans. 
   Members of the Commonwealth of the Philippines' military were promised full veterans' benefits if they fought for the United States during World War II. Because of this promise, many Filipino soldiers fought tirelessly and courageously for the United States, and they helped us defeat the Japanese empire in the Pacific. 
   We have failed to fulfill our promise, and these veterans deserve the benefits that they were promised over 60 years ago. S. 1315 provides surviving Filipino veterans, all of whom are now in their eighties, with full veterans' benefits. 
   In honor of the service of the Filipino veterans, I urge the House of Representatives to act swiftly and to take up and pass S. 1315.

   I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 117, a resolution commemorating the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, Virginia, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Virginia's, and America's, First Congressional District (Mrs. Jo Ann Davis). 
   This is truly an exciting time for the Commonwealth of Virginia and our Nation as we commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America and the cornerstone of our Republic. I have been honored to be one of the representatives of the most historic region in America, and all of the members of the Virginia delegation have worked hard to ensure that Federal funds and services have been readily available to prepare for this historic occasion beginning back in 2000 with the establishment of the Federal Jamestown 400th Commemoration Commission. And I would like to specifically acknowledge the hard work of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis and her staff for their tireless efforts on behalf of Jamestown's 400th anniversary. 
   Mr. Speaker, the spotlight of the world is now shining on the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Queen of England visited our State capital in Richmond and the Jamestown settlement just last week to commemorate this historic event.     
   Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people from all over our Nation and from all over the world will descend on Virginia this year to celebrate our 400th anniversary. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to visit Jamestown this year and encourage them to support this concurrent resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1294, the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act. 
   I want to thank my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Moran) for introducing the bill, and the gentleman from West Virginia and the gentleman from Alaska for their leadership and cooperation in bringing the bill to the floor. 
   This year marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, Virginia, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Jamestown is the cornerstone of our great republic, and its success relied heavily on the help of the indigenous people of Virginia. Virginia's Native Americans played a critical role in helping the first settlers of Jamestown survive the harsh conditions of the new world. 
   After the Jamestown colony weathered the first couple of years in the new world, the colony expanded, and the English pushed further inland. The same Native Americans that helped those first settlers were coerced and pushed from their land without compensation. Treaties, many of which precede our own Constitution, were often made in an effort to compensate the Virginia Native Americans. But, unfortunately, as history has shown, those treaties were rarely honored or upheld. 
   Like many other Native Americans, Virginia Indian tribes were marginalized from society. They were deprived of their land, prevented from getting an education and denied a role in our society. Virginia's Native Americans were denied their very fundamental human rights and the very freedoms and liberties enshrined in our own Constitution. 
   This bill on the House floor today will finally grant Federal recognition to the Chickahominy Tribe, the Eastern Chickahominy Tribe, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, the Monacan Indian Nation, and the Nansemond Tribe. The bill will ensure the rightful status of Virginia's tribes in our Nation's history. 
   Federal recognition will also promote tribal economic development that will allow Virginia's tribes to become self-sufficient. Those same opportunities will allow Virginia's tribes to flourish culturally and economically, and will lead to a brighter future for a whole new generation. 
   We have waited too long to recognize Virginia's tribes. The time has come for Congress to act. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I think it's important to put up a chart so we will know who's saying what about fiscal responsibility, because this chart shows what happened in the nineties when, with President Clinton's veto vetoing Republican bills after the Democrats set the budget off in the right direction, we were able to create a surplus that when this administration came in in 2001, we had a projected $5.5 trillion surplus. As a result of Republican initiatives, that surplus looks like it's going to come in, a 10-year surplus, at about a $3 trillion deficit, a swing of $8.5 trillion. And to put that in perspective, we've spent about $500 billion in Iraq; $8.5 trillion deterioration of the budget, $500 billion in Iraq, that is $0.5 trillion; $8.5 trillion deterioration, $0.5 trillion attributable to the war. And the Democratic budget, again, responsibly digs us out of this mess. 
   The important thing to note is, we talk about 9/11. We were broke. We spent the surplus, other than Social Security and Medicare, before 9/11. So you can't blame 9/11 for the fiscal decline that has happened here. 
   This budget is responsible. It shows how we can dig ourselves out. Unfortunately, we have, first of all, no leadership from the White House. Even the Republican budget pretty much ignores the President's budget. The President's budget had us in a ditch, never coming into surplus. At least the Republican budget has us coming out of the deficit and into surplus in 2012, but it does it in such a way that is not responsible and not predictable. 
   The Republicans' budget assumes that we're going to whack about $250 billion out of Medicare and Medicaid, about $250 billion cut out of health care. This is at a time when doctors are telling us now that they can't absorb the cuts. We are having situations now when States are not paying dentists enough for dentists to even take Medicaid. $250 billion cut. It's not going to happen. We're not going to go into surplus under the Republican budget. 
   The main factor that we have to look at is, who's talking? The Democrats dug us out of the ditch; Republicans put us back in the ditch; and the Democrats are digging us out again with a responsible budget. The Republicans have a budget that is so draconian on health care that 40 Republicans even voted against the Republican budget.  
   And so we have a responsible plan. Let's stick with the responsible plan, dig us out of the mess again, and have fiscal responsibility.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, PAYGO is a very simple concept. If you are going to increase spending, you pay for it. If you are going to cut taxes, you pay for it. You don't go into the ditch. If you have a tax cut, you have to pay for it either with increases of other taxes or spending cuts to pay for it. If you have spending increases, you have to pay for it with cutting spending somewhere else or increasing taxes to pay for it. It is a very simple concept.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is the concept, and that is how we got out of the ditch that we got into. If you build up a surplus, then you have something to spend. That is consistent with PAYGO. 
   But the point is that we got out of the ditch with fiscal responsibility, and as soon as 2001 came along, you let PAYGO expire, passed tax cuts that we couldn't afford and put us right back into the ditch. The fact is that the only way the Republican budget makes any sense is if you have $250 billion in cuts, mostly in Medicare and Medicaid, at a time when we can't even afford the cuts that are already in effect. 
   To put that $250 billion in context, there are plans out there, including the All Healthy Children Act, which can cover all children with healthcare for $15 billion a year. You are talking about cutting healthcare $250 billion. Obviously, you are not going to do it and so obviously the budget is not realistic.  
   But what are your priorities? Tax cuts that we can't afford at a time when we need to cover children? We can't even afford the Medicaid program we have got now. In most States, you can't find a dentist because the reimbursement rates aren't high enough, and here we are cutting Medicare and Medicaid $250 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would hope that we would adopt the Democratic budget and reject the motion to recommit, because it requires us to assume $250 billion in cuts that we are not going to make. We have a responsible budget. It digs us out of the ditch that the Republicans put us in starting in 2001. 
   I would hope again we would reject the motion and adopt the Democratic budget as we passed it in the House.

   If you make a $1 million, $17,000; $650 if you make $200,000 to $1 million; $11 if you make $100,000 to $200,000; if you make less than $100,000, you get on average of zero.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Reconstruction fraud has run rampant during the engagement of the U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States has devoted more than $50 billion to relief and reconstruction activities there, and at least $8.8 billion cannot be accounted for. 
   Some of the reports of excessive profiteering are simply appalling. For example, one contractor was hired to build the Baghdad Police College, a facility to house and train more than 4,000 police recruits. After spending $72 million of U.S. taxpayer money, the contractor delivered an engineering nightmare with so many plumbing problems that auditors from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction said that during the visit a substance dripped from the ceiling onto an assessment team member's shirt. 
   It's not only construction. There are widely reported stories of contractors double-charging taxpayers for sodas and overcharging the government 600 percent for fuel shipments. 
   Another report has a company running convoys of empty trucks back and forth across an insurgent-laden desert, pointlessly risking the lives of soldiers and drivers so the company could charge the taxpayer for phantom deliveries. Truckers referred to their cargo as sailboat fuel. 
   Inspector Generals have opened hundreds of investigations into fraud and waste in Iraq and Kuwait and Afghanistan involving illegal kickbacks, bid-rigging, embezzlement and fraudulent overbilling. 
   The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has more than 70 open and active investigations in contracting fraud and abuse in the war. In addition, private whistleblowers have filed numerous civil claims involving Iraq fraud under the False Claims Act. 
   Despite the breadth of all of these investigations and civil claims, the Department of Justice has chosen to pursue a relatively small number of cases. To promote a more vigorous Department of Justice prosecution of reconstruction fraud, the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) has introduced H.R. 400, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007. 
   Although there are anti-fraud laws to protect against waste of U.S. taxpayers' money at home, no law specifically prohibits war profiteering or expressly confers jurisdiction of U.S. courts to hear the fraud cases when our forces and reconstruction efforts are deployed overseas. 
   To clarify the full reach of the U.S. jurisdiction to appropriately punish this conduct wherever it may occur, H.R. 400 would criminalize overcharging taxpayers to profit excessively with the intent to defraud the United States Government or any provisional authority, such as the former Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. 
   This crime would be a felony, with criminal penalties up to $1 million in fines and up to 20 years in prison. In addition to prohibiting fraud, H.R. 400 also criminalizes false statements in providing goods and services in connection with the war or reconstruction effort. This crime would also be a felony, subject to criminal penalties up to $1 million and up to 10 years in prison. 
   The bill before us makes a few technical changes to the bill that was reported out of committee. Among them is a deletion of a provision providing for an alternative fund of twice the gross profits or other proceeds of the crime. 
   This alternative fund essentially duplicates and would possibly displace a stronger current provision in the law, section 3571(d) of title 18 of the U.S. code, which applies to all crimes. 
   But also note that the bill explicitly provides for an extraterritorial jurisdiction. The inclusion of this provision is meant to make it abundantly clear that this statute reaches war profiteering crimes wherever they may occur. However, it is not intended and should not be interpreted to undermine the extraterritorial reach of any other Federal criminal statute. 
   H.R. 400 sends a resounding warning, which I hope would be heard and taken to heart by all relief and reconstruction contractors doing business with the U.S. Government or any provisional authority operating under our control, that is, that contracting fraud not only undercuts our missions overseas, it is illegal. If you engage in it, you can expect to be vigorously prosecuted. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in mourning the loss of one of the Commonwealth of Virginia's finest public servants, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis. She was a good friend and a tireless advocate for America's First District, as both she and the late Congressman Herb Bateman referred to the First Congressional District of Virginia. 
   Jo Ann was a self-made woman who came from modest roots. Born in North Carolina, she grew up in Hampton, Virginia, where her father was a city bus driver. She graduated from Hampton Roads Business College in 1971, received her real estate license in 1984, and received her real estate broker's license 4 years later. She was a successful business woman, having opened Davis Management Company in 1988 and Jo Ann Davis Realty in 1990. 
   Mr. Speaker, Jo Ann was not a career politician and probably never imagined that she would run for office and end up serving in the United States Congress for over 6 years. In 1997 she was reluctantly convinced by her friends to run for a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates. When our late colleague Herb Bateman announced his retirement from the House, Jo Ann mounted an underdog campaign. Notwithstanding the fact that she was outspent by a margin of 40 to one in the primary, she prevailed; and in November, 2000, she became the first Republican woman from Virginia elected to Congress. 
   While we had different political loyalties, we had no differences in our efforts to work together for the citizens of Hampton Roads. Jo Ann's service on the Armed Services Committee directly mirrored her commitment to the thousands of military personnel in her district. One of her first pieces of legislation that she introduced passed in 2001. It increased the amount of life insurance benefits for survivors of members of the U.S. Armed Forces killed in active duty. 
   Jo Ann was also a tireless advocate for the thousands of shipbuilders in her district that worked at Northrop Grumman Newport News, and she cofounded the Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus with Congressman Gene Taylor of Mississippi. That caucus has made a compelling case to the Department of Defense that it is pivotal for our national defense that the Navy spend more money on shipbuilding. In the last Congress, she was instrumental in efforts to secure funding for the refueling of the USS Carl Vinson. Without Jo Ann's hard work, the Hampton Roads area might have lost billions of dollars in economic revenue tied directly to that aircraft carrier. 
   Jo Ann placed a high priority on the removal of ships in the so-called James River ``Ghost Fleet,'' which posed a major environmental threat to the James River and the Chesapeake Bay; and as a result of her leadership, many of those ships have been removed. Together, we have worked to secure Federal funding for the Achievable Dream education program in Newport News to ensure that at-risk children have the best opportunity to succeed in school. 
   Mr. Speaker, every Member of this body was saddened to learn that Jo  Ann developed breast cancer in 2005 and even more so when the cancer returned this year. The sadness is especially felt by members of the weekly Congressional Prayer Breakfast, which Jo Ann and I regularly attended. Despite her personal battle with cancer, Jo Ann did not retire from Congress. She stayed and fought her cancer and continued to represent the people of the First District to the best of her ability until the very end. Learning from her own experience with cancer, she has encouraged her colleagues and her constituents to get screened regularly for all types of cancer. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Hampton Roads delegation has lost a tremendous advocate for the interests of our region. I want to extend my deepest sympathies to her husband of 33 years, Chuck Davis; their two grown sons, Charlie and Christopher; their granddaughter; and her wonderful staff with whom my staff has worked so well over the years. America's First District and the U.S. House of Representatives have lost a true friend and advocate with the passing of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis.

   Spoofing is one form of identity theft in which criminals coax victims into giving up their most sensitive personal information by making it appear that a call is coming from a legitimate institution such as a bank. Misleading caller ID information also allows a spoofer to cause a victim to accept a call they otherwise might have avoided, leading to harassment and further privacy intrusions. Advances in technology such as Voice-Over-Internet-Protocol have made caller ID spoofing easy and readily available. 
   H.R. 740 includes a number of important provisions to fight spoofing. The legislation creates a new Federal crime to prohibit using or providing false caller ID information with the intent to wrongfully obtain something of value. The section also prohibits using or providing the caller ID for information of an actual person without his or her consent and with the intent to deceive the recipient. It correctly targets spoofing done to perpetuate financial fraud, and reserves harsh punishment for such crimes, including felony penalties of up to 5 years in prison. 
   In addition, the bill significantly improves the tools available to law enforcement to fight noncommercial spoofing while preserving the legitimate uses of the technology. For example, women's shelters may use misleading caller ID numbers, and many businesses do if they are calling from one of many lines. They may want the caller ID information to just reflect the main line. The bill does not infringe on these instances because the caller would not possess the requisite intent to defraud or deceive. 
   Finally, the bill is narrowly tailored to permit caller ID blocking in which one prevents one's number from being known at all. Caller ID blocking is not used to mislead because a person knows he is not getting any number and it has been a standard telephone device for many years. 
   In sum, the PHONE Act will deter telephone fraud, protect consumers from harassment, and will enhance protection of sensitive personal information. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying this started as bipartisan legislation and has continued. The information was brought to us when the chief Republican counsel on the committee, Phil Kiko, received such harassment because his number had been used by somebody else making annoying calls. He got called back because his number was appearing as the caller ID. 
   Mr. Murphy introduced the bill last year and we have worked to improve the bill and have made significant improvements since last year. Chairman Conyers, Ranking Member Smith, and Ranking Member Forbes, we all worked very closely together to make sure that we could have the best product possible. I urge my colleagues to join together and pass the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (EDUCATION IS CRITICAL FOR TODAY'S YOUTH -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to discuss the important issue of education. Obtaining an education is critical for today's youth. An individual's prosperity and quality of life will be directly affected by the education they receive. 
   We all know the phrase, ``The more you learn, the more you earn.'' In addition to increased earnings, individuals with higher levels of education are less likely to be unemployed, less likely to need public assistance, and less likely to become involved in the criminal justice system. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's communities will also benefit by increased education. Those communities will suffer lower crime rates, have fewer people on welfare, and will benefit from a better economy. 
   In fact, we have found that in this global economy, our competitive advantage is in education because we can't compete on wages. There are people in countries around the world who work for pennies and a few dollars a day. We're not going to compete with that. 
   We can't compete because people don't have to be in the United States to work. If you can work with your coworkers from across the hall, you can work with your coworkers across the globe. All you need is a cell phone, a computer and a modem, a fax machine, you can work anywhere in the world. 
   You don't need to be close to your customers. You can manufacture your goods anywhere and send them anywhere else in the world almost overnight. 
   And you don't need to be in the United States to finance a new plant. Used to be you had to be here to finance a plant. With worldwide banking you can have that plant located anywhere in the world. 
   The competitive advantage we have is the fact that businesses know that they can get well-educated and well-trained workers if they locate in the United States. But unfortunately, we're losing that competitive advantage. 
   In a recent measure of high school achievement, we found that students in the United States ranked below dozens of other countries in math and science. And so we're losing that competitive advantage. And the Education and Labor Committee is, therefore, focused on improving our international standing. 
   Earlier this year, the House passed the bill to renew the Head Start program with renewed emphasis on early Head Start. These programs are critical to getting our children on the right path early in life and the earlier, the better. At the K-12 level, the committee is also working towards renewing the No Child Left Behind Act. We will be addressing issues in that bill, for example, finding ways to meaningfully measure and reduce the achievement gap; ensuring that all students have access to high-quality teachers, and to effectively improve those schools which fail to make adequate yearly progress. 
   One of the most critical issues that must be addressed in No Child Left Behind is the fact that approximately one-third of all high school students in the United States fail to graduate with their peers. And in some communities, as many as half of the students fail to graduate and find themselves on the path to hopelessness. 
   The Education and Labor Committee will also consider renewing the Higher Education Act, which is primarily focused on access to college. Last year, approximately 1 million qualified students did not go to college because they could not afford the cost. Since the 2001/2002 school year, tuition at a public 4-year college has risen 55 percent. But during that same period the maximum Pell Grant only went up about 8 percent, and in the last 4 years didn't go up at all. 
   Unfortunately, this means that many of today's students, unlike previous  generations, are being denied the opportunity to live to their fullest potential because they were denied the opportunity of a college education. 
   This year, the Education and Labor Committee is leading legislation that will significantly improve access to college with improved Pell Grants and cuts in student loans. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, education affects many issues that we deal with: economic competitiveness, crime and welfare. And so I'd like to thank the gentlelady from Michigan, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Ms. Kilpatrick, for organizing the effort to focus on education tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, we obviously have a crisis in the financial markets. Major firms have failed and others are failing. We are in an economic downturn with people losing their homes, businesses going under, and credit drying up for small businesses and consumers. The current crisis is the predictable consequence of the failed economic policies of the last 8 years. These policies are the ones that have produced record budget deficits, the worst job growth since the Great Depression--including our ninth consecutive month of job losses--and the worst Dow performance in over three decades. Congress should address the crisis with appropriate legislation. 
   The Senate bill that we considered today is not fundamentally different from the bill we voted on Monday, although some have attempted to change the name of the package from a ``bailout'' to a ``rescue.'' The foundation of the bill remained the outlay of $700 billion for the purchase of worthless assets. On balance, the final version of the bill was still not a good deal for taxpayers. 
   Whether or not the bailout act we voted on today was a ``good'' deal rises and falls on the issue of fair value. You cannot rationally determine the worthiness of a purchase, without first assessing what the fair value is, and whether you are paying more or less than that fair value. If the bailout legislation included a provision that would provide that the Federal Government would pay no more than the good faith estimate of the fair value for the assets, then it would be a good deal. Some of the assets we will be asked to buy are options, derivatives, and other exotic speculative investments that are in fact worthless. There is no public policy rationale to bail investors out of speculative securities that did not pay off. Since there is no commitment to calculating a good faith fair value price, and to paying no more than that price, this is a bad deal for the American people, because we will undoubtedly overpay for these assets. Therefore, the worthiness of the deal rises or falls on the commitment to limit payments to a fair value. 
   I am not suggesting that establishing a fair value of these assets will be easy. But there are well established factors in other situations to determine the value of assets when selling prices or bid and asked prices are not available. And it is our obligation as protectors of the U.S. Treasury to require that no funds should be spent without a reasonable assessment of what we are buying. 
   Furthermore we should not give unlimited discretion to buy assets at prices obviously higher than fair value to an administration frequently accused of cronyism and favoritism. 
   We are dealing with three separate but inter-related problems: illiquidity in the credit market; insolvency of some financial institutions; and the hardship of homeowners. Offering fair value prices for assets will address the issue of liquidity. If we limited purchasing prices to fair value, we could purchase assets, reestablish confidence, wait for the markets to reinvigorate and the private sector could then buy assets back from the Government. Even if it took more than $700 billion, as long as we were paying fair value, and receiving assets earning more than our borrowing costs, we could be confident that, in the long run, this solution would at least break even, and would likely make money for the taxpayer even if we held the assets to maturity. But since the bill provides no limit on the price we pay for assets, we will undoubtedly overpay, and lose money on the deal. If we paid fair value, we could solve the liquidity crisis without any likely cost to the taxpayers. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the act to restrict payments for assets to their fair value. 
   The problem with illiquidity which affects credit relates to lending institutions holding valuable but temporarily illiquid assets on their books. While there is no market for those assets, accounting regulators require the assets to be valued at virtually zero. Since lending authority is directly related to the institution's capital, this markdown significantly reduces lending authority, which leads to the credit crunch. This problem can be solved either by the government purchasing the assets at fair value or by a change in accounting regulations to allow assets to be booked at ``fair economic value'' rather than ``market value''. This administrative change in the ``mark to market'' rule would significantly increase lending authority at no cost to the taxpayer. In addition there are a handful of banks that have sufficient capital but not enough deposits to sustain lending authority; in those few cases, simply depositing federal funds in the bank would increase lending capacity. 
   Another factor affecting credit is the reluctance that banks have to lend money to other banks; for fear that the other bank might go broke without notice as several recently have done. This problem can be cured by the issuance of ``net worth certificates'' which would guarantee the net worth of a bank, for a fee which would insure that there would be no net cost to the taxpayer. This has been done successfully in the past. 
   There are other ways to instill confidence in financial institutions without spending any of the taxpayer's money. William Isaac, former head of the FDIC, has suggested that FDIC exercise the powers already granted to it by Congress. The FDIC can take emergency action and declare that no general creditor of a failed bank will suffer a loss if the bank fails. That declaration, when coming from the FDIC would, by statute, be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. This action would be a signal to the worldwide market that the full faith and credit of the United States stands behind our banks, and an influx of capital would soon follow. Another FDIC change would be to increase the limit at which FDIC insures deposits from $100,000 to $250,000. This would limit the destabilizing impact of major withdrawals from banks. This provision is not controversial and is actually in the bill. 
   Another factor which affects capital and therefore lending authority is the downward pressure on stock prices caused by short selling. Administrative action has already been taken to prohibit ``naked short sales'' and to restore the ``uptick'' rules. 
   After the bill was defeated on Monday, I worked with other members who were skeptical of the bill, to propose cost-effective solutions to the crisis. Representative Peter DeFazio has produced a bill, the No BAILOUTS, Bringing Accounting, Increased Liquidity, Oversight and Upholding Taxpayer Security Act, that outlines administrative changes that could be implemented at no cost to the taxpayer. The bill directs the administration to implement a net worth certificates program, adjust mark to market valuation rules, increase FDIC insurance limits, and regulate short sales. These no-cost changes would be more likely to have an impact on the domestic credit crunch than spending $700 billion purchasing worthless assets from all over the world. 
   Some argue that overpaying for assets will help solve the second problem of the crisis,  the insolvency of some financial institutions, by providing capital to these institutions. I believe that we should help financially troubled companies that have a good chance of stabilizing and coming back with our help. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the bill to stop companies in no distress, or companies that are hopelessly insolvent, from selling their toxic assets to the Government, and any overpayment for assets those companies sell will provide no value to the taxpayer. There are more efficient ways of targeting financial assistance to appropriate companies than making overpayments to all companies. 
   Congress does have an interest in assisting homeowners, but homeowners struggling to pay mortgages will find little comfort in this legislation. We should have included meaningful assistance for struggling homeowners in the bill. All homeowners would benefit because homeowners who are paying their mortgages on time have been hurt by home prices collapsing because of the flurry of foreclosures, and perspective homeowners are having difficulty finding new mortgages. The bill directs the Treasury Secretary to implement a plan to decrease foreclosures, ``to the extent that the Secretary acquires mortgages''. The problem is that the toxic securities that the Treasury is being asked to buy are not individual mortgages, but options, derivatives and other securities comprised of portions of hundreds and sometimes thousands of different individual mortgages. It is therefore unlikely that the Secretary will have the authority to change the mortgage terms and help prevent foreclosure in any significant number of actual mortgages. 
   There are many effective ways to actually help homeowners. In November 2007, Representative Joe Baca introduced H.R. 4135, the Family Foreclosure Rescue Corporation, FFRC. Representative Baca's bill is based on the concept of the Home Owner's Loan Corporation, HOLC. During the Great Depression, this Government entity was created to buy troubled mortgages, and then refinance the mortgages at rates the homeowners could afford, preventing more foreclosures and stabilizing housing prices. When HOLC ended operations in 1951, it had turned a profit to the taxpayer. H.R. 4135 would create the Family Foreclosure Rescue Corporation, FFRC, to refinance loans for people currently in foreclosure or in serious default. Families will be able to refinance their mortgage through a Government administered loan with a set interest rate. FFRC would assist homeowners paying on the mortgages that back many of the toxic assets the Treasury is being asked to buy. Providing stability in the mortgage market is a much more direct solution to the foreclosure problem than overpaying for worthless options and derivatives backed by the bad mortgages, and this strategy is much more likely to help struggling homeowners. The HOPE for Homeowners program, a Federal program established by the housing bill passed earlier this year, is another program designed to directly assist homeowners, and Congress could do more to encourage mortgage holders assist their mortgage payers and themselves by utilizing the program. Changes to bankruptcy rules that would allow homeowners to renegotiate the loan on their primary residence would be another provision that would help homeowners. 
   Although the major assessment of the core provisions of the bill rises and falls on the issues of fair price valuation and actual assistance to homeowners, there are other issues addressed in the legislation. The media has reported that there are provisions in this bill to limit executive compensation and to protect the taxpayer. The actual language in this bill does not support these reports. There are huge loopholes in the bill that allow companies to continue to pay executives exorbitant salaries. And, the taxpayer protections in the bill are flimsy. If the bailout does not pay for itself, the bill leaves it to a future administration to propose a bill to tax financial institutions to raise the money taxpayers have lost. In a Congress where there is outrage against any new tax proposal, if there is no political will to pay for the bailout in the middle of the crisis, there will be even less political will to raise taxes on financial institutions that may still be struggling in the future. 
   The failure of the bill to limit the purchase of any assets to the fair value of those assets means that the bill will not effectively address the underlying issues: purchasing worthless assets adds nothing to general liquidity; overpaying for assets from all companies is an inefficient way to help those companies who only need temporary assistance to survive; and overpaying for assets does nothing for homeowners. Furthermore, this bill will fail to instill confidence in the market when it becomes apparent that the language of the bill is unlikely to match the public description of the bill on CEO compensation, foreclosure prevention and protection of the taxpayer. For those reasons, I regret that I was unable to support the bill. 
   We should have drafted a new bill with the inclusion of many of the alternative proposals I have laid out in this statement. The result would have been a comprehensive bipartisan bill which targets our Federal assistance to the goals we need to address: illiquidity in the market, solvency for appropriate businesses, and assistance to homeowners. 
   By spending $700 billion ineffectively on this crisis now, we will not have funds to respond to the next phase of our financial crisis in the future. For example, homeowners are continuing to lose their homes, and we have done very little to stem the tide of that problem. And because of today's vote, we will have fewer resources to address that problem in the future. Furthermore, we must not forget that the underlying problem is that we are in an economic downturn, and our actions must be deliberate and measured if we are going to steer our way out of this mess. Unfortunately, we now have $700 billion less to address our economic situation. 
   There are many administration initiatives that require virtually no taxpayer money, which would have a huge impact on the banking crisis, the solvency of businesses, and the challenges of homeowners. We should have begun with proposing those no cost administrative changes, before we authorized the expenditure of $700 billion on a plan unlikely to make any difference at all.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we owe a duty to protect foreign nationals who provide valuable service to our soldiers, diplomats, and other government officials overseas. Often these individuals risk their lives and those of their families to assist and protect our endeavors and our people. It's only right that we give them the assistance and protection that they need. 
   When we pulled out of Vietnam, Vietnamese citizens who worked for our government, as well as their families, were at great risk of being killed if they remained in Vietnam. To protect them, we gave them the opportunity to resettle in the United States. That was the right thing to do then and it is the right thing to do now for those who help us in Iraq. 
   This bill addresses two problems that currently interfere with our ability to protect those who deserve our protection. The first is a drafting error in the new Special Immigrant Visa Program that we enacted in January for Iraqis whose lives were at risk because of their valuable service to our government. The visas under this program were supposed to be available beginning this fiscal year, but the drafting error has rendered these visas unavailable until the next fiscal year. In the interim, we can't help those who need our help. Many of those could die because of this drafting error. This bill would correct the drafting error to ensure that these visas can be immediately accessed.

   Mr. Speaker, again, we have seen ongoing news reports that those who have chosen to help us in our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan are risking their lives for our Nation's interests, and it is appropriate that we give them assistance. 
   This bill is exactly what we thought we had done earlier in the year. This is a technical correction. It's not a change in policy. It is what we thought we were doing. In fact, I'm surprised we have opposition because we didn't think it was controversial. The Senate bill, just to read the original cosponsors, the Senate bill was introduced by Senators KENNEDY and LUGAR with bipartisan cosponsorship of Senators LEAHY, CORNYN, BIDEN, MCCAIN, LEVIN, SPECTER, OBAMA, HAGEL, DURBIN, SUNUNU, CARDIN, SMITH, COLEMAN, and BOND. An identical bill was introduced in the House by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren) with original cosponsorship of Mr. Fortenberry, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Skelton, Mr. Hunter, Mr. Berman, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, Mr. Blumenauer, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, Mr. Perlmutter, Mr. Pence, and Ms. Jackson-Lee of Texas. 
   Obviously those broad bipartisan cosponsors suggest that this is something that should not be controversial, especially when you consider it also has the strong support of the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Department of Homeland Security. 
   I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that we adopt the bill and do what we thought we were doing in January to protect our friends who have protected us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, August 27 will mark the 100th anniversary of the birthday of Lyndon Baines Johnson, the 36th President of the United States. President Johnson served his home State of Texas and this Nation during some of the most tumultuous and extraordinary years of our history. From the Great Depression, to the New Deal, to World War II, to the Civil Rights Era, President Lyndon Johnson shaped the events and left this Nation more prosperous, more just, and more free. 
   Joining the House in 1937, his life embodied the values of the New Deal, progressive values that sought to secure for all Americans President Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms: Freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom of want, and freedom from fear. In his own Presidency, the programs of the Great Society were the most ambitious of any administration before or since the New Deal. 
   In his 1964 State of the Union Address, President Johnson launched an unconditional war on poverty. As a former teacher, he understood the central importance of education. And so he said, ``It is our primary weapon in the war on poverty, and the principal tool for building a Great Society.'' 
   Among his key accomplishments in the field of education were Project Head Start, still one of the most successful education programs; the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; and the Higher Education Act of 1965. As a son of Texas' Hill Country, he also understood the importance of economic security. He told the Nation, ``The second prong on the attack on poverty is to protect individuals and their families from poverty when their own earnings are insufficient because of age, disability, unemployment, or other family circumstances.'' 
   The programs he launched included the Social Security Amendments of 1965 and 1967; the Revenue Act of 1964, which lowered the withholding tax on middle-income workers from 18 percent to 14 percent; the Minimum Wage Bill of 1966, which broadened the Federal minimum wage and overtime pay protection and lifted the minimum wage from $1.25 to $1.60 per hour; the School Breakfast Program; the Special Milk Program; and the Food Stamp Program of 1964, which this House recently voted to expand by a bipartisan veto-proof margin. 
   The third weapon in the War on Poverty was job creation. President Johnson once said, ``Our American answer to poverty is not to make the poor more secure in their poverty but to reach down and to help them lift themselves out of the ruts of poverty and move with the large majority along the high road of hope and prosperity.'' The programs included the Job Corps; the College Work Study Program; the Neighborhood Youth Corps; the Work Experience Program; and the Manpower Act. 
   Some of the greatest accomplishments were, of course, the Civil Rights Era. More than any other President, he was a guiding force behind the enactment of civil rights legislation that changed our Nation forever. Following bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama, President Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress to urge the passage of the Voting Rights Act. He told the Nation then that, ``What happens in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and State of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life. Their cause must be our cause, too. Because it's not just Negroes, but really it's all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.'' He closed with the rallying refrain of the civil rights movement by saying, ``And we shall overcome.'' 
   Among his historic accomplishments were the Civil Rights Act of 1957, where, as leader of the Senate, he ushered through the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction; the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which this Congress recently extended for another 25 years; and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. These landmark measures guaranteed the right to vote for millions of Americans who had been disenfranchised for generations, and outlawed discrimination in public accommodations and in housing, and outlawed discrimination in employment. 
   President Johnson also made history when, in 1967, he appointed his Solicitor General, Thurgood Marshall, who, as the NAACP legal director from 1939 to 1961 had already argued many cases before the Supreme Court, including Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, to be the first African American Supreme Court Justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, the life and accomplishments of President Johnson should inspire all of us to rededicate ourselves to the mission to which he devoted so much of his energies, to free all Americans from want, from fear, and from discrimination. This resolution is a fitting recognition of his accomplishments and his lasting inspiration. 
   I want to thank the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) for bringing this to the floor today, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (GAS PRICE RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have seen the price of oil skyrocket, from about $50 a barrel only a year ago, to nearly $128 a barrel as of last week. The retail price of gasoline has likewise jumped and is now in the range of $4 a gallon. Americans are finding it increasingly more difficult to fill up their gas tank in the family car. 
   A number of factors undoubtedly contribute to this dire situation. Some might cite the war in Iraq which the President has waged for 5 years, which has both diverted trillions of dollars from more productive uses in our economy and, at the same time, contributed to the weakening of the dollar against other currencies. 
   Others will say that we should be devoting more resources to alternative fuels. But let's not overlook the elephant in the room. We have a dysfunctional marketplace for oil. We depend on a few large oil refining companies to supply gasoline. They have become even fewer and even larger as a result of a wave of mergers over the last decade or so. What's more, at the center of it all is an international oil cartel, OPEC. 
   The Gas Price Relief For Customers Act of 2008, introduced by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kagen) addresses that marketplace dysfunction in three important ways. 
   First, it clears away the dubious legal doctrines that have been twisted to prevent us from holding the OPEC cartel accountable under antitrust laws. It will now be clear that price fixing violates antitrust laws just as much when committed by OPEC as it does by other cartels. 
   Just last week, President Bush traveled to Saudi Arabia, hat in hand, to ask King Abdullah to relax just a little OPEC cartel's choke hold on the world oil marketplace. King Abdullah said no, he would not. 
   OPEC's concerted manipulation of world oil marketplaces calls for more than begging for help. It calls for full antitrust enforcement. Our antitrust laws are international in their reach, and over the years they've been used effectively against numerous cartels around the world to vindicate the rights of American consumers to receive the benefits of honest competition. There is no excuse for giving the most notorious cartel a free pass. 
   Second, the bill requires the Justice Department to establish a task force to better ensure that it is effectively monitoring all parts of the petroleum and petroleum products marketplace for anticompetitive practices that artificially restrict supply or inflate prices, such as, for example, the illegal manipulation of investments in the futures market. 
   Third, the bill requires GAO to take a retrospective look at oil industry mergers that were allowed to take place over the past decade to assess to what extent the resulting increase in market concentration has contributed to the high gas prices Americans are now paying at the pump. This will help inform Congress and the antitrust enforcers as to what needs to be done to better ensure a competitive gasoline marketplace going forward. 
   These three important steps we can take now to better ensure, to better secure lower market prices for gasoline that the honest competition will bring about for all Americans. 
   I would, again, like to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin Mr. Kagen for bringing this bill before us to the House. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it and reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume just to finally conclude by reminding you, Mr. Speaker, that this bill will just simply make sure that our antitrust laws apply to this oil cartel, just like they apply to every other industry. It is just one element in a strategy to try to get gas prices under control. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope we will support this bill, just as much as we did a virtually identical bill last May 22 when 345 of our colleagues voted in favor, only 72 opposed, an overwhelming majority. Even the Republicans supported the bill last year. It's rollcall 398. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Memorial Day is a solemn time when we, as a Nation, commemorate the ultimate sacrifice that our brave men and women in uniform have made for us. Sadly, there are  those who, despicable as it may be, desecrate the grave sites of these heroes. In cemeteries across our Nation, thieves have even looted the metal parts of grave markers and sold them for scrap metal. 
   Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3480, the Let Our Veterans Rest in Peace Act, which will protect and honor the final resting places of our Nation's veterans. This bill will ensure that penalties are in place so that these despicable thieves are appropriately punished and would-be thieves are effectively deterred. 
   Specifically, the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review its guidelines in order to provide a fitting sentence for all offenses involving the desecration of, theft of, or trafficking in a grave marker, monument, headstone, or other object that had permanently marked a veteran's grave site. 
   I commend our colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Carney), for his leadership in this unfortunately necessary measure. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, particularly as we prepare for the solemn observance of Memorial Day. These veterans have sacrificed greatly for us, and they deserve no less than the highest honor and dignity for their final resting places. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today we take urgent action to prevent a critically important immigration program from expiring. 
   No one disputes that there is a health care crisis in this country. With our  population aging, there can be no doubt that the demand for health care will only increase. 
   The problem is made worse by the fact that many people in communities across America lack access to health care because of a shortage of medical professionals, including doctors. H.R. 5571 will reauthorize the program, the Conrad 30 J Waiver program, that has been successful in helping medically underserved communities attract highly skilled physicians. If Congress does not act, the Conrad program will expire on June 1, 2008. 
   And how important is this program? Well, to take just one example, a little more than a year ago, in early May 2007, a powerful tornado tore through a Kansas prairie, destroying 95 percent of the town of Greensburg and killing 11 people. Because of the Conrad 30 program, doctors were available in Greensburg to serve this community in need. The Conrad 30 program allows States, like Kansas, to recommend that doctors who have received medical training in the United States on a J-1 visa and who now want to work in medically underserved areas receive waivers from the general requirement that doctors first return to their home countries for 2 years. This is too important a program to let expire. 
   I want to commend the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren), the Chair of the Immigration Subcommittee, for her leadership on this issue. I also want to thank the ranking member of the full committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith); and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) for their efforts to make sure that this bill came to the floor. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for her leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus. 
   We first need to start off with the Congressional Black Caucus of where we are. We were in a ditch in 1993 and Democratic policies dug us out of the ditch, and Republican policies put us right back into the ditch. This is where we are, and this is what we are trying to dig ourselves out of. 
   Now, we have gotten in this ditch. We just need to respond a little bit. We heard that we created all these jobs. Go back, this administration, count them up, add them, subtract them, add them up, tied for worst job performance since Herbert Hoover. This is what they are bragging about. 
   They talk about economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average for the last 4-year increments, this administration's 6 years has not done what anybody since 1980 has been able to do in 4 years. 
   They talk about increased revenues: you cut taxes, you increase revenues. Since 1960, only 2 years did we not set a brand-new revenue record, and then we set a new record the following year until we get to this policy. We have gone 6 consecutive years without new record revenues, three consecutive years in decline. That has never happened since they started keeping records in 1934. 
   What we do is we repeal part of what got us in the mess. This is one of the tax cuts we repeal, and you want to look and see, we call it tax cuts for the wealthy. They get mad, but this is who gets $20 billion in tax cuts that we repeal: over $1 million, $200,000 to $1 million, $100,000 to $200,000, under that zero. This is what you get. This is one of those that we repeal. We are able, after we repeal that, we use part of it for fiscal responsibility. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus deficit is better than the President's deficit every year. We balance and go into surplus in the fifth year. In the fifth year, we save $14 billion in interest alone compared to the President. 
   Now, we use the rest of that money to address our priorities: health care that we hear about, education, veterans, justice, making our communities safer, diplomacy. 
   Madam Chairman, just to close, let's see what we would have to do to go from the Congressional Black Caucus' responsible budget to the President's budget. We would have to cut $150 billion out of education. We would have to cut $100 billion out of child care, eliminating the promised health care for all children, putting 9 million children out in the street without any health care. We would have to whack $42 million out of the veterans' budget and many other priorities that we are going to describe in a few minutes.     
   Then we would have to borrow $339 billion, mostly from foreign countries, in order to fund tax cuts that primarily benefit that portion of a family's income over $200,000, that portion of the income under $200,000 virtually unaffected. To fund the tax cuts that put us in the mess that we are in, we would have to cut education, health care, veterans, other things, and then borrow $339 billion from foreign countries. That is a bad choice. 
   Fiscally responsible and address our priorities, that is the Congressional Black Caucus budget. We are proud of it and would hope that you would support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Chairman, we need to review, again, where we are, because we have heard lectures about fiscal responsibility, and this chart shows where we are in fiscal responsibility, way down in the ditch. 
   In fact, in 2001, we were on a trajectory to pay off the entire national debt by 2013. 
   The gentleman from Wisconsin had a chart that showed that by 2040 we would almost have enough money to pay interest on the national debt and a little bit of Social Security, and that was it. Well, the main change in that was interest on the national debt. There would be zero interest on the national debt if we hadn't gotten into this mess. 
   In fact, at this point, the gentleman talked about what he called entitlement reform. For those that aren't aware what entitlement reform means, that means cutting Social Security. 
   Well, in 2001, we had a 10-year surplus of $5.5 trillion. We needed $4 trillion at that point to make sure that we had enough money to pay Social Security for the next 75 years without cutting benefits. So we had entitlement reform covered. 
   The gentleman mentioned jobs that have been created: remind him, worst job performance since Herbert Hoover. The gentleman mentioned economic development: worst Dow performance in a quarter of a century. The gentleman mentioned all these revenues we have gotten: worst revenue performance in the history of recordkeeping back to 1934. 
   We repeal some of the policies, some of the policies that got us in the mess to begin with. This is one of the tax cuts that got us in the problem, and you can see who gets the benefits. But not only do we eliminate some of the tax cuts that put us in the mess, we are fiscally responsible. We use that to improve the deficit. Our deficit has improved, over the Democratic budget, $100 billion, over the President's budget, $300 billion. 
   And, finally, we saved so much that we saved interest on the national debt, $14 billion in the last year of the budget. And we are able to fund children's health care, enough money in our budget to fund health care for all children in America, enough in our budget to fund $158 billion more on education than the President's budget. 
   $158 billion. If you have a city, 300,000, $158 billion is enough for $158 million in additional funding for education over 5 years. Imagine what your city could do with $158 million. 
   We have enough for veterans, $42 billion more than the President's budget. We make sure that our cities and communities are secure with investments in gang prevention, juvenile justice, COPS and other programs in the justice area. We help our communities with community development grants, billions of dollars. Diplomacy. 
   That is a compassionate budget. It is compassionate, but it is also fiscally responsible. 
   Madam Chairman, we have a budget that gets us out of the mess that we got into. It compassionately invests in our priorities. It is a proud budget. 
   On behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, I ask for your support for the Congressional Black Caucus budget. I thank the gentlelady from Michigan for her leadership on this budget and particularly her leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (ANIMAL FIGHTING PROHIBITION ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 137 is a bipartisan effort by the Judiciary Committee, led by the gentleman from California (Mr. Gallegly) as the chief sponsor and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) as the lead Democratic sponsor. Both have worked long and hard on this issue. I would also like to express my appreciation to Chairman Conyers, Ranking Member Smith, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Forbes for their leadership and support in moving this matter forward, and also the former chairman of the committee, Mr. Coble, who is with us today. 
   The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007 addresses the growing problem of staged animal fighting in this country. It increases the penalties under the current Federal law for transporting animals in interstate commerce for the purpose of fighting and for interstate and foreign commerce in knives and gaffs designed for use in cockfighting. 
   Specifically, H.R. 137 makes violations of the law a felony punishable by up to 3 years in prison. Currently, these offenses are limited to misdemeanor treatment with the possibility of a fine and up to 1 year of imprisonment. Most States make all staged animal fighting illegal. Just one State currently allows cockfighting to occur legally. 
   The transport of game birds for the purpose of animal fighting and the implements of cockfighting are already prohibited by Federal law, though the current law only allows, as I have indicated, the misdemeanor treatment. In 1976 Congress amended title 7, U.S. Code, section 2156, the Animal Welfare Act, to make it illegal to knowingly sell, buy, transport, deliver, or receive a dog or other animal in interstate or foreign commerce for the purposes of participation in an animal fighting venture or knowingly sponsoring or exhibiting an animal in a fighting venture if any animal in the venture was moved in interstate or foreign commerce. Amendments to the Animal Welfare Act contained a loophole, however, that allowed shipments of birds across State lines for fighting purposes if the destination State allowed cockfighting. 
   While Congress did amend section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act to close this  loophole in 2002, the penalty section and other provisions of the act have not been updated since their original enactment in 1976. This bill is designed to address those shortfalls to more effectively cover modern problems associated with animal fighting ventures. 
   As I have already mentioned, the legislation increases current penalties to provide a meaningful deterrent. One of the primary reasons for enacting the increased penalties under title 18 is the reluctance of U.S. Attorneys to pursue animal fighting cases under the current misdemeanor provisions because they view the penalties as ineffective against an animal fighting industry, which has continued unabated nationwide. 
   H.R. 137 further makes it a felony to transport cockfighting implements in interstate or foreign commerce. These implements take the form of razor-sharp knives, known as slashers; or gaffs, instruments shaped in the form of curved ice picks that are attached to birds' legs for fighting. Proponents of these implements within the game fowl community apparently contend that they inflict cleaner wounds upon the birds which are then quicker and easier to heal. 
   Since penalties against animal fighting were codified in 1976, Federal authorities have pursued less than half a dozen animal fighting cases, despite the fact that the USDA has received numerous tips from informants and requests to assist with State and local prosecutions. 
   In addition, despite the fact that all 50 States have banned dog fighting and all but one State has banned cockfighting, the animal fighting industry continues to thrive within the United States. Numerous nationally circulated animal fighting magazines advertise fighting animals, and paid lobbyists continue to advocate for animal fighters' interests. Thankfully, H.R. 137 will seek to bring an end to these practices. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill affects matters within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture and the Judiciary Committee. Both committees have worked closely together to ensure that all matters are dealt with appropriately. We appreciate their assistance in bringing this bill expeditiously to the floor, and I will insert into the Congressional Record at this point an exchange of letters between Chairman Peterson of the Agriculture Committee and Chairman Conyers of Judiciary.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentlelady from California, Ms. S&#193;NCHEZ. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of H.R. 137, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007, because it is time for the Federal Government to up the ante in its efforts to curb this cruel and gruesome abuse of animals. 
   The current misdemeanor penalties in Federal law have not been effective. They are considered a cost of doing business by the animal fighting industry, which continues to operate across the country. 
   This bill addresses the growing problem of animal fighting by amending Federal law to prohibit moving animals through interstate commerce for the purpose of fighting. 
   Do we want to make a Federal case out of this? Yes, we do. Those who profit from animal fighting often drug dogs and roosters to make them hyper-aggressive and to keep fighting even after suffering severe injuries. The animals are in a closed pit from which they cannot escape. Often, they die during the fight. This is a gruesome and inhumane practice. The American people agree. Dog fighting is illegal in 50 States and cockfighting is illegal in most. 
   Current law is simply not strong enough. Animal fighting often leads to additional criminal behavior. It is associated with illegal gambling, narcotics trafficking, public corruption, gang activity, and violent behavior toward people. 
   The National Sheriffs' Association supports the legislation, and more than 400 individual sheriffs and police departments in every State in the country have endorsed it. They recognize that animal fighting often involves movement of animals across interstate  and foreign borders, and they can't do the job on their own. They need the Federal Government to do its part to curb this dangerous activity. 
   I am proud to be a part of this bipartisan effort to curb this appalling treatment of animals. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes on H.R. 137.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today to congratulate the NAACP on its 99th Anniversary. As the Nation's oldest civil rights organization, the NAACP has for 99 years fought to ensure the educational, social, economic and political equality of all persons, so that all may participate and share in this country's great Democracy. 
   The NAACP was founded by a multi-racial group of activists who answered ``The Call'' to engage in a national conference to discuss the civil rights of African Americans in the summer of 1908. That year, the NAACP embarked on its mission to ensure equal rights for all citizens and to eliminate racial prejudice in the United States. 
   Since then, the NAACP has worked tirelessly to accomplish its mission by continually looking for ways to improve the democratic process and by seeking the enactment and enforcement of Federal, State, and local laws that secure civil rights. The NAACP furthers its mission by making the public aware of the adverse effects of racial discrimination and by seeking its elimination. The NAACP also seeks to educate the public about their constitutional rights and goes to court to enforce those rights when necessary. 
   Shortly after its founding in the early 1900s, the NAACP undertook an anti-lynching campaign and launched a public protest when segregation was introduced into the Federal Government. The NAACP was influential in President Harry Truman's decision to issue an Executive Order in 1948 ending discrimination by the Federal Government. In 1954, the NAACP helped bring an end to segregation in public schools in the case of Brown v. Board of Education. In 1964, it worked to raise support for the passage of the Civil Rights Act. In 1979, it helped expand voter participation through voter registration in high schools. And the list goes on. 
   Today, the NAACP continues to eliminate racial prejudice when it rears its ugly head, and informs the public of its intolerable presence when it does. It continues to act as a watchdog to protect the constitutional and civil rights of all people. And it educates the public about civil rights so that future generations will know tolerance and equality as the norm, rather than the exception. 
   I am proud to be a Diamond Life Member of the NAACP and to have once served as President of the Newport News, Virginia branch. 
   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the NAACP on 99 years of service to our great country and its people, and I wish them another highly successful 99 years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This amendment would restrict funds in the bill from being used to fund the Random Student Drug Testing program run by the U.S. Department of Education. The amendment would allow, however, the evaluation of the program being conducted by the Department to continue, and if the evaluation shows that the program is cost effective, the funding would be restored. 
   For the past several years, the Department has been using money designated for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program to conduct random school-based student drug testing programs.     
   The problem is, Madam Chair, that this program has been studied and found ineffective. In 2003, the National Institute on Drug Abuse conducted a study that found that there was no difference between drug use in schools that tested for drugs and those that did not. The study found that the drug testing at schools did not affect either the prevalence or frequency of drug use. 
   Furthermore, such testing is very expensive. The cost of these tests can range between $10 and $75 each. Indeed, one school conducting random drug testing found that only a small fraction of its students actually tested positive, resulting in a cost of over $3,000 for every positive result. 
   My amendment would prohibit money from being spent on the drug testing program until the program has been shown to be cost effective, because we should not be spending taxpayer dollars on programs that are not cost effective. At this point, the drug testing program has not been proven to meet that standard. This amendment would prohibit the Department from wasting the taxpayers' money on student drug testing until the Department shows that the program is cost effective. 
   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin, who I believe will insist on his point of order.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I would like to thank the lady from Ohio for convening this Special Order so that we can talk about the great weekend that we had. 
   The gentleman from Florida, KENDRICK MEEK, did a tremendous job as chairman of the foundation. CAROLYN CHEEKS KILPATRICK from Michigan did a great job as chairman of the caucus; DONNA CHRISTENSEN from the Virgin Islands and G.K. BUTTERFIELD of North Carolina leading the legislative weekend. 
   We had dozens of important legislative seminars, foreign affairs, armed services and veterans, transportation, health care, education, housing, social services, financial issues, civil rights, voting rights. Every aspect of legislation that you can imagine, we had the nationally recognized experts. They were open to the public, the public had an opportunity for questions and answers and input. These were great workshops. I participated in four of them. The town hall forum entitled ``The Cradle to Prison Pipeline'' that talked about the unfortunate situation where so many of our young people start off and gradually, slowly but surely, get in trouble, drop out of school and end up in prison, and how with appropriate investments, strategic investments we can change that pipeline to a cradle-to-college pipeline, which is so much better for humanity, so much better for our communities, and that we could do that in a cost effective way. 
   I participated in a budget forum where we had budget experts talk about the fact that in 1993 we began eliminating the deficit. By the year 2000 we had gone into surplus. And, in fact, in 2001, we had a projected $5.5 trillion surplus over 10 years, and how, unfortunately, over the last few years we have converted that $5.5 trillion surplus to a $3 trillion deficit, a swing of $8.5 trillion. And how, with appropriate changes and some of the changes we're trying to make in Congress today, we can change that back to where we have the surplus and save Social Security, invest in health care, education and other important investments. 
   We had a great workshop on education with the education brain trust. We had one session on desegregation of schools and how, notwithstanding the Seattle and Louisville cases, we can still, with a little hard work, make sure those schools are desegregated. 
   We focused on the importance of early childhood education and the elementary and secondary education and Higher Education Act. We were able to make sure that we invested appropriately in education to make sure that we have a better community. 
   We also had another workshop on the judiciary, juvenile justice and the importance of making the choice between reducing crime and playing politics. We need to make sure that we reduce crime. You were very active in law school admissions, to make sure that law schools' admissions policy was not discriminatory. 
   Great workshops, judiciary, education, budget. The other important workshops. It was a great educational weekend. 
   Madam Chair, I would like to thank you for your hard work and leadership and also the ability to bring us together so that we could discuss the great work that was done over the weekend. 
   Thank you very much, and I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the College Cost Reduction Act and the rule which makes in order the manager's amendment to the bill. I would like to thank Chairman Miller and Subcommittee Chairman Hinojosa for their work on this bill. 
   We know that higher education is crucial, not only to the individual but also to our Nation. We know, for example, that the more you learn, the more you earn. We know that those who are in college are much less likely to be involved with welfare, much less likely to be involved in crime. Education is critical for our national economy. We know that the economic future of the United States depends on the success of our higher education policy. 
   We live in a high-tech, high-information economy, so the number of college students that we have will be an important economic resource. We can't afford to have any of our children fail to achieve full potential because they were not able to afford to go to college. 
   There are many improvements in the bill. The cost of education through student loans will be made more affordable. There are significant increases in Pell Grants. One of the major increases, the first in the last 4 years, $500 over the next 4 years, will be the increase in the maximum Pell Grant award. We know this is critical, because in the last 6 years, the cost of college education has gone up about 55 percent, but in the last 4 years, the Pell Grant didn't go up at all. 
   This bill makes significant investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority-serving institutions. A significant portion of the students at these colleges and universities are first-generation students. We know they often come from low-income families, so support of these institutions is critical. We know that these colleges offer an opportunity that otherwise would not be there. 
   This bill also makes improvements in Upward Bound. It provides additional funds for Upward Bound because many qualified Upward Bound programs were not funded this year because the program just ran out of money. Upward Bound focuses on those who have the potential to go to college but may not, just because they don't think they are expected to go to college. This bill makes critical improvements in the Upward Bound program and makes sure that those qualified programs can get funded. 
   Mr. Speaker, the College Cost Reduction Act will reduce the cost of going to college. It will enable many to go to college that otherwise could not have afforded to go to college. Chairman Miller's amendment makes improvements to the bill, and therefore I support the rule and support the bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois for scheduling this special order on the Second Chance Act and for his long and diligent labors to move the bill forward as part of his lifetime of dedication to protecting and serving the public's interest. 
   He has been a dedicated public servant on this issue, ensuring that those who are in prison have a chance to turn their lives around and become productive citizens. That is why he is the chief sponsor of the Second Chance Act. 
   Congressman Davis' efforts not only benefit the offenders, because for everyone who comes out and establishes a law-abiding and productive life, one or more potential victims of crime never become victims, and the taxpayers have to pay less in prison expenses because one less person is not going back to prison. 
   This is the third Congress in a row that we have been working on this bill on a bipartisan basis. I believe this year we will be successful in passing the bill. 
   Madam Speaker, over the last decade we have seen an unprecedented explosion in our prison and jail populations. Now there are more than 2.2 million people incarcerated in Federal and State prisons and local jails, a tenfold increase since just 1980. Moreover, the annual expenses for corrections have increased from $9 billion in 1982 to more than $65 billion today. The figures continue to grow. These figures do not include the cost of arrest and prosecution, nor do they take into account the cost to victims of crime. 
   As a result of this focus in incarceration, the United States leads the world in per capita incarceration rates. The United States locks up 726 inmates for every 100,000 in population, according to 2004 data. 
   The international average is about 100 per 100,000. 142 in England and Wales, 117 in Australia, 116 in Canada, 91 in Germany, 85 in France. So the United States average is more than seven times the international average of about 100 per 100,000. The closest competitor is 532 inmates per 100,000 in Russia. That is 726 in the United States, Russia, second place, 532 per 100,000. 
   This year, more than 650,000 people will be released from State and Federal prisons to communities nationwide, along with more than 9 million people leaving our local jails. According to the Department of Justice, 67 percent of offenders leaving State and Federal prison will be rearrested within the next 3 years. 
   There is a pressing need to provide ex-offenders with education and training, drug treatment and medical and mental health services necessary to afford them the ability to obtain and hold steady jobs. 
   The statistics underlying the needs of our prison population are staggering. For example, 57 percent of Federal and 70 percent of State inmates used drugs regularly before prison, with some estimates going as high as 84 percent of alcohol or drug use at the time the offense occurred. 
   Furthermore, one-third of all jail inmates will have some physical or mental disability. Twenty-five percent of jail inmates in fact have been treated at some time for mental or emotional problems. And as has been detailed by many researchers, other deficiencies include limited education and few job skills or job experience. 
   Evidence from the Department of Justice indicates that the needs for prison population are not being met under the current system. If we allow them to return to their communities with few economic opportunities where they were actually involved in crime and where their friends and associates may still be involved in crime and substance abuse, if we allow them to return to those communities without support, we can only expect to see the extension of the cycle of recidivism. 
   With bipartisan support in this legislation, we are set to build a broad web of programs which will help break the cycle of recidivism laying at the heart of our prison population explosion. The Second Chance Act provides a host of evidence-based approaches designed to reduce the high rate of recidivism that we are now experiencing. 
   If we are going to continue to send more and more people to prison with longer and longer sentences, we should do as much as we reasonably can to assure that when they do return to their communities, they don't turn around and commit new offenses and have to go back to prison. 
   Madam Speaker, let's be clear: The primary reason for supporting the Second Chance Act is not to benefit the offenders, although it does benefit the offenders. The primary reason for doing so is it better assures us that we and other Members of the community will not be victims of crime in the future and because the taxpayer will have to pay less in services under the Second Chance Act than we now have to pay because of the high recidivism rate and having people go back to prison. 
   So I want to thank again the gentleman from Illinois for holding this special order to bring attention to this important issue and the legislation that has been carefully drawn up to address it. I thank Mr. Davis for being the chief sponsor of the Second Chance Act. We are going to work as hard as we can to make sure it passes the House and the Senate.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra) for introducing this resolution that salutes Grand Valley State for their recent victory over the Northwest Missouri State Bearcats in the NCAA Division II national football championship in December. 
   Grand Valley State was led by quarterback Cullen Finnerty, who completed 15 of 33 passes for 225 yards and rushed for 115 yards on 22 carries for 340 yards of total offense, becoming the first quarterback in the history of the NCAA Division II national football  championship to pass for more than 200 yards and rush for more than 100 yards. 
   The game also saw tremendous plays by Bill Brechin, who made two first quarter interceptions. 
   I would also point out that Northwest Missouri State University also played an excellent game, and I congratulate them for their effort. 
   The Lakers are no strangers to this championship, having won in 2002, 2003 and 2005. It is also the second year that the Lakers have defeated the Bearcats in a championship game. 
   Much is due to the coaching of Chuck Martin, who was named Division II Coach of the Year for the second year. Clearly, the Lakers deserve to be recognized by the House for their outstanding accomplishments on the football field, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 182 is a resolution commending and congratulating Virginia State University on the occasion of its 125th anniversary. H. Res. 182 was introduced by my colleague from Virginia from the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia, Mr. Forbes. 
   Virginia State University was founded on March 6, 1882, as the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, making it the first fully State-supported 4-year institution of higher learning for African Americans. Today, it is one of Virginia's two land-grant institutions. 
   The first president of Virginia State University was John Mercer Langston who upon his election to Congress in 1890 was the first African American elected to Congress and, until my election in 1992, had been the only African American elected from Virginia. 
   In 1935, Virginia State University founded a 2-year satellite school at Norfolk, Virginia. That school today is known as Norfolk State University. 
   Today, Virginia State has an enrollment of nearly 5,000 students who live and learn on a 236-acre main campus overlooking the Appomattox River in Chesterfield County, Virginia. The school also has a 416-acre agricultural research facility. 
   The University's academic programs include the ``Bridges to Baccalaureate'' program for students transferring from 2-year colleges who want to major in science, as well as the Honda Campus All-Star Challenge and the Ronald E. McNair Scholars Program for students planning to pursue doctoral degrees. 
   Virginia State has helped set the standard for minority-serving institutions in Virginia and across the Nation by providing quality higher education opportunities for 125 years. 
   My family has a proud Trojan tradition. My mother attended Virginia State, my older brother is a graduate of Virginia State, and I am honored to have an honorary degree from Virginia State. 
   So I congratulate Virginia State University on its 125th anniversary and wish them another successful 125 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 312, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule because it makes in order the Congressional Black Caucus alternative. The Congressional Black Caucus budget offers this Congress and the American people the choice between fiscal and moral responsibility and tax cuts for the wealthy. Under the stewardship of the Congressional Black Caucus alternative, the Federal budget returns to balance, as this chart show, in the fourth year and the fifth year. The President's budget is in red, in deficit, all the way through. It even returns to deficit in the fifth year. 
   If compared to the President's budget, we save $564 billion better on the bottom line. In fact, we save so much that we save $48 billion in interest compared to the President's budget. At the same time, we provide significant funding for essential priorities, for example, education, health care, veterans, justice programs, all much better funded under the Congressional Black Caucus budget than the President's budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have heard that we do this by canceling the tax cuts that got us in the fiscal mess that we are in today, except for those tax cuts that primarily affect that portion of your income under $200,000. Now, canceling those tax cuts has been called the greatest tax increase or whatever they want to call it. Mr. Speaker, all we are doing is canceling the tax cuts that got us in the ditch. When these tax cuts first passed, we had a projected surplus of $5.5 trillion for a 10-year budget. Those 10 years look like they are going to come in at a $3 trillion deficit. 
   We haven't created jobs at the same time. We have a choice. We can have fiscal responsibility and address our important needs, or we can fund those tax cuts for the wealthy. The Congressional Black Caucus chooses fiscal responsibility and a morally supportable budget addressing our priorities. And therefore, I support the rule that makes the Congressional Black Caucus budget in order.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, last night we considered a bill that the Director of National Intelligence said provided everything we needed. We didn't pass that bill, and here we are today. 
   This bill, unfortunately, does more than what's needed. It really lets the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to kind of use their imagination to decide when surveillance is appropriate without any meaningful review. 
   This bill will allow warrantless collection of personal data, e-mails, Internet usage, and allows the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to do data mining, Internet usage monitoring, reading e-mails or otherwise acquiring information on every American, even domestic communications, as long as they determine that the surveillance is gathering foreign intelligence, that's not terrorism information, that's anything involving diplomacy, concerning someone abroad, not someone who is abroad. It could be a conversation, if the conversation concerns someone abroad. It's helpful just to read the language of the bill. 
   Section 105(b)(a), notwithstanding any other law, the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General may, for periods of up to 1 year, authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States if the Director of National Intelligence and Attorney General determine, based on information, so on and so forth, that, among other things, that the information that they are gathering is that a significant purpose is the acquisition of foreign intelligence, doesn't even have to be the main purpose, just a significant purpose. 
   There is no meaningful oversight. They just have to determine that and put it in writing. Then they can listen in. 
   In terms of the reverse targeting, the language that the gentleman used makes it clear that if they are talking to somebody outside, they can listen to someone domestically.

That's true, it doesn't include wiretap, but it does include searches, e-mail review, all kinds of data mining so long as it's not electronic surveillance. 
   This is overly broad. It can happen in the United States so long as it concerns someone we reasonably believe to be outside of the United States. It doesn't even have to be the primary purpose of the search. It can be a significant purpose of the search.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS--Continued -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, it is the unfortunate reality that the House of Representatives has seen its share of unethical behavior on the part of public officials elected to represent and serve their constituents. Moreover, this problem is not one confined to Democrats or Republicans. Rather, it is a problem that we all need to recognize and take steps to address. 
   For these reasons, and with the interest of the American people in mind, we need a fair and just manner to investigate any allegations of unethical behavior by a Member of the House. With this goal in mind, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) introduced H. Res. 895, and I support his efforts. 
   H. Res. 895 takes every possible step to ensure equality, fairness, and nonpartisanship in addressing questions of ethics. It establishes a new independent Office of Congressional Ethics within the House of Representatives to be governed by a board that will be comprised of six members jointly appointed by the Speaker of the House and the minority leader. 
   To further ensure fairness and prevent preferential treatment, current Members of the House of Representatives and lobbyists are not eligible to serve as board members. Moreover, removal of a board member may only occur with the approval of both the Speaker and the House minority leader. 
   The Office of Congressional Ethics could include former Members of the House, but all of the members of the board would be qualified by virtue of their exceptional public standing. This office has the potential to clean up politics and, in turn, restore the public's faith in politics in the political process. 
   This has the support of Common Cause, U.S. PIRG, and two very well-respected scholars in government and politics, Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute and Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. 
   I support H. Res. 895 and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this reform.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from California for her leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, before we can even consider sending more of our young men and women into harm's way, we must first determine what our mission is in Iraq. Only then will it be possible to intelligently discuss the number of troops necessary to meet that mission. But 4 years after going to war in Iraq, the administration has yet to clearly articulate a mission. Without a mission and a strategy with a credible chance of success, we should not even be discussing an increase in troop levels. 
   Mr. Speaker, before we respond to the President's call for an escalation of the war in Iraq, we must first put his speech in the context of the history of the war in Iraq. We need to begin with a discussion of what the current 130,000 troops are doing in Iraq now before we can discuss what 20,000 additional troops might do. 
   The original reasons which were provided as the rationale for going to war, Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi leaders were connected with the 9/11 attacks, and that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the United States, all turned out not to be true. 
   We have found no weapons of mass destruction, and we know that Iraqi leaders were not connected with the 9/11 attacks. And we were told before the invasion into Iraq that, in the opinion of the CIA, Iraq posed no imminent terrorist threat to the United States. In fact, a letter from the Director of the CIA to the Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, dated October 7, 2002, specifically stated that the CIA believed that Iraq and Saddam Hussein did not pose a terrorist threat to the United States and would not be expected to pose such a threat unless we attacked Iraq. 
   Last night, the President once again attempted to associate our presence in Iraq with the so-called war on terrorism. The truth is that our presence in Iraq has actually increased our risk to terrorism. Furthermore, the term ``war on terrorism'' is a rhetorical term without any relationship to reality. ``Terrorism'' is not an enemy; it is a tactic. The enemy is al Qaeda. We attacked Afghanistan because al Qaeda was there. 
   But after the initial reasons turned out to be false, we have been subjected to a series of excuses for being in Iraq, such as the need to capture Saddam Hussein, the need to capture al-Zarqawi and the need to establish a democracy. 
   Well, Saddam Hussein was in jail for almost 2 years before he was recently hanged. Al-Zarqawi was killed over 6 months ago, and Iraq held Democratic elections over a year ago. Yet we remain in Iraq, with no apparent end in sight. And here we are talking about increasing, not decreasing, troop levels. 
   So what are we doing in Iraq? Why did we go in? What do we expect to accomplish? And what will our strategy be for getting out? After we receive truthful answers to these questions, we can intelligently discuss appropriate troop levels. 
   Last night, the President said he was laying out a new mission for Iraq, thereby clearly acknowledging that whatever the old mission was, it wasn't working. But there is still no clearly defined end goal and clearly defined explanation of how failure or success can be measured. So we remain where we were before the speech, which is on an unclear, undefined path, while continuing to put more troops in harm's way. 
   If our mission is to stabilize Baghdad, military experts have already said that an additional 20,000 troops is woefully insufficient, so sending these troops will not accomplish that goal. And what happens if Iraq fails to meet its responsibilities, or Baghdad remains unstable and the price is more American deaths? Will we send even more troops? Or will we just cut and run? 
   And how will we know the new initiative will work? Before our invasion into Iraq, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld predicted that the war would last, and I quote, ``six days, six weeks. I doubt 6 months.'' It has been almost 4 years, and we are still in Iraq with no end in sight. 
   At the outset of the war, the administration advised the House Budget Committee that it expected the cost of  the war to be so minuscule that it advised the committee not to include the cost of the war in the Federal budget, and the administration official who suggested that the cost of the war might exceed $100 billion was fired. 
   To date, the cost of the war to the United States is over $375 billion, with no end in sight. Over 3,000 courageous Americans have already lost their lives. How many more will die if this new strategy falls as far from the predicted result as the original time and cost estimates? We need to be honest in clearly stating the likelihood that this initiative might fail. 
   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, as far as developing a new mission and strategy, it is imperative that we ask where these additional troops will come from. Many will have to come from the National Guard and Reserve, and the escalation will mean longer and multiple deployments. But our troops already in Iraq have served for above-average deployments, and many have already completed multiple tours. Other troops may be redeployed from other assignments. So we must ask what moving these troops will mean to our global national security. We cannot assess the wisdom of an escalation without first answering these critical questions. 
   We need to develop a coherent plan for Iraq, and that can only begin with truthfully acknowledging our situation there. Unfortunately, all we have gotten from this administration is essentially ``Don't worry, be happy. Success is around the corner. And if you don't believe that, then you are not patriotic.'' 
   Last November, the American people sent a powerful message that they wanted a real change in Iraq, not more of the same. This Congress needs to hold substantive hearings on why we entered Iraq in the first place, what the present situation is, what we can now expect to accomplish and what the strategy is to accomplish it, and only then can we intelligently discuss the troop levels necessary to accomplish that goal. 
   It is absurd to discuss troop levels first before we have answers to these critical questions. The American people and our courageous men and women on the front lines deserve a clear, articulated and sensible approach to ending the war in Iraq. Starting with an escalation of military forces is a step in the wrong direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to offer my deepest sympathies to the victims and their families who suffered the horrific shooting tragedy at Virginia Tech on Monday morning. My thoughts and prayers go out to them, the students, faculty and staff of the university. 
   Virginia Tech is one of the largest schools in Virginia, providing higher education to more than 28,000 students. The effects of this tragedy can be felt all across the Commonwealth of Virginia, in the Halls of Congress and in every corner of this Nation. I represent hundreds of Virginia Tech families, perhaps thousands of alumni, and members of my staff have friends and family who currently attend Virginia Tech. 
   Schools are meant to be sanctuaries of learning and, most importantly, sanctuaries of safety. Parents who send their children off to college with all the potential that a college education represents should be content that their children will be safe. 
   As we mourn with the Virginia Tech community, this Congress must explore every possible avenue towards determining what can be done to prevent this kind of tragedy in the future, whether in high schools or college campuses or on business premises or other places where people may congregate. Yet we must be realistic. From what we are hearing regarding this tragic incident, it is not clear that any law would have been effective in deterring the kind of senseless acts that occurred. Anyone willing to indiscriminately shoot down innocent people and then kill themselves afterwards would not likely be deterred by any law. Nonetheless, we must work with our colleges and universities in developing ways to anticipate, identify and prevent any such threats that we can. Some evidence is emerging that indicates that there may have been signs of mental disturbances in the alleged shooter, and this may suggest information which could lead to things to look at to avoid these tragedies in the future. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, today we stand together to wish a speedy recovery for the injured and to mourn with the families of the victims who died in this horrific tragedy. Virginia Tech is and will remain one of the Commonwealth of Virginia's finest institutions of higher learning, and its proud traditions will carry on beyond this darkest hour. This event will be with the students, faculty and staff of Virginia Tech for the rest of their lives, but we must not let tragedies like this stop people from living their dreams. I hope that some day all members of the Virginia Tech community will be able to celebrate life and learning on the campus again. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce into the Record the powerful statement presented at the service yesterday at Virginia Tech by Nikki Giovanni. That service was attended by nine of the eleven members of the Virginia delegation to Congress and both of our U.S. Senators. So I will insert that statement into the Record.  
   We are Virginia Tech. 
   We are sad today, and we will be sad for quite a while. We are not moving on, we are embracing our mourning. 
   We are Virginia Tech. 
   We are strong enough to stand tall tearlessly, we are brave enough to bend to cry, and we are sad enough to know that we must laugh again. 
   We are Virginia Tech. 
   We do not understand this tragedy. We know we did nothing to deserve it, but neither does a child in Africa dying of AIDS, neither do the invisible children walking the night away to avoid being captured by the rogue army, neither does the baby elephant watching his community being devastated for ivory, neither does the Mexican child looking for fresh water, neither does the Appalachian infant killed in the middle of the night in his crib in the home his father built with his own hands being run over by a boulder because the land was destabilized. No one deserves a tragedy. 
   We are Virginia Tech. 
   The Hokie Nation embraces our own and reaches out with open heart and hands to those who offer their hearts and minds. We are strong, and brave, and innocent, and unafraid. We are better than we think and not quite what we want to be. We are alive to the imaginations and the possibilities. We will continue to invent the future through our blood and tears and through all our sadness. 
   We are the Hokies. 
   We will prevail. 
   We will prevail. 
   We will prevail. 
   We are Virginia Tech.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I would like to thank the chairs of the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee for their hard work in addressing the issue of warrantless surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and for introducing legislation that addresses national security challenges presented by global terrorism. 
   This bill provides that any wiretap which would be legal under the President's proposal will be legal under this legislation. It merely requires that under some circumstances that a warrant be obtained prior to the wiretap or if there is an emergency after the wiretap begins. The warrant procedure is a modest protection of our civil liberties. 
   This bill does not balance civil liberties with national security, because all of the wiretaps would be permitted; but this bill just provides a little oversight. The idea of wiretaps without oversight has to be considered in the context of some recent documents of the Department of Justice. 
   Republican-appointed officials have accused this administration of firing U.S. Attorneys because they did not indict Democrats in time to affect an upcoming election. We have been unable to ascertain the truth of the allegations for several reasons. 
   First, high-ranging administration officials question the credibility of Attorney General Gonzales' original response to the allegations. One high-ranking Justice Department official quit; another pleaded the fifth. White House officials have refused to respond to our subpoenas. It is this Justice Department that seeks unprecedented authority to wiretap citizens without traditional oversight or even articulating the primary purpose of the wiretaps. 
   Furthermore, the bill does not offer retroactive immunity for illegal activities. The fact is that the telecom companies which may benefit from retroactive immunity already have immunity for any reasonable actions they may have taken. This bill provides a procedural change which ensures that these claims of immunity can properly be considered. 
   In summary, this bill provides for all of the security protections sought by the President, but it also provides modest protection for our civil liberties. Therefore, we should support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, bias-based crimes are an unfortunate reality in this country. This legislation is necessary because existing law, 18 U.S.C. section 245(b)(2) does not protect individuals from violent acts based on race, color, national origin or religion, unless the defendant intended to interfere with the victims' participation in certain enumerated Federal activities. 
   Additionally, Federal law does not presently provide for hate crime protection at all for a tax based on sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill also addresses many of the express concerns about the first amendment rights to free speech and association. H.R. 1592 addresses these concerns by providing an evidentiary exclusion, which prohibits the government from introducing evidence of expression or association as substantive evidence at trial, unless it is directly relevant to the elements of the crime. 
   This provision will ensure that defendants will only be prosecuted and  convicted based on their criminal acts, not on what they say or what they believe, or because of the people with whom they are associated. There are some of us who criticize the bill as an improper exercise of Federal jurisdiction. But based on testimony and the issues of the witnesses at our hearings, this legislation has been carefully drafted to address the Supreme Court's decisions in Lopez and Morrison, which limited Congress' jurisdiction to pass legislation. 
   Furthermore, H.R. 1592, in response to the gentleman's complaint, Federal prosecutors must confer with State authorities to decide whether Federal jurisdiction is appropriate, and no prosecution can proceed without the express approval of the United States attorney general or his designee. Additionally at trial they must prove a valid Federal interest as a specific element of the crime. 
   In addition to creating new hate crime offenses and expanding the application of existing ones, this bill also establishes an important grant program to provide financial assistance to States, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to provide much-needed assistance in investigating high-profile crimes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill has broad support. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, we have just heard the suggestion that some programs might be better if only the program sponsors could discriminate in employment. We hadn't heard those arguments for over 40 years before this administration came in. 
   Let's talk about when you say ``protect civil liberties,'' what liberties you are protecting? If you are protecting somebody's right to tell somebody they can't get a job because of their religion, if you can discriminate against someone because of their religion, racial discrimination laws essentially cannot be enforced. So who are you protecting? You are protecting the one trying to discriminate; the victim of discrimination loses all protection. 
   The children of families of unpopular religions will ask their parents why they couldn't get a job in the Head Start program, and they will have to be told they are not hiring people of our religion. Just what kind of Head Start is that? 
   Proponents are saying we lose opportunities. We have plenty of opportunities in Head Start. All we have to do is fund it more, and there will be plenty of opportunities for Head Start programs. 
   There has also been a suggestion you may have to take icons off the wall. If icons have to be taken down, it is because of a violation of the establishment clause of the Constitution. Let me tell you, passing a motion to recommit will not solve a violation of the establishment clause. 
   Forty years ago race and religious discrimination was found to be so reprehensible that we made it illegal even with your private funds. Now we have a plea to protect the people trying to discriminate and not the victims of discrimination. We need to leave the law the way it has been for the last 40 years. We can keep the antidiscrimination laws and those programs. Any program that can get funded with this faith-based initiative amendment could be funded anyway if you just comply with the antidiscrimination laws that have been in effect for the last 40 years. 
   We ought not to have to tell our children why certain parents can't get a job in a program because we are failing to protect the civil rights of the victim of discrimination because all of a sudden we are interested in the civil rights of the person trying to discriminate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, as we discuss this faith-based amendment, I think we need to seriously consider the long-term societal implications of that amendment, allowing discrimination in the Head Start program. 
   Our Nation just went through quite a conversation when Don Imus made his remarks, and I would hope that that was just talking. We are actually going to do something in considering whether or not a program can deny an employment opportunity solely because of religion, and if you happen to go to an all-black or all-white church, the decision made on religion will deny you based on race as well. 
   We should have this conversation here on the floor, considering what we are doing long-term, similar to the conversation we had when Don Imus embarrassed himself. We should not embarrass ourselves here on the floor of the House of Representatives. We need to maintain the civil rights protections for prospective employees that we have had for the last 40 years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, Don Imus provoked a national discussion about race, but that was just talk. If we pass this motion, we will take action and turn the clock back before 1965. 
   This amendment doesn't allow faith-based programs to get funded. The Shuler amendment that we passed reminds us that faith-based organizations can and do sponsor Head Start programs. 
   The fact is that any program that can be funded under this amendment could be funded anyway if they would agree not to discriminate in employment. It has nothing to do with symbols. It is absurd to suggest that this has anything to do with symbols. Whatever problem there is with symbols is a constitutional problem that cannot be solved with a motion to recommit. 
   This is all about discrimination. And if you can discriminate based on religion, it has racial implications. So since the 1960s, for 40 years, when you talk about civil liberties, you are talking about the victims of discrimination. We decided 40 years ago that it was so reprehensible to discriminate in employment that we made it illegal, even with your own private money. And today, as we talk about discrimination, we ought to think about the victims, not the right of the person to discriminate against the victim. 
   The present law allows the church to use its own church money, as the gentleman from Missouri said, to hire whom they want. But with Federal money, just with the Federal money, you have not been able to discriminate. So for 40 years, all children in Head Start programs have learned that their parents are eligible to be hired by the Head Start program regardless of the race or religion of the program. They have known that for over 40 years. This amendment will determine what the next generation of Head Start students will learn. 
   We need to defeat this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (VETERAN VOTING SUPPORT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 6625, the Veterans Voting Support Act, which contains several provisions to help Veterans as they participate in the political process. First, it will require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to allow States to designate V.A. facilities as voter registration agencies. The bill will also require V.A. facilities to provide information and assist election officials to ensure proper delivery of voting material. Additional, the bill prohibits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from restricting non-partisan organizations and state election organizations from providing information at V.A. facilities. This bill will help to prevent Department of Veterans Affairs policies from withholding information from Veterans on voter registration and voting. 
   The Department of Veterans Affairs previously adopted a policy that prohibits voter registration drives on V.A. grounds. The Department of Veterans Affairs recently changed that policy and now allows state and local election officials as well as non-partisan organizations to provide veterans help. However, the language of the policy still allows individual V.A. facilities to restrict access to these groups. This legislation will guarantee that individuals and organizations with the appropriate knowledge are given the right to assist our veterans in the voting registration process. 
   Our veterans have dedicated their lives to our country's safety and deserve the opportunity to be assisted in the political process. Given that many of our veterans are disabled or ill with special assistance needs as a result of their service to our country, we should make every possible accommodation to provide them with the assistance they need to take a part in the political process and have their voices heard. It would be ironic for those fighting for our freedom and ability to participate in our democracy to themselves be denied the ability to participate. 
   I commend Rep. BRADY, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, for his hard work on this bill and urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, historically black colleges and universities play a pivotal role in America's higher education system and continue to educate many black American students as well as students of other races every year. 
   Today, we have over 100 historically black colleges and universities in the Nation, 5 percent of our colleges and universities; yet these institutions award almost 30 percent of all college degrees obtained by African Americans. In some areas of science, math and engineering, these colleges account for almost half or more of such degrees awarded to African Americans. HBCUs are also responsible for a large number of graduate and professional degrees earned by African Americans. 
   This bill will provide the necessary capital that will ensure that HBCUs have all of the options available to them in order to maintain their excellent standard of education.  
   This bill is supported by the Department of Education and three historically black college and university advocacy groups; the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, or NAFEO; Thurgood Marshall College Fund; and the United Negro College Fund.     
   I would like to thank the majority whip, Mr. Clyburn, and particularly thank the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. Miller, as well as their staffs who worked so hard to address this issue in a timely manner. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Second Chance Act and would like to commend Mr. Davis from Illinois and the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon) for their continued leadership on this bill and also acknowledge the dedication and tireless efforts of many members of the diverse coalition of national, State and local organizations referred to by Chairman Conyers.  
   While our national crime rates may have fallen significantly over the last decade, we have seen an unprecedented explosion in our prison and jail populations. Today, over 2.2 million people are incarcerated in Federal and State jails and prisons, a 10-fold increase since 1980 and at a present cost of $65 billion. 
   As a result of this focus on incarceration, the United States leads the world in per capita incarceration rates, over 700 per 100,000 population. While most of the world locks up about 50 to 200 per 100,000, the United States is first in the world at over 700 per 100,000. And as a result, more than 650,000 people will be released from Federal and State prisons to communities nationwide, along with 9 million people leaving local jails. 
   Unfortunately, the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that two-thirds of the offenders leave State and Federal prisons are rearrested in 3 years. If we are to reduce the number of inmates returning to prison, we need to provide our ex-offenders with the education and training necessary for them to obtain and hold steady jobs. They also need drug treatment, and medical and mental health services to decrease the chances they will come back to prison. 
   The Second Chance Act will provide these investments, and every study shows it will not only reduce crime but also save money in the process. Mr. Speaker, it is very infrequent that we have the opportunity to reduce crime and save money. I hope we will take that opportunity today and pass this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 3013, the Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2007 on July 12 of this year. At the time, I was joined by eight original bipartisan cosponsors, including the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers; ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Smith; Crime Subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Forbes; and other members, Mr. Coble, Mr. Davis of Alabama, Mr. Lungren, Mr. Feeney and Mr. Roskam. I would like to take a moment to personally thank each of them for their support. 
   The purpose of H.R. 3013 is fairly simple and straightforward. It is designed to prevent a practice that has regrettably become too common in many of Federal Government's recent investigations into corporate wrongdoing. I am specifically referring to the government's use of what are called ``coercive waivers'' to gain access to privileged communications that otherwise would remain private and protected under the constitutional doctrine of attorney-client privilege.     
   Coercing waivers of corporate attorney-client privilege has not always been the practice among Federal prosecutors. Formerly, a company could produce evidence of its ``cooperation'' with prosecutors by providing insight into relevant corporate information, as well as by providing general access to the company's workplace and its employees. Unfortunately, since that time, memoranda issued by the Department of Justice suggest that the policy has changed to one which now exposes corporations to an increased risk of prosecution if they claim this constitutionally protected privilege. 
   One of the first such memoranda was issued in 1999. The Holder memorandum was designed to provide prosecutors with factors to be considered when determining whether to charge a corporation with criminal activity, and specifically allowed prosecutors, in gauging the extent of a corporation's cooperation, to consider the corporation's willingness to waive attorney-client privilege and work-product privilege.  
   This memorandum was superceded in 2003 by the Thompson memorandum. This memorandum contained the same language regarding the waiver of attorney-client privilege and work-product privileges and also addressed the adverse weight that might be given to a corporation's participation in a joint defense agreement with its officers or employees and its agreement to pay legal fees. 
   Today, the current Department policies relating to corporate attorney-client privilege and work-product privileges are embodied in the McNulty memorandum, issued in December of last year. While this new memorandum does state that the waiver requests should be the exception rather than the rule, it continues to threaten the viability of attorney-client privilege in business organizations by allowing prosecutors to request a waiver of privilege upon the finding of so-called ``legitimate need.'' 
   I fully recognize the Department may face hurdles when undertaking investigations and prosecutions of corporate malfeasance. We look at the victims of Enron's collapse, the nearly 10,000 individuals who lost their jobs and pensions, their plans for their future, and know how vital it is for Federal prosecutors to have the tools necessary to prosecute these crimes and hold accountable wrongdoers who profit at the expense of ordinary working men and women. However, I also believe that facilitating and even encouraging such investigations should not come at the expense of vital constitutionally protected rights. 
   H.R. 3013 therefore prohibits the demanding of constitutionally protected materials as a necessary condition of receiving favorable consideration in decisions relating to prosecution and sentencing. This bill is supported by diverse groups such as the American Bar Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Heritage Foundation. That said, Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again thank the bipartisan members of the committee who have joined me in supporting this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON III AND ROBERT R. MERHIGE, JR. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to rise in support of S. 2403, a bill to designate the new Federal Courthouse, located in the 700 block of East Broad Street, Richmond, Virginia, as the ``Spottswood W. Robinson III and Robert R. Merhige, Jr. United States Courthouse.'' 
   The Commonwealth of Virginia has a rich history of contributions in the founding of this country and in the establishment and development of our legal system. Virginia practitioners such as George Wythe, Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, James Monroe, and Henry Clay have all profoundly shaped and molded our country's legal traditions. In fact, the first law school in the country was our own College of William and Mary located in Williamsburg, Virginia. 
   It is therefore fitting that we would name the new Federal Courthouse in our State's capital after two distinguished jurists, Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III and Judge Robert R. Merhige, Jr., whose exemplary careers under the law displayed the best ideals and principles of our Constitution and legal traditions. 
   Spottswood William Robinson III was born in Richmond, Virginia, on July 26, 1916, and passed away in his home in Virginia on October 11, 1998. He attended Virginia Union University and then Howard University Law School, graduating first in his class in 1939 and serving as a member of the faculty until 1947. 
   In 1964 Judge Robinson became the first African American to be appointed to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In 1966 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Judge Robinson the first African American to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On May 7, 1981, Judge Robinson became the first African American to serve as chief judge of the District of Columbia Circuit. Judge Robinson served on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and as dean of the Howard University Law School. 
   In addition to these exemplary and groundbreaking roles, Judge Robinson is probably best known for his role as one of the lead attorneys with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1948 to 1960 and specifically for his representation of the Virginia plaintiffs in the 1954 landmark U.S. Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education, which declared ``separate but equal'' schools unconstitutional and is one of the landmark cases in our Nation's history. 
   Judge Robert R. Merhige was born in New York, New York on February 5, 1919, and passed away in Richmond on February 18, 2005. He attended High Point College in North Carolina where he received his undergraduate degree in 1940. He then earned his law degree from T.C. Williams School of Law at the University of Richmond from which he graduated at the top of his class in 1942. 
   From 1942 to 1945, during World War II, Judge Merhige served in the United States Army Air Force as a crewman on a B-17 bomber based in Italy. After the war he returned to Richmond where he practiced law from 1945 to 1967. During that time, Judge Merhige established himself as a formidable trial lawyer representing a wide variety of clients. 
   In August of 1967, Judge Merhige was appointed U.S. District Court judge for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division, by President Lyndon B. Johnson, where he served for 31 years. While on the Federal bench, Judge Merhige presided over some of the most important and complex litigation in United States history. He ordered the University of Virginia to admit women in 1970. In 1972 he ordered the desegregation of dozens of Virginia school districts. As a result of his decision, he and his family were victims of threats and violence, and he was given 24-hour protection by U.S. marshals. His judicial courage and independence in the face of strong opposition is a testament to his dedication to equal justice under the law, and I believe his example is as pertinent today as it was then. 
   The new Federal Courthouse in Richmond is under construction and nearing completion. I believe that naming it after these two exemplary jurists will not only serve as a tribute to their fierce adherence to the Constitution and to their legacy of equal justice under the law but also will serve as a reminder of their contributions to ensuring a fair and just legal system for all people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend Senator John Warner and Senator Jim Webb for introducing this bill in the Senate, as well as the support from the entire Virginia delegation. I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton, Ranking Members Mica and Graves, Representatives Carney and King, and both the Democratic and Republican leadership for the swift passage of this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2135, the Child Soldiers Accountability Act of 2008. S. 2135 amends title 18 of the United States Code to create a criminal provision under U.S. law aimed at those who recruit or conscript children under the age of 15 into armed conflict. It establishes criminal penalties for up to 20 years in prison and up to life imprisonment if death results from the crime. 
   The bill also makes it a violation of immigration law for any person seeking admission to the United States to have committed such acts. 
   Finally, the bill would extend United States jurisdiction to perpetrators of this crime who are present in the United States, regardless of their nationality or where the crime takes place, so that those who commit these crimes cannot use this country as a safe haven from prosecution. This type of jurisdiction exists for similar crimes such as laws on torture and genocide, which allow for extraterritorial jurisdiction for crimes committed outside of the United States. 
   In at least 18 countries around the world, children are utilized as direct participants in war. Many of these children soldiers, some as young as 8 years old, are abducted or recruited by force and often compelled to follow orders to participate under harsh duress. And girls make up more than 30 percent of child soldiers and participate in many conflicts. Oftentimes, they are abused and raped. Once recruited, these children, boys and girls, participate in all forms of combat, even wielding AK-47s and M-16s as portrayed in the media. 
   There is international opposition to recruiting and using child soldiers. Over 110 countries, including the United States, have ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the recruitment and use of child soldiers under the age of 18. Nevertheless, the prevalence and nature of the child soldier problem is not going away. It continues to plague the international community. For example, in Uganda, the rebel group has abducted at least 20,000 children and has forced them to work as laborers, soldiers, and sex slaves. We hear about the ongoing persecution and atrocities in Burma, but what has escaped media attention is the use of child soldiers there, as the government has recruited up to 70,000 children, more than any other country in the world. 
   Recruiting and using child soldiers does not currently violate United States criminal law. S. 2135 was introduced by Senator Durbin and Senator Coburn to correct that problem. We overwhelmingly passed the Genocide Accountability Act last year to end the immunity gap in genocide law. By this bill, we seek to do the same thing for those who maliciously recruit and use innocent children in warfare. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (MEJA EXPANSION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2740, the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act of 2007. 
   I would like to commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, and the author of the bill, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), for their hard work on this bill. 
   We currently have a situation in which many military contractors act with impunity and no accountability because they operate outside of the jurisdiction of the United States criminal code because they are technically outside of the jurisdiction of the United States and outside of the Uniform Code of Military Justice because they are not in the military.     
   In Iraq, our troops have been supplanted by an army of contractors, which is estimated at 180,000, an extremely high number by any account. Last month we learned of a shooting incident involving a private contracting company, Blackwater, in which contractors allegedly shot and killed 11 or more innocent Iraqi civilians. Yesterday we learned that Blackwater was involved in at least 195 shooting incidents in Iraq since 2005. According to at least one report, their employees fired the first shots in more than 80 percent of these shooting incidences. 
   Madam Chairman, to provide much needed accountability and oversight for these contractors, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) introduced H.R. 2740, the MEJA Expansion Enforcement Act of 2007. When MEJA was originally signed into law in 2000, it did provide the United States Federal Courts with jurisdiction over civilian employees, contractors and subcontractors affiliated with the Defense Department who commit crimes overseas. The bill was later amended in 2005 to include employees of any Federal agency supporting the mission of the Department of Defense overseas. 
   This bill closes a loophole to make sure that all private security contractors, not just those contracted through the Department of Defense, are covered, to ensure that they are accountable under United States law. This  change would update the law to better reflect the current situation in Iraq and Afghanistan, in which a large number of contractors are present, with contracts written by a variety of different government agencies, including the Department of the Interior and Department of State. 
   Madam Chairman, H.R. 2740 also requires the Inspector General of the Justice Department to complete and submit a report about the identification and prosecution of alleged abuses in Iraq. This section is meant to address the lack of transparency in Department of Justice investigations and prosecutions. In some cases, the Army has investigated the circumstances behind some cases and found probable cause that a crime has been committed and referred the case to the Department of Justice for prosecution. 
   In one example, unfortunately, 17 pending cases of detainee abuse, including the abuse at Abu Ghraib prison by contractors, has remained in the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia for 3 years. We are not told why these cases against civilian contractors have not been prosecuted or why they are being held up. In comparison, since the invasion of Iraq, there have been more than four dozen courts-martial commenced against uniformed personnel with respect to the law of war issues. 
   Finally, H.R. 2740 requires that the Federal Bureau of Investigation establish an investigative unit to investigate reports of criminal misconduct in regions in which contractors are working. 
   Madam Chairman, I would like to state for the record that at the subcommittee markup of this bill I agreed to work with my distinguished colleague from Virginia (Mr. Forbes), the ranking member, to address his concerns in the bill before it reached the full committee. We did work together and jointly offered a substitute amendment in the full committee that reflected this bipartisan agreement. The bill was then reported out of the committee on a voice vote, without further amendments. The manager's amendment, which will be offered in a few minutes, has additional recommendations from the ranking member. 
   Madam Chairman, H.R. 2740 is a necessary bill. It is long overdue. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

   Madam Chairman, the manager's amendment reflects the compromise and bipartisan nature of the bill, which was reported out of the committee with bipartisan support. But after the bill was reported out of committee, the Department of Justice wanted to completely rework the bill. One of their suggestions would have gutted the FBI investigative units established in the bill and removed the enforcement mechanisms in the bill. Another would have so limited the number of crimes covered by the law that it could have not covered contractor fraud or even sex crimes in prisons. Those are simply unacceptable. 
   The suggestions proposed by the administration, many of which have been incorporated into the manager's amendment, have been described by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Madam Chairman. 
   And finally, I'd just like to point out to my distinguished colleague from Virginia that if he has additional technical and definitional changes and recommendations, those can certainly be accommodated after the bill passes the House before final enactment. They will be accommodated. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This important legislation overturns the recent Supreme Court decision, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire, a decision which undermines title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   The Ledbetter decision forces victims of discriminatory pay decisions to live with discriminatory paychecks for the duration of their career if they fail to file a claim within 180 days of the discrimination, possibly even if they had no knowledge of the discrimination within the 180 days. In other words, after 180 days, an unsuspecting female, minority, elderly, or disabled worker would simply be out of luck. 
   This would even be the case if the employer admitted to the discrimination and continued to discriminate after the 180-day limitation had passed. 
   Mr. Speaker, we hear comments that there would be no statute of limitations. That is not true. Under the bill, there is still a statute of limitations; 180 days still applies. The plaintiff has to show that a discriminatory paycheck was issued within the last 180 days. And if the employer would simply stop discriminating and went a whole 180 days without discriminating, then the statute of limitations would apply and it would be too late to bring a case. 
   Under the Supreme Court decision, that unjust outcome under the case is not in keeping with title VII's remedial purpose or the spirit of the civil rights cases. 
   Now, Justice Ginsburg noted in her dissent, ``Congress never intended to immunize forever discriminatory pay differentials unchallenged within 180 days of their adoption.'' I agree with Justice Ginsburg. And she also noted that Congress should correct this injustice. This bill corrects the injustice by appropriately expressing Congress's intent that title VII will hold employers accountable for unlawful employment discrimination.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the slaughtering of individuals simply because they are a member of a certain ethnic or racial group has occurred throughout history, and, regrettably, continues today. As we witnessed, as many as 800,000 of the Tutsi minority, men, women and children, were murdered in Rwanda. Mass violence has occurred against civilians in Bosnia, where up to 8,000 Muslim men and boys were systematically executed. 
   The obligations of the United States under the Genocide Convention are in the criminal code in title 18 beginning at section 1091. Genocide is defined as having the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. The code offers severe punishment for anyone who commits genocide within the United States. The law also makes it a Federal crime for a U.S. national to commit genocide anywhere in the world. Fortunately, there has not been a need to use the law against anyone now covered by it. However, by only covering genocide if it is committed in this country or committed by a U.S. national, we leave a gap which allows non-U.S. persons who commit genocide elsewhere to come to this country with impunity under our laws. 
   To this end, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Berman) introduced identical legislation designed to amend title 18 of the United States Code to expand jurisdiction of genocide over the following categories of people who have committed genocide outside of the United States: (1) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence; (2) a stateless person whose habitual residence is in the United States; or (3) an individual physically present in the United States. 
   Similar to the legislation before us, many other Federal laws, including  those laws that criminalize torture, allow for the extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes committed outside the United States by those present in the United States. 
   Genocide continues to be a threat in the world and we should attack it wherever we find it. In Darfur, we see the tragic replay of suffering and death. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people who have been killed, raped, tortured, or forced to flee, and over 2 million people have been driven from their homes. For them, the commitment of ``never again'' after the Holocaust rings hollow. The United States should have the ability to prosecute those who find safe haven in the United States for their acts of genocide. The Genocide Accountability Act would end this impunity gap in the genocide law. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to adopt this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (MANAGING ARSON THROUGH CRIMINAL HISTORY (MATCH) ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, arson is indeed a very serious problem, costing over $1 billion in property damage annually and endangering the lives of citizens and especially our firefighters. Arson has also one of the lowest arrest and conviction rates, and law enforcement needs new tools to enhance their capabilities to solve arson crimes. 
   Unfortunately, the evidence presented in committee was that the State of California already has a registry similar to the one contemplated in the bill and no arsons have been solved by that database. 
   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, I would need to point out another concern I have with H.R. 1759 in its current form. That concern relates to the treatment of juveniles under the proposed bill. Juveniles who are charged and convicted as adults for arson offenses would be required to register in the newly created arson offender registry. As research clearly indicates, of all offenders, juveniles are the least culpable due to immature brain development, and they have the greatest capacity for rehabilitation. Branding them as an offender in a State or national register is not only improper, it's counterproductive. 
   Requiring young offenders to register in a State or national offender database counters the concept of ensuring the proper development of juveniles because it is inconsistent with rehabilitative efforts. Although H.R. 1759 properly ensures that only law enforcement will have access to information on the registries, law enforcement officers will undoubtedly use the information to label and target youth for further arrests. Once law enforcement has certain youngsters on their radar, those youngsters would be targets and more likely to be arrested and prosecuted for even minor nonviolent conduct because law enforcement officials have their names on a list. 
   In summary, I agree that law enforcement needs effective tools to combat the devastation of arson causes, and I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her hard work in developing the bill and making many improvements in the bill from its original form. However, I still have concerns about the cost effectiveness of the proposal in the bill as well as concerns, the impact the legislation will have on juvenile offenders.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank and commend Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, Chairman Hinojosa, and Ranking Member Keller for their hard work on this bill. 
   This bill contains many important provisions that will make college more affordable for our students, particularly the Pell Grant and loan forgiveness provisions. 
   It also has many provisions helpful to institutions of higher learning, especially Historically Black Colleges and Universities which have been funded for new master's programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Predominantly Black Institutions. 
   It also, as the Chairman has indicated, has a new program to help the rapidly growing field of modeling and simulation. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is new language in the bill dealing with the accreditation of colleges, and it is important to explicitly note that this new language does not adversely affect or change anti-discrimination provisions. 
   The bill also contains a direction to the Department of Education to reword the financial aid application to make it clear that students can get financial aid, even if they have a drug offense. 
   We have worked long and hard on this bill, and for the foregoing reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, it has been ten years since the Higher Education Act has been reauthorized and I am pleased that we will now make many  needed updates to this law. I would like to commend Chairman MILLER, Ranking Member MCKEON, Chairman HINOJOSA, and Ranking Member KELLER for their work on this bill. I would also like to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor & Pensions committee, Senators KENNEDY and ENZI. Additionally, I would like to express my gratitude to Senator MIKULSKI for all her efforts in Senator KENNEDY's absence. I would also like to thank the House and Senate Committees' staff; we could not have reached this point without your hard work and dedication. 
   This bill contains many important provisions that will help make a college education more affordable for student and their families. I am particularly pleased with the increase in the authorization of the Pell grant and the loan forgiveness provision that will aid students who give back to their community if they enter a profession in an area of national need, including mental health professionals and child welfare workers. 
   The legislation also specifically assists minority students in several ways. For example, it contains a provision to promote cultural diversity in the entertainment media industry. It will also require that a study be conducted on whether race, ethnicity, or gender biases exist in the design of standardized admission tests used by higher education institutions. The information collected for the study is intended to be made available to the public--except in cases where the entity providing the information shows good cause or in the case where the information is proprietary--so that if such biases are found we can work to correct them. 
   The bill requires the Department of Education to conform hate crime reporting requirements to FBI guidelines to more accurately report incidents of hate crimes on our campuses. This will result in consistent and accurate reporting of crimes against persons and crimes against property. In addition, improved data will give parents and students a more accurate sense of campus safety and education institutions a better picture of their campus climate. 
   The legislation also contains many provisions helpful to institutions of higher education. The Secretary will now be required to develop and maintain a plan to help schools cope with natural and man-made disasters. The bill also creates an Education Disaster and Emergency Relief Loan Program to provide emergency loan funds to schools after a federal declared major disaster or emergency, including those schools affected by the 2005 Gulf Hurricanes. Additionally, the bill includes a provision which significantly helps schools affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by holding them harmless for purposes of Title III funding. 
   This bill also does a great deal to help the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The authorization levels for HBCUs have been increased to $375 million dollars, which is almost three times the amount that is in the current Higher Education Act. The amount for the Historically Black Graduate Institutions program has significantly increased as well. The bill also provides funding for Masters programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Predominantly Black Institutions that focus on science, technology, engineering, mathematics, health and other fields in which Blacks are underrepresented. 
   The legislation strengthens and develops college-level programs in the rapidly growing field of Modeling and Simulation. This is a field of study that refers to replicating a system on a smaller scale or on a computer for extensive examination. There is not a single field of study or profession that cannot benefit from this type of analysis including urban planning, medicine and national security. 
   This legislation includes several positive changes to the TRIO programs, which provide assistance to low-income and first generation college-going students. The bill eliminates the Absolute Priority conditions imposed on Upward Bound programs by the Department of Education without requiring a recompetition. In addition, the bill creates an appeals process for TRIO programs to ensure that the grantmaking process is as fair and transparent as possible. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a clarification that I feel must be made with regard to new language added to an existing accreditation provision. Current law requires that accrediting agencies or associations apply and enforce their standards in a manner that respects the missions of institutions of higher education. This bill states that respecting missions of institutions of higher education includes religious missions. It is important to explicitly note what is and is not intended by the new language. Pursuant to the House Report filed by the House Committee on Education and Labor on December 19, 2007 (H. Rept. 110-500, Part I), it is important to make clear that this new language does not affect or change nondiscrimination provisions. The House Report states in relevant part: 
   ``The new language requiring accrediting agencies or associations to apply and enforce their standards in a manner that respects the missions of institutions of higher education, including religious missions, reflects Congress' belief that accredited institutions should be allowed to choose their own missions rather than having them imposed or regulated by accrediting bodies. In response to concerns raised by Representatives ROBERT C. SCOTT (D-VA) and RUBEN HINOJOSA (D-TX) about whether the amendment would harm the ability of accreditors to enforce nondiscrimination provisions, the author of the amendment, Representative TIMOTHY WALBERG (R-MI), explained that the provision would not affect nondiscrimination provisions and instead would require accreditors to respect the missions of schools, including when the missions are religious. 
   ``It is the intent of the Committee that this amendment does not change or alter current accreditation requirements, and the exemptions included in those requirements (such as those allowed by the American Bar Association and the American Psychological Association), for the enforcement of nondiscrimination provisions. The Committee also notes that this provision does not alter title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 or other federal antidiscrimination statutes, which remain applicable to institutions of higher education to the same extent as before. The Department of Education shall not promulgate any regulations that provide any new exceptions to current nondiscrimination provisions. 
   ``It is also the intent of the Committee that this amendment does not change or alter current accreditation requirements, and the exemptions included in those requirements, for training professionals in the practice of medicine and other health care professions.'' 
   Similarly, the Senate report that accompanies S. 1642 (the companion bill to H.R. 4137) filed by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on November 15, 2007 (Report No. 110-231) confirms this position. The Senate report states in relevant part: 
   ``Accrediting agencies or associations recognized by the Department of Education are invested with a public trust and perform an important public function. Congress expects that those receiving Department recognition will perform those functions with the same diligence and competence as would be provided by any public body and that their procedures will be conducted with the same level of transparency, due process, and accountability that would apply to the Department if it performed this function itself. 
   ``The new language requiring accrediting agencies or associations to apply and enforce their standards in a manner that respects the missions of institutions of higher education, including religious missions, reflects these goals. It is not intended to allow an institution to deny a person participation in, the benefits of, or to subject a person to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance under existing laws, including those with respect to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability; or because the person has not complied with a standard of the institution that requires the person to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight a provision included in the Statement of Managers to the Conference which I feel is extremely important. Currently, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is written in a way that misleads many students to believe that if they have been convicted of a drug offense, they do not qualify for financial aid. In the Statement of Managers, Conferees encourage the Department to reword the FAFSA to more accurately reflect the ways in which students who have been convicted of drug offenses can obtain financial aid. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have worked long and hard for a comprehensive, bipartisan bill. While not perfect, I believe this bill goes a long way towards making college more affordable for students and their families and towards helping our institutions and higher education provide a quality education to our nation's youth. For the foregoing reasons, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we talk about the budget, it's helpful to know where we are and how we got here. This chart shows the budget deficit over the years and shows that when President Clinton came in, we reversed the trend of deficit and actually went into surplus and were going to stay into surplus until the Republican leadership had a President who would actually sign their bills. We immediately went in the ditch and have bounced around in the ditch ever since then. 
   We had, when this administration came in, a projected surplus of $5.5 trillion, more than enough to pay Social Security for 75 years without reducing benefits. Unfortunately, those 8 years will come in at about a $3 trillion deficit, a reversal of over $8.5 trillion deterioration. 
   And although they overspent the budget that much, they didn't create any jobs. This is the job growth since the Great Depression. These last 8 years have produced the worst job growth since the Great Depression. 
   And so we have a budget that will reverse this. We have a budget that is fiscally responsible, it balances in 2012, remains in balance using realistic CBO estimates. It posts smaller deficits over the 5 years than the Republican alternative. It continues emphasis on fiscal responsibility by maintaining pay-as-you-go that served us so well during the 1990s. 
   It also addresses our priorities, increases veterans' funding, energy funding, particularly renewable energy and energy efficiency, and assistance to low-income families. It invests in education and social services. It rejects the administration's cuts in environmental protection. It funds first responders, community development, and other high-priority services. It fully funds the defense budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman from Maryland for his hard work on this bill and for his leadership on the Chesapeake Bay issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5540, the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network Continuing Reauthorization Act. I commend my colleague from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) for introducing the bill, which will help further the Chesapeake Bay's restoration. 
   I serve as cochair of the bipartisan Chesapeake Bay Task Force, and I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
   Over 400 years ago, the first permanent English settlers of North America sailed into the Chesapeake Bay and settled on the banks of the James River at Jamestown, Virginia. Although the Chesapeake Bay played a significant role in the founding of this great Nation, the bay is often one of the most overlooked natural and economic estuaries in the United States. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Watershed touches 41 congressional districts in the States of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York and the District of Columbia. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been actively involved in ensuring that the resources are available to protect and restore the  Chesapeake Bay since my days in the Virginia General Assembly. When I served in the Virginia House of Delegates, I was a member of a joint Virginia/Maryland legislative task force that first recommended in 1980 a multi-State commission to address bay issues. And that multi-State commission continues to recognize the Chesapeake Bay as a vitally important regional and national treasure. 
   H.R. 5540 will reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, which is the National Park Service component of the greater Chesapeake Bay Program. The goal of this network is to conserve the natural beauty and cultural heritage of the bay for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations through grants, technical assistance to parks, volunteer groups, wildlife refuges, historical sites, museums and water trails throughout the bay watershed. The network ties all of these sites and projects together to actively engage citizens to help clean up the Chesapeake Bay. Since 2000, the network has grown to include 156 gateways in six States and the District of Columbia. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Maryland for his leadership. And I want to take the opportunity to thank our new Virginia colleague, Mr. Wittman, for his long-time leadership and activity in Chesapeake Bay issues. I commend the Committee on Natural Resources for reporting the bill favorably to the full House and urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, before we respond to the President's call for an additional 20,000 troops in Iraq, we must put his call in the context of the history of the war, beginning with the discussion of what the current 130,000 troops are doing there now. 
   The original reasons we were provided with the rationale for going to war, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that Iraqi leaders were connected with the 9/11 attacks, and that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the United States, all turned out not to be true. Saddam Hussein was captured and recently hanged, al-Zarqawi is dead, and Iraq held democratic elections over a year ago, and yet we are still in Iraq. 
   Throughout the war, the President has attempted to associate our presence in Iraq with a so-called war on terrorism. The truth is that our presence in Iraq has actually increased our risk to terrorism. 
   Furthermore, the term ``war on terrorism'' is a rhetorical term without any relationship to reality. Terrorism is not an enemy. It is a tactic. The enemy is al Qaeda. We attacked Afghanistan because al Qaeda was there, not in Iraq. 
   The President is now saying he is laying out a new mission in Iraq, thereby clearly acknowledging that, whatever the old mission was, it was not working. But there is still no clearly defined end goal and no clearly defined explanation of how failure or success can be measured. 
   If our mission now is to stabilize Baghdad, many military experts have already said that an additional force of 20,000 troops is woefully insufficient to  accomplish that goal. The fact is that the administration has already increased troop levels on several occasions during this war. None of the previous surges in troop levels have had any lasting effect on the war, and there is no credible evidence to believe that this surge will be any different. 
   And how can we have confidence in predictions of success? Before our invasion in Iraq, Secretary Rumsfeld predicted that the war in Iraq would last ``6 days, 6 weeks. I doubt 6 months.'' Vice President Cheney predicted we would be greeted as liberators. 
   Almost 4 years ago, the President stood before a sign that said ``Mission Accomplished'' and proclaimed major combat operations in Iraq have ended.     
   A year and a half ago Vice President Cheney said the Iraqis were ``in the last throes'' of the insurgency. And yet here we are discussing an increase, not a decrease, in troop levels. 
   At the outset of this war, the administration predicted that the cost of the war would be so minuscule that it advised the House Committee on the Budget not even to include the cost of the war in the Federal budget. The administration official who suggested that the cost of the war might exceed $100 billion was fired. To date we have appropriated nearly $400 billion, and the President has already formally requested another $200 billion more, with no end in sight. 
   Over 3,100 courageous Americans and countless Iraqis have already lost their lives. How many more will die if this strategy falls as far from the predicted result as the original length of time and cost estimates of the war? 
   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, as part of developing a mission and strategy, it is imperative that we ask where these additional troops are going to come from. Many will undoubtedly come from the National Guard and Reserves, but they have already been in Iraq for longer-than-average deployments and many have already completed multiple tours of duty. Other troops must be redeployed from other assignments; so we must ask what moving these troops will mean to our global national security. 
   Last November the American people sent a powerful message. They want a change in Iraq, not more of the same. They expect an honest explanation of why we entered Iraq in the first place, what the present situation is, what goal do we expect to achieve, and what the strategy will be to accomplish it. Only then can we intelligently discuss the troop levels necessary to accomplish that goal. Unfortunately, all we have gotten from this administration is essentially ``Don't worry, be happy, success is around the corner; and if you don't believe that, then you are not patriotic and you are not supporting the troops.'' 
   For my colleagues who say that failure is not an option, I ask what will happen if the President's so-called ``New Way Forward'' fails, as many experts predict it will? Are we then required to further escalate the war, further strain our military, sending thousands more of our troops to Iraq? How many more of our young men and women must die before the administration acknowledges what was in the National Intelligence Estimate? And I quote, ``The term `civil war' accurately describes key elements of the Iraqi conflict.' '' 
   Mr. Speaker, although the resolution before us is technically nonbinding, it gives the House an opportunity to call upon the President to work cooperatively with Congress to develop an effective strategy to bring our troops home. The American people and our courageous men and women on the front lines deserve a clearly articulated and sensible approach to ending the war. This resolution puts the House on record as saying that an escalation of military forces is a step in the wrong direction. 
   I therefore urge my colleagues to support the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for yielding, and I thank him for including my amendment in the en bloc amendment.  
    Mr. Chairman, the defense authorization bill is a tremendous undertaking and I would like to commend Chairman SKELTON and his Committee for their hard work. My amendment would simply insert findings that Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Technology is an important tool that ought to be utilized to the utmost by the Department of Defense. 
   Modeling and Simulation has become an essential component in ensuring that we meet both the defense and domestic challenges of the 21st century. It allows us to build and develop models of complex systems--whether it be a car, an airplane, an entire battlefield, or even a major city's evacuation plan. By doing this, we can easily and effectively sharpen the tools, procedures, and decisions needed to address difficult and complex problems. Determining how certain actions will affect the end result before implementing the plan in real life provides strategic, tactical and financial benefits. These simulations help us develop better and practical analogies of real world situations. 
   With the growing international challenges of the 21st century, this technology is vital to the defense of our great Nation. The practical uses of Modeling, Analysis and Simulation technology as a training tool are boundless. Military and airline pilots have been using this technology for decades. Now, simulating battlefield conditions will sharpen the skills of the brave men and women serving in our armed forces. And it is my firm belief that Congress should be interested in using this technology for defense, homeland security, disaster preparedness, and other ways to benefit the public. Every effort should be made to include Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Technology in the training and planning doctrines of the Department of Defense. This amendment is a step in that direction. 
   The power of modeling, analysis and simulation technology can be particularly useful in urban areas. The fact is that current and future military operations, and emergency management of natural and manmade disasters, do and will continue to involve operations in highly complex, urban environments; we are no longer engaging in traditional battlefield operations. These urban environments include complex geographical, communications, transportation, informational, social, political, and public support subsystems. The interdependence of these subsystems and the cascading effects of warfare or disasters imposed upon them should be modeled in a computer simulation environment. This will help us prepare for emergency consequence management of military, natural and manmade disasters in complex urban environments. 
   Using modeling, analysis, and simulation technology in the fields of national defense, science, homeland security and disaster planning will better the lives of all Americans, make our Nation safer and save time and  money in the process. I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (HONORING AND PRAISING THE NAACP ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 98TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise to congratulate the NAACP on its 98th Anniversary. As the Nation's oldest civil rights organization, the NAACP has for 98 years fought to ensure the political, educational, social and economic equality of all persons, so that all may share and participate in this country's great Democracy. 
   The NAACP was founded by a multiracial group of activists who answered ``The Call'' for a national conference to discuss the civil and political rights of African Americans. This conference was in response to the race riots that took place in Springfield, Illinois in the summer of 1908. Since that time, the NAACP has sought to ensure equal rights for all citizens and to eliminate race prejudice in the United States by working to improve the democratic process and by seeking the enactment and enforcement of laws that secure civil rights. The NAACP also acts as a watchdog and informs the public of the adverse effects of discrimination. The NAACP also educates the public about their constitutional rights, and when necessary, undertakes court cases to enforce and secure those rights. 
   The NAACP has a long and impressive history of activism and has contributed greatly to shaping America as we know it today. One of its first legislative initiatives was an anti-lynching campaign in the early 1900s. In the 1940s, the NAACP was influential in President Roosevelt's decision to issue an Executive Order prohibiting discrimination in contracts with the Department of Defense and in President Truman's decision to issue an Executive Order ending discrimination in the military. In the 1950s, the NAACP worked to bring an end to segregation in public schools; that work culminated in the case of Brown v. Board of Education. In the 1960s, the NAACP worked to raise support for the passage of the Civil Rights Act. In the 1970s, it helped expand voter participation through voter registration efforts. And the list goes on. 
   Today, the NAACP continues to eliminate race prejudice whenever it rears its ugly head. It continues to act as a watchdog to protect the civil rights of all people. And it educates the public about civil rights so that future generations will know tolerance and equality as the norm, rather than the exception. 
   I am proud to be a Diamond Life Member of the NAACP and to have served as a Branch President of the Newport News Chapter. 
   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the NAACP on 98 years of service to our great country and its people, and I wish them another successful 98 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of National Public Health Week and the health bills that the House will debate today. It is important that we recognize and build on quality public health programs that affect every aspect of our lives--from effective childhood vaccination programs, to early screening programs for diseases, to ensuring that Americans have access to critical treatment programs. 
   Access to quality, affordable health care is critical to the well-being of our country, today and in the future. With 46 million uninsured--9 million of whom are children--we need to focus on strengthening the Medicare system, providing increased access to quality health care programs and ensuring that our low-income children and families have health insurance. 
   During my tenure in the Virginia General Assembly, I introduced a number of bills that focused on child and maternal health, preventive screenings for hearing and immunizations for children against certain diseases. The need for these services was vital to the health of the citizens not only of the Commonwealth of Virginia, but also to our Nation as a whole and continues to help our most vulnerable today. 
   Madam Speaker, there continues to be an urgent need for expanded health care coverage and increased access to health care for children, seniors and low-income individuals. Because of this need, I introduced H.R. 1688, The All Healthy Children Act. The All Healthy Children Act, endorsed by the Children's Defense Fund, is a logical, smart and achievable incremental next step to close the child coverage gap and guarantees all children have access to the health coverage that they need to survive, thrive and learn. This proposal would ensure that all children are covered by expanding the coverage of both the Medicaid and SCHIP programs while eliminating procedural red tape that currently prevents many children from being covered under either program. This comprehensive program would include all basic health care and preventive testing as well as coverage for mental health and prenatal care. 
   The bills that we will vote on today will also help to provide our medical community the tools necessary to improve lives through prevention, research and treatment of disease. For example: 
   The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention program is a critical CDC program intended to identify and help infants with hearing loss. This bill reauthorizes funding and expands the program to provide screening and intervention services for young children. We know that the earlier hearing problems are identified, the more effective the medical services can be. 
   The Wakefield Act is designed to improve emergency medical services for children needing trauma or critical care. 
   The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act educates parents and health care providers about newborn health screening, improves follow-up care for infants with an illness detected through newborn screening, and helps States expand and improve their newborn screening programs. Many diseases and conditions which can be cured when detected early can lead to permanent disabilities if not detected in time. 
   The Cytology Proficiency Improvement Act is designed to improve the analysis of tests for cervical cancer by ensuring that health care professionals who read tests for cervical cancer are skilled in today's medical technology. It modernizes the cervical cancer testing program by requiring continuing medical education for pathologists to assess their diagnostic skills and ensure they keep up with the latest practices. 
   The Keeping Seniors Safe from Falls Act launches a comprehensive preventative care program to reduce the number and severity of falls by the elderly. It directs HHS to implement directives to reduce falls, including improving the identification of seniors who have a high risk of falling; supporting education campaigns focused on reducing and preventing falls and on educating health professionals about fall risk, assessment and prevention; and conducting research to reduce falls. 
   The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act will help schools deal with food allergies among their student population by requiring the Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Department of Education, to develop a policy for schools on appropriate management and emergency plans for children with food allergies and anaphylaxis. The policy would be provided to schools within 1 year after enactment, and schools could voluntarily implement the policy. The bill also authorizes HHS to award grants to local school districts to help them in implementing the policy. 
   The House amendment to the Traumatic Brain Injury Act authorizes the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, to provide State grants for patients with traumatic brain injury to enter treatment and rehabilitation programs. The thousands of brain injury survivors who are returning home from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan are joining the 5.3 million similarly afflicted Americans here at home. Indeed, TBI is the leading cause of death and disability among young Americans. The legislation would require the CDC to monitor brain injury incidents and create a reporting system to track the condition. It also directs CDC to study treatment techniques and NIH to conduct basic research to improve treatment. 
   Madam Speaker, action on these critical issues is imperative to meet the pressing health care concerns of our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support these bills.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stress the importance of health care to the well-being of our children and to our Nation. In 2003, a report was released by the National Academy of Science entitled ``Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care.'' It  confirmed what many of us have known for a long time, that even when African Americans and other minorities have equal insurance and equal access to physicians, their outcomes are different. 
   Minority populations just don't get the same health care and are not offered the same treatments. Unfortunately, we're foundering under the constraints of a profit-driven, multi-tiered health care where racial and ethnic stereotypes often distort the decision-making process by many health care providers. 
   The situation becomes even more critical when we realize that over 20 percent of all African Americans do not have health insurance. Those who do are more likely to have public insurance or Medicaid, which, unfortunately, often does not command the full measure of services available in private insurance. 
   Every day, more and more African Americans are diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses which can be avoided with proper care and prevention. The diagnosis of illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and HIV/AIDS continues to increase among African Americans in the African American culture as access to health care becomes more and more elusive. 
   It is no surprise that when it comes to taking care of our medical needs, many of us and our Hispanic, Native American and Asian Pacific Islanders are slipping through the safety nets available to other Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, the total number of uninsured has actually increased from 41 million, just a few years ago, to 46 million by the most recent numbers. In the country where we pride ourselves as being the world's leading and most prosperous democracy, we have millions of children and young adults walking around without health insurance. 
   A sad reflection of how ominous the absence of health care insurance can be is the death of a 16-year-old boy in Maryland who died from infections caused by an abscessed tooth because his family had no health insurance to seek medical care. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the next few weeks, we'll address the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, which is a vital Federal program which allows States to target and cover low-income children with no health insurance and families with incomes above the Medicaid eligibility levels. 
   Almost 90 percent of these children live in households with a working parent. More than half live in two-family households. Many of these children are actually eligible for coverage under SCHIP or Medicaid but are not enrolled due in large part to barriers to enrollment in programs and complex eligibility rules that make it difficult to obtain or keep coverage. Millions more children are underinsured or at risk of losing coverage if their parents change jobs or if employers drop health coverage for families. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to do more than just renew SCHIP. We need to expand it so that it adequately covers every uninsured child living in the United States. 
   Early and preventive screening, diagnosis and treatment, EPSDT, which would include services such as dental, vision and mental health services should be available to all children. EPSDT is the current requirement under Medicaid to make sure that the health needs of children are being met, and we should bring this requirement to SCHIP. 
   Coverage for low-income pregnant women. We need to make sure that women are receiving the necessary prenatal care needed to ensure that infants have a healthy start in life. 
   Presumptive eligibility. We need a unified application system for SCHIP. There are many social services programs, such as reduced or free school lunch, that have eligibility requirements clearly more restrictive than SCHIP. So if a child is eligible for such a program, it is a virtual certainty that he's also eligible for SCHIP. 
   The problem arises that States do not presume eligibility, and parents are required to fill out different applications in different offices, often with the exact same information, just to access the services they obviously qualify for. 
   A commonsense solution would be to streamline the application process for SCHIP and other programs so that if you're enrolled in another social service program, you should not have to fill out another application just to get health care benefits. Money to promote the streamlining of this process should be included in the reauthorization of SCHIP. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is an urgent need for expanded health care coverage for children, and that's why I introduced H.R. 1688, the All Healthy Children's Act. That act has been endorsed by the Children's Defense Fund. It's a logical, smart, and achievable incremental next step to close the child coverage gap and guarantees that all children will have access to health care coverage that they need to survive, thrive, and learn. 
   This proposal will ensure that all children are covered by expanding the coverage of both Medicaid and SCHIP programs, while eliminating the procedural red tape that currently prevents children from being covered by either program. The comprehensive program would include all basic health care, as well as coverage for mental health and prenatal care. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States health care system has yet to solve the fundamental challenge, delivering health care coverage to all Americans at an affordable price. The tragedy is that we know what to do to fix the problem once and for all. And what is required is a national health care system with universal access to comprehensive prevention-oriented benefits. And it is time to take action, and we should start with our children by passing the All Healthy Children's Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (HONORING OPERATION SMILE ON ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to commend the efforts of Operation Smile during their 25 years of service to the United States and to the world. I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Congresswoman DRAKE, for sponsoring this resolution and bringing it to the floor. As we both represent the city of Norfolk, VA, the home of Operation Smile, I would just like to say a few words about Operation Smile and its efforts to help children around the world. 
   What Operation Smile has accomplished since its inception is truly remarkable. Since its first mission in the Philippines in 1982, Operation Smile volunteers have treated more than 100,000 children and young adults and have trained thousands of health professionals around the world. In addition, through pure determination, Operation Smile has built bridges and built trust. As a result, it has created a presence, earned the respect of governments and ministries of health, and united cultures in over 25 developing countries. 
   Operation Smile consists of a diverse group of volunteers from various countries and cultures, who come together with the common goal of repairing childhood facial deformities. Through these missions, the strongest bonds of friendships are forged as people who have very little in common work together to change a life. Operation Smile has demonstrated an ability to find working partnerships amid unstable and controversial conditions. Through diplomacy and leadership, coupled with medical aid and technology, it is able to heal and inspire cross-cultural cooperation. 
   While promoting medical diplomacy, Operation Smile continues to cross borders, bridge cultural and ethnic divides, and encourage collaboration and commitment. Its success has been astounding and as a result, Operation Smile has become the largest volunteer charity of its kind. Its efforts go beyond children and their families--Operation Smile changes communities, students, medical professionals, and healthcare systems. 
   Just this past year, Operation Smile traveled to Jordan on two separate occasions in order to provide life-changing surgeries to 138 Iraqi children who were transported to Amman from Baghdad, and it worked with the Mercy ships to treat 54 children in Bangladesh. These missions consisted of volunteers from over a dozen countries who worked together side by side to help these children. In this time of war, the volunteers of Operation Smile managed to bring a bright light to the lives of these children that will last a lifetime. 
   In the war against terrorism, hatred of Americans by other populations is a significant problem. The work of Operation Smile is immeasurable in developing good will to counteract that hatred. The doctors and other volunteers who work with Operation Smile and the children who have been helped by Operation Smile will serve as perpetual evidence of our good will and the best America has to offer. I cannot think of better ambassadors for the United States than the founders of Operation Smile, Dr. Bill and Kathleen Magee. 
   In 1982, Bill and Kathleen saw a need both abroad and here at home to help children with deformities live a better and happier life. Because of their diligence, and that of the many volunteers and donors that have worked with Operation Smile over the past 25 years, Operation Smile has not only created smiles, but has changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of children across the globe. 
   I would like to once again commend Operation Smile on the occasion of their 25th anniversary, and I wish them continued success bringing smiles to the faces of children and families worldwide.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTION OF MODELING AND SIMULATION TECHNOLOGY TO THE SECURITY AND PROSPERITY OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 487, which recognizes modeling and simulation as a national critical technology. I would like to thank my friend from Virginia's Fourth Congressional District and the chair of the Congressional Modeling and Simulation Caucus, Congressman Randy Forbes, for introducing this important resolution. 
   Modeling and simulation has become an essential component in ensuring that we meet both the defense and domestic challenges of the 21st century. Modeling and simulation allows us to easily and effectively sharpen the tools, procedures, and decisions needed to address difficult and complex problems. This critical technology allows us to build and develop models of complex systems--whether a car, an airplane, an entire battlefield, or even a major city's evacuation plan--to see how certain actions will affect the end result. These simulations help us develop better and practical analogies of real world situations. With the growing international challenges of the 21st century, this technology is vital to the defense of our great Nation. Simulating battlefield conditions will sharpen the skills of the brave men and women serving in our armed forces. 
   Madam Speaker, the practical uses of modeling, analysis and simulation technology as a training tool are boundless. Military and airline pilots have been using this technology for decades. Congress should be interested in using this technology for homeland security, disaster preparedness, and other ways to benefit the public; the resolution before the House today ensures that this body is aware of how critical this technology is for our Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent the people and businesses of the Third Congressional District of Virginia who are a part of this important and growing sector of Virginia's economy. In addition to our local military bases supporting the Joint Forces Center in Suffolk, our local colleges and universities and NASA Langley Research Center on the Virginia peninsula are engaged in applying people, tools and facilities to modeling, analysis and simulation technology. Hampton Roads is leading the way in modeling and simulation technology. The Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center in Suffolk, Virginia, is a premier facility that is second to none. 
   The modeling and simulation industry is vital to the growing economy of Hampton Roads and the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Hampton Roads Congressional Delegation has a history of working together and we will continue to do so in promoting this important industry in this Congress. Using modeling and simulation technology in the fields of science, national defense, homeland security and disaster planning will better the lives of all Americans and make our great Nation safer. 
   Madam Speaker, I am glad that the House is considering this resolution today and I encourage all my colleagues to support this resolution and to learn more about this critical technology.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (SECURING AIRCRAFT COCKPITS AGAINST LASERS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1615, the Securing Aircraft Cockpits Against Lasers Act of 2007. And I want to thank Chairman Conyers for holding a markup and moving the bill through the full committee. I would also like to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller), who has been instrumental in bringing attention to this issue. Congressman Keller introduced this bill in the 109th Congress. I joined him in cosponsoring the bill then, and I continue to support the legislation now. 
   The purpose of the bill is to address the problem of individuals aiming lasers at cockpits of aircraft, and this is particularly troublesome since it will usually occur at the critical stages of take-off and landing. This practice obviously constitutes a threat to aviation security and passenger safety. The bill adds a section following title 18, U.S. Code, section 38, to impose criminal penalties upon any individual who knowingly aims a laser pointer at an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States.     
   The penalties impose imprisonment up to 5 years in prison. 
   Research from the FAA has shown that laser illuminations can temporarily disorient or disable a pilot during critical stages of flight, such as taking off and landing, and in some cases may cause permanent injury to the pilot. For example, in 2004, a laser aimed at an airplane flying over Salt Lake City injured the eye of one of the plane's pilots. In January, 2005, responding to concerns regarding this escalating problem, the FAA issued an advisory to pilots instructing them to immediately report laser beams directed at their aircraft. 
   The House passed similar legislation in the 109th Congress. The Senate did, also. The legislation placed a provision in title 49, the Transportation title, and included a different level of intent. The House and Senate were unable to agree on a compromise version before the end of the 109th Congress. This version represents a compromise between the House and the Senate from the last Congress. 
   Although I have some concern that when the bill is applied it might involve some misguided young person fooling around with a laser beam, I realize that the conduct the bill prohibits can be dangerous, so it must be strongly discouraged. Since the bill does not have mandatory minimum sentencing, the Sentencing Commission and the courts can apply appropriate punishment for violators based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. 
   After the bill is passed, as a further precautionary step, the appropriate committee of jurisdiction should consider requiring manufacturers of laser products to issue strong notices and warnings on the items and packaging regarding the provision of this law to put users on notice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think passing this bill is an appropriate step for Congress to address this potentially dangerous problem. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (INTERNET SPYWARE (I-SPY) PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1525, the Internet Spyware (I-SPY) Prevention Act of 2007. I would like to commend Congresswoman Lofgren and Congressman Goodlatte for developing the legislation and moving the bill on a bipartisan basis. Earlier this month the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security held a hearing and markup on the bill and reported it favorably to the full committee. 
   The bill amends title 18, U.S. Code, to impose criminal penalties on those who use spyware to perpetrate identity theft and numerous other privacy intrusions on innocent Internet users. The bill also provides resources and guidance to the Department of Justice for the prosecution of these offenses. 
   The bill is narrowly aimed at the practices of using ``spyware'' and ``phishing'' to harm consumers. Recent studies estimate that 80 percent of computers are infected with some form of spyware and that 89 percent of consumers are unaware of the fact that they have spyware. The greatest security and privacy challenges posed by spyware relate to technologies such as keystroke logging programs that capture a user's passwords, Social Security, or account numbers. This information can then be redirected for criminal purposes including fraud, larceny, identity theft, or other cyber crimes. 
   This bill combats spyware by clarifying that it is a crime, punishable for up to 5 years in prison, to intentionally access a computer without authorization by causing a computer program or code to be copied onto a computer and then using that program or code in furtherance of another Federal criminal offense. The bill also provides fines or imprisonment up to 2 years for anyone who, through means of that program or code, intentionally obtains, or transmits to another, personal information with the intent to defraud or injure a person. 
   The bill also authorizes funds to combat ``phishing.'' Phishing is a general term for using what appears to others to be either the Web site of, or e-mails from, well-known, legitimate businesses in an attempt to deceive Internet users into revealing their personal information. Phishing is adequately covered by the criminal code under existing Federal wire fraud or identity theft statutes, but additional funds are needed to prosecute the crime. This bill would authorize $10 million for each of the fiscal years 2008-2011 to combat phishing and spyware. 
   I would also like to note that the Energy and Commerce Committee is considering a bill on this subject as well. But that bill lacks the criminal penalty enforcement mechanism in this bill and in its place imposes a regulatory scheme which focuses on the uses of technology rather than the perpetrators of crimes. My concern is such a regulatory regime may unavoidably sweep in legitimate uses of the technology. 
   The I-SPY Prevention Act is a strong bill that protects consumers by providing criminal penalties for egregious behavior. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (MENTALLY ILL OFFENDER TREATMENT AND CRIME REDUCTION REAUTHORIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3992, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007. Since the 1960s, State mental health hospitals have increasingly reduced their populations of mentally ill individuals in response to a nationwide call for deinstitutionalization. 
   The move toward deinstitutionalization was based on the fact that mentally ill individuals are constitutionally entitled to refuse treatment, or at least to have it provided in the least restrictive environment. Unfortunately, neither the local governments for the States nor the Federal Government have invested the necessary resources to meet the needs for community-based mental health treatment and services created and needed by deinstitutionalization. 
   A 2006 report by the United States Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics entitled ``Mental Health Problems of Prison and Jail Inmates'' suggests that the criminal justice system has become, by default, the primary caregiver of the most seriously mentally ill individuals. The bureau reports that over one-half of the prison and jail population of this country is mentally ill. More specifically, 56 percent of State prisoners, 45 percent of Federal prisoners, and 64 percent of jail inmates have some degree of mental illness. 
   The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill reports that, on any given day, there are at least 284,000 seriously mentally ill people in hospitals and jails in this country, such as people suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or serious depression. However, only 187,000 of them are in mental health facilities. This issue is of particular concern in Virginia, my home State. 
   In August of 2007, the Virginia General Assembly's Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission released a 200-page report on the state of mental health services in Virginia. The report revealed a number of disturbing facts, among them that there are more people with mental illness behind bars in Virginia than there are in mental health facilities, with hospital care accounting for only a fraction of the needs of our State's estimated 400,000 mentally ill individuals in Virginia. 
   Since deinstitutionalization in Virginia, the daily number of mentally ill adults in State hospitals has dropped  from 11,532 to 1,452, a drop of 87 percent. Of the 6,350 mentally ill individuals in hospitals and jails on a given day, 60 percent were actually in jails because regional mental health facilities are not providing inpatient mental health services. 
   Since 1991, the number of psychiatric beds available has dropped by 800, or 31 percent, and the beds that are available are concentrated in one area of the State. In fact, there are no freestanding, profitable psychiatric hospitals west of Richmond. 
   These findings in Virginia are similar to those across the Nation that were discussed at a hearing that we held this spring in our subcommittee which revealed that our criminal justice system is serving as the primary caregiver for our mentally ill individuals. 
   One piece of good news in all of this focus on mental health in the criminal justice system is that mental health courts have proven to be a helpful tool for helping mentally ill individuals in several communities that have such programs. H.R. 3992 will assist further in this regard. 
   First, it will reauthorize the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction grant program, increasing the current authorization from $50 million to $75 million. It will also reauthorize the mental health courts program, and will expand the permissible use of funds to include pretrial services and funding for alternatives to incarceration. 
   Additionally, H.R. 3992 creates four new grant programs. One will provide grants to States and other law enforcement agencies to help officers learn how to access individuals with mental health illnesses and to work with the local agencies to provide the most effective placement for a person in custody. 
   Another program will provide grants to help correctional agencies learn how to identify and screen mentally ill prisoners so they can get help while incarcerated, or even be placed in alternatives to incarceration. These grants will also help correctional services plan for reentry into the community. 
   Another program provides grants to States to coordinate and improve the treatment of mentally ill offenders, including facilitating information sharing between agencies. The grant will also encourage States to promote evidence-based practices to improve treatment and services. 
   Lastly, a new program will provide States and units of local government to improve the treatment of female offenders with mental illnesses and create family support services and intensive case management. 
   The total cost for the new programs will be $35 million for fiscal years 2008 through 2013. That amount is much less than we are currently spending on incarcerating mentally ill offenders who often have to be placed not only in isolated cells, but also in isolated areas to avoid disturbance of other inmates. 
   Despite common misconceptions, the majority of mentally ill people who are arrested and incarcerated are low-level, nonviolent offenders. These programs will help jurisdictions to assist mentally ill persons and help keep them from unnecessarily going to jails and prisons. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I include for the Record a letter from the Council of State Governments Justice Center in support of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (NATIONAL STALKING AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res. 852, joining the strong bipartisan effort to raise awareness in the toll that stalking takes on our society. Every year, stalking affects approximately 1.4 million Americans of both genders, all races, ages, sexual orientation, disabilities, and economic status. 
   The consequences of stalking are serious. Stalking can paralyze the victim with fear, which is well founded, because stalking often leads to physical attacks from the victim. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government not only recognize stalking as a crime, but categorize it as a felony. 
   Stalkers cause their victims severe emotional distress, including anxiety, insomnia, social dysfunction and depression, all of which can affect all aspects on a person's life, including family, social activities and work. In fact, the emotional distress is so disabling that 11 percent of stalking victims have been forced to relocate their homes, 30 percent report seeking psychological counseling, and 74 percent report being stalked in a way that interferes with their employment. 
   Of course, the ultimate threat of stalking is to the victim's very life. 
   Over 75 percent of women murdered by an intimate partner had been stalked by that partner, and 54 percent of female murder victims had reported being stalked to police before being killed by their stalkers. With the rapid advancements in technology, stalkers  have ever-increasing access to personal information of their victims, raising their victims' vulnerability to an all-time high. 
   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 852 and recognizing January 2008 as National Stalking Awareness Month. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (DEATH IN CUSTODY REPORTING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3971 is entitled the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2008. It will reauthorize the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 which actually expired on December 31, 2006.     
   This is a bipartisan effort which I introduced with my colleague from Virginia, Representative Randy Forbes, and who was, at that time, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime. Its purpose is to provide continued and improved oversight over the conduct of law enforcement officials during arrest and imprisonment of fellow citizens. 
   Before the enactment of the Death in Custody Act of 2000, States and localities had no uniform requirements for reporting the circumstances surrounding the deaths of persons in their custody, and some had no system for requiring such reports. The lack of uniform reporting requirements made it impossible to ascertain how many people were dying in custody and from what causes, although estimates by those concerned suggested that there were more than 1,000 deaths in custody each year, some under very suspicious circumstances. 
   Consequently, an environment of suspicion and concern arose surrounding  many of those deaths. Some that were ruled suicides or deaths from natural causes were suspected of being homicides committed by officers, fellow prisoners or others. Indifference to prisoner rights and the safety of those in custody made scrutiny of suspected deaths a low priority, so such questionable causes were rarely investigated. 
   In the mid-1980s, researchers, reporters, prison and jail accreditation organizations, prison reformers, activists, and others began to give more scrutiny to the death rate in our Nation's jails and prisons and to the fact that such deaths were not being routinely reported to anybody. 
   In fact, by 1986, only 25 States and the District of Columbia even had jail inspection units. Moreover, even the States that did report deaths did it on the basis of different reporting standards. The insufficient data and the lack of uniformity of the data collected made oversight of prisoner safety woefully inadequate. 
   However, the interest in oversight that emerged shed light on the conditions in State and local jails, which began a rising tide of wrongful death litigation. The increasing litigation forced some measure of accountability, and conditions somewhat improved. Moreover, activism and news of the litigation spurned by media interests, and that shed further light on the conditions in our present jails and prisons. 
   The watershed moment for bringing the death in custody rate to national attention occurred in 1995. After a 1-year investigation by journalist Mike Masterson into prison conditions and the death rate of persons in custody, the Asbury Park Press of New Jersey ran a series of award-winning editorials that brought the seriousness of the lack of reporting to the Nation's attention. The editorials went on to detail abuses, including racially motivated violence, overzealous police investigations, cover-ups and general law enforcement incompetence, which prompted Congress to take action. 
   Following successive introduction of bills in several Congresses by my colleagues from Arkansas, first Representative Tim Hutchinson, then later Representative Asa Hutchinson, the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 was passed. The law required States receiving certain Federal grants to comply with reporting requirements established by the Attorney General. 
   Since the enactment in 2000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics has compiled a number of statistics detailing the circumstances of prisoner deaths, the rate of deaths in prison and jails, and the rate of deaths based on the size of various facilities and so forth. But the most astounding statistic reported since the enactment of the bill before is the latest Bureau of Justice statistics report dated August 2005, which shows a 64 percent decline in suicides and a 93 percent decline in homicides in custody since 1980. Those statistics showing a significant decline in the death rate in our Nation's prisons and jails since stricter oversight has been in place suggest that the oversight measures, such as the Death in Custody Reporting Act, play an important role in ensuring the safety and security of prisoners who are in the custody of State facilities. 
   In considering the reauthorization of the bill, the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security examined the statistics and heard testimony from witnesses whose testimony also supported the suggestion that oversight has actually improved conditions. Convinced of the effectiveness of the Death in Custody Act, we resolved to not only reauthorize it but also improve it. 
   To ascertain the most effective use of the statistical data, H.R. 3971 differs from the original bill in that it authorizes $500,000 for a study to determine which policies and procedures have, in fact, led to or at least assisted the decreasing death rate among prisoners. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend, Mr. Forbes, for his support of the bill. I encourage my colleagues to support it. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of the legislation.  
    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your leadership on efforts to address warrantless surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or ``FISA'' and for introducing a bill that corrects many of the shortcomings of the bill that passed the House last August. 
   The RESTORE Act establishes a strong framework, much stronger than the Administration's PROTECT Act, to fight terrorism effectively, while providing reasonable safeguards to protect personal privacy. 
   One important change in the Restore Act is that it draws the appropriate distinctions based on the physical location and types of targets. There has never been any controversy over the fact that surveillance directed at people all of whom are overseas does not need any warrant at all. This bill rightly makes it clear that no court orders are required for the government to conduct surveillance on foreign targets outside the United States, even if the technical surveillance is conducted on U.S. soil. But if any surveillance is intentionally conducted on a U.S. person, this bill makes it clear that the government needs to apply for an individual warrant to conduct that surveillance. And if information on U.S. persons is incidentally collected, the Manager's Amendment to the bill rightly limits dissemination of that information among government agencies. 
   Second, the bill removes vague and overbroad language from the bill passed in August that would allow the wiretapping of conversations without a warrant if the communication was ``concerning'' a foreign target. That, by its own wording, suggests 
   that if two citizens are in the United States talking about somebody overseas, that you could wiretap their communications without a warrant. The bill before us makes it clear that the persons involved in the communications must be overseas, not just that the subject of their conversation must be overseas. 
   Third, the RESTORE Act goes a step further than the Administration's bill and allows for the expanded wiretapping authority only in cases involving ``national security,'' as opposed to the over-expansive ``foreign intelligence.'' ``Foreign intelligence'' could include trade, deals or anything involving general foreign affairs activities. 
   Finally, the RESTORE Act was made even stronger in Committee by requiring the Department of Justice, in its application to the Court, to identify the ``primary purpose'' of its wiretapping. Under the original FISA, when an agent wanted to obtain the authority to conduct electronic surveillance or secret searches, a certificate was necessary detailing what the purpose of the surveillance was in order to obtain the warrant. The standard was altered by the Patriot Act, which provided that obtaining foreign intelligence only has to be ``a significant purpose.'' 
   We have to put this change in context because the Department of Justice has not credibly refuted the allegations that some U.S. Attorneys were fired, because they failed to indict Democrats in time to affect an upcoming election. So if the Department of Justice wiretapped someone when foreign intelligence was not the primary purpose, you have to wonder what the primary purpose was. This bill would allow the surveillance to be conducted but the administration would be required to reveal the true purpose of the wiretap to the secret FISA court. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that we do not have to balance security and privacy. It is therefore important to note that everything that the administration can do in its own bill, it can do under this bill. We just require them to get a warrant before they do it, or if they are in a hurry, get a warrant after they do it, but they can wiretap and get the information. We just provide a modicum of oversight to ensure that our laws are being obeyed. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF HOUSE WITH RESPECT TO RAISING AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGING PREVENTION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 289 recognizes April as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. The purpose of National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month is to increase the public's awareness and understanding about sexual violence in our society in order to encourage and support prevention of sexual assault. 
   The United States has the highest rate of any country publishing such statistics. A person is sexually assaulted in the United States every 2 1/2 minutes. The National Institute of Justice estimates that over 300,000 women and 90,000 men are forcibly raped each  year in the United States; but according to the American Medical Association, these numbers are lower than national incidents of rape or attempted rape. 
   Approximately 17.7 million American women and 2.8 American men have been victims of rape or attempted rape at some point during their lives, according to the Bureau of Justice statistics. That equates to one in every six women and one in every 33 men. The National Center for Victims of Crime indicate that among women who have been raped, 39 percent have been raped more than once. Most victims are children or young adults. Some 44 percent of sexual assault victims are under the age of 18; 80 percent are under the age of 30. 
   There are no significant differences in the rate of sexual assault among racial and ethnic groups, as sexual assault affects all populations roughly equally, though its impact is felt disproportionately by those least able to protect themselves. For example, persons with disabilities are estimated to be one and a half to five times more at risk of sexual assault than the general population. Between one-third and two-thirds of known sexual assault victims are age 15 or younger, according to a 2000 study by Population Reports, and women age 16 to 25 are three times more likely to be raped than those of higher age groups, according to the Bureau of Justice statistics. Also, the studies indicate that those in extreme poverty are twice as likely to be victimized as other women. 
   Most sexual assaults are not committed by strangers. Studies show that 70 percent of victims know their attackers, and this contributes to the underreporting of sexual assault. At the same time, studies show that 90 percent of those who knew their attackers did not report the crime. The study also found that most sexual assaults occur in the victim's home or that of a friend, relative, or acquaintance. 
   The consequences of sexual assault for victims are enormous and go well beyond physical effects. One-third of victims suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the National Victims Center; one-third seriously consider suicide; 13 percent actually attempt suicide. 
   The roots of sexual assault violence are cultural. A 1991 study by the Jacqueline White and John Humphrey study found that 56 percent of high school girls and 76 percent of high school boys thought that forcible sex was acceptable under some circumstances. Some 51 percent of boys and 41 percent of girls thought that certain circumstances included when a boy ``spent a lot of money on the girl.'' Thirty-one percent of boys and 32 percent of girls thought that forced sex was acceptable when women had had past sexual experiences. Eighty-seven percent of boys and 79 percent of girls thought it was acceptable when a man and woman were married. Sixty-five percent of boys, 47 percent of girls thought it acceptable if a boy and a girl had been dating for more than 6 months. 
   So, Madam Speaker, it is easy to see where there is need to focus much of our awareness and prevention efforts. 
   Sexual assault is a threat to the public health and public safety. It demands a coordinated response in the form of awareness, prevention, aggressive prosecution and service provision. The National Sexual Violence Resource Center, a project of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape, estimates that there are 1,400 community crisis centers providing services to victims of sexual assault across the country. Such efforts have made a difference. Over the past decade, we have reduced the rate of rapes and attempted rapes by half. Yet at half, our highest level, we are still the highest rate of sexual assault in the world. So much more needs to be done to further address the scourge in our society. 
   So, Madam Speaker, as we observe National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, it is our hope that a month of intensified awareness efforts combined with a broad spectrum of sexual violence prevention work throughout the year will bring us closer to ending and eradicating sexual assault in our society. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 119 recognizes this week as National Crime Victims' Rights Week in order to increase public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of victims and survivors of crime in the United States during this week and throughout the year. Obviously, we are very attuned to victims this week as we mourn the tragic deaths and injuries of the Virginia Tech shootings last week, though this resolution was scheduled for victims generally, without any reference to specific victims. 
   In 2003, the last year for which we have compiled figures, there were 24.2 million criminal victimizations of people over the age of 12 in the United States. Of those, 5.4 million were violent victimizations and 18.6 were property victimizations. Unfortunately, there were many more crimes than those figures suggest. It is estimated that only 48 percent of violent crimes and only 38 percent of property crimes are reported to police in each year. 
   We talked about the large group of victims in the resolution preceding this one involving sexual assault victims. Clearly we want to be aware of the need of victims of all crimes and do whatever we can, not only to address victimizations that occur but also to prevent the crimes occurring in the first place. Supporting the mission and goals of the National Crime Victims' Rights Week will increase the public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of victims and survivors of crime, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I wish to offer my sincerest condolences to the family of Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. My thoughts and prayers go out to them in their time of mourning. 
   Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD amassed many firsts and accomplishments during her life as a public servant by breaking racial and gender barriers. She was the first African-American woman to serve as Ranking Member and Chairman of the powerful House Committee on Administration. She was also the first woman to serve on the Carson City Council; the first to chair two powerful California State Assembly committees--the Insurance Committee; and the Revenue & Taxation Committee in her first term as a state legislator. She was also the first African-American Democratic Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues and in that capacity she led the women on two groundbreaking meetings: One with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to talk about the plight of women globally and another with the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange to develop strategies for increasing women's investments and net worth. 
   In recognition of women who served in our military, Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD initiated the first annual Memorial Day Tribute to Women in the Military at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery and she led the fight to secure $15 million for the maintenance of the memorial. Most recently secured $50 million for counseling services for our returning men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   During her 6 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, her ability to reach across the aisle and effectively move bipartisan legislation was evident during her work on a range of issues, including ensuring equal rights for women and minorities, improving our education system, combating poverty, protecting voting rights, and stopping the genocide in Darfur. 
   Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD devoted her life to her family and to service on behalf of her constituents in the 37th District of California and to the Nation. Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER MCDONALD was truly a phenomenal woman. She is a friend and colleague who will be sorely missed.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Conference report to H.R. 2669 the College Cost Reduction and Access  Act. I would like to thank my colleagues who worked diligently to bring this legislation before the full Congress, including Chairman Miller, Chairman Kennedy, and Subcommittee Chairman Hinojosa. 
   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act takes savings generated as a result of the reconciliation process and makes four major investments in America's students, especially students in African American communities. 
   First, the bill will increase the maximum Pell grant scholarship--the Federal scholarship for low- and moderate-income students--over the next 5 years to $5,400. This increase in the Pell program is critical. Since the 2001-2002 school year, tuition at public four-year colleges has risen 55 percent. Unfortunately, during that same time period, the maximum Pell grant award increased by less than 8 percent and did not increase at all over the past 4 years. 
   Second, H.R. 2669 will cut the interest rate on student loans in half over the next 4 years. This interest rate reduction will provide enormous relief to the many students who take out subsidized Federal loans. 
   Third, this legislation will make a strong and historic investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and minority serving institutions. HBCUs represent an important piece of our history and investments in HBCUs are imperative for both student services and programs as well as institutional needs and infrastructure improvements. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act shows this commitment by improving and increasing funding for much needed student programming and opportunities. The funding for these colleges and institutions can be used for a variety of important programs and needs, including science and lab equipment, library books, and enhancement of certain disciplines of instruction such as math, computer science, engineering and health care. 
   This funding will go a long way toward closing the achievement gap that exists across our nation and helping those who wish to better themselves through education achieve their goals. The bill also provides, for the first time ever, funding for Predominantly Black Institutions and Asian and Pacific Islander-serving institutions, thereby recognizing the importance of institutions of higher learning that serve these communities. In addition, it also provides additional funding to Hispanic-serving institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native-serving institutions, and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions. While this funding will cover only a portion of the unique needs of these historical places of learning, I appreciate the commitment that members of the House Education and Labor Committee have expressed to continue to find ways to support these important institutions. 
   Finally, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act includes a provision to aid the Upward Bound program, which is the last hope and ticket to the future for many low income and first generation college students. The bill includes an additional $228 million to fund both new and prior funded Upward Bound programs across the Nation. This funding will reach several Upward Bound programs at HBCUs. In this grant cycle, 30 percent of Upward Bound programs at HBCUs would have been eliminated despite an increase in the total number of Upward Bound programs receiving grants. This provision would also provide funding to other deserving Upward Bound programs including programs serving Hispanic students. 
   I believe the College Cost Reduction and Access Act contains critical support for our nation's higher education system and I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin the discussion on the budget with where we are. And I'd like to use charts because a lot of rhetoric goes back and forth. 
   This is a statement of where we are right now. You will see the budget deficit year by year was improved in the 8 years of Democratic leadership on the budget and in the last few years has totally collapsed. It has collapsed to the point where we had a surplus projected, a 5- or 10-year surplus of $5.5 trillion, a surplus projected for those 10 years starting in 2001. Those 10 years look like they're going to come in at a $3 trillion deficit. That's an $8.8 trillion deterioration. That's an average of over $800 billion a year deterioration in the budget. 
   We didn't create any jobs during this time. This job performance under this administration is the worst since Herbert Hoover. You can say what you want, but that's just the arithmetic fact. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus is dealing with this budget responsibly. We, first of all, repeal the tax cuts that put us into the ditch to begin with. You can call that process whatever you want. You can rant and rave, but the fact is we are repealing all of those tax cuts that got us in the ditch, except those tax cuts that primarily affect that portion of your income under $200,000. Under $200,000 those tax cuts are protected. Those tax cuts that primarily affect your income over $200,000, those are the ones that we are repealing. We are able to, with that money, balance the budget and to go into surplus. 
   The red is the President's budget, which is significantly worse than the Congressional Black Caucus every year. The Congressional Black Caucus has a lower deficit in the first 3 years and a higher surplus in the next 3 years than either the President's budget or the Democratic budget. We are so responsible, in fact, that we save interest on the national debt. Cumulative compared to the President we save $23 billion in the fifth year alone, $48 billion saved in interest over the 5 years compared to the President's budget. 
   We are also able to spend on our priorities. Education, compared to the President's budget, $160 billion more on education, particularly No Child Left Behind; $119 billion more in health care, particularly children's health that the President vetoed. Veterans benefits, $60 billion over the President's budget. We're not charging our veterans fees for the services that they desperately need. And justice programs, prevention programs, afterschool programs, and Second Chance Programs to make our communities safer, almost $35 billion extra. 
   This budget is responsible. It invests in our priorities, and it is much more fiscally responsible than the President's budget.

   Furthermore, we protect all of those tax cuts for that portion of the taxpayers' income under $200,000. It is just the tax cuts over $200,000 that primarily got us in the ditch.

But the alternative is to stay in the ditch. 
   We have a problem in that we have got Social Security we are going to end up having to pay in a few years. We have got more money coming in in Social Security than going out now. That is going to change in 2018, and we are not setting aside any money for that. We have a credible plan to get us out of the ditch by repealing what got us into the ditch.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown).     
   I want to thank the gentleman, Mr. Scott, for his leadership on the CBC budget. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Congressional Black Caucus alternative budget offered today. The CBC budget once again proposed to change a 7-year Republican policy that I have called Reverse Robin Hood, stealing from the poor to give tax breaks to the rich. 
   You might ask why the Democratic budget, which I support, needs improvement. The Democratic budget needs improvement because when America has a cold, the African American community has pneumonia. The CBC budget reversed the deep cuts that have been made to the programs that  serve the neediest Americans. This year's Congressional Black Caucus budget covers all eligible children with health care insurance through funding for CHIP, $84 billion more than the Democratic budget and $119 billion more than the President's; ensures no child is left behind by funding education and providing increased funding for Head Start, college access programs, college loans, and job training programs, $101 billion more than the Democratic budget and $162 billion more than the President's; honors our veterans by increasing funding for health care, benefits, and educational opportunities, $17 billion more than the Democratic budget and $60 billion over the President's budget; makes local community more secure by fully funding justice, gang prevention, and local law enforcement programs, as well as ensuring every voice counts by funding the Help America Vote Act. 
   We talk about a stimulus, and the only stimulus is the investment in our people, in education, in health care, in job training, so support economic and fiscal recovery. Vote ``yes'' on the budget. I encourage us to vote for the economic recovery by voting for the CBC budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I just want to make a couple of closing comments. First on defense, the number on defense, we keep the same number on the defense budget. However, we have different priorities. Those priorities will be debated in a different forum. 
   The $70 billion for the war we restrict to redeployment. We want those troops back as soon as practicable, consistent with our national security interests. 
   On waste, fraud, and abuse, we just don't talk about waste, fraud, and abuse. We spend $300 million to implement the GAO's studies and recommendations for how you can reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the military. We make them spend the money to actually implement those recommendations. 
   Our budget eliminates the fees and copays that the President's budget has for our veterans. It is insulting to try to balance the budget on the backs of our courageous veterans. We do have entitlement reform, $150 billion in entitlement reform, by reducing the subsidies to private corporations who provide Medicare Advantage. Those that provide, those are the subsidies that you get nothing for. Medicare could do it cheaper, $150 billion cheaper, and that's the reform that we have. 
   A lot has been said about tax cuts. We repeal what got us in the ditch. We protect those tax cuts that primarily affect that portion of your income under $200,000. 
   In summary, this is where we are, back in the ditch. We repeal the tax cuts that got us into the ditch. One of those tax cuts that we want to repeal is a $20 billion tax cut referred to as PEP and Pease, affecting personal exemptions and standard deductions. The only people that get this essentially are millionaires. If you make over $1 million you get this much tax cut; $200,000 to $1 million, you get that much tax cut; $100,000 to $200,000 you don't need ink to draw the bar; and $100,000, out of this $20 billion, you get, on average, zero. All of those tax cuts, we have said, had the greatest expansion in recent history. 
   Let's talk about the arithmetic. Arithmetic fact, worst job growth since Herbert Hoover. Look at the job growth of all the Presidents down to President Hoover; worst, this administration, and they are bragging about it. 
   We have a responsible budget that reduces the deficit, goes into surplus. It's a responsible budget that also funds many of our priorities: education, health care, veterans, justice. It is a responsible budget, and I would ask for the House to adopt this budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have to remind ourselves exactly where we are with the policies that took place in 2001 and 2003 and what has happened to our budget. You will see that we dug ourselves out of a ditch from 1993 to 2001, and it had a surplus. And overnight that surplus has absolutely collapsed. And we need a chart because there is a lot of partisanship on the floor. If you tried to describe this, people would think you're being partisan because they can't believe that you could do this to the budget. 
   In fact, in the 10 years after 2001, we had a projected surplus of $5.5 trillion. After the policies of 2001 and 2003, it looks like we are going to have a $3 trillion deficit, not a surplus, a swing of $8.8 trillion. 
   Now, a $5.5 trillion surplus. Everybody knows that the Social Security program is in trouble. In 2001 we had a shortfall of $4 trillion in the Social Security program. If we had $4 trillion in the bank in 2001, we could pay Social Security for 75 years without reducing benefits. We had a surplus of $5.6 trillion, not just the $4 trillion we needed to solve all of the problems in Social Security. 
   When we started in 2001, one of the questions that Chairman Greenspan had to answer was, what's going to happen when we pay off the national debt? Because by 2013 we would have paid off the national debt and put all the money back in the trust funds. Zero debt, zero interest on the national debt. Now it looks like in 2013 we're going to have to pay $300 billion a year in interest on the national debt because we messed up the budget. And $300 billion at $30,000 each is enough to hire everybody now drawing unemployment with money to spare with a $30,000-a-year job. That's $30,000 a year for everybody drawing unemployment. You've got money left over before you run out of people. 
   Now, we have heard that by cutting all these taxes, we increase revenues. Well, let me just show you this chart that shows the income tax revenues over the past years going back to 1960. The color code says that green is a year in which you had a record revenue. Red is a year in which you did not have a record revenue. You look back since 1960 through recessions, depressions, good times, bad times, high taxes, low taxes. We had record revenues every year but two, and the following year you had a record revenue. So we always get record revenues. Whoops, excuse me. Until 2001 and 2003, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 consecutive years without record revenues. So we didn't get record revenues. 
   And we hear that people are bragging about jobs that were created during this time. Let's look at the chart, get rid of the arithmetic. The worst job performance in this administration since Herbert Hoover. You've got to go back to Herbert Hoover to find job performance any worse that this. 
   So we've gotten into the ditch. We're trying to get out of the ditch. The Democratic budget makes the responsible decisions to try to get us out of the ditch. We've had tough decisions. 
   And other things like earmarks, we have heard this thing about earmarks: just cut out the earmarks and we will save some money. Let's have a word about how these earmarks work. If you have an appropriation of $200 million and I have got a little earmark for $1 million for a program in my district, that comes out of the $200 million. If I don't get an earmark, $200 million. If I get an earmark, $200 million. Get rid of the earmarks, and you're not saving the taxpayers any money. What this Republican budget does is it has a fantasy of about $800 billion in unspecified cuts. We don't know where these cuts are coming from. It might be health care. It might be student loans, school lunches, food safety, airline inspections, homeland security, port security grants, public safety. We've already tried to cut back on the COPS program. 
   This budget makes no sense unless you actually name the cuts, because the fact of matter is you're probably not going to cut student loans. You're probably not going to cut the school nutrition program. You say you're going to cut, and you don't do it. And so you've had the tax cuts. You got us in the ditch. And then when the spending cuts come around, nothing happens. So until they start naming what will be cut, this entire budget proposal substitute makes no sense. 
   I would hope that we would adopt the Democratic budget. I would have hoped that we had had the Congressional Black Caucus budget, but the Democratic budget makes a responsible attempt to reduce the deficit, go into surplus, and make the expenditures on the priorities that we desperately need. 
   We should reject this substitute and adopt the underlying bill.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, we have heard about this average tax cut. I just want to show a chart of what they mean when they talk about ``average.'' 
   This is a $20 billion tax cut that's in the Republican package. It's involving personal exemption phaseout and the elimination of ceilings on itemized deductions. This is $20 billion, which is an average $100 for every man, woman, and child. And here's how you distribute the average for this tax cut: if you make over $1 million, you get $17,500. If you make $200,000 to $1 million, you get about $650. If you make $100,000 to $200,000, you get $11 out of this tax cut. And if you make under $100,000, you get on average zero. This is what they call an ``average'' $100-a-person tax cut. 
   When they talk about the biggest tax cut and all this kind of stuff, let's be clear. What is repealed or what we allow to expire are the kinds of policies that got us into the ditch to begin with. We need to let them expire, get back on the right track, balance the budget, and address our priorities.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (PREVENT ALL CIGARETTE TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act, or PACT Act, introduced by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner), strengthens our law enforcement capabilities against the illegal smuggling of tobacco products.  
   Every year, billions of cigarettes are illegally smuggled across State lines. This fraudulent activity not only harms the public health but deprives State and local governments of sorely needed tax revenues. 
   In fact, tax evasion is a chief motivator for cigarette smuggling. Buying cigarettes in a State where the cigarette tax is low and selling them in a State where the cigarette tax is high allows the trafficker to sell the cigarettes at a discount and still turn an illicit profit. 
   States lose $1 billion in uncollected taxes each year as a result of illegal cigarette smuggling. The illicit profit also helps finance other criminal activity which creates a revenue stream for organized crime. 
   Because of the scope and interstate nature of this activity, States cannot adequately address it on their own. It has long been recognized as a Federal concern. 
   With the existing Federal statutes, the Jenkins Act, which requires reporting interstate cigarette sales to tax officials in the buyer's State, and the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act, which prohibits knowingly dealing in contraband cigarettes or smokeless tobacco, those two statutes are simply not up to the task in the Internet age. 
   The Internet, in particular, makes it possible for today's tobacco smugglers to be even more mobile and invisible and to operate with near impunity. Even when the smugglers can be identified and pursued, they can simply shut down operations and quickly reappear under a new name and Web site. 
   The PACT Act addresses the shortcomings in the current law by targeting the delivery systems for illegal Internet tobacco sales: the postal system and commercial delivery services. 
   With limited exceptions, sending tobacco products through the United States mail will be criminally prohibited. And vendors using commercial delivery services for retail sales will be required to notify the tax authorities in the receiving State, conspicuously label all tobacco products, verify the purchaser's age, and keep careful records of all sales. 
   The bill raises cigarette trafficking from a misdemeanor to a felony. And it authorizes the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to inspect the premises and files of sellers of significant quantities of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco.     
   H.R. 4081 enjoys support from a diverse spectrum of entities, including the National Association of Convenience Stores, Altria--the parent company of Phillip Morris--the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Wholesale Marketers Association, and the National Association of Attorneys General, among others. 
   I commend my colleague, Mr. Weiner, for his leadership on this important legislation. I also commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, and the ranking member, Mr. Smith, for their leadership in making this a bipartisan effort. 
   I also want to thank the other committees whose jurisdiction has touched on this bill for working with us to bring it to the floor today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.   
    House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
   Washington, DC, September 8, 2008. Hon. John Conyers, Jr., Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
   Dear Chairman Conyers: I write to you regarding H.R. 4081, the ``Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2008''. 
   H.R. 4081 contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and, accordingly, I will not seek a sequential referral of the bill. However, I agree to waive consideration of this bill with the mutual understanding that my decision to forego a sequential referral of the bill does not waive, reduce, or otherwise affect the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure over H.R. 4081. 
   Further, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees during any House-Senate conference convened on this legislation on provisions of the bill that are within the Committee's jurisdiction. I ask for your commitment to support any request by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the appointment of conferees on H.R. 4081 or similar legislation. 
   Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's jurisdictional interest in the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House Floor. 
   I look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass this important legislation. 
   Sincerely, 
   James L. Oberstar, Chairman.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. As a member of the Congressional Asian American Pacific American Caucus, and as the only Member of Congress with any Filipino ancestry, I'm pleased to speak on the floor today in honor of this great month. 
   Since the early 1800s, the AAPI community has played a vital role in the development and growth of this country. I'd like to take just a moment to highlight one of the many contributions that the AAPI community has played in American history, and that is, the accomplishments of the Filipino American veterans during World War II. 
   Members of the Commonwealth of the Philippines' military fought tirelessly for the United States during World War II. The invaluable service that the members of the military helped provide us the necessary support to defeat the Japanese empire in the Pacific. 
   Last year, Congressman Filner introduced, and I cosponsored, the Filipino Veterans Equity Act, which will ensure that the Filipino veterans who served in World War II will receive the veterans benefits promised to them over 60 years ago. We need to pass this bill as soon as possible.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTION DIGITAL AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Opportunity Act of 2007. This bill authorizes grants to Minority Serving Institutions for technology improvements and infrastructure. Given the large gap in technology between MSI campuses and other American universities, this legislation is critical to improving MSI's educational advancements. 
   It is important to note that MSI's educational contributions are significant. For example, in 2000 at least 40 percent of all African American students who received a baccalaureate degree in physics, chemistry, astronomy, environmental sciences, mathematics and biology graduated from a historically Black college and university. Given their contributions to our society, we must do all we can to make sure that MSIs receive the most modern technology to keep up with other universities. 
   Unfortunately, at the current time, there is a ``digital divide'' between MSIs and other schools in technology infrastructure and programming. Less than half of the students attending Minority Serving Institutions own computers. Sadly, the majority of historically Black colleges and universities do not provide high speed access to the Internet [according to a Feb. 2004 report by the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education]. We also see this trend in minority communities around the country. Over 60 percent of the U.S. population uses the Internet at home, while only 46 percent of African Americans and 37 percent of Hispanics have Internet access at home [according to a Feb. 2004 report by the Alliance for Equity in Higher Education]. 
   The Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Opportunity Act of 2007 will help eliminate the technological disparities at MSIs by establishing a grant program. These grants will help MSIs purchase equipment, make upgrades and improve their technology infrastructure as well as provide technology education services. In addition, these grants will promote the use of information communications technology to strengthen engineering, math and science research. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Towns and Mr. Forbes for their efforts to bring this bill before Congress and their commitment to rectify this disparity. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 694.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (TRIBUTE TO FATHER ROBERT F. DRINAN, SJ -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for organizing this Special Order so that we could pay appropriate tribute to Father Drinan. 
   I rise today to honor the memory of our former colleague, the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts, Father Robert Drinan. Father Drinan was elected to this body in 1970 on a platform that advocated progressive ideals, basic human rights for all, and ending our involvement in Vietnam.  
   During his tenure in the House, Father Drinan was a powerful voice for the poor and disadvantaged; and as a man of faith, he clearly understood morality in its true sense. Just 2 years ago on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Father Drinan eloquently stated:  
   There's a common core of moral and religious beliefs, and frankly, we are in total violation of that. We are supposed to be good to the poor; we have more poor children in America than any other industrialized nation. We're supposed to love prisoners and help them; we have 2.1 million people in prison, the largest of any country on the Earth. We also allow 11 children to be killed every day. All of the religions are opposed to that. That's violence. Why don't we organize on that?  
   Father Drinan spent his life advocating to change these realities. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Father Drinan strived to reform our still broken criminal justice system; and as the new chairman of that subcommittee, I hope to carry on Father Drinan's legacy in that regard. 
   Father Drinan's compassion for the disadvantaged did not end with his tenure in Congress. After leaving Congress, Father Drinan continued to advocate for basic 
   rights with his service with the International League of Human Rights, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the International Labor Rights Fund, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. He also spent the last 26 years as a law professor at Georgetown University. 
   I did not have the personal privilege of serving alongside Father Drinan in this Chamber, but I first encountered Father Drinan's commitment to equality during my senior year in college. At that time, Father Drinan was dean of the Boston College Law School, and he went out of his way to open opportunities for minorities at the law school. This motivated me to apply to Boston College Law School, and today, I am a proud graduate of the class of 1973. 
   Mr. Speaker, this evening we pay final tribute to one who dedicated his life to improving the lives of others and making the American Dream accessible to all. A Jesuit priest who, even as a Member of Congress, lived in a small room in the Jesuit community at Georgetown, Father Drinan helped make better the lives of countless millions of Americans of all religious, racial and ethnic backgrounds. Our great Nation will certainly feel the loss of this courageous and compassionate humanitarian. 
   I thank you for yielding to me and thank you for the opportunity to pay tribute to Father Drinan.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, it would be better to consider complicated wiretap laws in the process with committee consideration, public hearings, markups, and consider amendments with more than just 1 minute of discussion, but we have been told that there is an urgent need for clarification in the wiretap law. 
   Now, all of those clarifications are in this bill, especially the foreign-to-foreign communications. This bill honors our Constitution and provides the government all of the flexibility that we were told was needed, but it does not leave the decision of when wiretaps are allowed to the imagination of this Attorney General. 
   The secret FISA court is appropriately involved. It does not restrict the ability of law enforcement to engage in appropriate surveillance, but it does respect our Constitution. We should adopt this very limited clarification in the law.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and appreciate his leadership in efforts to address warrantless surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, and for introducing a bill that corrects many of the shortcomings of the bill that passed the House last August. 
   The RESTORE Act establishes a strong framework, much stronger than the administration's bill, to fight terrorism effectively, while providing reasonable safeguards to protect personal privacy. There are several important clarifications made in the bill. 
   One important change draws the appropriate distinctions based on physical location and types of targets. There has never been any controversy over the fact that surveillance directed at people, all of whom are overseas, you don't need a warrant in that situation. 
   The second is that the bill removes vague and overbroad language in the bill that passed last August that would allow wiretapping of conversations without a warrant if the communication was concerning a foreign target. That by its own wording suggests that if two citizens are in the United States talking about someone overseas, you could wiretap their communications without a warrant. The bill before us makes it clear that the persons involved in the conversation must be overseas, not just that the subject of the conversation must be overseas. 
   Third, the RESTORE Act goes a step further than the administration's bill and only allows expanded wiretapping authority in cases involving foreign intelligence unless it relates specifically to national security, as opposed to the overexpansive nature of foreign intelligence. Foreign intelligence can include anything, a trade deal or anything of general foreign affairs activities. If you are talking about national security, let's talk about national security. 
   Finally, the RESTORE Act was made even stronger in the committee by requiring the Department of Justice in its application to the court to specify the primary purpose of the wiretapping. Under FISA, when an agent wanted to obtain a warrant, he had to certify the purpose of the wiretap. The standard was altered in the PATRIOT Act which says it only has to be a significant purpose. 
   We have to put this change in context because the Department of Justice has not credibly refuted the allegations that some U.S. Attorneys were fired because they failed to indict Democrats in time to affect an upcoming election. So if the Department of Justice wiretapped someone when foreign intelligence is not the primary purpose, you have to wonder what the primary purpose is. This bill would require the administration to reveal the true purpose of the wiretap. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the fight against terrorism, we do not have to sacrifice constitutional protections or trust this administration to secretly protect the rights of Americans without public accountability. It is important to note that everything that the administration can do in its own bill it can do under this bill. We just require them to get a warrant before they do it or get a warrant after they do it if they are in a hurry, but they can wiretap and get the information. We just provide a little modicum of oversight to ensure that the laws are being obeyed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007. Human trafficking for exploitive labor, sex or other exploitive reasons, is equivalent to modern-day slavery in many instances and requires a concerted effort among the nations of the world not only to control it, but eventually to end it. I am pleased that the United States is leading an effort to root out this dreadful form of misery and suffering, and I am proud to be part of that effort. 
   Of course, we need to make sure that we do what we can to stop and prevent it here in the United States. In this regard, I am particularly pleased with the provisions in the bill which strengthen the ability of the Department of Justice to deal with abusive commercial sex traffickers who have been able to victimize women and children with relative impunity because of the difficulty of getting victims to testify as to force, fraud or coercive tactics or to show that they were trafficked across State lines. 
   The bill also strengthens the ability of the Department of Justice to address domestic sex trafficking by transferring the responsibility of the prosecuting domestic sex trafficking cases from the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice to the Criminal Division, both when it is commercial sex trafficking, where force, fraud and coercion can be proved, and when it is trafficking where force, fraud and coercion cannot be proved. The Civil Rights Division continues to have jurisdiction in cases where slavery is involved, but the existence of force, fraud or coercion in commercial sex trafficking cases in and of itself does not constitute the conditions of slavery which the Civil Rights Division prosecutes as a civil rights violation. 
   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H. Res. 264 is a bipartisan resolution designed to honor correctional officers and employees by acknowledging and supporting the goals and ideals of National Correctional Officers and Employees Week. This was introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Holden), the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Ellsworth). 
   The resolution directly honors correctional workers at all levels, local, State and Federal, including psychologists, chaplains, teachers and even kitchen staff. 
   Correctional officers and employees play a vital role in protecting and promoting public safety. They work in our county jails, our State prisons and our Federal penitentiaries. They have a tough job in a tough environment and at a time that Congress and State legislatures are actually making the job more difficult because we have been eliminating programs for inmates, such as parole, good conduct credits and Pell Grants for college courses, programs that give incentives to prisoners to behave. Now, with the additional reduction in prison inmate jobs on the Federal level, even more pressure will be put on correctional officers to maintain a safe and productive environment for prisoners. 
   So it is fitting, Mr. Speaker, that we pause at this time to recognize and commend our correctional officers and employees for the very important job that they do for us every day under these very difficult circumstances, and to them we say, ``Thank you.'' 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to indicate that I have received a note from the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Holden), the lead sponsor of the resolution and chair of the Congressional Correctional Officers Caucus. First, he asked that I share his regrets that he was not able to be with us today to speak on this resolution due to a prior commitment in his home district. He also asked that I convey his strong support for the men and women who work in our prisons and correctional facilities on a daily basis. And he also asked me to personally welcome on his behalf the correctional community to Washington, D.C., for their annual day on Capitol Hill, which is scheduled to occur this coming Wednesday. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I oppose H.R. 6304. It allows widespread acquisition of private conversations without meaningful court review. The bill actually permits the government to perform mass untargeted surveillance of any and all conversations believed to be coming into and out of the United States without any individualized finding and without a requirement that wrongdoing is believed to be involved at all. 
   It arguably is not limited just to terrorism. It could be any foreign intelligence, which would include diplomacy and anything else. It is vague on what can be done with the information after it is acquired and who has access to it, and the only court review is a check on whether or not the government certifies that the process has been followed. The court does not review who, what and where the tapping will take place. 
   Furthermore, the collection of all of this data can be done under emergency provisions before the court acts, but the collection can continue to be done even if the court later rejects the application if the administration appeals. 
   The bill also provides retroactive immunity to communications companies who may have violated people's rights, and whether or not those rights have been violated should be reviewed by the courts, not decided here in Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, we can protect Americans' national security and protect civil rights by providing government access to personal conversations with meaningful court review. This bill fails to do that, and therefore should be defeated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, the gentlemen on the other side are right, we have charts. Because you can see what is going on with a chart. 
   We have been lectured by those who have created these red lines. The Democratic plan is the blue line, and this is what has happened in the last 6 years: the red line. 
   We are being lectured by people who have put us in the ditch. In fact, the Republican policies turned a $5.5 trillion surplus into approximately a $3 trillion deficit, deterioration of the budget of about $8.5 trillion. 
   Now, the $500 billion we have spent on the war is about 0.5; $8.5 trillion deterioration, 0.5 on the war. 
   Now, they say we have stimulated the economy. This is the change in the Dow Jones Industrial Average: Reagan's first term; Reagan's second term; Bush I's term; Clinton; Clinton, 4 years. In 6 years, the Dow has not increased as much as it had in each of the previous 4 years back through the Reagan administration. So there has been no economic growth. 
   They brag about job growth. Add them up: Tied for last place since Herbert Hoover. 
   Now, they keep talking about this 2003 tax cut. You ought to talk about the 2001 tax cut, add up all the jobs through the tax policy: worst since Herbert Hoover. 
   We can do better than that. We don't want to be lectured by those who put us in the ditch. We need to make sure that we have good economic growth, good tax policy, balance the budget, and go forward.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We have been lectured. And sometimes you just have to be reminded about what's been happening to the deficit. We have been lectured by the people who created this chart. You don't create charts like this by accident. Those that created this chart are the ones that are lecturing us on what to do. Just look at the chart. 
   Now, one way to improve this mess is to improve the economy. Some economic policies help the economy, some don't. We know that creating jobs is extremely important.     
   If you look all the way back to Herbert Hoover, the job growth under this administration is tied for last since Herbert Hoover. We know that the job growth during this administration in fact isn't even as good after two major budget-busting tax cuts, isn't even as large as the Congressional Budget Office suggested it would be if we had done nothing. They had a projected job growth if we do nothing. They cut the taxes, and we actually didn't even do as well as that. So, the worst job performance since Herbert Hoover. 
   And what has it done to the stock market? Every 4 years, since the first Reagan administration, the first 4 years of Reagan, the second 4 years, the first 4 years of the first Bush administration, Clinton, the aggregate 4 years change in the Dow, worst since before 1980. That is what is the result of the economic policy.  
   Now, we know that we can grow the economy if we reduce the deficit, reduce the vulnerability to foreign countries. Three-fourths of our net debt has been financed by foreign investments, China, Japan, Saudi Arabia being three of the largest. You can't negotiate trade deals if you are borrowing money from somebody. You can't negotiate oil prices if you are borrowing money. 
   We can also grow the economy with investments in education, job training, and science. The Democratic budget does it. You can help with health care, with help in productivity. You can invest in agricultural, rural communities, and transportation. Our budget does that. And we can grow the economy with fiscal responsibility, and the Democratic budget will help dig us out of the ditch that was formed by the Republican policy starting in 2001. 
   There will be a number of budgets introduced. I will be introducing the Congressional Black Caucus budget that I frankly think does even a better job and makes tougher decisions. But this budget will dig us out of the ditch because it will make those important investments in the economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the vote to override the President's veto of H.R. 976, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. While the bill vetoed by President Bush was a watered down version of the bill passed by the House, it was at least a step in the right direction. 
   The SCHIP bill that Congress sent to the President was a bipartisan effort that renews and improves the Children's Health Insurance program, providing health care coverage for 10 million children. This bill preserves coverage for the 6 million children currently covered by SCHIP and expands coverage to nearly 4 million more uninsured children. 
   Madam Speaker, two-thirds of Americas' uninsured children are currently eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid but are not enrolled for various reasons. This bill gives states the resources and incentives to enroll, those children. 
   The President's budget proposal would have increased SCHIP by $5 billion over the next 5 years. This increase fails to cover the costs of simply maintaining the current SCHIP enrollment of 6 million children. In fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office, over the next 5 years, the President's budget would result in over 1 million children losing their SCHIP coverage. 
   Madam Speaker, the SCHIP reauthorization is supposed to be a bill to expand coverage, not reduce it. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007. I would like to thank Chairman GEORGE MILLER, Ranking Member MCKEON, Chairman HINOJOSA, and Ranking Member KELLER for their work on this bill, which goes a long way toward making higher education attainable for all. 
   The College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007 contains several helpful provisions for students. First, the bill increases the authorized maximum Pell Grant award from  $5,800 to $9,000. In addition, the bill further decreases student interest rates. The bill also includes a feasibility study on giving students more flexibility in refinancing their loans by making student loans more like home mortgages, in which borrowers can switch back and forth from variable rates to fixed rates as the market's conditions change. 
   H.R. 4137 increases support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions. 
   This bill also helps schools affected by a disaster. An Education Disaster and Emergency Relief Loan Program is created to provide emergency loan funds to schools after a Federal declared major disaster or emergency, including those schools affected by the 2005 Gulf Hurricanes. Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary to create a disaster relief plan for schools and LEAs adversely affected by disasters. 
   The College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007 also addresses several additional critical issues. The bill provides loan forgiveness for areas of national need, including early childhood educators, child welfare workers, school counselors, and mental health professionals. In addition, the bill creates a grant program, to help nonprofit organizations, in collaboration with higher education institutions and their students, that seek to promote cultural diversity in the entertainment media industry. Finally, the bill creates a new competitive grant program to strengthen and develop college-level programs in the rapidly growing field of modeling and simulation. 
   I am pleased that the bill also includes a study to be performed by GAO on whether any race, ethnicity, or gender biases are present in the design of standardized tests used for admission to institutions of higher learning. This language should enable GAO to acquire data from the testing companies because of the link between the tests and the federal money that the schools receive who use these admissions tests. 
   H.R. 4137 also seeks to make campuses more safe by creating a National Center for Campus Public Safety to train campus public safety agencies, encourage research to strengthen college safety and security, and serve as a clearinghouse for the dissemination of relevant campus public safety information. The bill also requires the Department of Education to conform hate crime reporting requirements to FBI guidelines to more accurately report incidents of hate crimes on our campuses. 
   Finally, the bill includes several positive changes to the TRIO programs, which provide assistance to low-income and first generation college-going students. The bill eliminates unreasonable evaluation requirements imposed on Upward Bound programs by the Department of Education without requiring a recompetition. In addition, the bill creates an appeals process for TRIO programs to ensure that the grantmaking process is fair and equitable. 
   One item not addressed in H.R. 4137 is the provision under current law that prohibits students who are convicted of certain drug offenses from receiving federal student financial aid. This provision unfairly targets poor and minority students, increases long-term costs to society, creates double jeopardy for students who have already paid their debt to society, and lacks evidence of effectiveness. For these reasons and others, I hope that we can address this critical access issue as this bill moves through the legislative process. 
   For the foregoing reasons, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, this amendment is a significant step forward in prevention and intervention efforts to reduce juvenile and gang crime. For far too long, the Congress has focused its crime policy on waiting for crimes to occur before anything is done. This has contributed to what the experts at the Children's Defense Fund call the ``cradle to prison pipeline.'' 
   Since 1970, the number of individuals incarcerated in the United States has risen from over 300,000 to over 2 million. Initiatives such as this, along with initiatives such as the Youth Promise Act, will create investments in strategies that deal with the root cause of crime, resulting in greater crime reduction and a cost savings to taxpayers. We must begin making meaningful investments in our Nation's youth, and this amendment is a strong step in that direction. 
   I thank Representatives Hastings and S&#225;nchez for their leadership and encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act. I would like to thank Chairman GEORGE MILLER, Ranking Member MCKEON, Chairwoman MCCARTHY, and Ranking Member PLATTS for their work on this bill. 
   H.R. 2857 reauthorizes the national service programs for the first time in over 10 years and contains many positive changes and updates for these programs. During committee consideration of the bill, I added language to make many of these programs more accessible for court-involved youth and adults, including individuals who have previously been incarcerated. I believe that getting these individuals involved in service could be a positive first step to reintegrating these individuals into their communities and giving them an avenue to begin positively participating in society. 
   Although I support this bill, I remained concerned about one provision, which requires the recompetition of grants under the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, RSVP. During committee consideration of this bill, Congressman HARE and I submitted an amendment that would have given existing RSVP grantees in good standing priority consideration for future grants. Since that time, we have worked with the committee to improve the provision that is in the bill, including giving existing programs technical assistance and additional time to prepare for recompetition. I appreciate this work towards a more fair system. 
   However, I believe that existing programs in good standing should be given a stronger priority in the recompetition process, whether that is by only recompeting under-performing programs such as in the Head Start program or by utilizing a prior experience point system such as in the TRIO programs. Through serving their communities for many years and in some cases decades, these existing programs have established strong ties in their communities on which many seniors rely and from which many others benefit. I remain concerned that the language in the base bill will create a recompetition process that will essentially become a grant-writing competition without consideration for current RSVP programs' experience and effectiveness. 
   Although I remain concerned about the recompetition process for RSVP programs, I intend to support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it as well.

   The measure, on its face, is quite simple and straightforward. It simply extends funding for the Drug Endangered Children Grant Program through fiscal year 2009. The current authorization for the program is set to expire this year. 
   The Drug Endangered program was first authorized as title VII of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, which authorizes up to $20 million a year for grants to address this problem. 
   One of the most troubling aspects of drug use is its impact on children. According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, over 15,000 children were found at methamphetamine labs from 2000 to 2004. The problem, however, is not limited to meth abuse. A Health and Human Services study found that over 1.6 million children live in homes where a variety of illicit drugs are used. These drug-infested conditions stretch child welfare agencies beyond their capacities because of the increased violence and neglect. 
   On February 6, the Crime Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 545, the Native American Methamphetamine Enforcement and Treatment Act of 2007, which has been reported by both the Crime Subcommittee and the full Judiciary Committee. A central provision of that bill extends eligibility for drug-endangered children grants to Native American tribes. However, unless the Congress passes H.R. 1199, the authorization for the drug-endangered children grants will expire this year, negating our recent efforts to help Native American children. 
   With this said, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING A VOICE FOR VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES INVOLVED IN MISSING PERSONS AND UNIDENTIFIED HUMAN REMAINS CASES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>

   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of House Resolution 340 to express the commitment of the House of Representatives in giving victims involved in missing persons and unidentified human remains cases a voice through advancing DNA technology. 
   The grief of loss of a loved one, particularly a parent's loss of a child, can only be surpassed by the endless torment of not knowing. When a loved one is missing, there is no finality, no way to begin the grieving process so that closure may eventually come and family and friends can begin healing. Going on, often hoping against hope, knowing the news they fear the most may come at any moment is a tormenting experience. 
   But with today's DNA technology, much of this burden can be removed. Over 6,000 samples of DNA evidence have been used to identify remains of missing persons; and with continued and increased funding, we can bring more justice to victims and peace to the families and friends. 
   Mr. Speaker, I further support the continued funding of DNA initiatives because of the incredible part DNA evidence has played both in determining guilt and protecting the innocent. Since 2002, over 200 wrongly convicted persons have been exonerated through DNA evidence, including death row inmates. In fact, just this weekend two incredible stories arose in the Baltimore area. On Saturday, September 22, prosecutors dropped all charges against a Baltimore man who had been held in a rape and assault of a 59-year-old woman just last month. This morning the Baltimore Sun newspaper reports that Baltimore County has solved their 18th DNA-evidence case, a rape investigation open since 1978. After 29 years, a victim will finally see justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can and must continue to fund advancing DNA technology because, although there has been much success, there remains much to do. Over 40,000 samples of biological evidence related to missing persons are in laboratories around the country ready for entry into DNA databases with the potential of identifying almost 40 percent of our missing persons. And although DNA backlog reduction grants have cleared more than 60,000 criminal cases, exonerating the innocent and identifying the guilty, the backlog level remains almost unchanged. Police departments and prosecutors recognizing the benefits of DNA evidence have been trained in its collection and are using the technology more than ever before, which adds samples at the rate that the backlog is being cleared. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support continued DNA-evidence backlog reduction grants in identifying missing persons and to exonerate the innocent and to identify the guilty. We have seen what the technology can do, and we have the wherewithal to fund those activities. Justice demands that we view continued funding as a major responsibility. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
