<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (NEW ENGLAND NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Grijalva, and thank you also to Chairman Rahall and my good friend Mr. Olver from Massachusetts for their hard work and diligence in bringing this bill to the House floor. The process by which it comes to us started long before I arrived here. 
   Mr. Chairman, in this digital age, our computers, our cell phones, our BlackBerrys, our PDAs, they have all collapsed vast distances that for so long have defined our lives. Continents can now be bridged in seconds with just the touch of a button, and the miles of fiber optic cable running beneath our feet and the satellites orbiting miles above our heads have helped make our modern world seem much smaller and much more compact. The idea of sending a physical letter through the mail now seems charmingly outdated in an age where communication is measured at the speed of light. 
   But in our wholesale embrace of this breathtaking new age of technology, we sometimes have lost sight of the enduring power of the natural world. Back in the outdoors, one is once again reminded of the sheer immensity and the beauty of the world around us. Getting away from our cars, getting away from our desks and laptops, thousands of New England residents every day take to the parks, to the trails, and to our reserves to reconnect with the natural world that thrives quietly all around us. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1528, the New England Scenic Trail Designation Act, because it will give thousands of more Americans, many of whom reside in the Fifth District of Connecticut, access to one of the most beautiful natural resources throughout the Northeast. 
   The Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett Trail, or the MMM Trail, runs some 220 miles from the southern border of New Hampshire all the way down to the Long Island Sound, from Royalston, Massachusetts, to Guilford, Connecticut, cutting across the Farmington Valley towns and the towns of New Britain and Meriden in the Fifth Congressional District of Connecticut. 
   Now, this isn't some secluded, inaccessible trail. This gem runs right through the heart of some of this district's most populous areas. More than 2 million people live within 10 miles of the MMM Trail, making it uniquely accessible as a recreational opportunity for hikers, for joggers, for picnickers, and for everyone who loves the outdoors. 
   With this bill's passage, the MMM Trail will become only the ninth scenic trail designated in the 40-year history of the national trail system, joining the likes of the Appalachian Trail and the Continental Divide Trail throughout the country as these national scenic recognized trails. 
   Until now, the MMM Trail has been maintained through the generosity of private donors, through natural preservation groups and landowners who have allowed people to pass through the trail of their own accord. With Federal recognition, the trail will have access to grants and to resources that will help with its maintenance, with its preservation, and with public awareness. 
   The hundreds of thousands of Connecticut and Massachusetts residents who have enjoyed the MMM Trail over the past half century will be joined by scores of new visitors coming to enjoy its breathtaking vistas, its distinctive flora and fauna, and its rich history. And those who have enjoyed the MMM Trail in the past will now be assured that the trail will be protected for future generations, while ensuring that the trail is actively maintained and cared for for all. 
   Perhaps the most important backers of this trail are the thousands of nature lovers who have hiked and enjoyed the MMM Trail for decades. Just today,  Adam Moore, the director of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, wrote me. He said: ``It's thrilling to me to think that this beautiful trail that I once hiked with my father could now become a scenic trail. I recall dangling my legs off the rocks of Mt. Pisgah in Durham while my father pointed out the gold building in Hartford some miles away gleaming in the distance. It is so inspiring to think that this trail in my home community could merit national status and recognition and that people will be able to enjoy it for years to come.''

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule. 
   Like many of my colleagues who we have heard from today, my family was built on good working class union jobs. My grandfather and great-grandfather worked at Fafnir Ball Bearing in New Britain, Connecticut, and I am, in some sense, the product of that American dream, a dream in which my grandfather's daughter could be the first woman in her family to go to college, a dream in which his grandson could be standing here on the floor of the House of Representatives, fighting for what is right and what is fair in the workplace. 
   But, Madam Speaker, this disappearing middle-class has no lobby here in Washington, DC. They are not organized as a special interest. And maybe because of this, their interests haven't been very well represented on this floor in the past several years. But things are changing. 
   Workers who belong to unions on average earn 30 percent more than nonunion workers. They are 63 percent more likely to have health care. They are four times more likely to have pension benefits. But unfortunately, over the years, the rights of these workers to join unions and to bargain collectively with their employers have eroded because of anti-union campaigns, employee intimidation and ineffective penalties for employers who violate worker rights. 
   Today, we are making standing up for what is right in the workplace a little easier, Madam Speaker. This isn't about making doing business more difficult; this is about strengthening the society in which families like mine were allowed to succeed.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Mr. Ryan. 
   I think what happened here over the last 12 years, and I was watching it all from the outside, is that the Republicans, for a very long time, vastly overestimated the gullibility of the American people. They thought they could stand up here and say over and over again that the Republicans are being fiscally responsible, and that the American people wouldn't notice that they were racking up record amounts of debt, $3 trillion, up to $9 trillion now is the amount of Federal debt that this government has racked up. The fact that they wouldn't notice that every single dime for this war in Iraq and Afghanistan has been borrowed money. I think you give them too much credit, Mr. Ryan. You said they were spending like a bunch of drunken sailors. Well, drunken sailors spend their own money at least, they probably don't spend it very wisely, but their own money. These are like a bunch of thieving drunken sailors. They were spending other people's money, my money, my parents' money, my neighbor's money, all the while kind of pretending that we weren't ever going to have to pay it back. 
   So what we've seen here tonight and what we've seen over the last few days is a Republican minority now that continues to vastly overestimate the gullibility of the American people. They think they can stand here, try to make disappear everything that happened over the last 12 years, and that once again they can stand here and talk about being fiscally responsible, while the very mess that we're here cleaning up is all theirs in the making.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Now, Mr. Speaker, here is what we are doing. You mentioned that we have a balanced budget, in 5 years we are going to balance this budget. But on top of that, we are starting to fix some of the biggest messes they left this Democratic Congress. 
   Take for example the Alternative Minimum Tax. Now, not a lot of people know what this thing is. You know it if you are paying it, and you are going to start paying it year after year. More people will start paying more and more. This is the biggest middle-class tax increase potentially in the history of this country, imposed by a Republican Congress. And, guess what? We are going to fix it. We are going to take it on. 
   For the first time, legislation that comes before this House actually has to be paid for as we go along; the pay-as-you-go rule. Every spending increase that this Congress proposed has to be accompanied by either a revenue offset or a spending offset. That's real fiscal responsibility; rules passed by the Democratic majority here that are going to finally impose some fiscal discipline on this place. 
   So the Republicans and the minority can say over and over again whatever they want. They can hope that if they say it often enough that they will believe it and maybe a few people out there will believe it. 
   But what is going to happen here over the next few months is results, Mr. Ryan. It is going to be rhetoric matched with results: Fixing the AMT, balancing the Federal budget over 5 years, making sure that every bill that  comes before this House is paid for as we go along, record increases for veterans programs, for education programs, for the things that people want to have funded in their communities. 
   There are finally going to be some words that are matched with actions here. As much as the other side of the aisle may try to make this disappear, they are going to find an American people that isn't as gullible as they used to think they were.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what happened in my district, because it happened in 40 other districts around the country last fall. 
   All the people who are fiscal conservatives, people who were concerned about fiscal responsibility frankly probably voted Republican for a long time because they did believe that the words were backed up by the actions, finally saw through all that rhetoric. And all those true fiscal conservatives came out and voted Democrat. 
   My district hadn't been Democrat for 24 years. And, guess what? It wasn't just the social progressives and the anti-war activists who came out and said we want change. It was the fiscal conservatives, the people who were concerned about the absolute and utter incompetency in this Government that came out and decided to change this place. 
   And, guess what? They are seeing results here. They are seeing results because what they did was they saw a party that over the years started out as a collection of ideas that ended up just being a collection of special interests. 
   Mr. Speaker, the words they used were still the same. Their allegiances changed over time. Their allegiances didn't happen to sit with the ideas that they held. Their allegiances sat with the lobbyists and the special interests and the folks that they were protecting  every single day on this House floor. Those voters who came out and voted Democrat based on fiscally sound and fiscally responsible principles last year are going to do the same thing 2 years from now because they are going to see that balanced budget. They are going to see the Alternative Minimum Tax. They are going to see the pay-as-you-go rules. Those are all results. Those are going to be voters that will be sticking with the Democratic Party.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Ryan, one of the most perplexing bars on that graph is the amount of money that we have borrowed from OPEC nations. You want to talk about why we can't stand across the table from the countries that are pillaging American consumers with these ridiculously, monstrously high gas prices? 
   Guess what? We can't sit across and be an honest broker from them because they hold the mortgage to this country. The same can be said of the Chinese and the same can be said of European nations. We have lost so much of our ability to sit and be an honest broker in negotiations over energy policy and foreign policy, because they own our currency. They hold all of our debt. 
   So beyond how terrible this is for the American taxpayers, it is also terrible for the American foreign relations. It has to stop.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Even when they did spend money, they spent it in such a ludicrous way as to waste the taxpayers' money on essential programs like the prescription drug benefit. Even when they chose to roll out a brand new and expensive new domestic program, they overspent to the tune of potentially $50 billion a year by cutting a deal with the drug companies so as to prohibit the Federal Government from using its bulk purchasing power.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I think it was a pretty simple formula. It was that we were going to squeeze and squeeze the people who have the least in this society, and that is the hospitals that care for the sick and the uninsured, it is the families that have the courage to send their loved ones off to war, it is middle-class families who can't afford to pay another dime. Those are the people that are going to get soaked in order to fund these giant tax cuts for the people.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I am not a hater. As a new Member, I am loving every minute of this, Mr. Ryan. 
   Listen to me: From every standpoint it makes sense. You talk about the jobs that an investment in alternative energy is going to bring. Undoubtedly it is going to make our air cleaner. It is going to reduce our contribution to global warming. We know in the long run it is going to bring prices down. It is going to be the thing that finally breaks our dependence on the high prices of foreign oil. 
   Also it is about national security. It is about finally breaking us free of dependency on the countries that produce that oil, that compromise a lot of our conversations in places in the world like the Middle East, compromised additionally by the amount of debt those OPEC nations hold. So, it is kind of a win-win-win-win-win-win scenario. 
   So the question is why didn't it happen? Well, it didn't happen because the agenda here wasn't about the economy. The agenda wasn't about cleaning up the air. The agenda wasn't about lowering gas prices. The agenda was about helping a bunch of people in the oil industry. 
   This is what happens when you break this place free of special interests. Good policy starts to happen. You get wins for everybody when you start making this about Main Street, right, instead of about the few people that get in the room and write the legislation based on how much money they have given to campaigns and how much influence they have inside the Beltway.

But you don't have to work that hard to hear what the values of the American people are. I mean, you don't have to be everywhere at all times in your district to understand that when people were crying out for energy reform, energy reform wasn't giving more tax giveaways to big oil.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. All I mean by that is it makes it even more inexcusable that all you had to do was go out and listen a little bit to hear the cries from people. 
   There are these sort of ``are you kidding me'' moments that happen out there. They happened in my district, when people are asking, listen, do something about energy policy. And the ``do something'' was let's just empower the oil companies even more. 
   People are crying out for change in our policy towards Iraq, and the answer was we are going to commit ourselves to even more troops and even more money and an even greater failed policy. 
   People stand there and say, are you kidding me? Did you hear anything I said? And for 12 years, the answer increasingly was no. We didn't hear anything you said. We didn't try, and in fact our ears were attuned to a very different set of people. 
   So now, this revolution that happened here isn't terribly revolutionary. We are finally starting to listen to people again, and that means investing in alternative energy, that means setting a new course in Iraq, that means making it easier for kids to go to college. 
   These aren't new ideas. These are ideas that people have been talking about in bars and in diners and pancake breakfasts and pasta dinners for years.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. One of the miracles of what is happening here, we are starting to change those priorities without spending more money in order to do that. You can tack onto your list of help to kids and families the fact that we passed legislation that could bring on average $4,000 in relief to students by lowering the interest rate on student loans. That is $4,000 back in the pocket of a young man or woman graduating from college, that is going to be looking to pile on a mortgage on top of their debt. And we did it at no additional expense to the taxpayers. We changed in a small way the amount of money that we guarantee to banks, and the banks are doing pretty well out there already, and we got $4,000 back in the pockets of American students and graduates without costing anybody else a dime. Same thing on the energy policy.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. When the other 98 percent get their government back, I would be angry myself if all of a sudden my day was over. 
   But let's not overstate the partisan differences here because when we have  put on the House floor good legislation for the American people, that student loan cut that we talked about, investment in alternative energy, stem cell research, when we put that before the House a lot of Republicans came over and supported it. 
   So there is a group of leadership, that is frankly the ones that come down the House floor and do most of talking, but there are a bunch of Republicans when Democrats finally put an agenda that is sticking up for regular people, they are going to support us on that. The newspapers and the TV talk shows are filled with the Republican leadership who, frankly, it seems to me, after 6 months on the job, don't speak for a lot of people on that side of the aisle. 
   I think what we are doing here over time is when you get past a lot of the rhetoric, a lot of the votes end up being pretty bipartisan because when you get beyond the leadership, you have Republicans who are appreciative of the fact that Democrats have finally returned this place to the American people.

Mr. Speaker, for all those people out there who came out to the polls and voted on national security or fiscal responsibility or competence in government, no matter what you hear late at night here or on the talk radio shows from the Republicans, pay attention to what happens here in the House of Representatives over the coming weeks and months. 
   Pay attention to the Democratic majority's plan to balance this budget, to pass on tax relief to people that need it, to start restoring order in this world so we are fighting the right fight at the right time. Pay attention to what happens here.     
   As we have said over and over again, for the first time in over a decade, words are going to be matched with actions. From one side of this Chamber, from the Republican side, you're going to see words. From the Democratic side, you're going to see words and action to follow. As a new Member of the 30-somethings and as a new Member of this Congress, that's what makes me proud to be here, is that we're saying the right things and then we're doing the right things behind it. All those people who came out and cast their votes based on those ideas are going to find those ideas put into action here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, first I would like to thank Chairman Visclosky for all his hard work on this bill. 
   As a former appropriator in the Connecticut General Assembly, I know how hard this job is, and I am honored to stand next to him today. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment at the desk will bar the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, from using funds to issue permits for projects that have not been the subject of a local public hearing. 
   This amendment is based on a simple premise. Public policymakers cannot and should not act without the input of citizens who will be affected by the decisions that they make. As legislators, we know that we can't sample public opinion by just sitting here in Washington. We need to go back to our districts and solicit opinion, whether it be in public forums, town fairs, or even at the supermarket or the post office. 
   A regulatory agency should be held to the same standard. This amendment does nothing to alter or constrain the final decisionmaking authority of FERC. It just assures that the commission hears all sides before making any determination on land-use issues. 
   Though this amendment would help many communities where FERC has refused to hold a public hearing in an affected locality, and I know Mr. Arcuri from New York, who may not be able to join us, holds this concern as well, I come to this issue with my concern through my constituents who live surrounding the Candlewood Lake area in Connecticut, the largest inland body of water in the State. 
   My constituents there have been unable to secure a public hearing from FERC to air their concerns regarding a shoreline management plan proposed by the utility that owns the lake. This shoreline management plan will change how they enjoy the land surrounding their homes and the price they will pay for the privilege of living on the lake. 
   Local feelings on the appropriateness of the plan are mixed. However, whatever residents may think, what is clear is that they should have the opportunity to directly make their case to FERC. FERC has continued to deny requests, both from my office and from constituents to hold a local hearing, and this is unacceptable, I think, to every Member of Congress. 
   I understand the Appropriations Committee, as well as the Energy and Commerce Committee, may like some more time to look into this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, if the chairman of the subcommittee would be willing to work with me on this issue, I would be honored to yield to him at this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to allow myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for his hard work, not only on the underlying bill, but in his gracious work with me and the Massachusetts and Connecticut delegations to allow us to bring this amendment before the House today. 
   I rise in strong support of the amendment before us. By supporting the implementation of commuter rail service, as this amendment will assist us between New Haven, Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts, we can help strengthen and expand one of my State's most vital transportation corridors. 
   While Metro North and Shoreline East rail lines provide extensive commuter service across Connecticut's southern coastal region, there is little available service to meet the needs throughout the central portion of the State. Connecticut's existing commuter rail lines have already seen over 5 percent increase in ridership just in the first quarter of 2008, and there's a clear need to expand it throughout the other sectors. 
   Not only would such rail service help alleviate roadway congestion, save consumers money on gas, and help combat global warming, it would contribute to the economic revitalization of this route. In my district, the city of Meriden is prepared to build a state-of-the-art intermodal transportation hub to take advantage of this new rail line. 
   At a time when gas prices are squeezing American's budgets like never before, we need to invest in this type of commuter rail service that is available right now on the line that runs between New Haven and Springfield. 
   We need sensible mass transit solutions, and by expressing strong congressional support for this new proposed rail line, taking advantage of an existing Amtrak line, and by directing Amtrak, as this amendment does, to report on the lines' uncompleted infrastructure maintenance, information that is badly needed in order to make plans going forward to add local commuter service to that line, we are sending a clear signal that the time for action is now. 
   Again, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and I would urge support for this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

We have the unique opportunity to take an existing line, have either a partnership or a transfer of the line to the State Department of Transportation, and with that we believe we will be able to greatly expand our opportunities for mass transit development in the State of Connecticut.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for giving us the indulgence of once again allowing the Speaker's 30-Something Working Group to come down to the House floor. We are hopeful tonight that we're going to have a full House here on the House floor, that we will be joined tonight by our master of ceremonies, on most nights Representative Meek and his original partner in crime, Mr. Ryan, as well as Ms. Wasserman Schultz, and Mr. Altmire. 
   It's appropriate that we're going to have hopefully four or five of us here by the time the hour is up because we have a lot to talk about. Because as our Republican colleagues have noted  over the last hour, the one thing that they are probably right on the mark about is that people are hurting out there. People have a level of anger and anxiety over what is happening in this economy that many of us haven't seen in a very, very long time. 
   I don't know technically whether we're in a recession, whether we're on our way into one. All I know is that people are having to do more with much less; that that salary increase that people thought they were getting isn't happening; that those overtime hours that my constituents in New Britain relied upon aren't there this year. And yet on the other side of their family's ledger, the prices to heat their home are going up, obviously the prices to fuel their car are going up, the college expenses, the health care expenses are going in only one direction and by and large far outpacing the rate of wage inflation that they're seeing as well.     
   And the New Direction Congress is trying to do something about it. There's no secret as to why we've gotten into this situation that we're in today, why our people are making money at the very upper echelon of the income scale, why do we have GDP continuing to expand, while we have wages remaining relatively stagnant. 
   It's because for a very long time on the floor of this House of Representatives before the New Direction Congress was installed last January, the voices that really mattered down here were the folks that were doing pretty well off in this economy: the drug industry, the health insurers, and at the top of the list, the oil industry. 
   The dichotomy right now that exists today between the success of the oil industry and the distress of the people who buy their product is absolutely unconscionable. And it is hard for us to understand, with our slim majority that we hold on the Democratic side, why we can't get more consensus here between Republicans and Democrats to take on those gross and unjustifiable profits that are being made by the oil industry. 
   Last quarter's profits from American and multinational oil companies set records, not for the history of the American oil industry, but for the history of American capitalism, and it's no secret where they're making those profits. They're making it off of all of us. 
   Now, we heard a couple of days ago that the average price across this country hit $4 a gallon. Well, that was old news to us in Connecticut. We hit $4 weeks, if not a month, ago. We are well on our way in Connecticut to $5 a gallon, and in Connecticut it hurts us a little bit more because we have more congested highways. We don't have mass transit alternatives like other parts of the country. People are driving. 
   In my district, we still have some jobs growing in Danbury, Connecticut, but nobody can live there because we don't have enough affordable housing. So people live in Waterbury, Connecticut, and they drive 30 miles to work every day. They'd live in Danbury if they could. They can't afford to do it. They'd live in Stamford if they could, but they can't. They live where they have to. They work where they have to. And it necessitates a commute which puts them out now record amounts, all the while, while the oil industry are making profits, they are setting records in the history of American capitalism. 
   So, to us, it seems pretty obvious where we should lay the blame, on an oil industry which has continued to take profits out of American consumers and at the feet of an administration run by two oil men. I mean, it doesn't get much more simple than that. 
   I mean, I understand people's frustrations. I understand the frustrations of the folks on the Republican side and the Democratic side, but it doesn't take too much imagination to figure out why we got where we got. We elected to the White House a President and a Vice President who made their fortunes in the oil industry, and they have created a legacy that they will leave behind in the White House of doing even more favors for that industry, of setting an energy policy that guarantees massive profits for the friends that they left behind in that industry. 
   And so, to us, the solution seemed pretty simple. The Senate tried just a few days ago to pass a windfall profits tax to suggest that maybe they're making a little bit too much in the oil industry; we should turn a little bit of that back around to hardworking consumers. Couldn't get the votes it needed to without Republican support. 
   Here in the House, we looked at the $18 billion in tax breaks and giveaways that have been given to the oil industry. We watched a recent report come out from GAO, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, about a week ago which told us that we have given away over $50 billion in annual unclaimed royalties that we should be collecting against the oil industry for their drilling across this country and off our shores. And we see an opportunity, we see an opportunity to take those unclaimed royalties that are making the oil industry rich, we see an opportunity to take those tax breaks, $16- and $18-billion, however you want to estimate it that the 2005 energy bill passed before the New Direction Congress got here and gave to the oil industry, and we see a chance to take that money out of the pockets of the oil industry and turn it around to hardworking consumers, hardworking commuters that need a break right now. 
   It's not like the money isn't out there. It's out there. It's lying in the hands of oil industry and gas industry CEOs and their top executives, their shareholders who are reaping the benefit of the misery that people in this country are witnessing at the pump. Four dollars may be the national number, but in Connecticut that's history. We're on our way to $5. 
   So, to us on the Democratic side, on the majority side, we don't want this to be a partisan issue. I appreciate the comments of our Republican friends who spoke before the 30 Something Working Group here tonight, but this, to us, isn't about Republicans or Democrats, because you're paying $4.50 at the pump in Connecticut whether you're a registered R or you're a registered D. And those oil company executives are making record profits, whether they are a registered Republican or whether they are a registered Democrat. Affiliation ideology does not mean anything here. The stats are the stats and the numbers are the numbers, and it shows us that there are people making a lot of money who don't deserve to make it, and there are people enduring a lot of misery who don't have to. 
   And one of the most respected Members of the other side of the aisle sat at the well just a few moments ago and told us that words are one thing, but votes matter. I don't think that there would be a voice of disagreement in this House. Absolutely, you can go out there and say one thing about how you're trying to take on the oil industry, but what you do here matters. 
   And so I would encourage people out there, my friends in the Fifth District of Connecticut, and all those in other parts of the country that are struggling to understand what's happening with energy prices out there to check the record, to go back and look at what Congress has done and has attempted to do to fix this problem and see where the votes are and where the votes aren't. 
   You see, we've tried to pass legislation to punish price gougers, to give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to press Federal charges against those individuals, retailers and wholesalers, who have tried to take advantage of this situation to unjustifiably run up the price, and we've been alone over here on the Democratic side of the aisle. We've passed legislation to repeal the antitrust exemption that the big, multinational oil companies have so that we can go after folks that are price colluding against American consumers, and we haven't had much cooperation on this side of the aisle. 
   And we have put actions behind words when it comes to conservation. I hope that Representative Wamp is right. I hope that we are on the verge of a new era in transportation technology. I hope that we are going to see electric cars be the predominant force in our automotive world. I hope that we are near that moment, and I think he's also right, frankly, that if we are going to get to that moment we're going to have to be honest about the electricity capacity that we do not have in this country.  
   I hope that we can set, Republicans and Democrats, a strategy to get there, to both encourage the development of electric car technology, of the recharging stations that we will need to make that a robust technology and a commercialized opportunity, an alternative for commuters, and that we will also do the right things in terms of electricity production and grid capacity to make it a realistic option. 
   But until we get there, until we get to a moment where we can plug in our car and go, we have an opportunity today to stand behind an effort to make the cars that we buy right now more fuel efficient. Thirty years went by until this House of Representatives stood up under a Democratic leadership and passed a new law requiring that every car in this country, the average fuel efficiency of a fleet, be 35 miles a gallon. Thirty years went by, 12 years of Republican rule, and not a single bill passed in this Congress to promote conservation with real policy directives behind it. 
   Now, we did get a lot of Republican sponsors on that legislation, the energy bill passed at the end of last year, but we needed more. We needed more, and on that case, votes did matter. On that case, votes did matter. We have had bipartisan cooperation, but led by a new Democratic majority, this House stood up and passed legislation requiring cars in this country to hit 35 miles a gallon, which will save the average consumer $1,000 over the course of the year at the pump. That's real dollars. That's real dollars for the average consumer. In fact, that number was from the end of last year. It's probably much more than $1,000 now that the price at the pump has gone up. 
   And the alternatives that the Republicans offer, as we try to say, listen, the solution here is to make the cars we drive now more fuel efficient, the solution is to go after those that would collude to set prices, those who would take advantage of this moment to price gouge at the pumps, when we sit here and say that we can also look at legislation promoted by Representative Stupak and Representative Larson, legislation being worked on now by the Energy and Commerce Committee to start to regulate the energy commodity trading markets that are skimming millions, if not billions, of dollars off of the product that people are paying for at the pump, we can do something to take money out of the hands of speculators who have done far too well off of the rising price of oil and put that money back in the hands of those hardworking, middle class Americans who are paying the bills for those speculators on Wall Street. 
   We're going to move forward legislation to do that as well. We're going to set a long-term strategy while we're at it because we can do things in the short-term with price colluding, with price gougers. We can take pride in legislation that Mr. Welch and Mr. Courtney and others moved through the House to stop the President from putting more oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and, instead, put that oil on the market. That's another 10, 15, 20 cents on the gallon. We can do all those short-term things necessary to get the price of oil down. 
   We can take a long-term view to try to get to a moment in 5 or 10 years where we're no longer relying on a foreign-produced and foreign-priced product that oil is. We can have that long-term view to have a renewable domestically produced energy source here. 
   We can do all those things, and we can do them together. It's not mutually exclusive to try to take some steps right now, going against the speculators, going against the price gougers, stopping putting oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That's not mutually exclusive from doing the long-term things necessary to wean ourselves off of this product that we do not price, that for the most part we do not produce. 
   The solution, though, is not to just say that we're going to get a little bit more from here in the United States. We have a chart here that maybe we can take a look at with regard to some of the claims of our friends on the other side of the aisle with regard to the great salvation of the American energy crisis which is going to be the drilling for oil in Alaska. 
   We are talking about a project that, first of all, is going to take 20 years to get to peak oil production. It's going to take 10 years, Mr. Speaker, just to get to a point where anything is coming out of the ground. Even in a moment right now, where big oil companies have license to drill right here onshore, on about 42 million acres, 42 million acres that they could take oil from onshore. You know how much that they're taking oil off of right now? Twelve million. There's 30 million acres with permitted potential here domestically that isn't being used today.     
   So this talk of drilling more, these oil companies have the ability to drill for more oil right now, 30 million acres permitted and not drilled for. 
   Let's talk about offshore as well. And I want to talk about what happens in ANWR, in the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge, but let's talk about offshore. Thirty-eight million acres ready to go, permitted for drilling by the big domestic and multinational oil companies. You know how much of that 38 million is being used today? Eight million acres. 30.6--let's be exact here--30.6 million acres of offshore territory permitted for use not being drilled upon today. 
   This effort to take a small parcel of land, admittedly no bigger than Dulles National Airport, and use this crisis moment in American energy history to open up a sensitive wildlife refuge for drilling is nothing more than a power and money grab by an industry that already today, by facts and figures that don't come from me, but come from the industry themselves, suggests that there are 60 million acres of onshore and offshore territory today that are not being drilled upon that could be used right now if they wanted to. Record numbers of new permits being handed out for drilling on available lands and available offshore territory today. 
   It is not that we don't have the capacity for new drilling. We have it, it's ready to go; the oil industry has decided not to use it. The oil industry has decided, for whatever reason--I can't get into their heads to try to figure out exactly what their motivation is, but you can certainly impute a motivation which would suggest that a holdback on supply isn't such a bad thing, that by keeping supply, by holding back on drilling, by keeping that 60 million acres that they could drill on right now tomorrow from going into production, they're going to make some profit off of that. 
   Our focus has to be on how on Earth we have allowed for more tax breaks, for more royalty breaks to an oil industry making record profits in the history of capitalism that sits today on 60 million acres that they're not drilling on. 
   But let's talk about what would happen if we did get beyond that, if we did sort of forgive the fact that they just simply aren't using the territory that's available to them today and we gave them the ability to drill in ANWR. You're not going to be even able to really see this chart. In fact, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, it looks like a blank chart. It's titled, ``How Much Would We Save by Drilling in ANWR?'' And the statistics used to make this chart don't come from congressional Democrats or congressional Republicans, they come from the administration, they come from the administration's own energy agency. 
   And you can't see anything on this chart. It looks blank to you because it is blank. How much would you save by drilling in ANWR? By 2030, Mr. Speaker--I'm going to have my first child this summer, and my child will be on his way to college by the time 2030 rolls around. So by 2030, my child will be driving a car. And in 2030, he's going to have saved 1.8 cents per gallon if we drilled in ANWR. 
   So even if you got over the fact that there are millions of acres out there permitted today, ready to go for exploration today that the oil industry has not used, even if you get over the very legitimate environmental concerns that confront ANWR, you're getting 1.8 cents in savings per gallon in 2030. Why 2030? Because it takes 20 years to get to peak production. It takes 10 years to get one drop out of the ground. 
   And while we sit here and argue over whether we drill in ANWR or not, we're wasting valuable time that could go into making changes today, like the success we had just weeks ago in stopping the deposit of new petroleum into the Strategic Reserve. That's not 1.8  cents per gallon, that is potentially 15 or 20 cents per gallon. Stopping putting oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve isn't 2030, Mr. Speaker, it's today, it's next week--maybe not next week, maybe it's next month, maybe it's next year. It's not 2030, it's immediate. 
   And more to the point, by spending our time this year and next year talking about how we take this country back from this oil industry, how we create sources of energy that are produced here in the United States that we control and we price, we're doing something not just for energy prices, but we're doing something for national security. Because every day that we continue to go on, every day that we fight about what little bit more we can get out of the ground, we're empowering a global energy industry that is a threat to this Nation in the end. 
   Every day that we continue to fill up our gas tanks with a product that sends money overseas to countries that use that money to fuel the educational and recruitment initiatives of those who would do harm to us--because that's what's happening here, we're sending oil overseas, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, to countries that maybe aren't directly using that money to send straight to terrorists, but they're using that money to fund the schools that train the kids that eventually turn into those terrorists. They're using that money to create societies that marginalize individuals in Saudi Arabia and other places so that they have no choice but to flee to those extremist movements. 
   Every day that we sit here and argue over whether we drill in ANWR, whether we drill offshore, whether we give more power to the international oil industry that already is making these record profits in the history of capitalism, we are endangering the safety of this country. 
   I want to do the right short-term and long-term things because I go home every weekend and I feel the hurt, as you do, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, as you do, Mr. Speaker, of all of our constituents that don't deserve to pay $4, $5 at the pump while the oil industry is making record profits. But I also want to make the right decisions now on the future of our energy policy because it's how my future kids and grand kids live in a safe country and in a safe world. 
   And so I'm proud to be part of a ``new direction'' Congress that is finally, for the first time in a decade, taking on this oil industry. I'm proud to be part of a Congress that is both doing things in the short run--even if we don't get Republican votes to do it--and trying to set a long-term strategy. It's a lot to ask. It's a lot to ask, but this is a big moment right now. This is a big moment. Four or five dollar prices at the pumps cannot sustain. Families cannot pay that. And the question is, are we going to allow the oil industry to co-opt this moment, to take advantage of it, to get a little bit bigger piece of the pie in order to make even bigger profits? Or are we going to use this money, the $4 and $5 prices at the pump, to finally stand up to these guys, to finally say enough it enough, and to set a long-term plan to get this country off of this product that we can't control, Ms. Wasserman Schultz? 
   I think I know the answer to that. I think I know where this Congress wants to go. I think I know that the American public are ready to follow. But it frustrates me--you just joined us here--it frustrates me to listen to some of our colleagues standing on the floor and basically asking for the same old, same old that we've seen for the late 8 years, Ms. Wasserman Schultz.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, just to put it in real stark terms here, 2002 to 2008, the oil industry we are talking about here, goes from $6.5 billion in profit, that is pretty good, you are going to take that, that is a good year, to 2008, $36.9 billion in profit. 
   We still haven't figured out why that is. Why is it that the oil industry and the drug industry are two of the most profitable industries in the world? Because they cornered the market, right? You have got to take that drug. You have got nowhere else to go. If that drug keeps you alive and nobody else makes that drug, you have got to buy that drug. If the only thing that gets you from point A to point B is the product that Exxon and Chevron and BP make, then they can charge whatever they want. 
   So we can talk about the margins here. We can talk about producing a little more. But, in the end, the reason why they get to just basically decide whatever they want, they can make $6.5 billion one year and $36.9 billion the next year, it is up to them, because they know whatever they charge, we will pay, because we have no alternative. That minivan mom, that soccer mom, guess what? Nothing else fuels that car right now, except for the products that these guys produce. 
   If I made a really good apple pie and I went out and everybody else that tried to grow some apple trees in their backyard, I whacked them down, I could charge whatever I wanted for that because nobody else could make that pie. That is what the Republicans are basically doing. Everybody else that tries to go out and plant some apple trees in their backyard to give an alternative to the big oil companies, they whack those trees down. Guess what? That apple pie is now about $5 a gallon, Ms. Wasserman Schultz.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. You know, before I was joined by my illustrious colleagues here this evening, one of actually our more helpful colleagues on the other side was talking about words are one thing and actions are another. Words are one thing and votes are something else.  
   Ms. Wasserman Schultz, you are pointing out when this comes down to it, when we had the chance to gather together and link arms and be one as Republicans and Democrats, our friends on the other side of the aisle didn't join us. There have been plenty of opportunities for that to happen, for us, as Mr. Ryan says, to do what our constituents want and put politics aside. 
   As I said at the outset, the pumps don't care if you are a Republican or a Democrat. The pumps don't care if you voted for Chris Murphy or not. They are going to charge you the same thing one way or another. 
   I think Mr. Altmire is right. Maybe they have the best intentions at heart. But it is a pretty simplistic solution to a pretty complex problem: Drill more, drill more. Again, you are just feeding the beast. You are continuing to perpetuate a monopoly on energy that offers no real competition. 
   What you need is not competition between Exxon and Mobil. You need competition between oil and electric, between biodiesel and gasoline. That is what you need competition among. That is how you are going to solve this thing in the end. 
   But so long as the solution to high oil prices is just more oil and nothing else, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Mr. Ryan, you are not getting anywhere.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   Two years ago, as Congresswoman DeGette noted, I was honored to write and pass one of the Nation's first stem cell investment acts, Connecticut's $100 million investment in stem cell research. But I decided to seek a seat in this body because our action in Connecticut was ultimately hamstrung by inaction here in Washington, despite public cries for our Federal Government to invest in stem cell research. We could not, in large part not because of the will of this House but because of the will of the President. 
   What should not be in doubt here today is the promise that this legislation holds. Although new discoveries occur every day, including just yesterday expanding the potential of stem cell research, make no mistake, political lines drawn by this political body about what kind of research will be allowed and will not be allowed will frustrate science and postpone cures. That's why every major medical, science and scientific professional association, as well as major research universities and institutions and affected patient advocacy organizations support the passage of this bill. 
   Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah, who has always been a faithful ally of the pro-life community, said that being pro-life is more than just caring for the unborns. It's about caring for the living as well. I couldn't agree more, when we talk about the sanctity of human life, and we all believe that human life is sacred. 
   We too often neglect the things that we can do to protect and extend the lives of our friends and loved ones who suffer from terminal and debilitating diseases. This bill, perhaps more than anything, is about extending and preserving life. That's a value that we all share. 
   One hundred million Americans are affected by some kind of life-threatening disease. Somewhere in this vast universe, a cure for their disease exists. I know it. We all know it. Let's stop putting up man-made barriers to finding that cure, a cure for our loved ones. 
   I stand in strong support of this bill. I commend Ms. DeGette for her long-awaited advocacy for this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio. As you dig deeper into this budget, Mr. Ryan, what you find is the financial gimmickry involved in the President's claim that this budget will be balanced by 2012 is accomplished by forgetting about this little thing that hides in our Tax Code called the Alternative Minimum Tax. That is a difficult concept for some people to understand, but it is not going to be so difficult for millions of middle-class families to figure out when, next year and the year after that, they are going to be hit for the first time with a massive new tax increase. 
   The Alternative Minimum Tax was introduced first to try to make sure that those at the highest end of income scales were forced to pay some type of income tax. But because we haven't adjusted that number over the years, more and more middle-class families are going to fall into that trap. 
   Mr. Ryan, you are exactly right. You and Mr. Meek and Ms. Wasserman Schultz have talked about the fact that, during a time in which we are expending vast amounts of money overseas while we have major overdue investments here at home, we are giving away this multi-billion dollar tax cut to the richest 1 percent of Americans. That is wrong. We need to reinvest that money back into our infrastructure, back into education and energy and all of the things that help regular families. 
   But what we need to tell people about is, this budget not only decreases taxes for folks at the very top of the income echelon, but it also raises taxes on middle-income folks, because the President in this budget does nothing to address that looming Alternative Minimum Tax. 
   It is kind of a difficult subject to talk about, because it is complex tax policy, and you have to dig a little bit into that income tax form to figure out how much it is going to hit you. But it is going to hit you.     
   And unless we do something about it, we are not just going to have a tax decrease for those at the top, we are going to have a big tax increase for those in the middle. And as we know, this budget does nothing to help the costs that all the middle-class families are facing. Their premiums go up every year from their employer, as the cost of higher education spirals, as we know, a 41 percent increase since 2001. This budget does nothing, little if nothing, to help those families. 
   So, Mr. Ryan, this is a double whammy for American taxpayers. Not only are we sucking money out of the budget by giving away tax breaks to the very wealthiest, but we are then very explicitly hammering those in the middle income. 
   But here is the good news. We know what the good news is, is that, as you have said, in previous years that budget which stands in front of Mr. Meek would have been delivered to Congress and would have had a little cursory look by the Members here and would have sailed out basically intact, at least when it comes to those priorities. 
   This year it is very different. And by the grace of the American people that sent a new Democratic Congress here, that budget is going to have a very, very hard look, and it is going to look very, very different when it leaves here, Mr. Ryan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. So here is what those of us who are new to this Chamber sort of see from the outside, and I think it probably matches up with what Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek keep seeing from the inside. 
   What used to happen here was that the agenda that came before the House was decided essentially by folks sitting in the third floor of the Republican National Committee, a bunch of Republican Party insiders who decided that they were going to put a Republican agenda on the floor. They were going to put a party agenda on the floor at the exclusion of the minority party. 
   So what you saw, for those us that turned on C-SPAN late at night when we were not watching the 30-somethings, we saw votes go up on the screen. And everybody sees those C-SPAN votes where they have got Republicans in one column, Democrats in the other column. You see all the Republicans voting one way, all the Democrats voting the other way, vote after vote after vote, because what was being put before this House was a Republican agenda. Occasionally you would have some people slide over, but by and large that is what you saw. 
   Here is the difference. The agenda that was part of the first 100 hours and the agenda that was behind the continuing resolution, as Mr. Meek says, if we have anything to do with it, the agenda that will underlie the budget that finally arrives before this body is not going to be a Democratic agenda. It is not going to be a Democratic budget. It is going to be a people's agenda. It is going to be a budget that comes from the voices and the concerns and the hopes and the fears of people back in all of our districts, Republicans and Democrat. 
   That is why you see on the 100 hours agenda and even on the continuing resolution, which is probably maybe the most controversial piece of legislation that came before that, even on the continuing resolution, the bill that kept the Federal Government going for the  next few months, you have Republican votes, because no longer is the legislation that gets put before us a partisan agenda. It is now a people's agenda. 
   And for someone who spent the last 2 years in my district campaigning to come here, talking to people that were so utterly frustrated with what was happening in Washington, yes, people were angry about the agenda here from issue to issue. They were upset that people were not listening to them about their concerns on rising energy prices, rising health care prices, why they could not send their kids to college. But they were maybe more overarchingly concerned with the tone this place had taken, and I think that is our lasting legacy, because, as I think I said the first time that I got to talk with you both on this floor, our legacy as a Congress may be that we have some small role in restoring people's faith in government. 
   When we go around and talk to elementary schools, we are talking to some of the most cynical 10-year-olds you have ever seen, because all they think government is is a bunch of people fighting with each other, yelling at each other, disagreeing instead of agreeing. 
   So what we do here is we are going to start putting those middle-class families first. That is what this budget will be about. If we can do it with Republicans, and when you do it with Democrats, in the end we make people believe a little bit again in government. 
   And for those of us who are in this 30-something caucus who might be around long enough to hopefully see government do a few more good things over the next 10, 20, 30, 40 years, that could be one of the most important things we can do.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATION REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I walked into the Capitol today, it was sunny outside, and one of the benefits of coming from Connecticut about 100 or so miles south a few days a week is, you might get a few sunnier days this time of year. And it is important, I think, on this day that there is some sunlight outside because beginning with the bill before us today, and following with pieces of legislation to come, we are going to start once again to open up this government to the people of this country. There is a sense, I think, over time that too much in Washington, D.C., gets done in back rooms and not enough gets done in the open daylight. 
   Today, we begin to open, again, this government to the people of this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1254, the Presidential Library Donation Reform Act of 2007, and I am grateful to do so through the benefit of work done before by Chairman Waxman, Congressman Emanuel, by Mr. Clay, and on the other side of the aisle, in particular, Mr. Platts and Mr. Duncan. 
   The legislation that they have worked on that is before us today is part of a larger effort by Congress to restore that honesty and accountability in the Federal Government. Simply put, this legislation would shine sunlight on donations to Presidential libraries. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Presidential library system was created by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Roosevelt had an idea to create a repository to house his Presidential papers for the benefit of future generations of Americans; you could call it yet another successful New Deal program. 
   His idea was to raise private funds for the construction of a library facility, and then he turned the facility and his papers over to the Federal Government for operation by the National Archives. This model is still followed to this day. 
   But, like many things, Presidential libraries keep getting more expensive. They have become libraries in concept much more than in practice. They often include various facilities in addition to a repository, such as museums, conference centers, or classrooms. 
   The George H.W. Bush Library was reported to cost more than $80 million to build. The Clinton library and museum cost about $165 million to build. News reports have indicated that the fund-raising goal for President Bush's library and think tank in Texas is $500 million. One can only imagine how much his successor will have to raise. 
   The problem is that as these libraries continue to grow in size and scope, Presidential foundations need to raise more money to build them, and many of these organizations do so by selling access to the President while he is still in office while his power and celebrity are the strongest. 
   Under current law, there is no requirement to disclose the names of the donors and the amounts that they have donated, and there is no limit on the amount that can be donated. You don't need to be a political scientist to see the potential for abuse. 
   Today's bill simply requires that fund-raising organizations disclose information about their donors to Congress and the National Archives during the period of that most intense fund-raising, while the President is in office, and during the first 4 years after the end of his term. 
   The legislation before us, H.R. 1254, would require that all organizations established for the purpose of raising funds for Presidential libraries, or their related facilities, report on a quarterly basis all contributions of $200 or more. 
   Under the bill, Presidential library fund-raising organizations would be required to disclose to Congress and the Archivist the amount and date of each contribution, the name of the contributor, and if the contributor is an individual, the occupation of the contributor. The National Archives would be required to disclose this information through a free, searchable, and downloadable database. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a nonpartisan problem, and what we have before us today is a nonpartisan solution. This bill does not seek to limit the amount a donor can contribute or the amount a foundation can solicit. It simply seeks to shed sunlight on the process. 
   Many of us came to Congress to bring government out of the back rooms and back into the open air. This bill, I believe, is an important step in that transformation; and I am honored to be able to stand on the work of colleagues who have worked on this issue over the years and to be able to present it to this body today. 
   Mr. Speaker, similar legislation has enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in the House in the past, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank both sides of the aisle, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Waxman and Mr. Clay, who have done such great work on this issue. They have constructed a bill which will allow the development of these facilities to move forward in an expeditious manner, but done so in a way that gives people faith in that process. 
   So much of our ability to build and rebuild faith in this government is connected to whether or not people believe that things we do here are done in the open light of day. Today is going to be a very good day to restore part of people's faith in this government, and this bill is an important first step.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Mr. Altmire. 
   I want to key off of your last point there, just spend a couple moments before we kick it back to Mr. Meek, on that issue of bipartisanship. Because you are exactly right. You know, it seems like a pretty simple premise that the cost of the war should include taking care of the warriors when they return back home, that the cost of the war isn't just the guns and the ammunition and the mechanics necessary to fight a war in Iraq or Afghanistan, the cost of the war is also taking care of those men and women when they get back home. That is this war and that is previous wars. 
   So it sounds like a pretty unanimous premise that we could all get behind, but the fact is that we didn't get behind it, and we didn't get behind it until the Democrats took control of this Congress. It was just platitudes and rhetoric for a long time, ``let's support our troops and support our veterans.''     
   So I think we got to be clear today, as much as we are going to talk about the importance of bipartisanship, it took the Democrats to put some of these issues out before the House in order to garner bipartisan votes. I think that is maybe as important as anything that we have done in these first 5 months, is that we have gotten rid of that old rule that I heard a little bit about when I was watching this place from afar in Connecticut called the ``majority of the majority.'' 
   I heard about this rule where nothing could come to the floor of the House of Representatives unless the majority of the majority party supported it. So you had very few opportunities for there to be real bipartisan cooperation, because you had to have almost unanimous agreement from the majority party, at the time the Republicans, in order for anything to get down here to the floor of the House. 
   We talked a lot, Mr. Meek, when we stood up here after that sort of glorious first 100 hours about those bills, those six or seven bills that we passed, and how many Republicans we had on board with each one of those. They were really remarkable numbers. On average we had 60-70 Republican votes for each one of those. It doesn't get covered much in the news. The news wants to cover just the grinding and gnashing of the two parties. 
   We had a lot of bipartisan cooperation, and that has continued. That has continued. In the last few weeks here we had on a bill to reauthorize funding for children's healthcare, we had 123 Republicans supporting it. That same 123 Republicans supporting increased record funding for Katrina recovery. On the joint funding resolution that finally restored some fiscal balance to this country, we had 57 Republicans supporting it. Increasing the minimum wage, 82 Republicans. 
   I know when you turn on the cable news networks you are not going to hear about the times that we agree. But why a lot us were so enthusiastic to stop by and send well wishes to Speaker Pelosi on her 20 years in Congress is because she has made good on her commitment to make this the most open and ethical and bipartisan Congress in a real, real long time. 
   I know, Mr. Meek, this doesn't get the headlines all the time, that the newspapers want to talk about the places that we conflict. But there has been a lot of cooperation here and it has mattered. I think it has made a difference. 
   I think one of the things the people don't understand is sort of how this place works, and I certainly didn't understand it until I got here. 
   It used to be it was impossible, virtually impossible, for Democrats to get their amendments heard on the floor of the House of Representatives. You were going to get a bill introduced by the Republicans, and that was about it. No more debate, no changes, no amendments. Nothing. No real opportunity for the People's House to actually engage in a real argument, in a process of coming up with a better piece of legislation. 
   That has changed now. In the first 5 months of 2005, we had two what are called open rules, bills in which any Member can put forth an amendment, have a chance to have that idea vetted and aired out before the House of Representatives. We have quadrupled the number of bills that have come before this House under a so-called open rule. 
   I know these are sort of arcane terms that people out there may not understand, but they matter. It means that every single one of the 435 people that are elected here have a chance to make a bill better, have a chance to have their voice their constituents' voices heard. For a long time it was shut down. 
   So it was a good night tonight to be able to celebrate Speaker Pelosi's two decades here in the House. A lot of us are excited about the potential that lies before us to be able to really reset our direction in Iraq, to do better things in energy policy, to stand up for working families. 
   But for a lot of us that came here on the backs and shoulders of our constituents who have virtually lost complete faith in politics, maybe we are just as excited about the fact that, despite what you may see in the cable news networks or reading the headlines, we actually are starting slowly to bring people together here, to open up this House, this process, again, to make it a true bipartisan People's House.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. You can talk the talk, but you have to come out here and do it. You have got to put bills before this House that have Republican ideas in them and have Democrat ideas in them. And you have to be okay with the fact that we can share credit. Listen, nobody in my district cares whether I am a Republican or a Democrat, as long as I am on the right side of the issues, as long as I am fighting for what they believe I should be fighting for. 
   People don't think in Republican or Democratic terms back at the places we come from. They think about Republican and Democratic terms here inside the Beltway in Washington, DC, but back out in America, Mr. Meek, people think about what is right and wrong; what is good for people and what is bad for people. Not Republican and not Democrat. I think we are beginning to start to figure that out.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Before we send this back over to Mr. Altmire, Mr. Meek, let's talk about an issue on which I think this Congress is going to stand together tomorrow, Republicans and Democrats, and stand against the policies of a President who is going to show once again how out of step he is with the American public, and that is on the issue of stem cell research. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity when I was in the Connecticut State Senate to author Connecticut's Stem Cell Investment Act. Connecticut became the first State in the Nation through a legislative act to invest public dollars in stem cell research. I am real proud of that. 
   But part of the reason that I decided to leave the State Senate and come here to the United States Congress is because it was a bittersweet victory for us. We shouldn't have 50 different State legislatures investing in basic scientific research; certainly not the type of potentially pioneering, life-saving scientific research that stem cell research, both adult and embryonic, holds in its vast and potentially limitless potential. 
   So, tomorrow, we are going to take up a bill that we took up at the beginning of January, now coming back to us from the Senate, which is the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, which is once again going to allow for Federal dollars to be used for both embryonic and adult stem cell research around this country, and, by the way, finally put some real ethical and moral and scientific boundaries around that research. 
   One of the great secrets in this world today is if you don't live in a State like Connecticut, California or New Jersey that has put forth in State legislation some moral and ethical parameters around stem cell research, this research is largely unregulated in this country. So I think the most important thing we will do tomorrow is pass in a bipartisan way a bill that will start to turn on Federal funds for research that, as we know, potentially will unlock the treatments and cures for such insidious diseases as juvenile diabetes and Parkinson's research and maybe even for cancer some day. 
   This isn't tomorrow's cure and it is not even the day after tomorrow's cure, but if we don't start investing now and start investing at a Federal level, start investing our Federal dollars, we are never going to get to that day when we can start to realize the potential of stem cell research. 
   But here is where the rub is. We are going to do this with Republicans and Democrats standing together. There will be more Democrats supporting it than there will be Republicans. That is just how this issue is going to work. But this is going to be an issue in which this Congress, because we are in tune with what the people are telling us, that they want us to use the research at our disposal to try to make people's lives better, that is what this is all about, trying to use the resources of the Federal Government, the communal resources of the American people, to try to make our lives better, that is what stem cell research can do. They want us to make that jump. It is going to land on the President's desk and he has already told us once again that he will veto it. 
   He is continually out of step with where the American people are with  this war in Iraq. Now he will once again show us he is out of step with where the American people are on healthcare. 
   But, once again, we are going to show that if we stand together, if we put party aside and we listen to what the people want, in this case they want a Federal Government that is going to start standing up and trying to find cures for cancer and Parkinson's disease and bone marrow disease, that we can do some pretty amazing things here if we stand together. 
   We passed things with bipartisan support in the past. We will do it tomorrow on maybe one of the most important things that we will do before we take our break for the summer, which is invest in stem cell research.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. You talked about how much public support this enjoys, and it is broad and far ranging. I think the public support mirrors the support within this body. It probably cuts across partisan lines because the diseases that stem cell research can treat do not discriminate based on whether you are Democrat or Republican, not even on whether you are pro-choice or pro-life. 
   So when you have family members out there who are watching a loved one grapple with diabetes, watching a father or mother die of Alzheimer's disease, and they see there is this vehicle, there is this potential out there, untapped right now, with their Federal  tax dollars, they don't understand. They don't understand why their elected representatives wouldn't stand up and at least try to make an effort to bring a cure or treatment to their loved one who is struggling or dying with these diseases. 
   This issue enjoys public support because these diseases don't discriminate based on political discrimination, political views or geography. I think that is why you will see so many Republicans and Democrats supporting it. 
   This is an issue that arises a lot of passions in people. So there is rhetoric that sometimes doesn't match the reality. One of the arguments that you are going to hear tomorrow is we don't need to invest in embryonic stem cell research, which is the controversial piece of this debate, because adult stem cell research does the trick. That argument doesn't wash when you talk to the scientific community. 
   Adult stem cells have vast potential, and we have found ways to utilize them to make people better and give people longer lives.     
   But the fact is that adult stem cells only work on the person that those cells are harvested from. My adult stem cells work on me. So I can take stem cells out of my bloodstream, manipulate them, put them back into my bloodstream to try to cure the disease or whatever may be affecting me. 
   Embryonic stem cells have almost a limitless possibility of being manipulated, to being harvested and put into a limitless number of people. Those cells don't just work on the people they're taken from. Those cells can be manipulated and have universal traits to try to cure diseases. 
   So we're going to have to try to talk about that tomorrow and why we need to invest in both adult stem cell research and embryonic stem cell research.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (HUMAN CLONING PROHIBITION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative DeGette, for being such a leader on this issue in the past and allowing me to join with her today to offer this very commonsense measure regarding the banning of human reproductive cloning. 
   I rise in support of this act today. I do so because to me the bill before us is relatively simple. This is a straightforward ban on human reproductive cloning, taking material through somatic cell nuclear transfer and turning that material into a living, breathing human being. As Representative DeGette said, nothing more, nothing less. 
   Under this law, if someone uses cloning technology to initiate a pregnancy and creates a cloned human being, they would face severe criminal and civil sanctions. 
   This legislation is something that the vast majority of the American public supports, and it is something that all Members of Congress I think should support as well. 
   In Connecticut, as part of our State's historic Stem Cell Investment Act, which I was very honored to have authored, we recognize that human being reproductive cloning is a practice that perverts the promise of science; and we banned it outright in our legislation. In fact, I think it is pretty amazing that we are standing here having this debate today, that the Federal Government has, until today, not stepped forward and said that human reproductive cloning, bringing that material to the stage of a human being created from that material, is illegal. We should do what we did in Connecticut here today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I understand that there are some members who want to turn this ban on human reproductive cloning into a ban on somatic cell nuclear transfer, called by some therapeutic cloning, and I understand the discomfort many Members have with this innovative line of stem cell research. Personally, for me, I join the scientific community in my belief that it is this research that holds the most potential for lifesaving treatments and cures. 
   But I recognize there are those who disagree. However, the debate surrounding this particular disagreement is not the subject of today's legislation. Today's legislation is simply about the line that we all can agree to draw, that which clearly and cleanly prohibits the manipulation of cells or embryos into a cloned human being. 
   The moral and ethical questions surrounding somatic cell nuclear transfer are legitimate subjects for debate. But that debate will occur later this week when we revisit the comprehensive stem cell authorization bill coming back to this House from the Senate. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, our task is simple: Ban what we all agree is beyond the scientific and ethical pale, human reproductive cloning. 
   We are dealing with an issue as complicated as cloning technology. The morass of scientific arcana and the ease of sound bite simplification can obscure the simple facts. So let's be clear. Today, human cloning, creating a replica of a person's DNA, implanting an embryo into the womb of a woman and creating a new human being out of that material, that practice is legal today in this country with exceptions such as Connecticut and other States that have done the right thing and banned it. With the enactment of this legislation, human reproductive cloning will be illegal. Nothing more, Mr. Speaker, nothing less.

And we've passed legislation rescinding the billions in tax giveaways that the prior Congress gave to the oil companies and turned them around to give them to tax benefits for homeowners and businesses who want to invest in renewable energy without any help from the other side of the aisle and with the President threatening a veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from New York and the gentlemen from Pennsylvania and Louisiana for bringing this resolution before us. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution to recognize the contributions of charter schools to education. So often we talk about the crisis of America's schools and our educational system, but it's equally important to take some time to recognize the good that's being done. That's why I welcome this opportunity to acknowledge the impact that charter schools are making in our education system nationally. 
   In congratulating charter schools, I want to also acknowledge the work of all of our administrators and our educators in our public school system and our public charter school system as well. Noncharter public schools remain the bedrock of our educational system, and we need to make sure that we are doing everything here in Congress and at our State level to make sure that our public schools have the opportunity to succeed. 
   But charter schools are growing because, when done right, they're working. They represent a network of committed and innovative administrators, teachers and parents whose great determination and resolve complement the public education system. This national network of 4,000 charter schools infuses hope and possibility into communities. In Connecticut alone, there are 16 charter schools educating over 2,500 students. 
   Charter schools are infused with an imagination. Moreover, these schools are effectively engaging students around innovative and aggressive curriculum. They are setting the bar high and they are getting results. As we consider solutions for improving math and science education and increasing the number of high school graduates and students matriculating to colleges and university, we should remember the contributions that charter schools are making to the education of our Nation's children. 
   Again, Madam Speaker, I commend the tremendous dedication of all educators. Their unsung sacrifices are critical to ensuring the success of America's youth today and the skill of tomorrow's workforce. 
   I urge all Members to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. First I would like to thank Chairman Mollohan. 
   This bill is a vast improvement on previous efforts to fund domestic violence efforts. It goes a very long way. And we rise today with my colleague Mr. Reichert to simply ask that we fund yet one more important program that has been authorized. 
   As a child, Mr. Chairman, I remember sitting at home with a baby-sitter while my mother went off to volunteer in a domestic violence shelter, and that memory still stays with me today. Victims of domestic violence require and are entitled to special assistance when dealing with their trauma. However, judges and court personnel need specialized training to deal with these victims in a way that both preserves justice and addresses the severe trauma associated with these crimes. 
   Some States have already put programs in place to deal with the special needs of these domestic violence victims. My home State of Connecticut is amongst those that has been pioneering these types of programs. In the biggest city in my district, Waterbury, we have a program through which law enforcement personnel, prosecutors, family services organizations, probation officers, and domestic violence advocates all review cases together in an effort to reveal more information about the perpetrator to ensure that victims are protected from further abuse. What makes the Waterbury operation so outstanding is the vertical case management model that should serve as an example to the rest of the country, a model that could be funded under the proposed appropriation in this amendment. 
   Congressman Reichert and I are offering this amendment today so that States can have a partner in the Federal Government. Our amendment will fund the Court Improvements Program to train judges and court personnel to better identify and resolve the complex issues involved in domestic violence cases. 
   Congress has a responsibility to recognize the unique and horrific nature of domestic violence crimes, and we have done that in the underlying appropriation bill today with a new investment in domestic violence programs. Our amendment today simply seeks to fund yet one more innovative program to make sure that courts, prosecutors, domestic violence advocates, and the victims themselves all have the resources necessary to navigate what can be sometimes a very complex system. 
   I urge adoption. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, it had been previously the intention of Mr. Platts and myself to offer an amendment to title II of the bill. In discussions with the chairman, we will not be offering that amendment today, but I rise to speak briefly on an issue that I know is of great importance to Chairman Mollohan, and that is the issue of juvenile justice. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Mollohan for his incredibly hard work on this bill. I am particularly glad that the bill contains a significant increase for the Department of  Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. At $400 million, the OJJDP saw a $62 million increase from last year's level. It received $120 million more than the President requested in his budget. It would be hard to overstate how meaningful these increases are going to be to the juvenile justice community. 
   The amendment that Mr. Platts and I were going to offer today would have increased the Juvenile Justice Title II State Formula Grants by $5 million. States rely on these grants to achieve and maintain compliance with the core requirements and protections of the Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Act. These requirements protect children who become involved with the courts and ensure that the treatment and services they receive are appropriate for their age, their stage of development, and are suited to their specific offense. 
   Mr. Chairman, when I was in the State legislature, I had the great honor of working on issues related to juvenile justice, and we made great strides in Connecticut in terms of bringing more appropriate care to children in our juvenile justice system and really moving from simply punishment and towards prevention and rehabilitation. These kids don't have lobbyists. Many of them don't even have a home. And as a result, they are often forgotten and voiceless in the halls of State legislatures and here in Congress. Mr. Mollohan and his office have sought to bring a voice back to these children, and I hope that we can build on that. 
   Since 2002, States have seen an 11 percent decrease in State formula grants authorized under the JJDPA, meaning that States have had fewer resources with which to keep kids safe and handle their cases appropriately. States use these formula grants to divert status offenders away from jails and towards appropriate community-based programs to assist them and their families. Status offenders are children under the age of 8 who have committed acts that would otherwise not be considered crimes if they were adults, like skipping school, running away from home, and the possession or use of tobacco. Status offenders may not be held in secure detention or confinement, with a few exceptions. 
   States also use these funds to monitor adult lockups and ensure that youth are housed in age-appropriate settings. They enact mandates that youth may not be detained in adult jails and lockups. When children are placed in adult jails or lockups for any period of time, sight and sound contact with adults is prohibited. 
   States across the Nation are using these funds for very innovative programs to provide children with much more appropriate care. There is very little political utility in State legislatures and here in Congress to stand up for children who have gotten into our criminal justice system, but these funds are used to give these children another shot at success in life. 
   I am glad to be joined by Mr. Platts from Pennsylvania, who was going to cosponsor this amendment, and I would be glad to yield to him at this time.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, 9 years ago on this floor, Congressman Floyd Spence, the Republican Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, had this to say about the bill withdrawing American forces from Bosnia: ``The time is long overdue for Congress to express its will on behalf of the American people.'' 
   I couldn't say it better myself. In this place, the People's House, the will of the people must mean something. Elections must mean something. And if the 2006 election represented anything, it was that the American people were tired of the lack of oversight and accountability from this Congress, and they were tired of a war with growing numbers of casualties, and mounting costs with no end in sight. They asked for a new direction from this Congress, and The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act, is the answer to their call. 
   There are many of us who feel uncomfortable giving this President another dime to spend to perpetuate this misguided and shortsighted strategy in Iraq. But I come here to support this legislation because for the first time since the start of this disastrous engagement, Congress is making sure that any further spending on this war comes with unprecedented support for our troops and veterans, and a real plan to redeploy our forces and resources to fights that we can still win. 
   This Administration has been wrong on just about everything about Iraq--there were no weapons of mass destruction, we were not welcome as liberators, the country has plunged into a civil war, and we have no exit strategy. 
   The days of issuing a blank check to this Administration with no questions asked are over. As we enter the fifth year of this war, people in Connecticut and across the country demand a change in our policy in Iraq. This bill is the change that they asked for.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, when will it end with Blackwater? Probably not soon enough. Just yesterday, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released findings that show that Blackwater has potentially misclassified hundreds of workers in Iraq and Afghanistan, evading taxes and costing the taxpayers in the United States at least $30 million. This comes a few weeks after the same committee discovered that Blackwater is raking in potentially $100 million in profit off of their government contracts. We have got to get this situation under control. 
   That is why I, along with Mr. Welch and Chairman Waxman, have introduced legislation to require that private government contractors receiving more than 80 percent of their revenue from Federal contracts, like Blackwater, must disclose the salaries of their most highly compensated employees. 
   It just isn't right for executives at Blackwater or anywhere else to make their fortune off of war profiteering. It is our money, and we deserve to know how it is being used.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Chair, I move to strike the last word. 
   Madam Chair, I was going to offer an amendment today, but would like, rather, to speak on the subject of the amendment. 
   Madam Chair, I'd like to thank Chairman Dicks for all of his hard work on this bill. 
   Last week, Madam Chair, I was joined by Representative Gerlach and Representative Pitts as we relaunched the Bipartisan Land Conservation Caucus. And as one of the new co-Chairs of that caucus, I'm thrilled that the Interior Department budget that Mr. Dicks and his subcommittee have put together includes a major new investment in open space preservation funding, and I applaud their work here. 
   But protecting these spaces, once preserved, is a time-consuming, expensive, and often complex process. We're lucky in this country, especially in New England where I hail from, to have amazing partners in this process, which are local land trusts. These land trusts were started by community members who want to preserve and protect the regional character of their special part of the world. Since their creation, they've grown into full-fledged partners in the conservation effort. Many of these trusts across the country have expanded and now have up to 10 or 20 full-time staff members; however, many still remain very small volunteer organizations with no staff support. For example, of the 128 land trusts in Connecticut, 103 of them are comprised solely of volunteers, the largest number of volunteer trusts in the country. It's these small land trusts that do most of the on-the-ground work, saving historic sites and priceless vistas that are so important to our regional character in New England. 
   However, in recent years the burden on these small land trusts has grown tremendously. In addition to their original task of seeking out lands to preserve, they are also now bound by IRS red tape and heavy enforcement duties. These land trusts are now responsible for ensuring that any conservation donation qualifies for the tax deduction offered by the IRS. These tax deductions have caused legions of landowners to choose to put valuable conservation easements on their land; however, a local volunteer land trust with no paid staffers cannot be expected to do the IRS's work for them to evaluate and sign off on every donation. 
   In addition, these small land trusts are now required to enforce and patrol the easements that they already hold. As more and more land is put into easements, more and more burdens are put on local land trusts to make sure that these easements are enforced. In Connecticut, there are now over 24,000 acres of land with conservation easements, and more and more land is added every year. 
   If the government is going to rely on these land trusts to do the administrative work associated with these easements for programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Forest Legacy, it makes sense that we should partner with them to help them with these administrative duties. 
   I had planned on offering an amendment that would have allowed 1 percent of all land and water conservation funds appropriated by the Bureau of Land Management to be available to competitive grants to volunteer land trusts across this country. That money could be used in order to help them with some of the administrative costs that have been imposed.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Chair, reclaiming my time. I thank the chairman very much for his offer to help. This is a historic investment in this bill in open space preservation and land preservation funding. I thank the chairman and his committee for their commitment to this very important issue, and I look forward to working with him to make sure that we are doing all we can to help those land trusts make the best use of this new historic and incredibly important commitment to land preservation and open space preservation.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Chairman Grijalva and Chairman Rahall, for your very hard work on bringing this bill to the House floor today. 
   Connecticut's Fifth District, which I have the honor to represent, is rich in the kind of landmarks and natural treasures that today's legislation would help to better manage. From the beautiful Farmington River, a Wild and Scenic River, to the Metacomet Monadnock Mattabesett Trail, soon to be a National Scenic Trail, my constituents are personally familiar with the kind of benefits and resources these designations can provide in encouraging community-driven conservation and land management. 
   As we continue to grow as a region and as a Nation, we need to be mindful of preserving that delicate balance with the natural world around us. My home State of Connecticut has the highest proportional rate of farm land development in the country, creating a quandary for communities who want to promote economic development but don't want to sacrifice the unique character of their towns and of their regions in the process.     
   This is the kind of bipartisan issue that brings many of us together. The designations that my district enjoys today come by virtue of the hard work of my predecessor, Congresswoman Johnson. This brings together hunting enthusiasts as much as it does environmental advocates, and they are all asking the question, how do we best leverage the resources of the Federal Government to partner with communities? 
   The Federal Government can and should be that type of partner in helping support the regional management of the outdoors. A better coordinated Federal effort, which this bill will bring, can empower communities and can empower individuals to have a larger, more constructive role in the sensible conservation of our land and of our resources. 
   Again, I thank the chairman for his work on this bill. And I urge my colleagues to support it this afternoon.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IN ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, last week this House, with strong bipartisan support, passed important bills that will demand more transparency and accountability here in Washington. And in the first few months of this Congress, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on which I have the opportunity to serve, has held several hearings on political influence in public policy. 
   Sadly, instead of following our lead, the Bush administration is being anything but open about its involvement in the political purging of eight U.S. Attorneys. 
   For weeks now, Attorney General Gonzales has asserted that the firings were not instigated by the White House, but e-mails between the White House and Gonzales's chief of staff show heavy involvement in the purging by political advisers. 
   The President admits mistakes were made, but he has no plans to hold his Attorney General accountable. The implications of this scandal on our legal system are grave. This administration has created a climate in which prosecutors are looking over their shoulders trying to do right by the political bosses instead of through the system of justice. 
   Madam Speaker, this White House should learn something from what we did in the House last week. It is past time that the President insist on more accountability in his administration.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. We are all important in our own ways. 
   Government Oversight and Reform, though, that was a committee that was a little sleepy here for the last few years. I have not been here with you for the last few years, but I was a watcher. I think I could see what was happening down here in C-SPAN. You did not see many oversight hearings. You did not see a lot from the Armed Services Committee, the Government Oversight Committee exercising what used to be the constitutional prerogative of the coequal branch, which is the legislative branch. 
   Here is how things have changed. Let me put this where people can see it.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. It used to be that, you are right, it was 60 Minutes and New York Times and The New Yorker. That was the oversight branch in our Federal Government. It was the press. We are thankful that they actually brought some things to light. 
   But what we have learned just in the first 2 months, what we have brought out in these oversight hearings are really stunning to the American people. Nine billion dollars put out in cash on wooden pallets, thrown out of SUVs in sacks as they drove down the street, unaccounted for, do not know where it went, have no idea where it went. 
   We have got Blackwater, a contractor out there, keeping the diplomats and some American military personnel safe. Well, we find out that the government's role in overseeing Blackwater and a lot of these other contractors, you know what we did? We contracted that out, too. We contracted that out, too. Blackwater took its responsibility and contracted somebody else, and they contracted somebody else. Everybody made a dime along the way. These were things that you did not hear about in these halls until we got here. 
   So the bill that you outlined, it does the right thing for our troops. It does  the right thing for our veterans. There are some other pieces that we can talk about, how it does the right thing for kids, the right things for farmers, but also does the right thing for taxpayers because it finally gives some accountability in how we spend these dollars. We would like to see an end to these dollars. But while we are spending money, at least finally we are going to have some accountability for those dollars.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Before Mr. Meek talks about readiness, let me just make one more point on top of that. It seemed that for years this Congress, the Republicans who set the policy for this war, didn't view the cost of the war as including taking care of the soldiers when they came back from Iraq and Afghanistan, that the cost of the war was just the money for the Humvees and the salaries and the missiles and the rifles. No, the cost of the war is all of what it takes to actually conduct that war on the battlefield, but it also is about putting forth every single dollar that is necessary to take care of those brave men and women when they come back to the United States. 
   Now, used to be in World War I, World War II, wars in the middle of the century that you would have about three injured soldiers for every soldier that was killed in action. Now, with improvements in technology in armor and medicine, we now have a 16-1 ratio. That is great news. That is great news, more people are coming back alive, but they are coming back with more difficult injuries, more complex medical issues. We haven't built into that war the cost of taking care of those veterans. 
   That is what this bill does. That is what this bill does. It is going to fund the withdrawal. It will fund the redeployment of our forces to fights that we still can win. It will also for the first time, for the first time, recognize that the cost of the war includes taking care of the veterans, not just average health care. In fact, we found out in many cases, in Walter Reed substandard health care, but with gold standard health care. Our veterans system should be the best health care available in this country. 
   With $1.7 billion in defense health care, $1.7 new dollars for veterans health care, we will finally live up to that commitment to our veterans and our soldiers when they get back here, like we should when they are over fighting for us.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Meek, I can't match your level of articulateness, but I think you are saying what people feel out there. I mean, this election had to mean something. I mean, people spoke, they went out there in numbers in parts of the country that we haven't seen in a long time. And they spoke with a pretty loud voice that they wanted a different course of direction in Iraq. 
   Now let me read something somebody said a few years ago in 1997. Mr. Ryan, when he was joining us here, talked about the fact that there is a little bit of double talk this week from folks on the other side of the aisle, this idea that Congress really needs to back off and let the President do his business. Well, that wasn't the line coming out of here in 1997, when Congress thought something very different about the oversight responsibility of this body when it came to the effort in Bosnia. 
   The chairman of the Armed Services Committee at that time was a gentleman named Floyd Spence from South Carolina. Here is what he said. This is his floor statement supporting the bill that was going to withdraw funding essentially from the President's intervention in Bosnia. He said, today's vote will call for the withdrawal of U.S. ground troops from a peacekeeping operation of growing expense and seeming unending duration. Mr. Ryan already told us that if that was unending duration, well, then you haven't seen unending duration compared to this effort. He went on to say, the time is long overdue for Congress to express its will on behalf of the American people. It is important that the Clinton administration be held accountable for the Nation's foreign policy and, in this case, for Bosnia policy. Let me say it again. It is long overdue for Congress to express its will on behalf of the American people. 
   You know what? I agree. That is what we are sent here to do. We are sent to invoke on this floor the will of the American people. That is why we get elected every 2 years instead of every 6 years, because we are the body here, the House of Representatives, and I have only been here for a couple of months, but I have studied enough history to understand that my responsibility when I came here was to speak on behalf of my constituents. And my constituents and the constituents of those that sent new Members here in droves from all over the country, from the Midwest to South, the Sun Belt, the West and the Northeast, said, set a new course. Stand up to the President. Redeploy our forces for fights that still matter. Protect us at home. That is the will of the American people. That is what we are going to be talking about this week. 
   Mr. Meek, I think elections mean something. And I think what we are going to engage in on Thursday is an effort to put the will of the American people into practice here. 
   Now, it is not just the American people. We just saw a poll the other day that came out and asked specifically whether the American people would support Congress' plan to bring American forces back home and redeploy them to other fights across the globe that we can still win by the fall of 2008, the bill that we are about to vote on this week, and it wasn't even close. A margin of over 20 percent, 59 percent to 34 percent of Americans support that plan. The American people said what they wanted on election day. And when pollsters went to just double-check the temperature and make sure they still thought that, well, they still think that, in fact, probably in greater numbers than they did on election day, seeing that things have only gotten worse on the ground and the President's policy has only become more meandering. 
   But we don't just have to listen to the American people, because we can also listen to our foreign policy community. We put on that Iraq Study Group some of the brightest minds in American foreign policy. The folks that have set the direction for foreign policy coming out of Washington for years all got together, Republicans and Democrats, folks that probably hadn't agreed on much of anything if you were to poll them on other foreign conflicts. Well, they all came to an agreement, and they sent a report to us saying it is time to set a new direction, it is time to start redeploying forces in 2008. 
   We can also listen to our military leaders as well. And we have read a lot of quotes on this floor, so we won't belabor it, but just take one. The Deputy Commander of Multinational Forces in Iraq said it very simply: It's clear, you cannot solve this problem militarily. You have to do it with a combination of military, economic and diplomatic things that we have to do. 
   The American public, our foreign policy community, military leaders on the ground who see this on a day-to-day basis say the same thing: We have put our men and women in the middle of a civil war. We have done virtually nothing to address the underlying causes of that religious conflict. And to simply allow them to continue to be the referee in an increasingly bloody battle, that is not the right policy for our troops, it is not the right policy for this country, and it is time to start focusing on real security issues again. 
   Let me bring up one last thing, Mr. Meek, before I yield back, what is included in this bill. This isn't just about, you hear this word withdrawal,  this isn't about withdrawal. This is about focusing our efforts as a Nation on the fights that matter. We still have a real important conflict in Afghanistan. If we redirect some efforts there, we can still make a difference on the ground. Remember, that is where the people that attacked this country trained. That is where they base their 
   operations. And if we are not careful, Afghanistan is going to fall right back into the hands of the folks who provided cover for so long to Osama bin Laden and his henchmen. 
   We also have to do a lot more here on the ground in our own country, Mr. Meek. Now, you voted for efforts on the Democratic minority for years to try to bring light upon the fact that we have been spending billions of dollars over in Iraq. We haven't been spending money here at home to do the things we need to do to protect this Nation. 
   So this bill is going to put $2.6 billion into homeland security needs, make sure that you and me and our families and our friends are protected here; $2.6 billion, Mr. Meek; $1.25 billion for aviation security, including 1 billion for a new explosive detection system, $90 million to deploy advanced checkpoint explosive detection equipment and screening techniques, $160 million to do better when we are screening air cargo, $1.25 billion for new port and transit and border security features, $150 million for nuclear security, including, at the President's request, $67 million to secure the nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. 
   Here is where the fight is; it is in places like Afghanistan, it is at our ports, it is on our borders. That is the fight that we are going to engage in. That is where we are going to refocus our efforts. 
   This vote that is coming up this week is about doing just what the Republicans told us we were supposed to do in 1997; that is, expressing the will of the American people on this floor. This vote is about putting our forces, putting our money where the fights matter most. 
   Mr. Meek, I am going to be proud to be part of that this week when we finally get that chance to make the will of the American people the law of this country.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Meek, this is about government. I mean, you talk about leadership, it takes leadership to govern. 
   You are right. I am as close as anybody to what is happening and what people are feeling out there because I spent the last 2 years spending every day and every night visiting the pasta suppers and the pancake breakfasts really, I think, being as in touch as anybody in this Chamber is with where the American people were. And, yes, they have specific irreconcilable grievances with this President about the war, about his approach to energy policy, about his lack of any understanding of health care dilemmas facing the American people. 
   But I think they also just have this sense that this place is broken down, that Congress couldn't govern any longer, that they couldn't maintain their relationship as a coequal branch of government with the President, that they couldn't even get anything done on meaningful issues like health care reform or immigration or oversight of this war. 
   So is this bill perfect? Absolutely not. Are there things that you would change in it, things that I would change? Would I move a date around here, some money around there? Absolutely. But you know what? This isn't a place where you just come and vote your preferences. I mean, we are not voting for the American Idol here. We are governing. We are putting votes together to make progress for the American people. And so there are going to be a lot of folks who are going to cast green votes for this, who are going to have problems with certain parts of it. But in order to live up to what the American people want us to do here, which is to set a new direction, we have all got to come together and find a way to govern. It is something that wasn't happening here for a very long time. 
   And so I am going to be proud to go back, once we get through this process, once we are able to put something through the House, through the Senate, we hope get the President's signature, I am going to be proud to go back and talk about it, talk about how we have fulfilled that commitment to redeploy our troops, to start spending our money in different places. 
   But I am going to be just as proud to tell them that Congress is working again; that there is leadership here that is willing to take some tough stands, that is willing to ask some people to cast some votes that might not be perfect for them; that we haven't allowed the perfect to be the enemy of the good, as a lot of people are talking about these days. I am going to be just as proud to talk about how this place is working again, Mr. Meek.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, Mr. Ryan. And it is quite an honor to be able to share the floor with a gentleman as articulate as yourself. 
   I know where you are from, and I can imagine that you have a lot of families, probably including your own, that shares the story of my family. My great-grandfather and my grandfather both worked at Fafnir Ball Bearing, which was a massive ball bearing factory in New Britain, Connecticut. It employed thousands of people in the New Britain area and partnered together with the Stanley Tool factory. Those two together employed over 10,000 people in New Britain in its heyday. 
   The city looks very different today. Those sites are either brownfields with nobody in them, or now sort of struggling office parks. My office, which I inherited from Congresswoman Johnson, is in actually a site that used to be owned by those manufacturers. 
   But the story that we are talking about today is not necessarily a story of manufacturing, it is a story of the workers that were there. It is no coincidence to me that as you chart the history of our middle class in this country, as you chart the growing disparity between those that are doing very, very well and those that are struggling just to get by and cope with the daily cost of their lives, I don't think that it is just a coincidence that during that time, as we have seen a middle class vanish before our eyes, or at least become on the precipice of vanishing, and you see that disparity, that gap between rich and poor grow bigger and bigger, that that has happened during the same time that we have seen unionization rates drop through the floor. Because the middle class that my family came up through, which is that working-class middle class, the folks that are making enough money to get by, enough money to give their kids a little bit better chance at life than they had, but they are not doing enough to buy a second home, they are not doing enough to buy many luxuries, that group of Americans, diminishing by the year, doesn't have a lobbyist up here. That group of Americans doesn't have a pool of money in which they can employ people to advocate on their behalf here in this Chamber. 
   The group that has done that historically over time have been unions. They advocate to make sure that their ranks are swelled as well, but they also have been, frankly, the people that have been advocating year in and year out up here in this House to make sure that we have a healthy middle class. 
   And so I am fairly unapologetic about my support for the bill tomorrow, that we are going to basically level the playing field. I think that is what you were talking about, Mr. Ryan, is that we are not giving any unfair advantage to workers, we are simply saying that we want to level the playing field when it comes to organization in this country. And I think that is the right thing to do for workers. But as a member of a family that only has survived because of a society and an economy that once produced jobs that had real pensions and real health care benefits attached to them, we need to start figuring out a way to make sure that those folks get advocated for here in this House. 
   And as you recited that long and important list of achievements here in the House during the first 100 hours, that is all about that group of people. That is all about making this House a place where those middle-class, working-class folks get a voice: again, minimum wage; taking away the big tax breaks for the oil companies; starting to lower the cost of health care; investing in life-saving research. That is bread-and-butter work for the middle class. 
   The gist of it is this: This bill, the Employee Free Choice Act, tomorrow is going to level the playing field to allow some of these folks that have been before Congress fighting for a very long time for that healthy middle class to be able to continue to emphasize and increase that voice. And that is as important as anything we do here because, as Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek and Ms. Wasserman Schultz have been talking about on this floor night in and night out for far too long, the voices that have mattered here have been the folks that have the big wallets that can pay the high-priced lobbyists to come in this building. And we don't begrudge the work that people who advocate on behalf of people do here, but frankly, we need advocates here for folks that don't have those dollars. And whether we like it or not, unions in this country have done that job, and they have done it well with decreased numbers because of a system we have set up that ends up making it very difficult for workers to organize.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Here is what we are talking about here. So how do we take that chart that you are showing there, which I agree cannot continue to be the way that our society operates. We cannot be a flourishing democracy, we cannot be a flourishing economy if we have so many people doing so poorly and a small group of people doing very well. So how do we go about changing that? 
   And I think the message is that we are not talking in this Chamber about big new government programs. We are not talking about creating new departments and new bureaucracies. All we are talking about is take the existing programs, take the existing set of rules and make them fair. Make them fair. Give everybody a chance to compete. That is what increasing the minimum wage is. I mean, 10 years, while every other cost goes up and the minimum wage stays where it is? Just bring it up to where it needs to be. Just match inflation with your minimum wage. 
   Student loan rates. As the cost of college goes up 41 percent since 2001, well, let's help families match that increasing cost of higher education. 
   And the same thing with the Employee Free Choice Act.     
   Let us have our eyes open to what the reality is on the ground for those who want to organize. Let us recognize how employers have changed some of their tactics, and let us give employees the opportunity to operate on that same level playing field. 
   That is what this is all about. This is about taking the rules that we have and making them fair, not coming in and creating big new government bureaucracies to help these folks. 
   One of the most important things we did here was the bill in the first 100 hours that allows the Federal Government to negotiate lower prices with the drug companies. That is a great example of one of the few instances where this Congress did create a new bureaucracy, and when they created it, they set rules that disadvantaged regular, average taxpayers and the senior citizens who were supposed to benefit. They created this big new health care program and created the rules to tilt the playing field in favor of those people who needed no extra help. 
   This Congress has to be about taking those programs that are right there in front of our faces and making them work again. I think if we do that, we will live up to your mandate that we cannot let this stand.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. You spoke earlier about the need for unions to be flexible. I couldn't agree more. This is an inexorable march to a very new global economy, and nobody can deny that is happening, and we have to ask our workers and the unions that represent them, just like we ask our employers, to figure out a way so America can compete in that new environment. 
   You talked about the steel industry. That is a remarkable instance. Actually, not that remarkable; it happens more than I think people are given credit for, of workers and industry really coming together before this body and singing a very similar tune. 
   We have to remember that as much press might be given to unions and the companies that they work for fighting over contracts, when it comes down to it, both of them only are able to prosper if the economy is strong and if their company is strong. So on the vast majority of this that they are going to come and talk to this Congress about, they are going to advocate in their communities for, they are going to be on the same page. 
   When you talk about that, maybe there is no better example than our health care system. You are talking about it in the context of our new Medicare prescription drug program, but if we want to figure out a way to compete in this world, we have to figure out why $1,500 of every car sold in this country goes for retiree health care benefits compared to only a couple of hundred dollars in Japanese manufacturing plants. We have to figure out a way to deal with the fact that 16 percent of every dollar spent in this country goes to health care costs compared to 9 or 10 cents in most of the  countries that we compete with. We put an exorbitant amount of money into employee benefits and health care in general, which puts us at a tremendous competitive disadvantage compared to the rest of the world. That is something that employers, workers, government officials, we should all be able to agree on. We should all sit here and try to tackle that very grave question of how do we get health care costs under control. That is the salvation of American manufacturers and American small businesses. Frankly, it is also the salvation of American workers and unions. If we can figure out a way to have that conversation, that benefits everybody. 
   We have given a lot of emphasis and put a lot of light on the fact that everything we have done here as part of that 100-hours agenda has had very large numbers of our friends from the Republican side of the aisle supporting us here. You have the numbers right in front of you. You can tell the story, Mr. Ryan. 
   Sometimes government gets shed in a light that tries to accentuate controversy, just as sometimes the relationship between workers and their employers tends to be told in a manner that accentuates adversity and strife. 
   Well, in this Chamber, in my first 8 weeks as a Member of Congress, it has been remarkable the amount of bipartisan cooperation we have seen. It shows in the vote totals. Maybe it doesn't show in the headlines, but it shows in the vote totals. 
   I think the same story can be told about the relationship between workers and employers in this country. I think there will be a bunch of people grousing about what comes out of this House tomorrow, but I think in the end, by leveling that playing field, we will stimulate a lot of productive cooperative relationships in our economy. 
   I thank the Members of the 30-something Working Group who have over the last 2 to 3 years stood up on this House floor to talk about the fact that this place had to work together. I think a lot of sectors of our economy, a lot of members of our community takes cues from what happens in Washington. I think to the degree they see this place just being about Democrats and Republicans fighting, then I think they may reflect that in their operations and in their daily life. I thank members of the 30-something Working Group and other Members who have talked about bipartisanship. I think what has happened here in the past several weeks is going to be instructive to a lot of relationships in our country and in our economy going forward.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I was asked a question at a Chamber of Commerce meeting that I went to back in my district last week. Someone challenged me and asked a question that went something like this. They said if you had the choice to take a dollar and put it back into the economy through the private sector or through the public sector, which one do you think does a better job at stimulating our economy. I kind of didn't understand the gist of the question. 
   What he was getting at was this idea, I think, that he thinks that people on this side of the aisle somehow think that government spending should be done for the purposes of stimulating our economy. Listen, that couldn't be further from the truth. What we want to do is decide on a set of services and a set of priorities that the government will be a part of, and then find the money that is sufficient to pay for that. 
   We all agree that if we have our choice, every extra dollar goes right back into people's pockets. Every extra dollar we have goes right back into the economy. All we need to agree on here, and it is a big all, is what those set of priorities and services are. People in my district think one of them should be investing in stem cell research. That is just my district. But they think you know what, one of the things that we can probably do better together rather than separately, rather than simply through philanthropic contributions, is to take on some of the most insidious and terrible diseases known to man. That is something they think we should do. 
   It wasn't agreed upon by this Chamber until the Democrats took back this House and Nancy Pelosi took over the Speaker's chair, but now we include it in the group of things that we think we are going to do better together. 
   I think we all agree that every extra dollar we have goes right back into this economy. But let us think about this. When we are talking about putting dollars back into the lands of middle class folks, lower middle class folks, working class folks, whether it is through tax breaks to small businesses that employ them, whether it is through a cut in the student loan interest rate, or whether it is through a minimum wage bill that gives them a little more every week, we know that every single one of those dollars is going right back into the economy. 
   Now that is, in part, because there is not a lot of flexible income for people in that situation today. Every dollar they get has to go back into the economy. When you talk about tax cuts and where they should go, you talk about new government programs and whether they should benefit the pharmaceutical companies or whether they should benefit senior citizens, I will take middle class workers, I will take senior citizens every time, not just because I think they are who we should be here sticking up for, but because I know that every dollar we put back in their pocket is going to end up at the local florist, is going to end up at the local grocery store, is maybe going to end up being put into a local charity or community group. We are talking about recycling good community money when  we are talking about trying to give a leg up, Mr. Ryan.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. You are exactly right, and that is where the American people are. There are folks out there that are far to this side of the political and ideological spectrum, and there are people out there that are far to this side, but you know where the majority of bread-and-butter Americans lie. They lie in that place where they are seeking some solutions here that are part of that middle way, a part of that third way. 
   In Connecticut, I spent 4 years as the chairman of the Health Committee. In Connecticut, we have a lot of pharmaceutical companies, and we found a way to try to mitigate some of the deleterious influences that that structure imposes on citizens, while trying to partner with them to do some of the good work that can grow that new economy. 
   I disagreed day and night with the pharmaceutical industry when I tried to get Connecticut to be part of reimporting prescription drugs from Canada, but you know what, we fought hand in hand, arm in arm, linked together when we were trying to make Connecticut one of the first three States to invest in stem cell research because we knew that our pharmaceutical industry, we knew that our biotech industry were going to flourish if we helped plant some of the seeds with government funding because we know in today's economy that venture capitalists are not terribly interested in funding some of those new biotech ideas, funding those new baseline pharmaceutical research. So government in that instance can spend a couple cents to grow a couple private dollars. 
   So there is that way to sort of say enough is enough, we are going to do something about trying to help citizens get some cheaper drugs from Canada, we are going to talk about trying to use the power of the Federal Government to negotiate lower prices, but there are so many places we can cooperate. There are so many places that you as a pharmaceutical industry, you as an information technology industry can be part of growing this country. 
   You know as well as I do that the reason that businesses are still here in the United States and the reason why businesses come to a high-cost area like the Northeast is the workforce. We still have the best trained, most highly educated and, most importantly, most productive workforce in the Nation. So when we are investing in the minimum wage, when we are investing in higher education funding, I mean, we are investing in what is the current and the future of this economy.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I like sharing stories, an Irish story from my Polish mother. 
   She tells a story about she was going back to school to get some classes for her degree in teaching. She was getting some classes at the local community college, and she told this story to me when she came back from registration. 
   She was in a line to register for her course, and there were a number of different lines to register for different courses. About three or four lines down from her, there was a gentleman who was waiting in line sort of nervously, thumbing through his pockets, sort of counting the money in his pockets. He got to the head of the line, and she  could sort of see what was happening over there and realized that he was maybe $30, $40 short of the cost of that particular class. He fumbled through his pockets. A couple of people behind him tried to help him come up with the money. He did not have it and walked away, walked out that door. 
   What my mother said, and I agreed with her, was you can imagine the courage that it took that young guy who maybe had not been to school in a very long time, decided this is it, I am going to go back, I am going to start down that path again, I am going to go to my local community college, I am going to have the courage to step up and restart my education, and gets in the line and realizes he does not have the $380 that it costs to get that class. That right there, that could be that welder. That could be that information technology worker. That could be somebody using the stepladder of education to become part of this incredibly productive economy. 
   Because we still have barriers to increasing your educational opportunities, to being a more productive member of our workforce, we handicap ourselves. We handicap ourselves. 
   And I think of the story of that guy over and over again when I think about higher education funding, when I think about not only what that would mean for him personally, but what that means for our economy in general. Our strength is our workforce, and if we do not start investing in it, we are going to have even more trouble than we are competing in this global economy.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, and I do not know how long my career will last either, but it is starting here in my first 8 weeks in the House only because me and 100,000 other people in northwestern Connecticut decided things had to change, there was no choice; that we could not sit back any longer and let the status quo go on; that we could not watch the disparity between rich and poor, those doing well and those struggling to make ends meet, could not watch that get any worse. 
   So what this election was about, what this first 100 hours was about, what everything that comes after that is about is about restoring that balance. So for all of the challenges that we put before this House during the time we spend here, for as many charts that paint a gloomy picture, I mean, there is light on the horizon. The work we have already done here means something. 
   You talked about the 400,000 kids that did not go to college because they could not afford it. Well, if we can get this student loan bill through the Senate and to the President's desk, that is almost $5,000 in savings. I bet you there is a good percentage of those 400,000 families that if they knew that college ultimately, after they paid back all their loans, was going to cost $5,000 less, they would make the choice to go. 
   Things are happening here which are going to make those concerns of middle-class families tomorrow with the Employee Free Choice Act and later as the bills in the 100 hours come through this process, they are going to make a difference.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Fighting for kids with autism, fighting for teenage pregnancy programs, fighting for children's mental health, I mean, that's what's in these earmarks. 
   Why is the so-called pork spending that I'm bringing back to the Fifth District? For a children's mental health program in Danbury, for an after-school program in Torrington, for a teenage pregnancy center New Britain. You know why? Because the Republican Congress, along with this President, for the last 6 years and the last 12 years have gutted every single one of those programs that helps poor kids, helps poor families, helps the disabled, that helps poor, the disadvantaged, the dispossessed, all of those programs that are just trying to give people a little bit of a leg up, trying to give them access to the apparatus of opportunity that all the rest of us have, were stolen out from underneath them. 
   So guess what we're doing with these earmarks. We're going and funding basic social services to try to treat kids with autism, to try to cure children of a mental disease and mental disorder that they have. And we're forced to do that because we have been sitting through a Congress, and Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek have been talking about it for several years, that has made a choice over the last several years, has made a choice to fund a whole bunch of tax cuts for people at the upper, upper echelon of the income scale and at the expense of all the people that we are now putting first again, the folks that are supposed to be helped by government, that is, middle-class, regular folks who, through no fault of their own, might have had a little opportunity stolen from them. We're going to try to help them out again here.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, the point is to make your case. If you want money for thermal underwear, come down and make your case in front of your colleagues. If you want money for autism, make your case. But the fact is you can't come down here and hold everyone else on one side of the aisle to a standard that you're not willing to hold yourselves to. It's a simple request here, Mr. Ryan, to be consistent. If you're going to be against earmarks, then be against them. But if you are going to make the case that there's waste and pork in the bill, sometimes you've got to look inward.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Altmire, let me just take a quick guess, let me throw a hypothesis out there about why folks on the other side of the aisle and those that were talking tonight might be a little angry. 
   Everyone gets passionate down here, but when Mr. Meeks talks, it's kind of like happy passionate. On the other side of the aisle it feels a little different. And listen, I would be too, I guess. And this is my guess, I would be, too, if I had spent decades building up a brand of my political party based around fiscal responsibility, and then, in the course of 1 year, in the course of 1 year the party that you tried to portray as the tax and spenders, the fiscal irresponsibles, that party, after having been in control of the Congress for less than a year, for the first time in 12 years does all of the fiscally responsible things that you couldn't do, passes a rule saying that every single bill that comes before this Congress has to be paid for. You can't pass anything on this floor that expands the deficit. First time that's happened since the Republicans took control of this Congress. That was Democrats that did that. Passes a balanced budget in 5 years, that's Democrats doing it. Leading a Congress that is shrinking, rather than expanding, the annual operating deficit of the Federal Government. That's Democrats; that's not Republicans. 
   So, I guess I would be angry, too, if I was a Republican in this House and I looked at the party that I thought I joined, which was the fiscally responsible party, and found out that that mantle now lay on the other side of the aisle. So, that might explain something, Mr. Ryan. And I guess knowing that, maybe a little bit of it is justifiable.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, we need a tear-down reform of our national health care system. But until we do that, we have an obligation to fund the providers and institutions that make our system work despite the system. That is why I am so proud of the budget passed by the House last night. 
   President Bush's budget would have required cuts of 800 grants for medical research at the National Institutes of Health. He would also cut programs that provide access to health care by $595 million and rural health care initiatives by more than 50 percent. We rejected those cuts last night in a bipartisan fashion. We approved a bill that included $607 million above the President's request for critical medical research. And we approved money for community health centers so that they can provide access to 280,000 more uninsured Americans. Finally, we approved $147 million above the President's budget request for rural health care for those critical access projects. 
   Mr. Speaker, the health of the United States is stronger today because of the budget we passed last night.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, if I had a monopoly on apple pies because the law said that my backyard was the only place in town where you could grow apple trees, I would charge whatever I wanted for those apple pies. I would be even more excited when I would start jacking the price way, way up for those apple pies and would make huge, record apple pie profits. 
   If the government decided that the way to fix that problem would be to give me, and only me, permission to grow one more apple tree in my backyard 10 years from now, well, it would sound pretty ridiculous, right? 
   Unfortunately, even though the analogy is a little bit simple, that is basically the Republican's plan for high gas prices. Instead of actually creating competition for the oil industry by concentrating on growing renewable energy sources, they just call for a little bit more drilling, giving their friends in the oil industry even more profit. 
   Well, we shouldn't fall for it. With 2 percent of the world's oil reserves here in the United States, the only way to bring gas prices down is to end oil's monopoly and to start growing apple trees in other people's backyards.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank my friend from Ohio. And I think it's important to point out that a lot has changed here in the last 1 1/2 years. I mean the numbers that you show are pretty startling, moving from about $5.6 trillion on the plus side to now $3.2 trillion in deficit. And the fact is that we got a mandate when the Democrats were elected to control this House and to control it by a slimmer margin in the Senate. We had a mandate to get our fiscal ship in order. The days of not paying for anything had to end for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the reason that you're talking about, the fact that the amount of money that we are borrowing from foreign banks has contributed to the devaluing of the dollar. And that means everything that we import into this country becomes more expensive, not the least of which are the millions of barrels of oil that come into this country. 
   So what do we do about it? Well, we did something. We passed a rule in this House that is a rule that most families and every business out there lives by every day. We said, listen, when legislation comes before this House that spends money, we're not going to pass it unless in that legislation we account for how we're going to pay for it. When a piece of legislation that comes before this House wants to cut somebody's taxes, we're not going to pass it unless within that piece of legislation we account for how we're going to pay for that tax cut. And we call it the ``pay-as-you-go'' rule, which is how my family grew up, how most American families live their lives. They don't spend money that they don't have. And it's so ridiculously simple that it's mind blowing to a certain extent that it took a change in leadership in the this House to actually put that into practice, but it has changed things. We're starting to get that deficit that you talk about, Mr. Ryan, under control. 
   Now, it means that this Congress can't spend money as wildly as it did under the Republicans. It means that we have got to be a little bit more careful about whom we give tax cuts to and make sure that when we do it, we give it to the right people. But in the end it makes for a better policy and it starts to get that fiscal mess that you talk about under control. 
   And there are so many ripple effects of that good policy, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek, that's not just about making sure that we don't pass along the costs of this deficit to our kids and our grandkids and their kids. This is also about restoring some balance of trade so that we are not basically asking the rest of the world to pay for our debts, and in the end, do something about the dollar that as much as anything else is responsible for the high prices we're paying at the pump, Mr. Ryan.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank you, Mr. Meek. I appreciate the point. 
   You talked about record profits. Let's talk about some meat on the bones here. A 311 percent increase in profits for the oil industry from 2002 to 2007. It may just be a coincidence that that time about correlates with the moment that they started sitting in those secret meetings, Mr. Meek, in Vice President Cheney's office to negotiate this new energy policy into the Bush administration. But I don't think it's a coincidence. 
   I think you can directly correlate the moment at which the oil companies started seeing this 311 percent increase in profits begin with the moment at which they were let in the door to start writing America's energy policy. Because that is what happened. 
   We put two oil men in the White House, in President and the Vice President seat, and we got, as a result of it, the highest gas prices in the history of this Nation, a 300 percent increase in the profits to their friends in the oil industry, and families having to make decisions about whether they feed their kids or whether they fill up their gas tank to get to work the next day. 
   That is not coincidence. That is not chance. That is the result of putting two people in charge of this administration that made their fortune in the oil industry and who have friends that they have allowed into the room to write the very legislation that has led to the situation that we are in today. It's not just conjecture. 
   Let's take a look just in the last year and a half at what we have been doing here and who's been standing in the way. This is probably not readable to the Speaker and to our colleagues here, but can you get the picture here. 
   The Renewable Energy and Jobs Act that we passed just a few months ago, investing millions of dollars into renewal energy that would actually compete with the oil industry, would make us energy independent, as we talk about all the time. Veto threat in the President of the United States. The Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act that held OPEC and the oil companies accountable for price fixing; for getting together and trying to decide what the price of oil should be. The President once again threatens to veto it. 
   Commonsense legislation. Repealing the subsidies, the tax subsidies that that energy bill that the oil industry wrote, repealing those tax subsidies and instead, this just seems like common sense, turning those subsidies that the Republicans and the President were giving to the oil industry, instead give them to consumers and small businesses and people who want to invest in things and energy technology in their homes to get them off of oil. Another veto threat from the President. 
   Cracking down on price gouging. Fifty-six Republicans joining us on that bill. Veto threat from the President. Again, a second bill, this time with 125 Republicans supporting the measure.     
   This measure was to go after the OPEC countries and oil cartels for price fixing. Another veto threat by the President. Over and over again. 
   This Congress in the last year-and-a-half has been doing what we were sent here to do, represent and stick up for all of those middle-class families out there that are getting it stuck to them at the pumps. The way we say that we can do that best is to go right at the people who are getting rich off of these exorbitant oil prices, those oil companies. And every time that we have done it, virtually every time we have done it, we have had a President standing in the way. It continues. 
   We just find out the other day, Mr. Meek, that this administration has been helping the oil companies negotiate no-bid contracts to get their newly found oil out of the fields in Iraq.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. It is completely consistent though, because when the Bush administration came into office and they wanted an energy policy, they knew who to turn to, right? They went for answers to their friends in the oil industry. So, today, when people are hurting at the pumps and they are looking for answers, who does the Bush administration and who do the Republicans look to for answers? They ask their friends in the oil industry. And guess what their answer is? The way out of this is to give us access to the tiny little chunk of territory that we haven't gotten yet. It is going to take 20 years to get anything out of it, but our answer to your immediate problem is to give us access to territory that will get a tiny additional bit of oil in 20 years from now. And people bought it.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank you, Mr. Ryan. You referenced that short-term plan, and I think we would be remiss if we didn't talk a little bit about what is maybe our best tool between now and when this session wraps up to actually get some short-term relief to people. Because as much as we know the oil companies are a lot of the reason, the majority of the reason behind the problems that we face today, we have got to acknowledge where the price of a barrel of oil is set. 
   The price of a barrel of oil is not set in the boardroom of Exxon or Chevron or BP. It is not set at the gas station that you and I go to fill up at. It is set on this place called the commodities market, the other place that has done very, very well over the past several years, the traders on Wall Street who have been coming away with millions, if not billions, off of these increased prices that we see. 
   So if you really want some short-term relief, if you don't want to wait 10 years until you could get a drop of oil out of newly-leased territory, then let's actually go and pass some legislation to affect the very place that the price of oil is being set, and that is on the commodities market. 
   We have seen an explosion of almost 20-fold in the amount of money that is being invested in the oil commodities market. And, guess what? Most of that money is being invested betting in only one direction, that the price goes up. And guess what else? When you bet that the price goes up, that is what it does. It goes up.     
   Money chases money. Long bets increase the price of a barrel of oil. So we have got some pretty simple solutions in front of us that we are going to be putting forward in front of this House in the next few weeks. 
   Let's limit the amount of people who can go onto Wall Street with the millions that they have made and force the price of gasoline, the price of a barrel of oil artificially beyond what it really costs. Because I do not believe that the price of a gallon of gas is really $4.20. That is not what supply and demand would have it at. That is what the commodity traders on Wall Street would have us believe. 
   So if you really want to get short-term relief, then just as on the issues that we were talking about before, you have got to take on the oil industry,  you have got to take on Wall Street, you have got to take on the commodity traders. 
   And this place just I have seen it in the last few weeks, Mr. Meek, has all of a sudden started to crawl with those lobbyists that represent the folks that are making all this money off of oil trading. They are going to try to shut this down. They are going to do their best to go to their friends here in Congress and in the administration and try to shut down our efforts to reform the commodity market. 
   And this isn't a simple thing to explain to our constituents, it is not a simple thing for people to explain to us. But if you really want to talk about what is responsible, what venue can be affected immediately in terms of bringing down this price, you have got to go after Wall Street, you have got to go after the place where we can get the most obvious and quickest price relief. And it is not going to be easy, because those folks there have just as many interests and lobbyists as do the oil companies here. But, Mr. Meek, we didn't get sent here to represent the lobbyists, we didn't get sent here to represent the special interests. We took over this House, we took control of this House because we are supposed to stick up for the people who are paying those prices. 
   And we are all singing the same tune. In the long run, we have got to get off of oil. We have got to find something else to run this country on, Mr. Meek, Mr. Altmire, and Mr. Ryan. But in the short run, let's go to the place where it counts and where it can be changed and affected the most, and that is the commodities market. And I hope that we are going to do something here. I hope that we are going to get some bipartisan consensus to be able to work on that solution in the next few weeks.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 30-Something Working Group which the Speaker is a member of and I know will join us down here for an hour in the future, we hope to be joined later this evening by one of the senior members of the 30-Something Working Group, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek). 
   We come down to the House floor as some of the younger Members of the Democratic Caucus, and we try to do it every week to really focus in on how the issues affecting this Congress are specifically challenging younger families in this country. How the neglect of the past 12 years trying to be remedied by the new Democratic majority here are affecting those families that are just starting out, those issues maybe can be best talked about and best addressed by those of us who are the younger members of the House represented by the 30-Something Working Group. 
   We thank the Speaker for constituting the working group and allowing us to come down and share our thoughts. 
   It is remarkable as a first-term Member, Mr. Speaker, to see the transition of views and transformation of priorities and issues that you hear about as a first-term Member, going out and holding office hours as I do at supermarkets throughout my district, holding town hall meetings every week or 2 weeks throughout the district. 
   I remember back in February of 2007 when I held my first big, large town hall. It was a nerve-racking occasion as a first-term Member of Congress, and I remember thinking there was only one subject to hold that town hall meeting on, and that was the war in Iraq, dominating the conversation as it seemed to here on the floor of the House and in the halls of the United States Congress. 
   The President had proposed his new strategy to introduce 35,000 to 40,000 new troops into Iraq, clearly working against the will of the majority of the American people who had said all across this Nation in November 2006 that they wanted a new direction in Iraq. 
   And now fast forward a year later to town halls that I am holding, as well as other members of the 30-Something Working Group and Members on both sides of the aisle, and you hear a very different tune. 
   People are still talking about Iraq. The situation hasn't gotten any better, and you can make the very plausible argument that things have gotten worse in Iraq over the last year. Even as the surge has moved forward, the political willingness of the Iraqis to take control of their own country has moved backwards. 
   But what we are hearing very clearly from the mouths of our constituents in town hall meetings and office hours across this Nation is that there is economic trouble. There is trepidation on behalf of families throughout this country as to the economic future that they face as families and that our communities face going forward.     
   And it's real. The numbers are getting worse. The amount of homes facing foreclosures, the number of workers being laid off, even those people who have jobs finding that the salary increases they thought were coming are being postponed, the amount of overtime hours that they used to rely on, cut back, many more part time workers, more temporary workers. 
   I don't know, Mr. Speaker, whether we're in a recession or not. I'm not an economist. But I know that people are facing real trouble back in Connecticut, as they are throughout the rest of this country. 
   And I don't think it takes a rocket scientist on this floor or anywhere else in the country to figure out how we got here. You know, this isn't just about the jobs that are being lost. This isn't just about the themes are being foreclosed upon. This is about the fact that thousands of families, millions of families around this country and in the Fifth District of Connecticut have no more room in their budget to take any more hits. 
   Energy costs going up at a pace that families and seniors can't sustain; health care costs going up to the point where businesses celebrate when they hear that their premiums are only going to increase by 10 percent in a given year. You add that all together with an economic slowdown, and you put millions of families at risk throughout this country. 
   And it should be no surprise that we've gotten to the place that we are today because for 12 years, while our friends on the other side of the aisle controlled this House, while President Bush staked his claim to the White House, we have had absolute neglect when it comes to energy policy. 
   So the families throughout this country today are hurting, while oil companies are making record profits, record profits; not just for the oil industry, but for any company in the history of capitalism in this country, record profits for the oil companies, while we have  families hurting, paying more at the pump, paying more to heat their homes. 
   Health care policy is the same story. I mean, how long has it been that this Congress has been listening to the cries, to the pleas of families and businesses throughout this Nation to do something about the rising cost of health care? 
   And for 12 years of this Republican Congress, for 8 years now, almost 8 years of this Bush presidency, no relief on health care costs. While yet, at the same time, those that are making profits off the health care system, the insurance companies, the drug companies, continue to make enormous profits. Salaries for the CEOs of these companies spiral to new heights. 
   So people are doing pretty well when it comes to energy prices, people are doing pretty well when it comes to health care prices. It's just not consumers. It's just not our neighbors and our friends and our relatives. It's that lucky few who got to run the oil company, who got to run the drug company, who got to run the insurance company. 
   And we're trying to change things. But we're finding that it isn't easy without partners. It isn't easy without a Republican minority who actually wants to actually do something to change our economy. It's not so easy without a President who wants to come to the table and help us with health care policy. 
   And so we are in difficult economic times today. But we need a Congress working together. We need a President who's willing to come to the table. 
   Mr. Speaker, the facts speak for themselves here. On January 22, 2001, when the President was sworn into office, the price of a gallon of gasoline was about $1.47. Today, 7 years later that price stands at $3.53. 
   In Connecticut you might be lucky today to find a gallon of gasoline at $3.53. I think when I filled up my car this weekend, if I remember, it was up around the $3.70 mark. 
   This is what you get, this is what you get when you give away $16 billion of tax breaks to the oil companies. This is what you get when you refuse to make any investments in the types of alternative renewable energy sources that could wean this country off of gasoline. And this is what you get when, year after year after year, you perpetuate a foreign policy that destabilizes international oil markets in the Middle East and elsewhere. 
   It's no secret, it's no surprise that we're standing where we are today. This Democratic majority has inherited an utterly bankrupt national energy policy, and it is leading to the trouble that we have seen in American families today. 
   And the same thing goes for health care policy, Mr. Speaker. Again, I find it painfully humorous that 10 percent increases in premiums are to be celebrated around this country in our business community. And what it has led to is too many businesses who want to do the right thing, who want to give health care to their employees, cutting them off, or forcing more of the cost on those employees; putting yet another economic burden on families all around this country. 
   This economic slowdown, once again, is not just about the subprime crisis. It's also about energy prices, it's also about health care costs. And for 12 years of this Congress, for 7 years of this presidency, no action on health care. 
   With one minor exception, right? You remember the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. Well, it did a couple of things. First, it foisted a Medicare prescription drug benefit seniors, which drove millions of seniors around this country through the roof trying to figure out, amongst 40 or 60 or 80 different plans, which one they should sign up for; drove them through the roof even more once they got to the end of the year and realized that their coverage was going to run out on them when they entered that dreaded donut hole; and all the while, made another nice health profit for the insurance companies and drug companies that were in the room writing the bill with the Republican majority at the time. 
   That was our approach to health care, was to give a little bit to people in an utterly confusing and cruel program, which gives a lot to the folks that didn't need any more. That's pretty much the sum total of health care reform in this Congress before the Democrats took control. 
   And as we've tried to extend out health care, we have been met with almost uniform resistance from the Republicans and from the President, most significantly in our effort to try to extend health care to poor kids. Four million kids we could have covered with the health care State insurance bill that we tried to pass. We came, you know, depending on anybody's estimates, about six votes short here in the House of Representatives, to overturn the President's repeated vetoes. 
   That kind of health care coverage, reaching out and extending to a lot of working families out there. Remember, you're talking about 3/4 , maybe more of the 46 million uninsured out there are members of families in which you have a full-time worker. People are playing by the rules. They're doing everything we ask them to do, trying to make do in a tough economy, and yet they don't have any health care insurance. And that children's health care insurance bill that we tried to pass here as Democrats, and couldn't get cooperation from our friends across the aisle, that would have extended out benefits to four million more kids and, more importantly, four million more families, families that are doing everything we ask, playing by the rules, trying to survive and simply can't get health care to their kids. 
   Now, we know that they do get health care to their kids, because if their child is sick, they might postpone getting them to the doctor, but compassionate parents all across this country will end up bringing their child down to the emergency room, will end up finding a doctor that will treat them. But they pay for all of that out of their pocket. 
   More bankruptcies in this country are caused by health care costs than any other cause that you can dream up. And so this economic slowdown is exacerbated by the increasing amount of health care costs that are pushed and burdened on families across this country. 
   Doing something about health care is doing something about the economy, just like doing something about energy prices is also about doing something for this economy. 
   But the other thing that I'm finding out, Mr. Speaker, as I'm walking around talking to constituents in the northwest section of Connecticut, is that the gig is up on the Republican and the President's ability to separate the war from the economy, because people are figuring out that they are totally linked together. 
   The fact that we are spending $339 million a day, let me say that again, $339 million a day on this war is taking food right out of the mouths of families here in this country, taking jobs effectively right out of the hands of American families. 
   Why is that? Imagine what we could have done if we could have taken the nearly $1 trillion that we have spent on this war over the past 5 years, and invested it in growing new economies in this country, invested it in building new worker training programs so that individuals being phased out of old economy jobs could be transitioned into new economy jobs. 
   What if we took that money that we've been spending, $330 million a day, and put that into new tax incentives for small businesses to grow their operations? 
   All of the things that we could have done with that money could have prevented the economic slowdown that we face today. They are absolutely linked together, the spending on this war, and the economic slowdown that we see today. 
   And part of this whole puzzle, and now you're getting into sort of high-minded economics that a non economist like me probably shouldn't be talking about. 
   But we know also that the dollar is falling fast across this world, and is jeopardizing even further the soundness of our economy as our dollar gets weaker and weaker and weaker. 
   And part of that equation is the fact that every dollar of this war, virtually every dollar for this war has been borrowed from foreign countries, countries that we're trying to sit across the table from and negotiate better trade deals, trying to negotiate on foreign policy. We can't do that on a fair and level playing field because we owe them  money; not just a little bit of money, but billions upon billions of dollars that we owe foreign countries. Because for this war, we haven't paid for it ourselves. We put it on somebody else's tab, our kids' tab, our grandkids' tab. And for now that money is being held, those promissory notes are being held by foreign governments, further undermining the American economy. 
   So the chickens are coming home to roost here on energy policy, on health care policy and on the policy of the war that has sucked money out of this country that could have gone to sustain our economy. 
   Well, we can do things about it. We can do things about it. We can make strides, we can take steps to strengthen our economy, once again. 
   I want to talk for just a brief moment, Mr. Speaker, about one small bill that we passed today that'll start to get us on the road to fiscal and economic sanity once again. 
   Regardless of what you think about this war, we have spent wildly and out of control. Now, I'm talking about the $340 million that we spend every day in Iraq. 
   Now, I think that had we not gone into Iraq in the first place, had we not stepped foot into this quagmire, we could have spent all of that money here at home to educate our own kids, to build our own schools, to retain our own workers. 
   But even if we had gone into Iraq, if we had just been paying more attention, as a Congress, as to how money was being spent, we could have had a lot more money to do those things that is now being wasted on the battlefield of Iraq and the battlefield of Afghanistan. 
   One of the ways in which we are wasting money was that we were making and still are, Mr. Speaker, making people rich off of this war. War profiteering is what it's called, people making their fortunes off of the misery of others. That's happening right here and now in the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. 
   In the Government Oversight Committee that I sit on as a freshman member, we had one of the most egregious examples of this practice, Blackwater Security before us back in the fall. The CEO of Blackwater Security who's got a billion dollar contract to basically do the work that the U.S. military should be doing in Iraq, Blackwater is basically a paramilitary citizen army setting up camp in Iraq. 
   They got a huge contract with the United States Government. 90 percent of Blackwater's profits, excuse me. 90 percent of Blackwater's revenue comes from U.S. taxpayers. I mean, they are, essentially, a quasi-government agency. 90 percent of their money comes from the U.S. taxpayers. 
   So I asked what I thought was a commonsense question at this hearing. I asked Eric Prince, the CEO of Blackwater, I said, listen. You know what? I think it'd be useful for us to know as a Congress, and for the American public to know how much profit you make, how much salary do you take as a quasi-public government employee? 
   Mr. Prince said to us, very clearly, it's none of your business. I'm a private company. It seemed outrageous to me. It seemed outrageous to many of my colleagues on the committee. 
   We pay your salary. We pay 90 percent of all the money that your company takes in, and you're not going to tell us whether you make $1 million? 
   Well, he did tell us that; he did tell us that he made over $1 million, but he wouldn't tell us how much more.     
   $2 million? $3 million? $10 million? $20 million? 
   So I put in a bill, a really simple bill that passed on the floor of the House of Representatives today that said for those private companies that are out there making 80 percent or more of their money from the Federal Government, that have $25 million or more in contracts, you need to tell the American public how much you are taking out in profit. Tell us how much your most highly compensated officials make. Put some sunlight on how much profit you are making off of this war. Seems like a commonsense measure. In fact, it passed unanimously on the House floor this afternoon. 
   But it says something about how important the change was that was made in control of this House that it took 5 years of this war for that commonsense, simple bill to make it to the House floor, because when it got here, it resulted in a unanimous vote. But it took Democrats taking control of the House in order for these types of bills, cracking down on war profiteering, to even find the light of day here. 
   And so, yes, so many of us believe that part of bringing us out of this economic mess, this downturn, this recession, whatever you want to call it, is getting us out of this mess that we have gotten ourselves into in Iraq, turning that money around and spending it right here in the United States of America. But until we do that, one of the most important things we can do for our economy is to make sure that to the extent that we are spending money in Iraq that we're spending it wisely, the right way. 
   That's part of our responsibility as a Congress. At least when I grew up reading the Constitution, learning about the three branches of government, I was told that the House of Representatives was supposed to be a place that oversaw the executive branch, that made sure that the money of the people that they represented was being spent in the right way. Well, that didn't happen here for a long time. 
   That oversight role that the Congress was supposed to have on the war, on the policies of the President, kind of vanished for about 7 years. Conveniently, they were there for the years in which there was a Republican Congress and a Democratic President; a record number of subpoenas were flying out of this place when there was a Democratic President. But when there was a Republican Congress and a Republican President, it wasn't happening so much. I would like to think it was a coincidence, but it probably wasn't. 
   Now we've got oversight again. And a reasonable amount of oversight. Not overreaching. Not politicizing, not grandstanding. The right amount of oversight. And we passed a bill that was part of that process today. 
   I couldn't be more pleased, tickled, frankly, to be joined on the House floor by one of the originators of the 30-Something Working Group, Representative Meek.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Well said, Mr. Meek. And if we can get the legislation that we passed through the House today through the Senate, what will make those numbers even starker is to partner them with the numbers reflecting the millions of dollars that some people out there are making off this war. Or those numbers of troops that don't come home, or come home with their lives altered permanently, for many of us, I think for all of us, it doesn't seem right that off of that misery someone is making their fortune out there. And that's what the legislation today on the floor sought to do. 
   Mr. Meek, you talked about the fact that on a lot of the pieces of legislation that we've been talking about, especially with respect to our efforts here in this New Direction Congress to try to do something about the legacy of rising oil prices that the President has left us, we've had folks on the other side of the aisle join us. I'm just looking at a couple of bills here on our legislation to finally go after these multinational oil cartels that have been price fixing, have been immune from the actions of prosecutors and U.S. courts. Well, we've decided to put them under the jurisdiction of the United States court system and try to go after them for price fixing. And you know what? We did. It looks like we got about 125 Members of the Republican side of the aisle to join us. 
   When we went after price gougers, we said, let's make it a Federal crime, let's give the Federal Trade Commission the ability to go after those people who would take advantage of rising prices to gouge consumers, to try to get much more than the market would command. We had over 50 Republicans who joined us on that legislation; we wish we had more. We wish we had a greater bipartisan majority for these pieces of legislation that are going forward. But the fact is is that we are working together as much as we can. It's not easy to take on these big interests that are making record profits in the oil industry. 
   The real problem is down the street. The real problem is that we have empowered and entrusted with the reins of the White House and the entire executive branch two oil company executives, two people who made their own fortunes taking profits off of oil prices, taking money out of the pockets of consumers. And those relationships in this administration with the oil industry, I think more so than the relationships that certain Members of this House might have, have really led us to the point where we have trouble advancing good consumer legislation through the full process because the President's threatened vetoes on the anti-oil cartel bill. The President's threatened veto of the price gouging legislation is what holds it up from moving further through the process. 
   So Mr. Meek, this is, I think, a building bipartisan majority here in the House. I think we are having some success convincing some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, despite their procedural tricks and maneuvers, that, you know what, these prices don't discriminate based on what party you went down and registered at the town hall and you're getting killed by gas prices and home heating oil prices whether you're a Republican or whether you're a Democrat. So I think that may account for why we have been able to build some collective support here for these pieces of legislation. 
   It's really down the road, as you ended your remarks, Mr. Meek, by suggesting that we've still got time left, right? I mean, everybody's looking at this presidential election saying, you know what, that's where our focus is. Everybody's concerned about this primary and that primary, and the cable news networks don't cover what we do here, they just cover what's said on the campaign trail. Come on, we've got 9 months left of this administration. We've got 9 months more, potentially, of $3.53 gasoline prices, of similarly high prices to heat your home in the northeast as the winter starts to come around again. We've still got time to do something if we've got a President to come and join us here and make some of the changes we need to make, Mr. Meek. 
   There is still time left. We say to our colleagues, don't pay attention to this presidential election at the detriment of the good work that we still can do. Now that the people have got back control of their House, taking it back from the oil companies that have controlled this agenda for so long, we can still make progress. We can still do something about these prices between now and the end of the year, Mr. Meek.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. You can't lose. And I wish it was more complicated. I wish legislating involved a little bit more mystery, but it doesn't. When you've got a choice to stand with regular, average, everyday folks who go to work every day trying to make a living and are playing by the rules or you stand with oil companies who make more money than they ever have, it's not a hard choice. You stand with regular, average, everyday people and the troubles they're going through. If you do that every time, you'll win every time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (GOVERNMENT FUNDING TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of this very important commonsense legislation, the Government Funding Transparency Act 2008. I would like to thank, of course, Chairman Towns for his work on the subcommittee, Chairman Waxman for his early and active support on this legislation, and especially to the ranking member, former chairman, Mr. Davis, who we were able to work directly together with over the past days and weeks to make this, as he states, I think a much stronger bill and one that answers many of the concerns that were raised by Mr. Davis, his office, and members of the minority of the committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, as described, the Government Funding Transparency Act will require that companies who receive more than 80 percent of their income in annual gross revenue from the Federal Government and more than $25 million worth of Federal work in any given fiscal year disclose the salaries of their most highly compensated employees. 
   This disclosure would be, as Representative Davis noted, posted on an existing OMB Web site, www.USAspending.gov, which was authorized as part of the Federal Funding, Accountability, and Transparency Act, a bipartisan measure passed by the 109th Congress. 
   As pointed out in a recent GAO report, buying services accounted for 60 percent of the total 2006 procurement dollars. And expenditures on security services, due to our engagement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, have forced those service expenditures to increase substantially. 
   In addition, according to that same Web site, we have seen an increasing number of contracts that weren't competed at all. In fact, in 2000, the amount of contracts not competed was $48 billion, just north of there; and in 2007, 7 years later, that number had ballooned to $112 billion. 
   And yet with such a substantial increase in government funding going to companies through no-bid processes, these companies are virtually subsidiaries of the United States government taking in 80 to 90, perhaps 100 percent of their revenues from U.S. taxpayers. We don't know enough about these tax companies. We don't know their management practices, their financial statements, or their employment policies. They are often highly and tightly held secrets not subject to public scrutiny. 
   So it is not surprising, as Chairman Waxman mentioned in October 2007 when the full Oversight and Government Reform Committee brought the CEO of Blackwater before us, one of the largest government contractors, taking in nearly 90 percent of their revenue contracts from Federal contracts, the CEO of that company, Eric Prince, refused to disclose to Congress the amount of profit that company makes or the amount of salary that he took in; yet despite the fact that 90 percent of that salary, 90 percent of the company's revenues, come from the United States' taxpayers. 
   It's our money. We deserve to know how it's being used. Regardless of your position on this war or any other war, we deserve to know whether or not public funds are being used to unjustly enrich government contractors. 
   But this principle, as Representative Davis and others pointed out, shouldn't just be applied to these types of private security or service contracts. It should be required of all entities that make the vast amount of their earnings, over 80 percent, from U.S. taxpayer dollars. And I would especially like to thank Representative Davis and Representative Foxx for their advocacy for this principle. 
   Importantly, it's important to note that this bill will actually only affect a limited number of companies, only those entities that subsist almost entirely on Federal money and only those that are not publicly traded, since public companies who do the lion's share, frankly, of Federal contracting, already disclose executive compensation information. 
   Mr. Speaker, profit is clearly a powerful motive, and this legislation does nothing to remove this incentive from our Federal contracting structure. But when it comes to private companies like Blackwater and others that would not exist if it wasn't for United States taxpayer dollars, the taxpayers and this Congress should have the information necessary to decide whether we've gone too far in padding the personal pockets of those who feed at the government trough. 
   As the late Supreme Court Justice Brandeis said, sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe this legislation will apply a little bit more sunlight to the Federal funding process. 
   Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their assistance on this legislation. And I know that this body will agree that as stewards of the people's treasure, we must do everything in our power to make sure it's being spent justly and responsibly. Again, I thank the chairman.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank the gentleman from Vermont. 
   I am here as a new Member of Congress because my constituents, like millions of others around the country, figured out what was happening here in the United States Congress for the last 12 years, that the priority was to pad the pockets of the oil companies at the detriment of American consumers. 
   They have also figured out what has been happening here on the floor of the House of Representatives for the last year-and-a-half. As this Democratic majority has passed legislation cracking down on price gougers, as this Democratic majority has passed legislation going after the multinational oil cartels, as this Democratic Congress has passed legislation repealing the billions of dollars in subsidies for the oil companies and turning them around into ordinary subsidies for ordinary Americans to try to put renewable resources and energy in their home, we have done it all without help from the President, we have done it all without almost any help from the Republicans. 
   That is why there are so many new Members of Congress ready to set a new direction on energy policy, and that is why it is time for the Republican minority to join the Democrat in setting a new energy policy for this country.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here again to spend a small amount of time on behalf of the Speaker's 30-something Working Group. I thank the Speaker of the House for allowing us this opportunity to come and share with our colleagues and share with the American people some, I think, very important thoughts on what is happening today. 
   It was interesting, I got to hear the end of our colleagues' remarks from across this side of the aisle; and one of the things they have asked of this Congress, and you hear it over and over again as we talk about this war in Iraq, is that we have to finish the job. And I think there is a question that has to come before that subject. We have got to start asking a little bit more in this place what that job is. I think that is what this debate is about, in part, this week, and the debate that we have renewed here since we have brought the House under new leadership. What is the job that we need to be doing in order to keep this country safe? 
   The answers to that have come in piecemeal fashion, in dribs and drabs over the past year. But maybe the most substantial piece of information, new information that helped us decide what that job is, was when we got last summer evidence through the National Intelligence Estimate that started to tell us that if our job is what we think it is, which is to do everything we can to keep this country safe, then our own Intelligence Community, the dozens of intelligence officers and organizations that contributed to that report came up with one unfortunately startling conclusion, and that was that our efforts in Iraq are on more days making us less safe as a Nation than making us more safe. 
   Why? Because we have not only destabilized the region, but we have created what that report called a cause celebre in that country, where extremists and terrorists around the world now see Iraq as their proving ground, as their training ground, and as their breeding ground. 
   So what we are debating here today is, I think, exactly the question that is posed by the other side of the aisle: Let's start talking about finishing that job. That job is ridding this world of fundamentalism and terrorism and extremism that poses a threat to us no matter where it is. It is not confined by the borders of some country in the Middle East that we occupy today. It doesn't know the borders of nation states. It poses a threat to us in all forms and from all places. 
   And so this debate this week, the supplemental bill which this House will vote on shortly, is about refocusing our mission, starting to deal with the realization and the reality of a conflict against terrorism that goes far beyond the borders of Iraq. 
   Part of what this bill is going to do is not only redeploy our forces, but also bring our troops out of harm's way in that country. You can't ask them to be a referee in what has become a religious conflict in that country, one that military leader after military leader, our own commanding general on the field there, General Petraeus, has said himself just earlier this month that there is no military solution to what has become a civil and religious conflict on the ground. 
   Job number one is to recognize the limits of our brave men and women in Iraq. They do an unbelievably admirable job every day. We are so grateful, especially those of us in the 30-something Working Group who consider those men and women our contemporaries, that they have chosen to defend this Nation so that others of us are able to serve this country in a different way. In order to honor them, in order to support those troops, we need to bring them out of a fight that our military forces cannot win alone. 
   But this is also about refocusing that effort, and I think that is what we have to keep on coming back to here, is there are fights still worth fighting in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, where we are on the verge of losing control of that country back to the very forces that gave cover and umbrage to the people who attacked this Nation on September 11. Remember, it was not Saddam Hussein that flew planes into tall buildings in New York, it was Osama bin Laden's organization called al Qaeda that used Afghanistan and the Taliban as its place and center of operation. And that country, as we have shifted more forces away from Afghanistan into Iraq, is now falling back into chaos, and part of our mission here has to be a realization that there are places worth fighting, and there are places in which military forces cannot quell ongoing violence. Afghanistan is still a fight worth fighting. 
   But it is also about focusing our efforts back here at home. And one of the secrets starting to come out, and thanks in part to the work of Representative

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, you are exactly right. There is a new day here. And I don't have the comparative experience that you do. I watched this place as an observer for the last several years. One of the reasons that I ran was you sit around in coffee shops and local community halls, and people generally don't pay much attention to the division of labor down here. I mean, people aren't necessarily talking about in their daily lives the co-equal branches of government. They are not thinking too much about the separation of powers. But you know what? They were forced to talk about it in the past several years, because people didn't understand how, in record numbers they were turning out, not only in elections, but in community meetings, to tell their Members of Congress that they needed a change in Iraq, because, not only did they have moral and intellectual objections to what we were doing over there, but they were talking to the families of those troops who were being sent over there without body armor. 18 months it took until our forces over in Iraq had the body armor that they needed. They were looking at statistics like the one we just found out earlier this month which said that 88 percent of the National Guard and Reserve troops are so poorly equipped that they are rated not ready by the military; that we have not one active duty reserve brigade in the United States that is considered combat ready. And so people out there were hearing over and over again from the families of the troops, the troops themselves, which was backing up their own instincts about the backwards nature of our policy in Iraq. And they wondered where Congress was. And they watched this place sort of shut down for a number of years. And they couldn't understand why their elected Members of Congress weren't standing up and asking some questions. I mean, at the very least, asking some questions about what this president was doing over there. 
   Mr. Speaker, there were six opportunities since this war began for this Congress, on supplemental appropriations bills, to stand up and try to perform some perfunctory oversight over this war; four emergency 
   supplemental bills, two emergency spending funds in the Department of Defense authorization bills, six times this Congress, under Republican leadership, had an opportunity to stand up and say, you know what? We are going to give you some more money to conduct this war, but we are going to put some strings on it. We are going to try to check your authority in some even elementary way. Not once. All six times this Congress stood down. Despite a lot of yelling and screaming from one-half of this chamber, this Congress stood down and gave President Bush virtually every single thing he wanted. 
   Now, listen. I understand you might have been lulled into a sense of complacency here. This Congress heard from this president over and over again that things were going well, things were going fine, everything was going to be better. We find out now that all along this administration knew that things weren't going well. In fact, they knew things were pretty terrible on the ground and they were plotting this new strategy, a very different one than I think the American people intended on Election Day. They wanted a new course of direction in Iraq. They didn't necessarily think that that policy was going to be escalation. I think they were counting on de-escalation. It was a slightly new direction, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. 
   But here is the thing, is that people in this country became constitutional scholars over the last couple of years because they started scratching their heads when they picked up the paper every morning as this war was going nowhere but downhill, and there was deafening silence coming from Congress. And so there is a lot of commotion in here about this emergency supplemental bill because it has got some policy in it. We are actually, instead of rubber stamping the President's requests, we are actually saying, if we are going to give you another dime for this war, then we are going to make sure that you honor the will of the American people, that you step up to the plate and listen to the foreign policy community that this Nation has expressed through the Iraq Study Group; that you listen to your own generals, many of which who will tell you over and over again, that though there might be a political or diplomatic solution to what happens on the ground in Iraq, that it cannot be a purely military solution; that you start listening to the families of those troops who have cried out for years to equip them when they go over, to make sure that they are protected when they serve overseas, and to make sure that their health care is taken care of when they come back; that we actually conduct this war, redeploy our forces in a responsible manner. For the first time, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, this Congress is stepping up to the plate and actually conducting that type of oversight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Reclaiming my time for a moment, in Connecticut we have the same problem that you talk about. It takes hundreds of days for veterans simply to get qualified for the benefits once they return. I mean, of all the benefit programs that this government runs, it would seem that the veterans program would be the easiest to qualify people for, right? Because what is the qualification? You served in the military. You fought for this country. There is a record of it. It is not hard to find. And yet we have constructed so much bureaucracy and so much red tape. 
   And I understand that a lot of the folks in the Department are trying to do a lot with not enough funding to do the job, but it is time that we cut through it because we shouldn't be talking about a system that is of inferior care or equal care to that of what you or I get or people in this community get. Our veterans' health care system should be the gold standard of care in this country. We should accept nothing less than the best that our health care system can offer. And we know not only through the recent revelations at Walter Reed, but also simply in the conversations that we have door to door. 
   It was amazing to me in this last election, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, as I went door to door over the summer and fall. I did it almost every night, and almost without exception if you knocked on the door of a veteran, someone that had served in World War II through the more recent conflicts, almost without exception health care came up, whether it was a personal problem they had had with the system or a problem that a family member or one of their brothers and sisters in arms had encountered when they came back. Almost every single veteran brought that up because they have a notion, and it is exactly right, that when they come back here, their community should be able to stand up for them and make sure that they continue to be healthy, certainly make sure that the injuries they received in defending this country are treated expeditiously, efficiently, and with the best care possible. 
   And so it was remarkable to me how often this issue came up, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, just as you talked to people door to door. It was so real and so palpable because to the people who have served this country, there is no greater dishonor, and I am speaking as someone who has not served, but who has had the honor to know many that have, no greater dishonor to them than to come back to a country that doesn't express a deep and daily sense of gratitude for that service. 
   Ms. Wasserman Schultz, for all the bad news that I heard on the campaign trail, the good news is this bill that we will vote on will honor that service, one of the biggest infusions of funding support for the veterans' health care system that this country has ever seen. And I can just hope that when I go back out there this summer, when I am going out just to knock on doors to check on people in a noncampaign environment, that you will hear a very different story, that they will feel finally their stories are being heard. 
   I yield to Ms. Wasserman Schultz.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Reclaiming my time just for one point. Before coming over here, I was reading a really interesting front-page article, and I think it was a recent Newsweek or Time, and it was entitled, sort of, The Downfall of the Right, and it was talking about how the sort of conservative ideology has really fallen by the wayside in the past several years. And one of the things it had talked about was that when the class of 1994 was ushered into office, there was a sort of purity to their ideology. You disagreed with a lot of the things they stood for, but they did come in here as reformers. I mean, they did come in here and set a whole new bunch of rules for this House, how this place was governed. They changed the franking rules. They put in term limits. And you could have disagreements with some of the results of that ideology, but they did come in here with some real ideas rooted in some intellectual discussion about how you change Congress. 
   And what this article was sort of pointing out was that over time, over the last 12 years, the ruling party of this Congress became one that was guided by a set of ideas to one that was guided by a collection of special interests; that it was simply kind of an amalgamation of different lobbyists and different industries that would sort of pull and push for control over this place, and it stopped being one that was guided by any real ideas about how to move this country forward. 
   And it was an incredibly interesting survey on how the Republican Party has changed over the years. And if you want to know why their reign ended after 12 years, in 
   part I think it is a recognition from the American people that this place stopped being about ideas and in the end started being about those special interests.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, you talk to Members on the other side of the aisle, and I think they share that same concern for veterans. I mean, they do. We are not suggesting that anybody in this Chamber was sitting here intentionally deciding that they were going to create the situations that happened on the ground at Walter Reed. It is just a matter of choices. It is a matter of the choices that were made here. And whether they were made consciously or unconsciously, it resulted in an abysmal situation for veterans. 
   The choices that ended up getting made here when it came to the fiscal situation in this country was to hand out massive, unprecedented tax breaks to the top 1 percent of income earners in this Nation while we were fighting a war. While we were fighting a war. It never happened in this country. We have never asked this country to go into war without asking the entire country to sacrifice in order to pay for it, because here is the thing: The cost of the war isn't just the guns and the troops and the tanks and the armor. It is the health care for the people that come back here afterwards. The cost of the war is the whole thing. 
   And so we ended up short-changing our troops and short-changing the people that came back here because we decided that what was more important was to hand out another round of tax breaks, this last one to the persons in our districts, the rare folks who are lucky enough to make $1 million a year. They got $40,000 back from that tax cut. 
   I know if I showed up at their door and asked them, if you had to choose, if you had to choose as someone who is taking in income of $1 million or more a year, would you take the full value of that tax cut if you knew that that was going to leave the decrepit conditions that we have found at Walter Reed, that that was going to result in waiting times of up to a year for services for the men and women that fight to protect us overseas? I know what their answer would be, and it should have been the answer of this Congress. 
   It now does get to be the answer. The answer now gets to be that our priority is going to be making sure that those folks are taken care of when they come home. 
   And do you know what? We have already voted for tax cuts in this Congress. You can do both. You can still find a way to provide targeted tax relief to people who need it, as the small business tax cut bill here in the House a couple of weeks ago, and honor those commitments.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, I think it serves us well to sort of try to outline for people why this is such a big deal. Why do you have a senior member of the Republican leadership coming as close as you can come to calling for the resignation of the Republican sitting U.S. Attorney General? Why do you have the papers filled with this day after day? Why do you have the Judiciary Committee going to the unfortunate but necessary step of actually having to subpoena members of the administration to come before us? 
   It is pretty simple. If you are an average Joe out there, you want to know that if the guy next door to you commits a really bad crime, that he is going to go to jail, no matter who his political friends are, no matter what political connections he has; that justice should be blind. Justice should certainly be blind to politics. 
   Now, we can freely admit that when Bill Clinton came into office, he sent out notices that he was intending to get rid of all of the prosecutors and everybody was going to have to reapply.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. And there is the rub, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, is that it is one thing to decide to clean house and say okay, everybody goes. I am not going to examine all of your pasts and your political connections and whether you have done what you have asked, because I haven't served one day. I am just going to come in as a new president, which is their prerogative, and just clean house. 
   That not what happened here. In fact, there is a reason why somebody within the White House actually recommended that they fire everybody, because they knew that if you are going to start firing prosecutors, people that are given by the public and by this government the very grave responsibilities of carrying out our system of justice, then you better not inject any politics into it, because the worst thing that can happen to the American justice system, and for all of the inefficiencies of government, one thing we can stand very proudly by, is our system of blind justice. 
   We do have a system of justice that by and large makes decisions without political influence. If you are my neighbor and you did something wrong, no matter who you know, now matter how powerful you are, now matter how much money you have, you are going to pay for it. You 
   are going to be held accountable for it. 
   But if prosecutors throughout this country start having to look over their shoulder every time that they decide to try that rich guy or that influential guy or politically powerful guy, and they have to wonder whether the consequence of that decision is going to be the political boss somewhere decides their job shouldn't be their's anymore, then that has immense, immense consequences for our system of government and our system of justice. 
   I know it is just eight. I know it is just eight. But if that message that those eight guys, men and women, those eight men and women, who for some reason displayed some act of political disloyalty to the President, don't get to hold their job anymore, then that has an unbelievable chilling effect on the rest of our prosecutors, and I think it has dire consequences for our system of justice.  
   So it is a big deal, and it should be a big deal. I hope that the President sees the light of day and decides to put the people that were responsible for this decision before Congress so that everything can be aired out. 
   His offer now is obviously certainly not acceptable. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee today said, Representative Conyers, said we might as well go down to the bar down the street and have this conversation, because that is about as much meaningful information as you are going to get out of that conversation.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I think, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, it is part of a pattern. Political influence in the judiciary, we are finding that prosecutors are being fired for not being loyal to the President. We find it in some of our scientific agencies, where basic scientific accepted data is being suppressed by the administration because it doesn't meet their political goals within some of our medical approval agencies and boards. Decisions are being made based on ideology, rather than on science. 
   We have had hearings on a lot of these subjects in the committee that I sit on, the Government Reform Committee, and you actually get some indignation expressed, as you said, from both sides of the aisle, from Republicans and Democrats on this issue. I think there is a bipartisan frustration at the administration's willingness to inject politics into a lot of places where politics have no business. 
   But at the same time that I accept there is criticism coming from both sides, I also note that there were a lot of things we probably would never have found out about unless we were asking the questions, and the questions weren't getting asked for a very long time. They are getting asked now. Maybe the answers are terribly palatable.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, right now there are millions of patients and families around this country who are too scared to talk about the mental illness they are dealing with. They are too scared to go and seek treatment for that mental illness.     
   And there are millions more in this country who are living in denial, thinking they can just wish away their debilitating illness. 
   The legislation that we are passing today, that States like Connecticut and others around the country have been passing for the past 10 years, it is going to do a lot to get treatment to those who have insurance. 
   But I think just as importantly, it says this, it puts the full power of the United States Congress behind the effort to lift that veil of shame and secrecy that too often visits families and patients who are living with mental illness. Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad are true heroes to those families dealing with mental illness today, and on their behalf, I thank them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support today of S. 377, the United States and Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program Act. 
   Poland, as has been said by both of our previous speakers, has demonstrated an amazing commitment both to democratic values and to their role as an ally of the United States. I remember, as a teenager, if I might date myself, watching in rapt attention as Lech Walesa and his solidarity movement defeated the Communist Party in Poland in parliamentary elections, and then watching Walesa go on to become president of Poland in 1990. That solidarity movement heralded the collapse of communism across Eastern Europe. 
   This United States and Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange will allow American students to learn much more about this very important heritage of our neighbors in Eastern Europe. Eligible participants in the program will attend a public high school for one academic year and enroll in courses that place a particular emphasis on their host country's history, the establishment of its Constitution, the nation's birth and its political development. 
   Though my last name might not give a hint to this, I am a very proud Polish American. My mother's family emigrated from Poland to New Britain, Connecticut some generations ago. And if you have a chance to drive through the great State of Connecticut and you're looking for a great place to grab a bite to eat, stop off in New Britain, Connecticut. Go to Broad Street, where we still have Polish language storefronts selling some of the best Polish food that you'll find in eastern Connecticut. 
   And I appreciate the gentleman spending a little time remarking about General Pulaski. We take that legacy very seriously in New Britain. We still celebrate Pulaski Day with a Pulaski parade that runs not very far from Pulaski School and ends up at the Pulaski Club. So we are very serious students of Polish history in New Britain, Connecticut, and I can't think of a better program than one such as this that will allow children of a community such as ours in New Britain, whose forefathers came from that country, to be able to go there and strengthen their appreciation for that culture and that country's heritage. 
   I'd like to thank Representative Visclosky, especially, and Representative Emanuel for bringing this legislation before the House floor today and, of course, Senator Lugar for being such a champion in the Senate. This will mean a great deal to our small community of New Britain and the entire Polish American community in the Fifth District of Connecticut.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you for letting me come down here for just a couple of seconds and add my voice to the chorus here. 
   You are absolutely right. When you are talking about something as essential as gas for people driving to and from work bringing their kids back and forth to school, it's not an optional expenditure. Now, in Connecticut we love to say there is another choice, people  could get on some train or get on some bus, but they don't exist. They don't exist because unfortunately in some parts of this country we have neglected our mass transit infrastructure, and we have forced people to rely on their vehicles to get themselves around. 
   I just saw a statistic today that said in Waterbury, Connecticut, in the heart of my district, that one in six people in public housing are spending 66 percent of their income on rent, 66 percent of their income on rent. There is not much left for food. There is not much left for medicine. We know they have to pay more for medicine because less of them have health care. There is certainly not a lot left for transportation costs. This is hitting at the heart of the American middle class, at the heart of the American working class. 
   In just a second we will show a chart that would suggest that the reason for these increased prices at the pump is certainly not that the oil companies are crying poverty, certainly not because the bottom lines of American oil companies and national oil companies are hurting. It is hard to understand with the record profits, year after year. The last 3 or 4 years, every year, comes new record profits for these oil companies. How on Earth can we continue to see these prices go up? 
   I just want to say one more thing that was touched on. We have to talk about what national independence means, dependence on oil means for national security as well, over 170,000 barrels of oil from Saudi Arabia in 2006 and other OPEC countries. If you want to talk about why we can't bring a country like Saudi Arabia to the table, have a conversation about why they are creating a society in which their most marginalized members feel that their only resort is to extremism and violence; if you want to find out why we can't hold some of these Middle Eastern countries accountable for the societies that they are creating and the terrorism they are helping fuel, it's because we rely on their oil. It's because in the end we can't make them angry, because if we do, they are going to cut off the food that our cars eat. 
   Now, energy independence is about lowering gas prices. Antitrust legislation, price-gouging legislation, is about getting to the heart of the problem for middle-class consumers and drivers, the prices at the pump. But ultimately we have to figure out how to walk away from some of these quagmires we are in with countries that provide oil to us. We have got to understand that energy independence is about doing the right thing for middle-class families, to minivan moms. 
   It is also about doing the right thing for national security. It's also making sure that my future kids and grandkids are going to grow up in a society that's safe. That's why it's a triple whammy. Energy independence is about lowering energy prices, it's about cleaning up our environment, and it's also about national security. That's why I had to drag Mr. Ryan up to the rostrum to allow me get down here and say my 2 cents on this. 
   This is what the Democratic majority is going to deliver. It's going to go from a time when we could complain about gas prices and not see much action at all from Congress to a time now where we are still going to complain about it, but we are actually going to have a group of people here in the House and Senate and step up to the plate and do something about it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Mr. Welch. I just want to point out to the Speaker and the Chamber that Mr. Welch just used a word with six syllables in it, oligopolistic. We have freshmen that are courageous, we have freshmen to take on big industry, but we also have some pretty smart freshmen too in this case. So I don't want that to go unnoticed. 
   Mr. Welch, let's call it for what it was. For a long time this Congress was run by the oil industry. Whatever they asked for, they got here. It was sort of a sense that if you did really, really well in this economy and you came and asked for something from this Congress, then they were going to give it to you. You were going to be rewarded, in essence, for coming out on top of the heap. The same could be said for the pharmaceutical industry, the same could be said for multimillionaires, as was the case for the oil companies. 
   If you probably turned on the television and you watched people get up here on the other side of the aisle for the last several years, you probably heard them say a lot things like we are saying. You probably heard them complain about gas prices. You probably heard them say that they were going to do something about it. 
   Well, they didn't. They didn't do a single thing about it, and we see the evidence of it today. Gas prices spiraling higher and higher. Mr. Perlmutter is going to show a chart here which shows the average price of a gallon today pretty soon. You are going to see the average price for today is on an 8 1/2 by 11 piece of paper sort of precariously stuck on to the poster board. Why? Because, guess what? It moves every single day. We have to change that piece of paper on that chart every day as the price goes higher and higher and higher. 
   So what happened when a bunch of us went out there and decided that we were going to come to Washington to try to change the priorities here, do what Mr. Welch said, which is finally put regular middle-class folks, working-class folks in charge of government again, was that we started matching action with words. 
   We are going to get up here and talk about how gas prices are hurting regular Americans, how they have less and less ability to spend money on other family needs, but then we are going to go and do something about it. 
   We started with the price gouging legislation. We are going to take on some pretty important legislation to end the antitrust exemptions for OPEC and international oil cartels. 
   Then we are going to take on the big enchilada. We are going to start making this country energy independent. We know that is a triple whammy. That is about gas prices and energy prices, it is about making energy more affordable for people, that is about cleaning up our environment, and it is also about national security. 
   That is what happened here for a long time, was that the inaction wasn't just about trying to stem the bleeding in one particular summer, it was about avoiding a problem that could have been solved 5, 10 years ago, if they had started doing the things that we are about to do to invest in alternative and renewable energy. 
   So I am so proud to stand here with members of the freshman class, because we can stand here and talk about what we want to do to start transforming this society back so that the priorities of regular middle-class Americans matter again. But we also need to do something about it. 
   We also get to stand here and cast some votes that have not been cast in this Congress for a very long time, and that is what makes me especially proud to be a member of this freshman class, certainly proud to be a member alongside my friend from Iowa, Mr. BRUCE BRALEY, who I will turn the microphone over to at this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   My friend who just spoke and those on the other side of the aisle are fond often of quoting our Founding Fathers. I'm not a student of James Madison or some of his brethren, but I would think that they would be turning in their graves if they watched how this House worked for the last 12 years. 
   I come here as a freshman Member and I am speaking from what I saw from the outside. I am sure this analogy has been used here on the House floor over the course of the last 10 hours, but listening to folks on the other side of the aisle, my Republican friends, complain about the issues of fiscal responsibility and transparency has got to conjure up the image of the bull in the china shop. If you let a bull into a china shop for 12 years and then he just tears down everything off the walls, he knocks over every case, he breaks every single glass in there. And then in this case, he runs out of the china shop and says, Well, why don't you go in there and clean that up? Why doesn't somebody go clean up the mess that we just made? 
   That's what happened in this House from those of us who watched it from afar on the issues of transparency and on fiscal responsibility. 
   You know, it's interesting. I sat here last night being called back and forth to the floor for, I guess, eight different motions to shut down this House and to stop the Homeland Security bill from going forward, and I wondered why hadn't that happened in the last 12 years. Why wasn't there a night while we were wasting billions of dollars on this floor in Iraq, $9 billion that we found out are totally unaccounted for? Why didn't we shut down the House one night to talk about that? 
   As thousands of FEMA trailers were stranded on open lots in the southeastern United States, why didn't we shut down this House for one night to talk about that over the last 12 years? While $70 billion in corporate giveaways were handed out through the Medicare bill, why didn't we shut down this House to talk about that? 
   Millions of dollars in no-bid contracts. Record deficits year after year. Why on earth wasn't this House shut down like it was last night over the last 12 years? 
   The American people are probably asking that same question, and there is probably one answer: This House changed hands. There is a different party in charge. And so now there is a very different standard that applies here. The questions that should have been asked for 12 years, well, now in a political context they are being asked today. 
   I also don't shy away, Mr. Chairman, from the fact that as a new Member, I'm also one of the younger Members here. So I kind of feel that I have an obligation to talk for the millions of my generation that have just become utterly turned off to politics. And when they look at a House being shut down overnight into today, who knows how many more days, to prevent a fairly nonpartisan Homeland Security bill that will protect them, that will protect their parents, their neighbors, that will make their communities a safer place, they know this is about politics, not policy. 
   And so I think about all of those people who, as they watch this process unfold, are losing their faith in this institution. As angry as I am about the double standard that's applied, about the hypocrisy that's exercised on this House, this House thick with irony over the past several days, I think also about what people think when they see members of the Republican Party playing politics with the issue of homeland security. 
   Now, we hear claims that this isn't obstruction. We don't have a problem  with slowing down the House to talk about this. Well, I would say this. I think that my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, they vastly underestimate the gullibility of the American people. They also vastly overestimate the amount of patience that the American public has left for the games that are being played here on the House floor. 
   We have an obligation to do all the things that we were sent here to do, to fund homeland security, to protect this Nation. We also have an obligation to live up to the expectations that people had of this Congress when it changed hands, to take the politics out of this House and to start doing the right thing for the American people, not the right thing for either political party. 
   I would ask we don't go through tonight what we did last night, that we start doing what's right for the American people on policy rather than what's right for the Republican minority on politics.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank the Speaker and I thank the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, for once again allowing the 30-Something Working Group to come to the floor tonight and share with the American people and share with you, Mr. Speaker, some of the most important and pressing issues that are before this Congress right now, and to do that in part from a perspective of some of the hardworking individuals across this country who are looking for help from this Congress, who are looking for a Congress for the first time in a long time to start standing up for average, hardworking, everyday men and women who have been getting the short shrift from this government for a very long time. 
   I am soon to be joined by some of my colleagues, potentially Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek and Mr. Altmire to discuss some of the issues confronting us today. 
   We will try, on behalf of Mr. Altmire and Mr. Meek, and certainly Mr. Ryan, to make as few Halloween analogies as potentially positive. We have exhausted that already this evening, and we are guilty on both sides of the aisle, so we won't talk about things being frightening or scary, at least until Mr. Ryan gets here. He may not be able to resist. 
   It always amuses me when we are down here for one of these 30-Something Working Group hours, and a lot of times we are preceded by The Truth Squad or some of our friends on the Republican side of the aisle. Often their mantra is to preach to the Democratic side of the aisle and preach to the American people the values of fiscal responsibility. 
   Tonight we heard a little bit about it from our friends from the other side of the aisle chastising Chairman Rangel and his new very progressive tax cut which will bring tax relief to millions of working-class families. We heard them talk about how it is time this Congress got spending under control as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are short memories on the other side of the aisle, short memories which seems to only go back 10 months. They do not go back 3, or 6 or 12 years ago when Republicans took control of this Congress. If they did, they may have some recollection of the fact that they had 12 years of control. The Republicans had 12 years of responsibility over the Federal budget to get some fiscal sense and some fiscal discipline in the Federal budget. 
   I stand here as a representative from a pretty fiscally conservative district. I represent northwestern Connecticut which is filled with Democrats and Republicans and Independents alike who care about the management of their Federal budget. They care about what this government does with their Federal dollars. 
   They may be sort of a more socially liberal or moderate district, but when it comes to dollars and cents, people in my district care about fiscal responsibility. So I think one of the reasons I replaced a 24-year incumbent is because after a while, people in my little corner of Connecticut and from across this country woke up to the fact that while on the floor of the House of Representatives or back in their districts or on the talk shows or the cable news networks, the Republicans said over and over again that they valued fiscal responsibility, but when they had a chance to pass budgets to back up that talk, when they had a chance to get the deficit under control, not only did they not do it, they made it worse. 
   This President with a Republican-controlled Congress in the House and the Senate, with a Republican-controlled administration inherited a budget surplus and turned that in just a few years into a record budget deficit. A chart that Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan have shown on this House floor year after year after year says it pretty well. President Bush during the time he has been in office, all of that,  all of those budgets passed with Republican Houses and Republican Senates, in the time he has been in Congress, he has doubled the amount of foreign-held debt, doubled the amount of borrowing we have done which has been bought up by countries other than the United States. 
   It took 42 Presidents 224 years to build up $1 trillion of foreign debt. And it has taken this President 6 years to go to $1.19 trillion. And this chart is a little old, too. It's even worse than that now. So it amuses me, Mr. Speaker, and a lot amuses me in Washington. As a freshman Member, I find a lot of things to sort of step back and laugh about. But to get lectured by a Republican, now in the minority, about fiscal responsibility, when it was their party in control of this House and in control of the Senate and running the administration that put us in the situation we are in today. So now it is our job to try to clean it up. 
   When I go back to my district, Mr. Speaker, I have a hard time explaining why some of the simple, commonsense measures that we have undertaken in this Congress weren't done years, decades ago. I use for an example what is called the pay-as-you-go rule. It is kind of the rule that most families and businesses use every day, which is we are only going to spend money that we have. We are going to put money out at the same rate money is coming in. 
   For some reason when the Republicans were running this House for the last 12 years, that wasn't the rule of the day. In fact, regularly they were spending American taxpayer dollars that they didn't have, that weren't in the bank. That is what rolled up these deficits that were rolling in at about $300 billion a year. It's spending more money than we were taking in that is now responsible for a Federal deficit that balloons over $1.2 trillion. 
   The majority, I am not sure the majority but a large amount of that deficit, that debt, those notes, those obligations being held by China and Japan and OPEC nations, all of these countries that we are sitting across the negotiating table from, being largely compromised by the fact that we owe a large amount of money that we are asking for policy considerations from. 
   So we decided, let's do something simple. When Speaker Pelosi came to the Speaker's chair, to the dais you sit on right now, Mr. Speaker, she decided in the first 100 hours we are here, let's say that every obligation that we decide to commit ourselves to, every new spending bill that may come before this House, let's within that bill explain exactly how we are going to pay for it. When I explain that back home, when I go to my Rotary groups or my Chamber of Commerce meetings and I explain that Congress now has decided to only spend what we have, and if we spend anything more in that bill we are going to tell you how we are going to spend it, people look at me with these blank stares saying on the inside and on the outside: Why didn't you do this before? 
   This Republican Party that told us for years they were the party of fiscal responsibility in fact was running this budget into the ground; and could have, just by adopting a pretty simple pay-as-you-go rule, could have exerted some discipline on this House which was lacking almost completely for 12 years, now finally here. 
   I am pretty proud of Chairman Rangel for his frankness as he was sort of mockingly given credit for earlier today, because the bill that he has put before us, the bill that fixes the alternative minimum tax, and I know we will spend some time talking about some really important topics as we head into the holidays regarding food safety and toy safety and drug safety, but first I want to talk about the alternative minimum tax because you didn't hear a word about it, you didn't hear anybody talking about it, at least when I was listening to the other side of the aisle, you didn't hear anybody talking about the very reason Chairman Rangel and the Ways and Means Committee have dedicated themselves to tax relief because we are on the verge of the biggest tax increase on the middle class in perhaps the history of American tax policy courtesy of President Bush and the previous Republican majority here.     
   So guess what? Yet again, it's left to this Democratic Congress, the New Direction Congress, to clean up yet another mess that was created by this prior Congress. 
   We're already trying to do it when it comes to children's health care. We're trying to reorder our energy policy. We're trying to clean up the ethical malaise that has settled on this town. So now we are also going to do it when it comes to this issue as well, to the alternative minimum tax. 
   In 1969, when the alternative minimum tax was passed by Congress it was pretty simple. They said, listen, with of the different tax loopholes and deductions and credits and offsets that people can take, there's going to be some people who make a lot of money who may be able, through creative tax planning, to avoid paying taxes to the United States Government. That's not right. That's not right. 
   And so in 1969, they passed a complicated formula called the alternative minimum tax, and in 1970, about 20,000 of the richest Americans paid the alternative minimum tax. Makes sense. Makes sense. Make sure that everybody pays some minimum level of taxation, especially those folks up at the top of the income stratosphere who have creative ways to avoid that tax situation. 
   Okay. So 20,000 people pay it in 1970, but guess what? Because Congress, after Congress fails to index the alternative minimum tax, in 2006, 3.5 million people end up paying it, and all of the sudden it's not just the tax paid by the really, really rich people. It's a tax that starts to get paid for by people that look and sound and make incomes like you and I, and as we look at what happens in the next couple of years, it gets even worse. 
   By 2010, if we don't fix the alternative minimum tax, the AMT as people call it around here. I figured out in my short time here that everything has got an acronym, everything; even things where the word itself is shorter than the acronym, that's got an acronym. So this has got an acronym. The alternative minimum tax is called the AMT. 
   By 2010, just 2 1/2 short years away, if we don't fix this, if we don't clean up the mess that this last Congress created on the AMT, 80 percent of people that make $100,000, in Connecticut that's a middle-income family, 80 percent of people that make $100,000 are going to be paying the alternative minimum tax, and it just gets worse from there.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. We've got to decide how we're going to fix it. Everybody on this side of the aisle and some of our friends in the Senate can sort of live in this. 
   Fantasyland where we're just going to do more of the same; let's fix this alternative minimum tax for middle-class taxpayers, and guess what, let's just do it by borrowing more money. That's the way I think a lot of people in the place would like to do, more of the same, borrow money in order to cut taxes. 
   You can't do that anymore. You can't do that for the next generation is going to end up paying all that money back. You can't do that because you can't exacerbate the existing trend, which has countries like Japan and China and OPEC nations, and Taiwan and Korea and Hong Kong and Germany owning all this American currency. 
   You've got to stop this. You've got to stop the madness of borrowing. So the way you do that is to be honest about how you pay for the alternative minimum tax, and we're going to have to deal with some choices here. 
   The Republican Congress for years made this choice. They could have fixed the alternative minimum tax. Instead, they gave away more and more and more tax breaks to their super, ultrarich friends and their oil companies and drug companies and everybody else who did well here. We're going to make some different choices. 
   We're going to actually balance the Federal budget in 5 years. We're going to give some tax relief, badly needed, to the middle class, and you know what? We're going to stop that policy of giving away tax breaks to folks that don't need it.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I really appreciate the analogy Mr. Ryan makes about the choices we're making. We don't want to borrow any money. We want to actually be honest about how you spend. I think it's a great point to make again that this administration and the Congress that used to control this body was making this choice.     
   You sort of put it to the average American living in Ohio or suburban Pennsylvania or Connecticut that if you had a choice to spend money and give an extra $100,000 to that really rich guy who lives up on the hill or you could spend that money to make sure that the Sponge Bob toys that your kid is playing with don't have levels of lead 100 times over the Federal standard, I mean, that's kind of a laughable question, like the premise, you know, you would be laughed out of the room by most parents for that. Of course you should put more testers and more product safety employees in the Federal Government. 
   What we find out, when the head of this organization, when the director of the Consumer Product Safety Commission comes and testifies about what's going on, why do we have 20 million toys manufactured in China that were recalled this summer? Why do we have that long list that Mr. Ryan puts up? Why do we have just recently a press release dated today from the Consumer Product Safety Commission calling for a recall of these fake teeth that kids use, and a lot of them use on Halloween. Well, it turns out that about 43,000 of these fake teeth that kids are using out there have levels of lead that might be as much as 100 times over the Federal standard. 
   I mean, this is dangerous stuff. 
   So Ms. Nord comes before the Congress to be held accountable, first time that's ever happened on this issue, I mean, finally we are bringing these bureaucrats in front of Congress to ask these questions, and she says that she doesn't have the resources to do her job and that there is one, quote, lonely toy tester in her office, one lonely toy tester who is responsible for the flood of millions, probably hundreds of millions of toys coming in from China. 
   When you think of the choices that have been made to give these massive tax breaks to the wealthy, to oil companies, to put our troops in harm's way in Iraq for a policy that's making this country less safe, not more safe, and what we got for all of that was one person who is charged with making sure that our kids don't get poisoned by toys over here, it boggles the mind.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let me give you a quote that comes from one of these hearings and you decide, we will let the public decide and our colleagues decide 
   whether or not this is good information that maybe we should have out there. 
   David Kessler, who is the former FDA official and one of the acknowledged experts on food safety in this country, Kessler says, ``We have no structure,'' in this country, ``for preventing food-borne illness. The reality is that there is currently no mandate, no leadership, no resources, nor scientific research base for prevention of food safety problems.'' 
   I think that's probably information that we should know, that one of the leading officials, one of the leading experts on food safety and food regulation in this country believes that we have absolutely no ability to control the quality of food coming into this country. 
   He knows what we know, the amount of inspections has dropped precipitously. We did about 50,000 food inspections in 1972. We do 5,000 now in 2000. We have dropped by 90 percent over the last 30 years the amount of food inspections we do. 
   We have these experts out there who had these opinions that they couldn't share because Congress wasn't doing oversight. Congress wasn't bringing before it the people who knew what was going on out there, knew the risk that the American public was being put at, they weren't being asked to come here and express those opinions to Congress. We are getting them now.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Now that we are starting to shed some light on what's going on out there, the charts that you put up about the amount of imports into this country for unsafe toys and the incredibly quick decline and the amount of people that are charged with inspecting those toys, I mean, that's out there now. You would think that now that we finally shed some sunlight on the issue of unsafe toys and unsafe food and the number of people that are at risk and the problems with our current regulatory processes, that we could all come together and work on this now. 
   But what happens? Yet more obstinacy from this administration, yet more closing of their eyes and their ears to this problem. The Senate and the House are both working on reform pieces of legislation that will give new powers, new duties and new resources to these commissions, in particular to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
   That same director that we are talking about, the person that runs the Consumer Product Safety Commission, came and testified before Congress that she doesn't want any more powers. She doesn't want any more protection that she can afford the consumers, that she would rather see the status quo, effectively, is what her testimony is. Even now that the American public has awoken to this problem, that this Congress finally is talking about it, we still have an administration that says, I don't want to do anything more. I don't want any more power. I don't want any more resources. I just want things to be as they are. I want to close my eyes and my ears and hope the problem goes away. That can't be how we do things going forward.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let me read, Mr. Meek, to you from a, you guys all say third-party verifiers, right? Validators. Kind of means the same thing. Half a dozen, six. So this is from a report called Toxic Trade done by the Campaign for America's Future, and we'll go back to this problem that we have at the CPSC regarding toy testers. It says this: The agency's toy testing department, it's lab hasn't been modernized since 1975, and the department consists of one man who drops toys on the floor in his office to see if they'll break. 
   I mean, that's it. There you go. I mean, that's the toy testing regimen of the United States Government is a guy, and I'm sure he's a wonderfully nice guy. But he sits in his office at his desk and he takes toys and he drops them on the floor to see if they'll break. I mean, that's what we got now. That's what you got for these record deficits, for all the spending in Iraq, for breaks for oil companies and drugs companies. You've got one guy who drops toys from his desk and sees if they'll break.

   As the Member of Congress who now has the honor of serving New Britain, Connecticut, I can tell you, as someone who didn't know Governor Meskill and Congressman Meskill personally, that he loved the City of New Britain and the City of New Britain loved him back. He earned the nickname of ``Tough Tommy'' during his time in the Governor's mansion when he turned a very large deficit into a very large surplus in a short amount of time. As you have heard, there was hardly an office in Connecticut in any of the branches that Governor Meskill did not hold.  
   New Britain is better off for having him. It bears his stamp. We all stand today to mourn his loss and send our condolences to the family.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, Mr. Ryan. I am nothing if not a fan of New England etiquette. I would let the gentleman speak for as long as he wishes, but he makes great points. 
   The American people sent this new Congress in order to set a new direction. They didn't imagine on election day that new direction was putting more troops in harm's way in the middle of a civil war. The word ``escalation'' was not in their vocabulary when they conceived of what that new direction would be. 
   They believed it was about time to start listening to the bipartisan foreign policy community as represented by the Iraq Study Group Report, of the record number of generals coming back and telling us we needed to start setting a new course. They believed that new direction was about redeploying our forces and bringing the National Guard home. 
   I hope tonight we will talk about how stressed the National Guard is, bringing the troops back home to protect ourselves on our homefront, and being able to respond to the natural disasters and emergencies that are all too frequent on our own shore, and begin to focus on places where we can still win. 
   Afghanistan, a fight that is taking it right to the insurgency that attacked this country, taking it right to the training ground of al Qaeda, the place where Osama bin Laden trained and prepared his forces to attack this country. Certainly we can win there, but it is time we start recognizing what that new direction has to be. 
   It was amazing when I listened to the Republican leader say a week or so ago, and I am paraphrasing, but the thought was that the Republicans were willing to hear out the President's plan to escalate the war for a period of time. But, say, by the fall or later this year if it wasn't working, it was time for the President to propose plan B. 
   I am not sure how anyone who has been watching this play out for the last 4 years could still believe we are on plan A. We are not plan A or B, we are on like plan triple R right now. We have tried everything. And guess what, every new strategy, every new approach that we take based solely on military might alone, which has been essentially our practice so far, has made the situation even more chaotic and has plunged Baghdad and its environs into greatest chaos. 
   Why? Guess what, because the rest of us, the American public and the Democratic Caucus, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, retired generals from every stripe, have realized that we cannot win this conflict. And everyone's definition of win is different, I understand, but we cannot prove victorious there on the force of our military might alone. 
   I got to spend a couple of days on the ground in Baghdad with those soldiers. If anyone can fulfill the mission they have been given, it is the men and women in the Armed Forces that we have put on the ground. They are the bravest and most capable people I have ever been around. But the fact is that we have given them a mission which is nearly impossible. 
   We are forcing them one day to be soldiers, the next day to be diplomats, and the next day to be civil engineers. The reason why plan A through Z has not worked yet is because it doesn't recognize the very fact that if we can solve this, if we can somehow bring some resolution to Iraq, it will be through diplomatic and political might, not sheer military force.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, we have been in this fight over timetables, and so many of us believe that we have got to start setting a deadline on when the Iraqis are going to have to stand up for themselves. Okay, so we passed that, and the President vetoed, and we came back and said, all right, let's talk about something a little bit less than that. Let's talk about what you outlined. 
   Let's give you all the money you want and more for the next several  months for the conduct of this war, and then after that's done, let's see if it's working. That's a revolutionary concept here. Before we authorize the next round of several dozen billion dollars for the conduct of this war, let's just ask some questions. Is it working? Are the Iraqis doing what they need to do to achieve a political settlement? And guess what, the message is to that idea as well, that's not acceptable either; it is going to get a veto just like the first one. 
   There was a word that was just lost here for a long time. You and the 30-somethings talked about it night after night, but it was a foreign phrase to people and it is accountability. It is accountability. 
   Guess why the Iraqis consider going home for the summer? Why the parliament thinks it is okay to stand down? Because they know they have a crutch to rely on. They know that the Americans will be there as long as they continue to refuse to stand their military up, to stand their political institutions up, to stand up their ministries. 
   They know that, in fact, we're going to reward their incompetence. Enough is enough. 
   I got to spend a couple of days there, and in addition to spending some time with the troops you get to spend a little bit of time with the Iraqi military, and you can see that there's potential there. You can see that they are ready to do this mission but you can also see that there's no incentive there to do it right now. 
   And so that word ``accountability'' which has been lost here for so long is I think a large reason for why Congress looks a little bit different now, why you have a whole bunch of new Members who were sent here, not just to wrap up this war, not just to bring our troops home but to also instill in this government a sense that if we are going to spend taxpayer dollars, we better have some accounting for how it is done. 
   The two bills that we have passed, both the first bill that set a timetable to wrap up this war; the second bill, frankly, is as reasonable as you can get in trying to provide some benchmarks for success, they are both about that missing word missing here for a long time. It is accountability.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. We talk about the enormous and unconscionable level of American casualties there, and the number that we focus on are the number of men and women who don't come back, and not enough focus gets put on the number of American soldiers who come back with grave, crippling injuries. But we don't talk at all about the number of Iraqis who have been killed, the immense civilian casualties that mount not by the two or three or four a day but mount by the dozens every day. 
   And so when you see what we are seeing now, which is an Iraqi parliament standing up and saying enough is enough, we need the Americans to go home, what you're hearing is a bunch of people who are realizing that the best way to keep their own people safe is to have the Americans stand down because, on more days than not, we are drawing additional fire into the chaos there. 
   We went over and asked the generals there, we said, listen, tell us how much of the fire that you are seeing in and around Baghdad is a result of Shia and Sunni violence and tell us how much of the fire is directed at American forces. And the stat was pretty amazing. Ninety percent of the fire there is fire directed from one religious civil group to the next, from one sect to the other. Ten percent of it is directed at American forces. It's an inexcusable 10 percent, but to think that we are asking our men and women to stand in the middle and be a human shield between Shia and Sunni fighting each other, in fact sometimes Shia and Shia, Sunni and Sunni fighting each other, is a miserable way to conduct foreign policy. 
   And I asked one of those soldiers, I said, you know, you're being asked one day to try to negotiate some political settlement between religious groups, when the day before they were shooting at each other; how on earth do you tell who's shooting at who? And the soldier looked at me inquisitively, sort of shocked that I would ask the question. He said, we don't know who's shooting at us; if they are shooting at us, we shoot back. That's their job. That's their job, to protect them, to protect the people around them. 
   But as you said, the fact is when you can't tell who it is that's doing the shooting how on earth the next day are you going to be expected to sit down and try to mend the fences that gave rise to that violence in the first place? 
   Like I said, if anybody can do it, I think that these guys and women can do it. They are the most amazing, capable people that I have ever met in my life, but the fact is that if you don't know who's perpetuating the violence, it's very hard to heal those wounds the next day. 
   And to my mind, if the Iraqis are telling us that what they believe is necessary to make their country safe is a precipitous withdrawal of American forces, if our own intelligence community is telling us that we are less safe because of what's going on there, the Iraq Study Group, retired generals, American public, Iraqi parliament, intelligence community, there's a wall around Pennsylvania Avenue right now, and none of that seems to be going in there. And if we don't change course sooner or later, we're going to do damage that is not going to be even reversible by this Democratic Congress.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. This place has been a one-horse show for a real long time. You talk about the Constitution. It's kind of been a document  that's been dead and buried for a long time. People say the United States Congress here is to be an equal branch of the United States Government, to be able to operate within a structure that recognizes that not every single decision gets made by one man sitting in a house up the street; that people go out to elections in record numbers like they did last November and they should think, rightfully so, that what they say and the votes they cast are going to have some impact on what happens down there. 
   And I understand that the President's version of working together is us agreeing with whatever he asks us to agree with, but that's not what the American people sent us here to do. I certainly didn't get sent here to do this as a new Member, and the sooner that we recognize that you have a Congress for the first time in a long time that is going to stand up and speak for the people that sent us here, the sooner that happens the better.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (TIME FOR A NEW COURSE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, it seems that President Bush and many of his allies still don't understand how things have changed on the ground in Iraq. 
   A few days ago the Republican leader, when asked about the President's new escalation plan, said that if it doesn't work, the President pretty soon is going to have to present to Congress and the American people what plan B is. 
   Well, there are very few people that don't realize by now that we are not on plan B anymore; we are on plan Z. And we have got to start asking ourselves why plan A and plan B all the way through plan Z still haven't worked. It is because a military plan, without diplomatic and political reinforcements behind it, cannot work on the ground in Iraq. That is what the Democrats in Congress have realized. That is what the Iraq Study Group realized. That is what legions of retired generals have realized. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time the President and his allies join that hegemony of opinion and join us in setting a new course in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (IMPORTANT STEP TAKEN ON ISSUE OF DOMESTIC NATIONAL SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, we still hope to bring a 30-something hour to the floor this evening, but we may have to wait for another evening, Mr. Speaker. 
   I wanted to briefly rise for a few minutes, potentially in replacement of our normal 30-something hour this evening, to talk about what I think is a very important step forward that this Congress took today when it comes to the issue of domestic national security. 
   We hear a lot and have heard a lot from our President and from this Congress over the past several months about trying to change our course in Iraq, trying to do the right thing to make sure that our troops, that our soldiers there are not put in harm's way in the middle of a religious civil war. 
   For those of us who have been calling for a new direction in Iraq, we do so in part based on what our own intelligence community has told us, through the National Intelligence Estimate, that the war in Iraq, which has become what they call a cause celeb for the terrorist communities, is in fact making this country less safe, not more safe, by creating a breeding ground, a training ground for terrorists and in fact by growing the undeserved derision for this country across the world. 
   It points us to, I think, a misplaced allocation of resources. While we have been fighting a misguided and bungled war in Iraq, we have been leaving our own borders, leaving our own homeland unsecured. 
   We know that the National Guard and the Reserve troops are stretched to their limit. I have a GAO report from January of this year stating the high use of National Guard for Federal overseas missions has reduced equipment available for its State-led domestic missions. 
   Governor after Governor is telling us that their National Guards are not ready to respond to the national emergencies that may confront States. The Governor of North Carolina says, ``We rely on the National Guard to respond to natural disasters, a pandemic or terrorist attack. Currently, we do not have the manpower or the equipment to perform that dual role,'' of responding to both State and Federal needs. 
   We know that our National Guard is stretched thin. We also know that over a period of time our local law enforcement personnel have been stretched thin as well. 
   For those of us that watched from State legislatures or from our place in the private citizenry, we were very proud of this Congress in conjunction with former President Clinton when they instituted the COPS program. Over 117,000 additional community police officers were put on the streets of this country. Every State of the Union was a beneficiary of this program. 
   That program was put by the wayside by this Republican Congress and this President. Today a lot of Republicans got up and spoke in favor of the bill today which basically reinvigorated that community policing program. But it was a Republican Congress that cut that program to the bone. 
   During the Clinton administration during the 1990s, the COPS program was funded at $1 billion a year. By 2003, the Republican-led Congress had scaled back COPS to $198 million. And by 2005, to $10 million. By 2006, the Congress had completely eliminated COPS funding. 
   Boots on the street, community police officers on the ground, you want to talk about the first defense against the next terrorist attack on this Nation, it is the community police officers, our law enforcement personnel on the ground. 
   Today, we made an historic investment in community policing. For my district alone, it means a 50 percent increase in the number of COPS-supported personnel on the ground. 
   We are going to set a new course in Iraq, and I believe that is going to make this country safer. We are going to put our National Guard and Reserve troops protecting their States. That will make us safer. 
   But today, this Democratic Congress showed that things changed by investing once again in community policing and the COPS program. 
   A lot of people wonder whether things really are changing in Washington or whether it is just talk. Today, by making an historic investment in community policing, we did the right thing for our brave law enforcement personnel and national security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1700 and the law enforcement officers that keep our neighborhoods and communities safe. 
   The small cities of Connecticut's Fifth District may not rival the size of those neighboring districts, but they still have the same need for vigorous community-based law enforcement. Since the COPS Program began in 1994, 265 police officers have been put on the beat in the Fifth District. This bill could put an additional 113 police officers out on the streets. One bill, this bill, could increase the law enforcement personnel by the COPS Program by 50 percent. 
   For the last 6 years as I sat in the Connecticut State legislature, I have watched the Federal Government walk away from its commitment to partner with States and towns to provide funding necessary to keep our communities safe. In Connecticut, our law enforcement community has been asked to do more with less. They are the pride of our community, but they have seen the cuts in action that have been imposed by this Congress. 
   The numbers in this bill are meaningful, Mr. Speaker. I urge all Members to support the bill. It is important for our law enforcement officers and important for the safety of our communities.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE ETHICS REFORM -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, many members of the freshman class were elected in part because people were tired of the culture of corruption that they saw here in Washington and the total lack of accountability for those that broke the law and betrayed the American trust. People out in America look at Washington and they just don't understand how Members of Congress over the past several years could be carted off to Federal prisons while their own body, the Congress of the United States, sat by and did virtually nothing to hold these people accountable for their actions. 
   Today, Congress will pass landmark lobbying reform legislation. Fund-raising will become more transparent, sunlight will be shed on lobbyist influence, the K Street Project will end, and the revolving door for Members of Congress will shut a little bit tighter. But as Congress reduces the influence of people outside the body of Congress, we also need to recommit ourselves to cleaning up our own House by reforming the House ethics process. We will all celebrate our victory today. It will be a critical step to changing how things work in Washington. But we can't stop here. We need to make our ethics process work again by establishing a new citizen ethics panel independent of Congress with the power to initiate and vet ethics enforcement actions. We need this reform not because Members of Congress are corrupt but because they are the victims of simple human nature. It isn't natural to turn against your colleagues, your coworkers and your confidants to file complaints against each other under our current ethics process. Inaction within our current system isn't corruption, it's just human instinct. That's why responsible ethics reform will allow an independent panel to initiate these complaints, guaranteeing that friendships and work relationships don't get in the way of enforcing our ethics rules. 
   Mr. Speaker, soon after I was elected last November, I went to speak at an elementary school in my hometown of Cheshire. At the end of my talk, a fifth grader stood up and asked me a question. He said, Mr. Murphy, you sound good now, but how do I know that you're not going to go down to Washington and become like everybody else? 
   I laughed a little bit when he asked me that question, but it's frankly a good one. And the danger for all of us is that the longer that someone spends here, the more ownership you take over the very system that you once ran against. And even though you may know that the system is broken, sometimes it just seems far too long a bridge to cross in order to fix it. But it has to be fixed. And it may just fall upon the newest Members of this body to do the mending. Because it's not just happenstance that some of the strongest voices for this reform are the freshman class, those who have spent the least amount of time working under this dome. Maybe because we just spent the last 2 years spending 18 hours a day living and breathing the frustrations of people outside the Beltway, even those that aren't old enough to vote, that we see with clear eyes what I think everyone inside the Beltway knows in their heart--that our current ethics process doesn't work and it feeds the perception that politicians spend far too much time and too much effort watching their own backs. 
   Listen, I know reform isn't easy, especially when it comes to setting up the rules by which we enforce our own code of conduct. This is delicate stuff. And I understand the fear that some Members have of handing over our ethics process to some outside independent body. But we need to rise above these fears, not only because we owe it to ourselves to remove the built-in conflicts of interest that put Members between a rock and a hard place but because the people out there in the Fifth District of Connecticut and every other district in America won't believe in their Congress again until they know that we can police ourselves. 
   Reform isn't easy. Not the landmark lobbying bill that we will pass today or the needed ethics reforms still to come. But, Mr. Speaker, nothing worthwhile ever is.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, it is good to see you in the Chair this evening. 
   This has been a pretty amazing first 3 months for a new Member such as myself, who just joined this Chamber after having watched it from afar for a number of years. As our majority leader said at an engagement earlier tonight, this has really been one of the most remarkably productive Congresses in as long as he can remember being here. That is important. That is important to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are going to be joined later tonight by Ms. Wasserman Schultz, who is just beginning her second term. I think she shares a lot of the same frustration that the new Members do, that for all of the important policy changes that this Congress has started, whether you want to talk about raising the minimum wage, starting to repeal some of these massive tax breaks we have given to the oil industry, the very important action that we took on Friday that we will talk about in terms of Iraq and the new direction that this Democratic Congress is beginning to set on what we do in Iraq, maybe the most important thing was that we started getting this place to work again and starting to give our constituents out there faith that Congress is back to work for the people of this country. Instead of sort of waiting for the special interests and  the lobbyists to line up and come into the offices of the prior leadership to tell them what they wanted, now actually we have got the American people, middle-class families, working class families, their priorities are back in charge here again. That is what makes me proud to be part of this group. 
   This is the hour that the 30-Something Working Group gets to spend on the floor of the House. I am proud to be a member of that group, a new member, proud that Speaker Pelosi has allowed us this opportunity. 
   We are going to cover I think a couple of subjects tonight. We will certainly talk about what happened here on Friday. 
   But I want to first just rewind for a second, to rewind to what happened when we first got here in January. Because it is interesting. I watched C-SPAN occasionally when I got home from the campaign trail, I got home from the State capital where I served in Connecticut for a few years, so I have some familiarity with some of the talk that goes on in this place. 
   But now I get to sort of listen it to with new ears, because now I listen to a lot of the revisionist history that gets thrown around this place late at night, listen to our friends on the other side of the aisle, and they are friends. 
   It is important to put up this chart, Mr. Speaker, to remind the American people that we actually can be friends when it actually comes to putting on the floor of the House of Representatives up or down votes on issues that matter to regular, middle-class families out there. 
   We can talk about 68 Republican votes along with the Democrats voting to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. When we raised the minimum wage, set that bill on a path forward in this House, we got 82 Republican votes for that. Stem cell research, passed 253-174, 37 Republicans. Better prescription drug programs for our elderly, 24 Republicans. And on and on and on. 
   When it matters, where you put up-or-down votes in front of this House for things that make lives better for regular people out there, you are going to have Republicans and Democrats agreeing. So we are friends. We are friends when we put things before us we can all agree on. 
   But there has been some revisionist history. There has been some interesting 20-20 hindsight happening on this floor often. We heard just a little bit of it before. A lot the decrying about the situation that our Federal budget has gotten into is pretty curious, seeing that the reason that I am here in large part is because a whole bunch of people out in northwestern Connecticut who voted for one person for 24 years decided that the budget priorities, along with the priorities on our foreign policy, were gravely out of whack. 
   A $9 trillion deficit, Mr. Speaker. A President that inherited a budget surplus, who ran on very fiscally conservative principles, managed to turn that into a record deficit in his first 6 years in office. A Republican Congress, I am sure there were some Democrats that were at the trough as well, but a Republican-led Congress that was complicit in racking up record amounts of debt that we know are not owned in large part by domestic banks but are increasingly owned by foreign banks, Asian banks and, in fact, it will put us in a very difficult position with when we are sitting down at a table to negotiate foreign policy with a lot of these foreign debt holders that have fairly decent leverage over us. 
   So we hear a lot about how we need to do something about this deficit. How it is our children, our children are going to be crippled under the weight of this deficit. They absolutely are. They absolutely are.     
   We had 6 years with a Republican President, 6 years with a Republican House, a Republican Senate for much of that time. Could have fixed it during that time; didn't get the job done. 
   Let's take a look at this chart for just one second. Let's make this clear, when we borrow money, all of this debt that we have racked up over the past several years, it is owned by Japan, China, the United Kingdom, Caribbean nations, Taiwan, OPEC nations, right down the line. That is who owns our foreign debt. That is what places us in incredibly compromising positions when we try to bring them to the table to be a multilateral player in actions throughout this world. 
   So here is why I am here: I am here because people in northwestern Connecticut wanted us to finally challenge this President on his disastrous policy in Iraq. I am here because they were sick and tired of the programs that make communities strong, the health care programs, education programs, job training programs, we are getting slashed and burned and cut to the bone by this Congress, while they gave away more and more massive tax breaks to their friends in the upper .1 percent of income earners in this Nation. 
   But they are also upset because the party that I think they thought was, you know, you see it in the polls, people for years and years and years thought that the Republicans were the ones that could manage their money and the Democrats they weren't so sure on. Well, they finally wised up after a while to realize that this place wasn't so responsible even under Republican rule; that in fact after budget after budget that got put before here, that President Bush put before this Congress was rubber-stamped over and over and over again and led to some of the most fiscally irresponsible policies that this Congress has ever seen, that this Nation, in fact, has ever seen. Largest Federal debt in the history of this country, growing by the day. 
   Now, here is the good news: it's changing. Now, as many times as folks on the other side of the aisle want to talk and use the term ``biggest tax increase in the history of the Federal Government,'' well, I'm still searching through that budget resolution, I'm still searching through what I am going to vote on this week and I don't see it. I don't see it because it's not there because we are actually going to do the responsible thing. Because what happened to create this Federal budget deficit was not just these massive tax breaks that they gave away to the folks way at the top, top, top of the income bracket, but they also spent money in a way that would have your eyes spin to the back of your head if you dug into some of the things they were doing here.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Meek, just as a transition to Ms. Wasserman Schultz, I would just say, elections matter; and there is probably no better example of that in recent history than the election in November. Things have just changed here. The air is different, the priorities are different, the rate of action is different. 
   And, Mr. Meek, I get why we had to have an election in order to change course in Iraq. I understand that this is a very difficult subject that has divided people for a number of years. Over the past several years, people, large numbers of people came to the conclusion that we needed to change course from the President's policy, that we needed to put a Congress here that is going to start standing up to this guy and insisting that there are some other fights that matter in this world, and that we need to invest back in Afghanistan, that we need to make sure that our borders here are protected and that we needed to start redeploying our forces. 
   So I get that we had to go to a national referendum in order to set a new course. That is an important issue that has divided people. 
   Now, people have come down pretty firmly in the past 12 or 18 months on the side of a new direction. That is why Friday, to me, was maybe the most gratifying day in the short number that I have been here. But, Mr. Meek, I don't get why we had to have an election to decide to support veterans.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, there is going to be a lot of stuff over the next couple months about Executive privilege and who said what, and there may be a lot of terms that may not seem like it matters to regular people. 
   The heart of the matter is the difference between America and some Third World nations out there is we have a system of blind justice which holds people accountable for their actions based on whether they were right or wrong, whether they broke the law or didn't break the law; not whether they have some powerful friend sitting in the halls and corridors of power in Washington, D.C. or their State legislature. That is what separates this country from a lot of other places in the world where you can get hauled off to jail simply because you have fallen in disfavor with someone who is in a high political position. That is the essence of the genius of this country, that we have made sure that our legal system operates separate from our political system. 
   There is going to be a lot of commotion about Executive privilege. What it comes down to is what may have happened is that this administration violated one of the basic principles of American democracy: don't mix justice with politics. 
   And you are very right, maybe people wouldn't have found out about this if we did have Democrats in the majority.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. This is a religious war that we helped to create in part. It did not exist until the bull sort of rushed into the China shop, but I think we all find it appalling, some of us, this simplistic terminology that gets rolled out here that we cannot leave until victory has been achieved. Explain to me what victory is because if we have to stay there until we have completely eliminated a civil/religious conflict, well, it was not raging for the decades before we got there and is one that has almost no historical bounds. That is a difficult victory to ask our brave men and women to achieve, to try to somehow remediate a dispute between Shia and Sunni that cannot be resolved through the military actions of our men and women. 
   Victory is much broader than that. Victory is about going after the fight that really mattered in the first place which is in Afghanistan, Mr. Speaker. Victory is about making sure that we secure our borders here at home; that every container that comes into American ports gets checked; that every airport has the proper screening technology to make sure that the ports of entry who brought in the terrorists who harmed this country have all the technology they need to make sure that it never happens again.     
   That's victory in the end. So it's frustrating as a new Member to come down here and to listen to this new terminology get thrown out there that doesn't have any basis in reality. That is part of what we did on Friday as well, to start to broaden that definition of what victory means and try to challenge the people to rise to that.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you for yielding, Mr. Meek. 
   You talked about our commitment, failed commitment, over the past several years of Republican rule in this House to our veterans, and I think of what message we send, Mr. Speaker and Members, to the young men and women who are coming back to this country who have fought for us in a war that they are beginning to understand, I think, has been so badly mismanaged and a war in which this Congress has so miserably overseen for the past 3, 4 years. But I also think about what message it sends to prospective young men and women who may want to join our Armed Forces, because we are so lucky in this country to have an all-volunteer military, and it is a blessing for each and every one of us who lives under this blanket of freedom that our volunteer military provides. 
   The message that we are sending them today, Mr. Meek and Mr. Speaker, is that, one, when we send them into battle, we are not going to do it in a way that protects them with the armor and equipment that they need, that we are not prepared to send them into a conflict that we have planned for in advance for success. 
   But, even given all that, that when they come back to this country, unconscionably, we are not going to make sure that they have the health care that they need, that they won't wait in lines for procedures that they need, that they won't have to pay exorbitant amounts of money 
   out of pocket for the drugs that they need to treat the injuries that they suffered on behalf of this Nation. 
   So for me, Mr. Speaker and Members, the issue of veterans really ties it all together for us because it talks about the values that we have as a Nation to those who have served. It talks about the misguided policies of this administration and the peril that we have put these young men and women in. 
   As 30-Somethings that get to stand here and as a very new member of this group, we all have friends and cousins and brothers and sisters who are fighting there, and we hear the stories firsthand from our generation or those just a few years younger than us as they come back, and the stories only get worse. We give credit to those who served, and we should give them the benefit of their service when they return here. 
   And I think you are very right, Mr. Meek, to point out that that was a very noticeable absence from the President's speech, to give credit to them not just in words, not just in Veterans Day and Memorial Day ceremonies, but in the acts and in the funding that this  body is charged to provide for those men and women both when they are abroad serving for this country and here at home. And having watched the 30-Somethings do work on this floor, I know what great advocates you have been for those men and women who have served for us, Mr. Meek.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Meek was right on. The new class that was sent here to Washington was sent here to make sure that this place is returned to that hardworking family that you are talking about. 
   You know, we know the statistics, the terrible statistics of the number of military families that are on food stamps, the number of military families, ex-military families that have to come to the government for some assistance just to get by every day. I mean, these are amongst the legions of families across this country that are scraping to get by every day. 
   We have a growing economy. You know the story, Mr. Meek. We have a growing economy. Production is up. GDP is up. And wages are flat. Wages for regular, ordinary Americans are going nowhere while wages for CEOs and the folks at the very top of that economic scale are doing very well. 
   And none of us begrudge folks that have done well in business making a dollar. I mean, that is the genius of our American economy. But what it does is it leaves all of those people behind while a very few at the top are well off. 
   Here is where we come in, I think. I think we come in in that our job, not necessarily to completely level that playing field, but our job certainly is not to exacerbate the differences that already exist. And when President Bush goes to Illinois, if he spends a little time moving away from the motorcade and the Secret Service lines, he will find a society there in which there are deep divisions between those folks in the middle that are just trying to cling on to that middle class, and the folks that are doing very well.  
   Our job, you know frankly, is to not make that situation worse. And the tax breaks that this previous Congress gave away to a lot of those oil companies, to the deals that they cut with the drug companies to give them record profits off this health care system, have left a lot of people behind, have left millions of hardworking Americans struggling, producing more, working harder than ever, and not seeing a return for their dollar. 
   You know the costs of this war. I have heard you talk about it on this floor. But we are spending $8 billion a month in Iraq right now. And we need to start having a conversation about how we spend that money here in the United States of America, and how we use that money to retrain workers that have been laid off due to the globalization of our economy. 
   We need to talk about how to spend that money to get kids an education that they deserve, to get them out of school in 4 years, rather than what is all too often happening, that it takes 6, 8, 10 years for some students to get degrees. That is where we need to be investing. 
   That is the right thing for our economy. That is the right thing for our kids. And ultimately it is the right thing for our men and women that are fighting overseas. So I appreciate the focus that we are going to hopefully be able to add to the President's visit, to make sure that when he goes out there into the world that he sees all of America, that he does not just see the folks that have been the beneficiaries of the largesse of government in this Congress for all too long, the oil companies, the drug companies, the Fortune 500s, that he sees the rest of the folks that are struggling. 
   Now, he is going to get an opportunity, as you know, Mr. Speaker and Members, to do right by those folks, because hopefully we are going to get to his desk an increase in the minimum wage, we are going to get to his desk a decrease in the student loan rate. We are going to put on his desk for his signature a repeal of those massive tax breaks to the oil companies. 
   He is going to have a choice then, and I hope he listens to what happened on election day. I hope he listens to the legions of folks who sent us here, some of us for the first time and others back for another tour of duty in this Chamber. I hope that he listens to the folks that are asking this government to start sticking up for people that have had very little voice, very little voice except for some people standing here late at night trying to shed light on what has been really happening in this country, Mr. Meek.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I would just say, it is funny because there was kind of a low bar set. And I at some levels am pleased that I was not in the same shoes that Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek were, that I did not have to go back to my constituency for the last several years and answer for what has happened here, because the answer is, not much. 
   You know, folks out there were struggling with these energy prices just going through the roof. Health care was becoming harder and harder to find, good health care at least. People were crying out for work on immigration. People were trying to get help bringing up their wages to a liveable wage, and they were not hearing anything. I mean, it was deafening silence from down here. 
   So I do not have as much comparative experience as you, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek, do. But walking around the district in Connecticut for the past several weekends it has been euphoric. And I used that word the last time I was down here with you. 
   It is really this sort of sense that, oh, my gosh, our government is working again. Our government is back to work again; and it used to be that that is what happened. It used to be that there would be a problem, you would go to your legislator, they would come down here and they would do something about it. 
   And people have come to expect inertia. That is what sort of was just the run of the mill down here in Washington, that you have a problem and then you have to wait about 5, 10 years, in order to get something to happen. 
   I felt the same thing, Mr. Ryan, that people you know, it is too bad frankly that people have come to be surprised by the fact that there could be immediate action. Because that is what they should get from their government, and they are getting it now.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I will just key off of an important word there and that is investments. You know, how you balance the budget into the future is to make sure that you are doing the right things now to make sure that our economy is humming 10 years and 20 years from now. So when you talk about this investing in renewable and alternative energy sources, I mean, that is going to be our export. That is going to be what America can renew its economy around, is our ability to be the producer of all these new energy technologies. 
   When you talk about investing in education, making sure that kids are educated so that America, which right now grows as an economy because we have the best-trained, best-educated work force in the country, continues to be that beacon of economic development due to our work force. Those are the type of investments that have been long cast aside but now we are going to start making again so that we make sure that you know when we are long gone from here that we have left an economy and we have left a budget that makes sense.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (DEMOCRATS FIGHT TO END SUBSIDIES FOR BIG OIL AND INSTEAD SUPPORT RENEWABLE ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House eliminated wasteful and unnecessary taxpayer subsidies to some of the largest multinational oil companies and instead invested this money in subsidies for regular individuals and businesses who are investing in clean energy. This legislation will not only help ease the pain at the pump for many Americans, but it will also help us get us on the road toward energy independence. 
   This bill comes shortly after the big five oil companies reported their latest record profits. Earlier this month, for example, ExxonMobil reported earnings of $40.6 billion in 2007, the largest corporate profit in American history. 
   Now, why should the big oil companies receive billions of dollars in government welfare? Well, they shouldn't. It's simply a waste of taxpayer dollars at the expense of our very necessary drive towards energy independence. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House has acted on legislation that will lower energy costs, improve national security by making us more energy independent and ending wasteful taxpayer subsidies for companies that clearly do not need them.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Just a quick point. During the May break, I went back and spent most of the week visiting with manufacturers and businesses in northwestern Connecticut. I could imagine what I heard was the same thing from what anybody who makes that trip will hear. It's all about workforce, workforce, workforce, that our economic salvation as a region in the Northeast, but also as a country, is not going to necessarily be, in terms of how cheap we can turn out the rubber balls, it's going to be about the quality of our product, and the quality of our production capacity. 
   That's all about training the new generation of workers. I mean, this money that we are talking about, it doesn't just go for students who are going to a 4-year Ivy League school. This is also money for kids that are going to community technology colleges that are being trained to be tool-  and-die makers, that are being trained to be computer technicians at the shops and the manufacturing centers of the next decade and the decade beyond. 
   If we are going to compete as a Nation, as you say, against China and everyone else who is undercutting us, it is going to be because we have the best trained and the most productive workforce in the country. That's what our manufacturers are screaming for, and that's what you address when you talk about putting money into higher education.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. If I was one of those high-priced political consultants and a prospective candidate came to me and said, listen, this is what I want to be for, this is what I want to be known for, I want to stand with the President every turn, make sure we stay in Iraq for as long as we can. I think I am also going to be against children's health care insurance. I am going to try to defend the  status quo on our health care system. I think it's about right, I think we got it right. 
   Also, I think I also want to be against affordable college. I think I also want to fight against increases in Pell Grants and Stafford loans and all the rest. If I was that political consultant I might sort of look at my watch, look at my date book, and, you know, take a pass on that one. 
   You know why? It's not about Republicans or Democrats. It's what the American people are asking for; it's what the American people have been crying for. They want a new direction in Iraq. They want help with the cost of getting by every day, which certainly includes the cost of health care and college affordability. They want a place that is listening to them again instead of listening to the White House and the banks and everyone else that has had the run of this place for a while. 
   It will be another good week here, and I hope sooner rather than later some of our friends across the aisle join us in standing up for what the American people have been crying for for a real long time.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. If the gentleman would yield, just to make one last point on this, and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for coming down, before I came here, I was the chairman of the Public Health Committee in the Connecticut State Legislature. What we figured out over time, because we were a State that submitted waivers to the Federal Government to expand our children's healthcare program, so we actually ended up with one of the more generous SCHIP programs in the country. We had more kids as a percentage of children who were eligible for children's healthcare, sponsored and subsidized by the State and Federal Government, than most other States, and what we found was that was actually reducing the cost of healthcare over time. 
   I got to listen to a little bit of the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle earlier, and they act as if we have existing today a fiscally responsible system of healthcare. We don't. We have the most expensive healthcare system in the world. 
   You may have covered this earlier before I got on to the floor. But we  have the most expensive healthcare system in the world for outcomes that are lucky if they rival those of countries that spend 50 percent less on their healthcare, 16 percent of GDP in this country compared to 10 or 11 percent in other countries that insure everybody and get basically the same or better outcomes. 
   So what we found in Connecticut was as we expanded the reach of our SCHIP program and got more kids eligible and enrolled, we were actually cutting the cost of care for those kids because, guess what? Preventative care, as I am sure has been said on the Floor, is much less expensive, much more fiscally responsible than crisis care, when these kids show up in the emergency room with much more complicating, debilitating illnesses that require much more expensive care. 
   So, for my money, investing in children's healthcare insurance is the right thing for taxpayer dollars. We certainly know it is the humane thing to do, it is the moral thing to do, to insure children who have no healthcare through no fault of their own. But it is certainly the right thing to do if we are going to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. 
   If I were sent here, as the folks on the other side of the aisle believe they have been, to be stewards of taxpayer dollars, I would be investing in preventative healthcare every single day I was here, and that is what the SCHIP program does.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. The coalition of the willing is no more, Mr. Meek. What is left are the military family, and their friends and families have been asked to shoulder almost the entire burden of this war. 
   When we talk about where we are going to spend the taxpayer dollars, you have to talk about what we are getting for that investment. 
   You gave the statistics on the casualties since the beginning of the war, but it is even more terrifying when you talk about what has happened simply since the surge has begun: 593 soldiers have died since January 10; 3,500 have been wounded; 1,600 wounded so badly they cannot return to battle. We are talking about 13,000 Iraqi civilians and members of the military police who have been killed or wounded since the surge took place. 
   So you have to ask what we are getting for this investment. It has gone from $8 billion a month to $10 billion a month since the surge has gone into effect. What we have gotten is an Iraqi political institution or Iraqi political infrastructure which is even less willing to take responsibility for its own actions, even less able to take control of their own country. 
   It was reported in the Associated Press of the President's report on progress in Iraq that the Iraqi government has not ``met any of its targets for political, economic and other reform.'' Has not met any of the targets we have given them for economic, political reform. 
   Parliament is going home for the summer. There is a parliament where the biggest Sunni group has pulled out. You have an inability for the Iraqis to deal with their own shop. As someone said, right now the Iraqis are paying wholesale for their politics because we are subsidizing every decision that is being made there. It is time they start paying retail for their political decisions, and that is only going to happen when they have a sense of when the crutch is going to be taken away from them. 
   So, Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan, I think to myself when we talk about how we are going to spend money, whether we are going to spend $120 billion a year in Iraq or whether we are going to spend $40 or $50 billion on children's health care insurance, and I think, as Mr. Ryan said, that $120 billion investment is getting more and more Americans killed every day and is making this country less safe and less safe every day, and is making it less and less likely that the Iraqis will ever be able to take control of their country.     
   That's a terrible investment. That's a bad investment. When I think about $50 billion in children's health care, by doing the right thing, the moral thing for kids, and at the same time, probably making our health care system more affordable and less costly in the end, because we're hooking kids up with preventative health care, that's a great investment. That's a worthwhile investment.

Those are the investments that millions of Americans around this country sent a new class of Democrats here to work on, and if we can get some Republicans to stand up with us this week, as we have seen happening in the Senate over the last week and a half, we'll start to make good on those promises.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I guess I wonder whether the water is different in the Republican cloakroom down here than it is in the Senate cloakroom, because what we've seen in the last couple of weeks, and I've got a list here of all of the people who have changed their opinion on the war in the last several weeks and all the quotes from Republicans in the United States Capitol regarding their new opinion of this war, which is that we should set a date for withdrawal, and it is Senate Republican after Senate Republican after Senate Republican after Senate Republican, Dick Lugar, George Voinovich, Pete Domenici, Lamar Alexander, Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins. 
   What's missing from that list, for some reason, are members of the Republican minority here in the House. This is the body that's supposed to actually be more responsive to the American people, not less responsive. So I haven't been here long enough to understand what the difference is, but some Republicans are waking up to the notion that it's time for a change. It just hasn't happened here yet.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. To go deeper than that, let's explain exactly what the deal is. Let's delve one layer deeper into this, explain exactly what the deal is for banks here. 
   We already guarantee all of these loans for the banks. That's a great deal. You tell me that I'm going to lend money to somebody and if they don't pay it back, somebody else is going to pay me back? Well, guess what, I'll probably make that loan. 
   But then what we did on top of it, on top of it was we gave them a cut of the loan, too. You know what we figured out? They're still going to make the loans even if you don't give them a cut of the loan. They're guaranteed loans. They're essentially guaranteed loans. That's just commonsense. 
   And so as Mr. Ryan said, this becomes sort of a socialist welfare program for just a different set of people, people that are doing pretty well already. So, to me, this is just commonsense. So to a lot of people it's commonsense. 
   When we go back in our districts, we're hearing a lot of people talking about Iraq. People are behind the Democrats' plan to reorder our priorities there and start going after the real bad guys, but there are a lot of people struggling just with getting by every day and every week, and there are a lot of young parents who are raising young kids and looking at college costs, thinking to themselves how on earth am I going to do this. 
   And to think that one of the things that stands in their way is a system now that subsidizes some pretty well-off banks, at the expense of those parents and their kids, is ludicrous. I mean, frankly, I could probably sit there, even coming from a pretty fiscally conservative State like Connecticut, I could probably sit here and justify bringing in new revenue somehow in order to increase money for student aid. I think I could sell people back in Connecticut, and say, listen, we've got to put a little more into the pot and we're going take care of students who need help, I mean truly meritorious students. 
   We don't even have to do that here. We don't even have to make that argument. All we have to do is say listen, we've just got to shift moneys from the haves to the have-nots. That's the brilliance of this program.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend from Tennessee and from Illinois for supporting the resolution here today. 
   I think it's fitting, in part, that we are here in the House of Representatives on this august floor in order to celebrate a town, New Milford, Connecticut, which is, in part, responsible for our very existence here today. 
   The first citizen of New Milford is often referred to as Roger Sherman, whose statute sits not far outside this body. Why is that? Because after being an entrepreneur in New Milford, Connecticut, Roger Sherman came to the Constitutional Convention and was one of the authors, the primary author, of the Connecticut Compromise, which was responsible for the United States Government having a bicameral legislature with both the House and the Senate. 
   We're very proud of him. We're very proud of the incredibly rich historical tradition in New Milford. As was referenced, the number of people who rose from New Milford to fight in the Revolutionary War is remarkable, given its small size. It also became a central stop, a central hub on the Underground Railroad in the 50 or 60 years after the Revolution. 
   It has grown over time from a community that was founded first by only 12 families to now a town that not only enjoys one of the largest land masses in Connecticut, but also has 30,000 people there and still has retained its small-town charm. 
   I really urge anyone who has plans to travel throughout the northeastern section of this great United States, to try to divert a little bit of your trip to see the quaint village of New Milford. Not only does it have a small, but bustling, downtown of quaint shops on the side streets off of the green, but a growing commercial industrial sector as well. 
   I was privileged to be able to march in a very festive 300th anniversary parade a few weeks ago, and I'm very pleased to join my colleagues here to celebrate its 300th anniversary on the floor of the House of Representatives today. 
   I urge passage of the resolution.

   In Connecticut, I was proud to have overseen passage of the Nation's first law investing State funds in life-saving stem cell research. But our $100 million success story in Connecticut was a bittersweet one, since our effort was made necessary only by the Federal Government's failure to act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be even prouder to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle this week to support legislation that will buttress the hopes of millions of Americans with the tangible support and resources of their Federal Government, and I hope that this unprecedented show of support here in the people's House will give our President cause to reconsider his unfounded and unpopular decision to oppose this life-saving initiative.

   I know that because as a candidate for office and as a student of American politics I have had the honor of watching you stand here and really speak for the American people, for the last 4 years in your case, Mr. Meek, and for the three of you, for the last 2 years. I have been able to serve in the State legislature and now obviously have just a unique opportunity to be here and advocate on behalf of those people with all of you. 
   If I could start by saying a tremendous and unconditional thank-you to what you have been able to do. Those of us in the political world and nonpolitical world sometimes do not get to turn on the TV until late at night. I will tell you, and speaking especially for a lot of the younger people in the State that I am from, Connecticut, who are interested in this process either as their profession or simply as an interested American, the work that you have done in talking about the agenda that was so badly needed, that was reaffirmed by the American people this November, made a difference, made a difference for me. I think I stole a lot of your lines over the course of my work this last fall. 
   So let me just say, by means of introduction, that it is a privilege to be able the stand here with you as a new member of the 30 Something Caucus. There are a few of us that came down here, and I think that speaks to the agenda that you have put forth that said the American people need change. We need change. 
   We especially heard it in our generation those of us who are looking at not just the next 10 years, but the next 20, 30, 40 years and want to make sure that things are happening here in Washington, D.C., whether they be on the 100-hours agenda or whatever we do for the next 2 years is looking to the future of our children and grandchildren, and that's what the 30 Somethings have been all about.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I am coming off of my first weekend back in the district after having spent a glorious first 1 1/2 weeks down here getting sworn in and starting to work the 100-hour agenda. And people back in Connecticut are just so enraptured by the idea they have their House back, they have their House back in their hands. 
   You talk about the bill we are going to vote on tomorrow. Last summer, as those oil prices and gas prices rose through the roof and people started to make those terrible decisions about whether they were going to afford to pay for their family's basic needs or they were going to fill up their tank, they looked at their government which was giving away more and more tax breaks to oil companies, allowing these excessive royalties to go on in the Gulf Coast, and they just wondered who was in charge down here. They wondered who was in charge. 
   And that went for student loans as well, as they were crying out, clamoring for more assistance to try to get their kids to school, as students were asking, ``I need just a little more help to finish this degree.'' Congress said the opposite. In fact made it harder for them to get that degree by raising student loan interest rates. 
   There was just this sense out there, almost a sense of disbelief, and you all felt it I know as well that we had lost control of the people's House here. And what I felt when I was back in the district this week was just a sense of euphoria, that the people's agenda, just regular middle class families' agenda was finally being heard in this place. 
   And you are very right, Mr. Ryan, when you said that it certainly doesn't end with the 100 hours agenda. This is  just a preview of whose priorities are going to be heard here, and it is an exciting place to be.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I think one of the things that makes a lot of what we are doing attractive, we are not just talking about pay-as-you-go, as Mr. Meek stated, we are doing it in almost every piece of legislation that has been brought forward. 
   Today, for example, the reason we saw such support for the student loan interest rate is because that program was paid for with efficiencies within that program. That is at no cost to the American taxpayers. 
   Tomorrow, when we go forward on our new energy policy, that is not even going to be PAYGO, that is going to be pay-it-forward. We are actually going to take the savings from all of the programmatic changes that Mr. Ryan talked about and we are going to put it into a fund, a strategic investment fund, that we are going to be able to use down the line as we start to change our energy policy towards renewable and alternative energy. 
   We are exercising on a daily basis that kind of fiscal restraint that was lost for so long here, and I think that is why you see a real coming together of people in this Chamber, and why people were so excited back in our districts. Not only do they see things that are helping average families, on education, on energy policy, but they are seeing it done in a really fiscally sound way. 
   And tomorrow we will continue to do that by taking that money that we are going to save through repealing those tax breaks and repealing those very bad royalty policies and putting it into a fund that we can then use to promote clean energy and use to promote conservation, all of the things that have been so dearly lacking in this country for a very long time. 
   We are doing the right things, and we are doing them in a way that, as Mr. Meek has talked about so often, are true to the fiscal restraint that really should be the hallmark of this Congress.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Ryan, thank you for yielding, and I think you are right, this is kitchen-table type of stuff we are doing now, and I think you are absolutely right, this is going to affect the lives of all the people in our districts. 
   I would go one step further. Before I came down here, I had the chance to go to my friend Adam Garner's elementary class at Highland Elementary in Cheshire, Connecticut, in my home town. And I looked at those kids, and we had about 50 kids in that place, and I thought about what their impression is of Congress, what they think happens in this place. And all they see and all they have read about for the last 10 or 12 years is bickering between the two sides. All they have seen is special interests and lobbyists giving untold millions to campaigns and having their business be brought before the House of Representatives. 
   So I thought, what kind of world are they going to grow up in, in which they think their government is for sale, where they think their leaders care more about arguing with each other than getting work done. 
   And you are exactly right, Mr. Ryan, this is going to mean money on the table for people who have very little to work with. This is going to mean a better quality of life for families. 
   I think of my little friend, Adam Garner, and his friends in Cheshire, Connecticut, and what this says to them about their faith in government. That is what, in the end, is our greatest legacy. Not just the fact we raised the minimum wage and not just the fact a few more kids get to go to college, but what we are doing here, and I think you are very right in this historic moment, is in some small way about restoring faith in the process of government. 
   The hundred hours is so brilliant because not only does it mean real, tangible results for people, but it means, I think, as Ms. Clarke said, a paradigm shift, a paradigm shift that will be noticed by people who pay attention and watch C-SPAN late at night, but might also be noticed by those little kids who haven't thought much of their government over time. 
   I think the 30 Somethings being on this floor trying to expose what has become of this place, Mr. Meek, has been part of that healing process.

   You will hear some acrimony from the other side, but when you look at the votes, as Mr. Meek ran through, in the end, there is a lot of healing that happens here because we are working on things that benefit both sides. 
   I tell you, all of us new Members, and there are 50-some odd new Members, we all may have certain different issues that were accentuated to a greater or lesser degree in our races, but we have found in talking to each other these first few days that what binds us is the sense our constituents sent us here to get this place working again, get it working again for the right people. 
   I know from our side of the aisle we will do that with whoever it is. If you are liberal, conservative, Democrat, or Republican, we want to make this a place where we work together again. That is maybe why that sense of euphoria in my district that I talked about in the beginning is maybe due in part to the issues, to the substance that has happened here; but in part it is due to the sense they have that this place is back at work in a way that it hasn't been. 
   So I am just so grateful for what Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek have been able to do for everyone, us and all of our constituents, over the past 4 years, and grateful to have a few moments.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I would like to thank Chairman Waxman for putting this very valuable amendment before us today. We've spent an awful lot of time on the Government Oversight Committee looking into the contracting practice of the Federal Government. I think this goes a very long way towards safeguarding our taxpayer dollars, and also shining some transparency on it, which is the piece of the amendment that I would like to speak on today. 
   This amendment includes legislation that passed the House on voice vote several weeks ago, the Government Funding Transparency Act. The act requires that companies that make almost every penny of their revenue from the Federal Government, essentially quasi-public agencies, requires them to disclose to the American public the amount of profit that they're taking off of those contracts. These companies making over 80 percent of their money shouldn't be allowed to hide this type of financial data from the American taxpayers. 
   I would like to thank Ranking Member Davis for working through this bill as it moved through the committee process. This really has moved from a contracting bill to a disclosure bill, one that I think is going to give the American public and this Congress the access to the data that they should have when we are awarding large contracts to essentially government agencies that don't have the requirements that other agencies and public vendors do. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Skelton as well for working through this amendment as we brought it forth today. I support its passage and the underlying legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (THE LIFE OF CATHERINE RORABACK -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and accomplishments of Catherine Roraback of Canaan, Connecticut. Ms. Roraback passed away on Wednesday, October 17 in Salisbury, Connecticut, and will be greatly missed by her family, by her community, and by her country. 
   Ms. Roraback was best known for successfully arguing the landmark case of Griswold v. Connecticut in front of the United States Supreme Court in 1965. This groundbreaking case overturned an 1849 Connecticut law that banned the use of contraception. And this historic decision established the right to privacy that exists to this day as the foundation of many of our most revered constitutional freedoms. 
   Ms. Roraback was the only woman in her graduating class from Yale Law School in 1948, and she quickly established a law practice dedicated to protecting the rights of those that she called the ``dissenters and the dispossessed.'' Her groundbreaking work in the Griswold case was simply an extension of her life's work, which included the founding of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union and serving on innumerable boards and commissions to serve her community and her State. 
   Mr. Speaker, Catherine Roraback was a national figure. But where she shined the brightest was at her desk in her law office in northwestern Connecticut, where she worked out of for almost her entire career. She was always a caring and fiercely intelligent adviser and advocate to her neighbors and her clients, and she was a mentor to generations of community leaders and advocates, including my friend and her cousin, State Senator Andrew Roraback, with whom I had the pleasure of serving in the State Senate for 4 years. 
   I had the pleasure of getting to know Ms. Roraback just a little in the last few years, and though we only got to spend a brief few moments together, I feel so blessed to have had the fleeting chance to get to know one of Connecticut's true heroes. She was an incredible woman with an incredible drive and a never erring sense of right and wrong. I was deeply honored to be her representative for the last 10 months, and I will strive every day to live according to her example. 
   In these very trying days, I think it's incredibly important to remember the lessons that Catherine Roraback leaves with us, the motivation that underlied her entire work as a lawyer and an advocate, because Catherine Roraback taught us that the basic rights that we enjoy every day to live and to speak freely cannot be dependent on one's lot in life. She also taught us that these rights, these precious civil liberties that we enjoy, cannot and should not be taken for granted. We must fight for them, now more than ever. 
   Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers go out to Catherine Roraback's family, her friends, and her beloved community.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, and I appreciate his promptness in being here as I share with him today. We trust that the other members of the 30-Somethings will join us here today, but it falls very often on the new members of the 30-Somethings to make sure that we are here to begin the sharing of good news with the American people. 
   And I hope there is good news, Mr. Altmire. I hope that people throughout this country who see the President's veto of this incredibly important bill, and you laid out very clearly and very succinctly what the President has vetoed, what he has said no to. We're talking about health care for kids. We're talking about good schools. We're talking about Head Start, medical research, home heating assistance for the elderly. And these are the basic building blocks of a compassionate society, and the President has said, very firmly and clearly, no to those. 
   And as you said, we're not very far away from having the requisite number of votes here on the House floor to override that veto. And I know that's kind of inside baseball for a lot of people, whether we have two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever the percentage is that we need. But it's important because, as you said, the President has found his veto pen for the first time in his tenure in office. And I think it's important to try to figure out what's different this year than as was the case in the last previous 6 years of his Presidency? And it's kind of funny because, if you look at the record, as you said, Mr. Altmire, it seems a little odd to be having lectures from this administration on fiscal responsibility because this President and the Republican Congress over the last 6 years have increased Federal spending by 50 percent, 50 percent just over 6 years. We've put $3 trillion on top of the deficit, on top of the debt that this country owes, as we've watched the President and this Congress continue to spend and continue to borrow. We've seen the amount of foreign-held debt, and you know, this is something that Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan have been talking about for years and years and years. We've seen the amount of foreign-held debt during that time double. This is all under a Republican-controlled Congress, both Houses, and a Republican administration. And during that entire time, the biggest piece of the budget that has exploded has been the funding for this war. 
   Now, those of us who paid attention when the President initially rolled out his plans to invade Iraq, his very rosy and optimistic projections of our success there and the cost of that war, well, remember that he told the American people, his administration told the Congress that he thought that this war wasn't going to cost more than $50 or $60 billion to get the job done? And also, if you remember, that the Iraqis were going to welcome the Americans as conquering heroes. Well, we know that that $50 to $60 billion was a figure of fiction, historical fiction now, Mr. Altmire, because now the estimates are that this war has cost us not $50 billion, not $100 billion, not $500 billion, but $1.3 trillion. And if we look forward to the projections associated with carrying out a war for the next 10 years, as this President has told this country he's planning to do, or that his war planners intend to do, we're talking about a $3.5 trillion commitment before this is all done. Now, that is a number that is almost impossible to get our hands around. I mean, what does $3.5 trillion mean to anybody? Well, what it means is that we're going to borrow more and more and more. We are going to put our children and our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren into hock in this country. 
   And so, when we hear this President sitting down and telling the American people that he's going to get tough on spending, and the way he's going to do that is by denying education to kids and health care to the sick and heat to the elderly, well, during that time he and his Republican Congress have spent like drunken sailors when it comes to a very mismanaged and misguided war in Iraq, you can't help but wonder where his priorities are and where this Congress' priorities were for the last several years. 
   So, it's all got to be, I think, in relation, Mr. Altmire, because we're making choices here, as we have for the last 6 years. We've chosen not to spend on American hospitals and American children. We've chosen not to spend to help our elderly get what they need in order to keep their house heated for the winter. And instead, we've chosen to build Iraqi buildings and Iraqi hospitals. We've chosen to put more and more troops in harm's way in a war that is making this country less safe in the long run rather than more safe. This is all about choices, and it's time that we started making some different ones. 
   And that's why we got sent here, Mr. Altmire. We got sent here to start investing in this country, to start making sure that our priorities look to this country, to the United States of America, first. And that's what the Labor-HHS appropriations bill does. It is the foundation of that compassionate government that we all believe in. It's about medical research. It's about schools. It's about hospitals. 
   And I hope, as you said, that there will be enough Republicans here who will join us, and we only need a handful, so that we can reverse that and bring back some common sense to our spending priorities in this country, Mr. Altmire.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Really, when it comes down to it, the only thing that's different here is the party that's writing the budget. I mean, really, when you look at it over time, what's different about the last six  budgets that this Congress passed that over time expanded Federal expenditures by 50 percent and the budget that we've passed, which simply reflects the fact that it costs a little bit more to heat your home if you're a senior, that it costs a little bit more to run a school than it did last year? What's different? I mean, the fact is is that it seems like it's just base partisan politics in the end, that all that really is different is that the Democrats are writing this budget this year and the Republicans were writing the last six budgets. And it is not a coincidence that over the last 6 years we saw nary a veto from this President while his party was in charge of the Congress, and now all of a sudden we have seen a flurry of vetoes on bills that reflect many of the same priorities, we think adjusted to make a little bit more sense for our communities, many of the same priorities that were reflected in the budgets for the last 6 years. And I think to a lot of us that came here to change the culture of this place, as much as we care about resetting our priorities and putting funding back into our communities, we also were sort of hoping that there was a little bit of a message sent in this election to change the partisan rancor that has really enveloped this place, and the President, by vetoing bills very similar to ones that he has signed in the past simply because a different party controls the House, I think does a disservice to the process and a disservice to the mandates that a lot of voters sent us here with, Mr. Altmire.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I just want to make a point. It is not like we are out on a limb here. We just saw a poll that came out a few days ago from CNN that shows that seven in 10 Americans oppose this war. That is the highest number, 68 percent, 70 percent of Americans oppose this war, the highest number since the war began.     
   We are seeing almost by the week, by the day, new generals, new senior retired American military officials coming out and breaking with this President. We have already seen the Iraq Study Group, we have already seen dozens of foreign policy experts come out and plead with this President. Even many of his best friends, many of his father's advisors have pleaded for a new course. 
   The Democrats are on the side of the American public. The Democrats are on the side of the foreign policy community on Iraq. The Democrats are on the side of an increasing number of retired military generals and officials on this issue. As you said, there is just a very loyal, very recalcitrant block of Republicans who refuse to abide by the growing will of the American public on this issue. There will be a price to be paid for this.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to offer an amendment to H.R. 3221, to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or better known as FERC, to hold public local meetings before issuing permits or authorizations that will affect land use decisions, if that meeting is requested by local citizens.  
   While FERC is required to have an open comment period before they issue a rule, there is currently no mechanism right now to require that they hold a public local hearing in an affected locality. 
   I bring this issue to the floor today, Mr. Chairman, because my constituents who live in the community surrounding Candlewood Lake in Connecticut were unable to secure a public hearing from FERC to air their concerns regarding a shoreline management plan that would impose new hefty fees on the residents that surround that lake and enjoy that lake. 
   This amendment is based on a simple premise: Public policymakers cannot and should not, frankly, act without the input of citizens who will be affected by the decisions that they make. 
   As legislators, we know we can't simply sample public opinion by sitting in our offices here in Washington and reading the mail that may come in. We need to go back to our districts and solicit opinion there. A regulatory agency should be held to the same standard, especially in relation to hydropower assets, around which many citizens reside. 
   My amendment is a commonsense solution to the problem that any of us could face. It does nothing to alter or constrain the decisions that FERC may ultimately make; it just ensures the commission would hear all sides before making any determination on land use issues and ensures that our constituents' voices are heard. 
   Mr. Chairman, I understand that this issue may need more time for the committee. 
   I would be happy to yield to the chairman for a short colloquy.

   Mr. Chairman, my intention is to withdraw this amendment. I look forward also to working with my colleagues on the greater issue of making sure that, in all cases, our constituents' voices are heard when these decisions are handed down. As we move more control over Federal power assets from States to the Federal Government, it seems that we should still have safeguards in place to make sure that local citizens' issues and concerns are taken into consideration by FERC, and I plan to continue my advocacy of that cause. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have the amendment withdrawn at this point. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Representative Sutton. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think we're on the precipice of an historic step forward in restoring the people's faith in this institution, but I understand how difficult this is to talk about. And giving the minority the benefit of the doubt, maybe that's why this House sat idly by for 12 years with no real major reforms to a very broken process. 
   But it's tough to talk about because it's not just about a broken process, it's about human nature. It's tough to talk about the failure of our ethics process because we're talking about the fallibility of all of us. It is against human nature, frankly, to rat out your friends, to investigate them, to punish your colleagues. And so that's why you can't just change people's perception of this place. You just can't fix the ethics process by tweaking the process that exists now. You have to admit the inherent fallibility of the ability for all of us to police ourselves and give that power to an independent body. 
   The cat is out of the bag, people figured this out long ago. There are too many Members that have violated the public trust, and they've watched too many other Members sit idly by. 
   Now, I, frankly, agree with my colleague Representative Space that this proposal could have been even a little bit stronger with the addition of subpoena power, but this is a major step forward and we should all support it. There is a generation of young people out there who stand on the precipice of losing all complete faith in government and in this institution. Tonight we have the chance to do right by them by correcting the mistakes of the past. 
   I thank Mr. Capuano and the task force for their hard work here, and I urge passage of the rule.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Mr. Altmire. I don't want to take too much time because I know the American people are eager to hear your detailed line-by-line analysis of the President's budget, so let me be brief. 
   You hit it on the head here. I mean, this budget that the President has proposed to us is the worst of both worlds. It cuts spending on programs that everyday middle-class families and seniors and the disabled use to simply grab hold of the apparatus of opportunity that has been stolen from them, and at the same time, it continues 
   to spend wildly in other parts of the budget. It continues to give away massive, unjustified tax breaks for the richest 1 percent of Americans that aren't even being asked for by many of those people. And it results in a pretty ugly picture over the next several years for this country if we were to adopt the budget that the President put before us. 
   It would mean massive cuts, as you've already laid out, to health care programs, to law enforcement programs. And, Mr. Altmire, this budget has got a 100-percent cut to the COPS program. The COPS program is the acronym for the community policing initiative that was started by President Clinton over 10 years ago. It is one of the most successful law enforcement programs that this Nation has ever seen. Any Member of this House on the Republican side of the aisle or the Democratic side of the aisle can just go down to their local police department, any one of them, and ask their local cops whether or not community policing has worked. It has. That's not me saying it, that's not just the statistics saying it, that's the experiences of thousands of community policemen who have been on the beat for years. 
   Now, what's happened over time is the Republican Congress year after year slashed and burned that line item, and so many communities either had  to take cops off the community policing beat or start picking up the tab themselves. That means increased property taxes for people because somebody has to pay for it. And this budget that we're looking at right now takes out the entire amount for community policing. I guess I just don't understand how you justify that. I mean, I would love to have somebody from the administration on this floor try to explain in a commonsense way why they don't believe that the experiences of thousands of communities and thousands of police officers is true, which is that community policing works. 
   But here's the other side of this equation, Mr. Altmire, and I know we're going to talk about this. At the same time, it's not like we're getting anywhere for all of the cuts in this budget because this budget envisions the Federal deficit continuing to explode. Now, this is a small little chart, you probably can't see it, but this is a pretty dramatic, but accurate, representation of what's going to happen to the Federal debt. 
   In 2001, we had about $5.8 trillion in Federal debt, and you can at least see that it only is going in one direction. Under the President's budget, by 2013 we're going to owe $13.3 trillion to foreign nations, Mr. Altmire. 
   We are cutting funding for programs that matter, we are spending money wildly in other parts of the budget, primarily in the defense budget, and what we get in the end is a Federal budget that is more out of whack, more out of balance than it ever has been, and families who are struggling, amidst this economic slowdown, who are going to see less services and less help from their government.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let me stop you there for a second, because I liked what he said, too. But I would have liked it if he had said it for the last 7 years of his administration. I mean, you know, I hope it wasn't lost on anyone watching that State of the Union speech that for the last seven Congresses, as the Republican-led majority has spiraled spending out of control, has added on political earmark after political earmark, the President was absolutely silent on that matter. And it is just incredibly convenient that in the year in which the Democrats take control of the House of Representatives is the first year that we hear in a State of the Union speech the President talking about grants in Federally approved budgets.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let's hammer that home in a real world way for people. What does it mean when the President's budget reduces payments to nursing homes? In Connecticut, we have had a real crisis with a particular nursing home group that has gotten a lot of attention in the paper, Mr. Altmire, in the last several months regarding some really inexcusable conditions in those nursing homes, low levels of staffing, no remediation when violations had been found. And that problem is not going to get better if the solution from the Federal Government is to cut the funding that goes to those nursing homes. These nursing homes are already stretched very thin. There already isn't enough staff to cover the residents and make sure that seniors that are staying there are living under safe and humane conditions at all times in some places. 
   This cut that the President is talking about in the cut and reimbursement rates to nursing homes is going to have a direct effect on the care that many thousands, hundreds of thousands of seniors get in this country. Your loved ones, your neighbors, their care is going to be compromised by this. 
   The safety of your community is potentially going to be compromised by a zeroing out of the COPS budget. Communities will be less safe because there will be fewer community police on the beat. Those are the real world consequences of the budget that the President is putting before us. 
   And the question is just a matter of choices. And that's what I hope that every Member of this House goes out and endeavors to ask over the next month or so as we debate this Bush budget, which is are you sure that your community wants to spend another $70 billion in Iraq rather than put cops on the beat or put staff in your grandmother's nursing home? Are you sure that the constituents in your district want to give away another massive tax break to the richest 1 percent of Americans instead of putting cops on the beat or putting staff in your grandmother's nursing home? Those are the questions that people are going to have to ask. And I think, Mr. Altmire, there's only one answer to that in any district in this country whether you are represented by a Republican or a Democrat.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I just want to share a story with you, if you will yield, Mr. Altmire. I was getting on a plane this morning to come down to Washington from my district, and an older gentleman recognized me as I was going through the security checkpoint. And he stopped me, and he said, I have written you a letter. I've got a real problem with what you're doing down there. And I said, Talk to me about it. 
   And he looked me in the eye and started to tear up a little bit, and he said, My wife died of cancer last year. And he said, I can't for the life of me understand why you guys, and he lumped us all together, and I tried to explain the differences a little bit to him, but it was a very emotional moment. He said, I can't understand how you guys are cutting the funding for the programs 
   that might save the life of the next wife who has cancer and instead you're spending money, billions of dollars, overseas on a war that's making us less safe. And he was tearing up. 
   I mean, this is a personal and emotional issue for so many people in this country, as it should be, because they know. They read about the advances that are being made in science. Whether it be stem cell research or the thousands of other lines of inquiry that are making progress every day in this country, they know that it could be their loved one's disease whose cure or treatment is right around the corner. This should be a personal issue to everyone in this Chamber, and everyone should have to answer that question that you posed as to how on Earth we can pass a budget that freezes medical research that is going to cure diseases and make people better just in order to balloon a deficit, just in order to fund a war, just in order to fund massive tax cuts for the wealthy. The priorities are just so screwed up, and any person in this world can tell a story of a loved one who would be hurt by those cuts.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. At the very time, Mr. Altmire, where our country is most in need of a skilled workforce. I mean you know it, because you do the same tours that I do to manufacturing facilities and worksites, that every company in our district is screaming to us, Do something about the workforce. I can hire people if you make sure that they are trained and educated and ready to work on day one. And so as we're sort of seeing a massive slowdown in this economy, potentially on the way to a recession, this is the very worst time to be cutting back our commitment to higher education programs, to worker and job training programs. And it runs totally counter to what we have been doing here in this Congress. 
   I mean, we need to remind the President that he signed into law the biggest expansion in college aid since the GI bill, increasing the maximum allowable Pell grant, the direct grant to students by $500, providing for loan forgiveness to potentially tens or hundreds of thousands of students who go into public service professions; and, most importantly, cutting the interest rate for student loans in half from 6.8 to 3.4 percent, which is going to save the average college student in Connecticut about $4,000 over the lifetime of the repayment of their loan. That's real dollars when you couple it together with the other benefits that that package had. 
   And that was a bipartisan success. That was conceived by Democrats. It took Democrats taking control of Congress to put that on the agenda. But there were a lot of our friends on the Republican side of the aisle that voted for it, and there was a President, maybe reluctantly, because he changed his position over time, but there was a President that signed that. 
   So we have come together as a Congress to recognize the importance of helping kids and helping families pay for the increasing cost of higher education, and we should especially recognize the importance of that when our economy is having trouble getting its engine going. That's when we should be investing in workers. That's when we should be investing in education. And  as you have so ably and accurately outlined, Mr. Altmire, this President's budget does an immediate 180 degree turn on the investments that we have been making and should continue to make in higher education.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. It doesn't make sense. It wouldn't make sense even in good economic times, Mr. Altmire, because you know even in the so-called boom years of the 1990s and earlier in this decade, those jobs were still leaving Pennsylvania. Those jobs were still leaving the northwestern part of Connecticut. And you always need to have just that safety net, just enough help for people to bounce back, because the folks that live in our districts, as they do across the Nation, these are proud, proud people. They want a job. They want to work hard. They do not want to be out of work. They do not want to be undertrained. And they are going to take the opportunities that we give them just to be able to bounce back and reenter the economy. That is all we are talking about with these programs. This isn't permanent job assistance. This isn't the welfare state. This is just, listen, your company went out of business, shipped their jobs over to China, shipped their jobs down to Mexico. We're going to help you for a certain period of time learn a new skill so you can get back and be a productive member of society. That is an important project to undertake in any economic time but most critical now when more and more people need that help, Mr. Altmire, that is critical right now.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let's view this through a broader prism, and I think if you do, you see that this cut, in particular, is even crueler because we were set up for this moment. I mean, this has been 7 years of an energy policy which has been designed to do only one thing, a cynic might say, put more money into the hands of the big international oil companies, run by a lot of the friends of the folks that are in this administration. We have had an energy policy which has done nothing, has done nothing, essentially, to decrease the amount that people are paying to gas up their car or heat their homes. We have profits of record magnitudes coming from ExxonMobil and Chevron and BP and all of these major multinational oil conglomerates. We have had a Federal policy, led by this President and probably more accurately led by this Vice President, Vice President Cheney in his secret, closed-door meetings that have constructed most of this energy policy, that have stolen millions of dollars from American consumers with the tax breaks and regulatory giveaways to the oil industry that have allowed them to continue with no abandon to rip off American consumers. The LIHEAP program is just an added insult to an energy policy which has been taking money out of American taxpayers' pockets and putting it into the oil companies' treasuries. 
   The LIHEAP program simply says this, this has been the policy of this administration and the Republican Congress for the last 8 years, for the last 6 years, they have said, we're going to do nothing to help you with prices, we're just going to continue to watch energy prices spiral and spiral and spiral and have no short-term or long-term strategy to do anything about it. But on the back end, we're going to help you a little bit with some subsidy dollars for the people in your community that are so hard up they are going to need some help to pay those bills or else they would freeze in their houses, which is what you're talking about. You're talking about people who would potentially freeze in their houses if they don't get a little bit of help from their government to pay for their heating oil bills, largely seniors on fixed incomes in our community. And now not only do we have an administration that is not willing to work with us on reforming our energy policy to break our addiction to foreign-produced oil, to finally get a grip on these spiraling oil prices because we have got an administration that cares more about the pockets of their oil company friends than the pockets of the regular, average, everyday consumers, now also we are taking away that small, tiny little subsidy that prevents people from freezing in their homes because they can't afford to heat it. 
   When you step back a little bit, when you are right in that budget, everybody here should make it one of their top priorities, whether you live in a cold weather State or a warm weather State, to put the money back for the LIHEAP program. Put the money back for the heating assistance for low-income people. But let's also understand that it is even more egregious given  the fact that we could have done something 10 years ago, 5 years ago, to prevent ourselves from getting into a position where we are continuing to subsidize these big energy companies and have to be reliant on low-income heating assistance to keep people warm in the winters.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Just to make one point there, the Democratic budget that we passed last year balances the Federal budget in 5 years. For the first time since the Clinton administration, we are going to have a balanced Federal budget. This isn't pie-in-the-sky rhetoric that you are putting out there, 
   Mr. Altmire. The Democratic budget found a way that we passed at the end of last year to invest money in education, in environmental protection, in health care and do it in a responsible way that provides for a balanced budget in 5 years. There is a way to do it, and we are finding it here. We can do it again.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I know we have our freshman colleagues coming in after us, so we are going to give them some room here. 
   But I want to turn for a few minutes to a subject that you alluded to earlier, and I know you may have some more areas here in which we want to talk about what the devastating cuts are going to do, but I want to talk for a second before we hand it off to some of our other freshman colleagues about what is not in the budget, and you alluded to it before, most importantly, the cost of the war isn't truly reflected in this budget. 
   In fact, some staff members on the Republican side made a comment earlier today that they even admit that the $70 billion that is put in this budget is essentially just a downpayment on what we are going to need to perpetuate the costs of this war in Iraq for the rest of the year. And it is just I think becoming impossible for our constituents to really understand why we can't include the costs of this war, whether you agree with it or disagree with it. We will save that for another day. Mr. Altmire, you know where I am on this question. I believe that we should get ourselves out of this mess sooner rather than later in a planned-for way. But while we are there, and while we are still spending money, let's pay for it. Let's budget for it responsibly. 
   Now, I think you could probably make the argument in the first year or 2 years of this conflict that it was emergency spending, and that there was an argument to be made in the first few years of the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan that we were going to need to borrow some money for that. I have no problem understanding that in emergency circumstances, we are going to have to do some deficit spending. Nobody likes that. But with regard to the economic stimulus package that we are passing, it makes sense in very narrow circumstances to borrow some money in order to get some short-term gain when the spending is on an emergency basis. But we are 5 years into this war now, both in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is not catching us by surprise anymore. It is not an emergency expenditure anymore. We can plan years in advance for the money that we are spending on this war. There is no justification for this money not being in the budget. What happens is it is just hidden. When you get these figures about how big the deficit is going to be when we pass the President's budget, which we obviously won't do, but if we were to pass the President's budget, that doesn't even take into account the real costs of this war. If I were a taxpayer out there that was for this war, or if I were a taxpayer out there that was against this war, I would be greatly aggrieved, and I think they are greatly aggrieved by the fact that we are not paying for it. Well, we're going to. We're going to. Because these bills, whether they are on the tab of the war or whether they are on the tab of the domestic programs that haven't been paid for for years, they are going to be paid at some point. Those bills and those promissory notes are going to come due, and they are going to be paid for by your children and my future children, and your future grandchildren and my future grandchildren. We are hamstringing generations to come to pay for the costs of this war, and we should account for it. 
   The second thing that is not covered, Mr. Altmire, is this thing that we keep on talking about down here called the alternative minimum tax. Now, I know there are still a lot of people out there that don't understand what the alternative minimum tax is because year after year, Congress has done the right thing and has held in abeyance the adjustment to the alternative minimum tax that would essentially make it cover most middle-class taxpayers in this country. In my district in Connecticut we have about 20,000 people that pay the alternative minimum tax that was initially set up just to cover the richest of the rich who weren't paying any tax through deductions or were paying very little tax through deductions and credits.     
   If we don't fix the Alternative Minimum Tax again this year, in my district it is going to go from like 19,000 people paying it to like 80,000 people paying it. It is going to be a huge problem, thousands of additional dollars in tax obligations for millions of Americans. Well, the President doesn't say anything about that in this budget. I think he just assumes that we are going to fix it again, but he doesn't put the cost of doing that in the budget. 
   So, if you tack on the costs of the war that aren't in this budget, if you tack on the costs of once again fixing the Alternative Minimum Tax which we should do and put that in the budget, this deficit is enormous, is enormous. I think we should be having a real argument over the real cost of this budget. Through all this sort of gimmickry that we see, all this trickery in how the numbers are accounted for, the  war is not in there, the Alternative Minimum Tax fix isn't in there. 
   I know this sort of goes over the head of a lot of people out there, because they say this is just the logistics of a budget. This is just numbers, where you put one number, where you put another number. It matters, because you can't hide money that we have to spend. Whether you put it in the budget or out of the budget, if you spend the dollar, somebody is going to have to pay for it. Maybe not now, but in 10 years or 20 years. 
   Mr. Altmire, part of the reason that the 30-Something Working Group talks so much about deficit spending is because we are going to be around when those bills come due. We have an obligation, I think a special obligation as some of the younger Members of this House, to cry bloody murder when this President tries to do more deficit spending than he is even telling us here, because it is going to be our generation and our kids' generation that are going to have to pay for it.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. This is all sort of hard to take in. As you said, that massive budget document gets dropped on us, and the parade of horrors is endless in terms of all of the commonsense programs, whether it is homeland security, whether it is law enforcement, whether it is health care, whether it is research spending. It is just hard to handle. It is like it gets your brain going in overdrive. Then you got to step back for a second. I think it does make sense to step back and have a little bit of faith that now cooler and calmer heads can prevail. 
   It used to be when that budget was dropped on Congress' desk in January or February that it basically was the law of the land, that with a few changes here or there, the Republican-led Congress was going to rubber stamp that President's budget. 
   As much as Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan and Ms. Wasserman Schultz before we got here would come down and try to expose all of those damaging harmful cuts to middle-class families throughout this country, to people trying to make their way in this world, that it didn't matter, because so long as Republicans controlled this place, there was going to be essentially a rubber stamp on all of those cuts and more massive deficit spending, the most fiscally irresponsible set of Congresses in our lifetime. 
   That has changed now. That is different. And, listen. We are all fallible. We don't get every single choice right, even on our side of the aisle, Mr. Altmire. But the good news is, is that we are going to find a way to push back most of those cuts, if not all of them. We are going to find a way to pass another budget which gets us a little bit closer to a balanced budget. 
   Now, the way we do that is sit here and expose all of the very harmful cuts and all the very harmful spending in this President's budget. But the American people should have some faith that you sent a new Democratic Congress here. You sent this new freshman class that we are a part of to pick apart that budget for the first time, and decide not only how to more compassionately spend American taxpayer dollars, but to more smartly spend them so that we are not racking up those huge deficits, so that we are starting to balance budgets again. 
   So this is all very damaging news, and I know we are probably going to close on some of the worse news in the budget, but I think people should have faith that we now have leadership in charge of this Congress that is going to be able to pull apart that budget and start setting us on a commonsense and compassionate course again.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. It just begs the question, Mr. Altmire. What was going through the minds of the Bush administration budget negotiators when they were sitting at the table last year negotiating with us as we were insisting on the biggest increase in veterans funding in the history of the program? I mean, we pushed that and pushed that and pushed that. You were courageous from the very first day that you got here in making that a priority. 
   It is just so terrible to think that, well, the Bush administration was sitting there finally saying yes to that enormous and important increase in veterans funding, that all the while they were drafting that budget. All the while as they were agreeing just 60 days ago to the biggest increase in veterans funding since the VA program began, they were drafting secretly a budget that was going to reverse everything they just agreed to. That just speaks to the worst of what happens in Washington, D.C., Mr. Altmire.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado. 
   Mr. Speaker, if I could just tell one story about a small State in the northeast, Connecticut, a place where we made 2 years ago a historic $100 million investment in stem cell research. And there will be others that will speak much more ably about the moral and ethical and scientific rationales for the bill before us; let me talk about the practical rationales from our standpoint in Connecticut. 
   Our success investing $10 million a year in stem cell research was a bittersweet one, because it was only made necessary by the failure of the Federal Government to act on this question. We responded to the cries of thousands of families throughout Connecticut that wanted us to give them not only hope but tangible support when it came to researching cures and treatments for the diseases that afflicted their family members. 
   The problem being that, because of the Federal prohibition on the use of Federal funds for scientific research, Connecticut is now having to do back flips to find ways to invest our money. We are having to invest in bricks and mortar, invest in stealing sciences from other of the few remaining States that allow for State funding of stem cell research. 
   This is a highly inefficient means to spend the State of Connecticut's money, and one of the reasons that I was sent down to this august body was to make stem cell research, to make investment in scientific research, not a 50-State strategy, but to make it a national priority. 
   We hear from people on the other side of the aisle, I think, a very wise caution that we shouldn't make promises today or throughout the debate that embryonic stem cell research will definitely lead to a cure of this disease or a treatment for that disease. But the point being here is that there are no promises, there are no guarantees, but that what our families wants is a removal of the ceiling that we have placed on scientific research in our States and our Federal institutions so that that hope may become a reality. 
   From the citizens of Connecticut who have made great strides on this, as the author of that bill in the State of Connecticut, I am very proud, ten times prouder than I was to vote for it in the State of Connecticut, to vote for it today.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (THE DEFICIT -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, my friend from Colorado. I am glad you brought up this issue that has come up today. Really you couldn't write this. You couldn't make a movie that was more salacious than the details that are being unveiled today in an article you referenced from the Washington Post regarding not only, it appears, monetary favors, gifts, meals, trips, but sex and drugs. This is a Hollywood blockbuster that is being unveiled here, and it is all on our dime. 
   What you are saying here is certainly relevant to the question of how we are running our energy policy in this country, that we have an administration that is so cozy to the energy industry that it is not just leases that are being negotiated, but apparently it is drugs and sexual favors being negotiated. 
   But what we are dealing with really here, Mr. Perlmutter, is a government run amuck. This is, I think, symptomatic of a much larger problem. We are talking here about the economic disaster that this administration has wrought, and you can calculate that in so many different ways: wages flat while GDP goes up; deficits running into the trillions of dollars. 
   But what we also have seen is an administration that just can't run government any longer. They are wasting our taxpayer dollars. Now, they also happen to be wasting all of the money that they are borrowing from foreign banks, but we are wasting a lot of our money too. 
   It is incredibly relevant that we are here trying to expose the economic disaster that the Bush administration has left us with that we are going to change with the new administration. It is relevant that we are also talking about this new revelation. 
   You have mentioned some of the details, but what we found in the Interior Department is what investigators call a ``culture of substance abuse and promiscuity.'' Nineteen oil marketers and other employers in the office are accused of having personal and sometimes sexual relationships with representatives of a group of favorite oil and gas companies from 2002 to 2006. Mr. Speaker, this is from the Washington Post story today. 
   This is what this government has left us with, an economy that is suffering, deficits that are rising, and a government that just doesn't work any longer, whether it is the misuse of our funds in Iraq. We discovered in the Government Oversight Committee that Mr. Welch and I serve on that $9 billion was wasted, unaccounted for at the beginning of the war, sometimes thrown out of pickup trucks in duffel bags and never, ever seen again. Or whether it is our response to Katrina and Rita, in which we left thousands, tens of thousands of residents helpless and hopeless. And now today we find that we have unbelievably inappropriate relationships between the government and the oil and gas companies seeking to lease our lands. 
   This is an economy that is in trouble because of the policies of this administration. This is a government which has simply fallen apart at the seams because of mismanagement. And it all speaks to the change we so desperately need. No more of the same. 
   John McCain's campaign, as we know, is run by the same crowd of lobbyists who have run the Bush administration for the last 8 years. We need a real change. This Congress with Democrats in charge has started it, but it comes to a completion this November. All of it stops, the mismanagement of this war, the disastrous response to natural disasters and these new revelations about the corruption still endemic in our government. 
   Ms. Sutton, it can all change this November.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California for yielding. 
   We talked a lot about how this bill is great for kids. I want to join Mr. Altmire in talking about this bill is great for seniors as well. 
   Four years ago this House passed an expansion of the Medicare program to cover drugs. It should have done it a long time ago. The problem was when you finally did it under Republican control, it ended up benefiting the drug companies and insurance companies and really being a burden for many senior citizens. That ends in large part today with the passage of this bill. 
   The underlying CHAMP Act today is going to finally allow seniors to be able to switch their plans when the plans change the drugs that they cover. It is going to begin to remove the doughnut hole, especially for the most vulnerable Medicare recipients out there. And it is finally going to get rid of those burdensome late penalties for the lowest of income seniors. 
   This bill is undoubtedly a great bill for kids. This bill is also going to be a great step forward for the millions of seniors around this country who have been struggling with the Medicare part D program for the last 4 years. 
   I thank the gentleman for his work on this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I am especially proud to rise today in honor or the Rotella Interdistrict Magnet School in Waterbury, Connecticut, which recently received the Ronald Simpson Deserved Merit Award. This award, considered the highest recognition for magnet schools in the Nation, is given to only one school a year for its exceptional academic standards and achievements. 
   The Rotella School is a dynamic learning community of 600 students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. Rotella serves urban and suburban students who represent a diverse group of backgrounds from around Waterbury. Its unique, art-based curriculum challenges students to excel, and encourages them to express themselves through arts. 
   Students who are exposed to the arts have higher test scores, better school attendance and increased self-discipline. Rotella is a testament to the power of arts in education. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply proud to stand here today in recognition of Rotella, its administrators, its students for their contribution to our community. They are truly an inspiration to Waterbury. I also commend Rotella's principal, Gina Calabrese, for outstanding work at Rotella and receiving this distinguished award.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND MANUFACTURING STIMULATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Chair, my thanks to my friend, Mr. Wu, for leading this debate today. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act. 
   The time has come for our country as a whole to stop ceding progress in science and technology to our competitors overseas. As one of the younger Members of this Chamber, I know that it is this generation's responsibility to keep our country competitive with countries like Japan, China, and India, whose young scientists and engineers are making new technological discoveries every day. 
   H.R. 1868 is part of the Speaker's Innovation Agenda to address how the United States should create a new generation of innovative thinkers and an educated, skilled workforce in science, math, engineering, and information technology. This bill makes a sustained commitment to Federal research and development, and will promote private sector innovation and provide small businesses with the tools to encourage entrepreneurial innovation and job creation throughout the country. 
   The Innovation Agenda is of particular importance to me as the Representative to Connecticut's Fifth District. We used to be the vanguard of manufacturing in the Fifth District; it is the home of Stanley Tool, of Scoville Brass, Torrington Ball Bearing Company, the fashioner of ball bearings where my grandfather and great-grandfather worked. 
   The days of those large manufacturing plants, at least in the Fifth Congressional District, are days of the past. However, my district now stands at the precipice of a new manufacturing era. 
   As I travel around my district, I am struck by how many small, high-tech manufacturers are setting up shop in this corner of the world. For example, in Torrington, high-tech companies are sprouting up on the grounds of the former Torrington Ball Bearing plant. In Danbury, in the shadow of a deserted hat manufacturing plant, a company that specializes in homeland security devices is growing. And in Waterbury, at an old brass factory, Luvata is making wire for an international consortium creating the world's first nuclear fusion device. 
   These small manufacturers are struggling every day with rising electricity costs and a lack of qualified workers to fill their growing job demands. This is why the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, a national network of local centers that are set up to help these small manufacturers, are so critical to my district and districts like mine. This program is an effective public-private partnership that helps to leverage State and Federal dollars into private investment funds for these smaller manufacturers. 
   The importance of small manufacturers to America cannot be overstated. It is these small manufacturing plants where the most innovative work is being done. That is why I am so proud of where the Fifth District stands as it is ready to lead in this new era. 
   Lastly, I just would like to voice my support for the Baldrige National Quality Program, named for former Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. The awards given by the President to businesses that live by Mr. Baldrige's strong belief and quality of performance standards, his widow, Midge Baldrige of Woodbury, Connecticut, and a friend. It is an honor to represent her. 
   I thank the gentleman for the time, I thank his efforts on this measure, and I urge passage this afternoon here in the House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Well, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) for yielding. 
   One of the things I realized when I came down here in January was that you get a lot of analogies, and some of them work, some of them don't. But listening to our colleagues criticize the budget, the continuing resolution we just passed here, you kind of think of the old ``bull in the china shop'' analogy. 
   This is kind of like the bull walking into the china shop spending a good half an hour breaking everything in the china shop; the owner finally having the good sense to kick him out, and then him showing up about 2 days later and asking why everything hasn't been fixed yet. I mean, that is essentially, what has happened here is that there has been so much damage, Mr. Speaker, done to this budget by virtue of nine of the 11, nine of the 11 appropriations bills not being completed by the end of business. 
   And an important thing to note is that, you know, Congress was back here in the holiday season in November and December trying to finish those budget bills. And I am just learning, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, about the budget process, but from what I know, November, December is pretty late to be even working on those budget bills. Those budget bills were supposed to be done over the summer and fall. And so even giving themselves an extra 4 or 5 months to complete those bills, they still weren't done on time. 
   And so when the Democrats finally were put back in charge of this place by virtue of the millions of Americans who stood up across this country to start putting common sense middle class values first, the people who put Mr. Altmire and myself here in Congress, when they finally, we finally sort of reentered the china shop and realized that everything had been broken, we realized it was going to take a little while to clean everything up. And what we did today, this continuing resolution which keeps this government running for the next several months, is an important first step because there are some critical programs, veterans benefits at the top of that list, Mr. Altmire, that are funded here. 
   What else are we talking about? We are talking about Pell grants. Even after coming before this body and, with remarkable bipartisan support, decreasing the rate of student loans for millions of students across this country, we came back in this budget, we increased the maximum Pell grant by $260, to over $4,000, $4,300 for the average student. 
   We put in new money or in schools that are failing to meet the Head Start standards. Mr. Altmire, you know that both of us heard so much about that from our school districts over the course of the campaign and over the course of the last month. Now, 6,700 schools across this country that are failing to meet those No Child Left Behind standards are going to get new funding from this government in order to keep on operating. 
   We increased community health center funding by $207 million. Community health centers in this very broken health care system are sometimes the place of last resort, often the place of only resort for so many uninsured families. We are now going to make sure that they get the funding that they deserve. 
   So in so many ways we started to clean up the mess that that bull made for the last 12 years. We are starting to put the china back together. We are starting to buy a little bit of new stuff to put on the shelves. And it is going to take a little while. It is going to take a little while. 
   But it is important to remember that the work we did here today, I think, is just a beginning on that front, Mr. Altmire. And I join Ms. Wasserman Schultz and Mr. Ryan in commending you for standing up for the veterans in your district, because when you speak for those veterans, it is not just in your district, it is for all the veterans in my district and, as an extension, it is for all the future veterans, because as you know, we are so lucky to have an all volunteer military. 
   But if they think that by going into the service they will return home and find a country and a Nation that does not honor their service, well, then we are going to have a lot harder time than we are already having finding people to fight the future battles and wars that this country may engage in. 
   I would yield. I see Mr. Meek has joined us. But I would yield to Mr. Altmire and thank him again for his advocacy over the past several weeks.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Would the gentlewoman yield for a moment? And I think she is exactly right, and I think that that disconnect that you talk about, that certainly was in existence here for a very long time was one of the reasons why we now have a Democratic majority. The people last summer were fueling up their cars at $3.50 a gallons. We are finding that all of a sudden, they were having to pay $50 co-pays rather than $25 co-pays. And they looked at a Congress which seemed pretty incredulous to their concerns, that seemed to watch without listening. And you are right, people get hurt by the decisions they make down here. And I will give you an example. 
   In my district I have a senior housing complex in Torrington, major place where a lot of seniors live in one of the biggest cities in my district, and we have had some security problems there, some people coming in off the streets and had a couple violent incidents. Well, most of the facility and the staff there are financed through Federal grants. Well, because this Congress, over the last 12 years, slashed Federal housing funds to the bone, they have had to make major layoffs at that housing complex. 
   In fact, it finally came down to a very difficult but unfortunately necessary decision that that housing facility made to lay off their security guards. That is going to put hundreds of senior citizens at risk in this senior housing complex. And they come to their local elected officials, their State-elected officials and ask, what can you do to help? And everybody points back to where the problem came  from. It was years of neglect down here in Washington of housing programs, just as there were years of neglect years to health care programs, years of neglect to defense and certain national security programs. 
   And in order to reinstill that commitment to the seniors of Torrington, to those veterans in Pennsylvania, it is going to take a little while. 
   But if you are back in your communities, if you are talking to people, regular middle-class, working folks people, you will hear those stories on how the votes we take here affect people back in Connecticut, back in Florida, back in Pennsylvania. And for some reason, whether it was the power that went to people's head, whether it was the pomp and circumstance that surrounds being a Member of Congress, for some reason, over the last 12 years, and in particular, I think, Mr. Altmire, over the past 4, 5, or 6 years, there was a wall that was put up around Washington, D.C., and folks that were controlling the committees here and the budget here just were not listening to people back in State of Connecticut, State of Pennsylvania, Florida, and throughout this country, because if they did, they would know we have to put more money in housing. 
   If they listened to those veterans that you and I talk to every day at people's doors, they would know that men and women who came back from Iraq, came back from Vietnam, World War II veterans are struggling. And what we are now doing here in starting to clean up that mess is also to start listening again. And I believe Ms. Wasserman Schultz is very correct on that notion. 
   I yield to Mr. Meek.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, let me thank you, Mr. Meek, on behalf of my constituents and the people throughout this country for the vigilance that you and Ms. Wasserman Schultz and Mr. Ryan showed for the last 2 years, and in your case longer than that. There were a lot of things you could be doing late at night when Mr. Altmire and I might have caught you on TV into the wee hours. But you were out here spreading the message that it was time for working class, regular folks throughout this country to have their day here again. There had been enough time for the special interests and lobbyists and everyone else to have their day in Congress. It was time for regular people to have their day in the people's House. 
   I want to add something. We use this term ``Republican leadership,'' and I think that is important. Because one of the things that you have figured out over the last couple of weeks is that there is a difference between the Republican leadership and a lot of the rest of the folks in the Republican Party. 
   Maybe I should be careful to not give too much credit to the other side. But it seems like on every measure the Republican leadership trots out and says, the Republicans are going to be against raising the minimum wage, and they turn around to see who is following. And, guess what, they vote for it. 
   The Republican leadership says, we are going to be against cutting the student loan interest rates. They run out here and turn around to see who is following them, and there are even more of their colleagues voting with the Democrats. 
   They say, this process is broken, we are going to 
   vote against this continuing resolution, and they turn around, and there are 50-some-odd of their Members supporting it. 
   Why? Because, on average, we had 60-some-odd votes for every piece of the 100 hours agenda from the Republican side and 50-plus votes for the continuing resolution. 
   Why do you have so many Republican votes? Because there are Republicans, just as there are Democrats, who are in touch with their constituents. When they go home for weekends, they hear about the struggles that middle-class families are going through to pay for health care and education.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. That's right. I think what happened here for the last 12 years, the agenda on the House floor was a Republican agenda. Republicans supported it, and they twisted some Republican arms to support it. 
   The agenda that is now before the House of Representatives is a people's agenda. That is why you see Republicans and Democrats supporting it. Because the agenda doesn't have to do with somebody on the seventh floor of the Republican National Committee or somebody on the third floor of the Democratic National Committee. The agenda has to do with the people that we meet at the diner and the senior housing center. 
   That is why I think for the next 2 years, I know for the next 2 years, we are going to see Republicans and Democrats coming together. Because this isn't a party agenda anymore. This is a people's agenda. That may sound corny, but it is probably the best way to articulate what is happening here. 
   As a new Member, it fills me with joy and pride to be part of this.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. The Wall Street fire department is well-equipped. The Main Street fire department, it's gone underfunded and undermanned and unequipped for the last 12 years, particularly for the last 6 years. 
   We were very quick to go and help out our friends on Wall Street, but everybody sat here with their hands, you know, on their seats, tied behind their backs, when all these families needed a little help, when a kid who couldn't get an education in an inner city needed to access the apparatus to opportunity that all the rest of us had, when that small business that was about to go under because it couldn't find the health-care insurance to keep its employees on staff needed a little assistance. The little guys, when they needed the fire trucks, they weren't there. But when the big guys needed them, they got there. 
   And so I think you're exactly right, it's just a matter of consistency. Listen, government certainly can be an agent of help to people who need some assistance. But it shouldn't just be the big Wall Street firms. It should be regular, average, everyday families out there. 
   And to Mr. Perlmutter, just a word of warning. I know you're sort of new to the 30-Somethings here, but we don't use Latin. It's just a rule, and I hope you will take that under advisement if you join us from here on out. 
   Listen, I thank my friends for letting me join a little late here. I just wanted to maybe add one thought to this, and maybe you have covered it already. But I think people are searching today for the reasons, as Mr. Altmire said, as to why last night AIG got the brass ring. Now, why did they get help and Lehman Brothers didn't and IndyMac didn't? Exactly why did they get help? 
   Well, part of it I think is that this is a company that does tremendous international business. This is, at some level, a representation of American economic power throughout the globe, economic power that has been so greatly compromised by this administration as we have sold this country to foreign banks and foreign governments, that part of the reason, I think, that we have decided to choose AIG is because we are in such a precarious situation with regard to all of the foreign lenders and foreign governments that hold our currency, that hold American money through the $9 trillion, $10 trillion that we have given out in notes through the Federal debt, that we are now in a crisis position, that when an American firm that is a representation of our power across this globe comes under threat, we have to prop them up. Because if we are seen as economically weak around this globe, those countries are going to start calling their notes, those countries are going to start asking for their money back. 
   And that's when the real economic ruin happens, when the $9 trillion that we have out to lenders across this globe, the record amounts that foreign governments hold, when they start to call in that money that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress sent out to them in record deficits and record debts, then we're in real trouble. 
   And so part of the reason I think we're standing here and trying to answer the question as to why AIG is at the top of the headlines is because we are trying now to make up for the terrible economic policies of the Bush administration that John McCain seeks to perpetuate.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I just wanted to throw something on top of that, just to give you an example. You're giving one kind of example. Let me throw another one on, as to what it means when you regulate the small banks but you don't regulate the investment banks, you don't regulate the Fannies and the Freddies of the world. 
   Local banks are still in business, largely, because they have government regulation--sensible regulation, some of it; some of it a little bit too much--that requires them to be appropriately leveraged. They have 4:1, 5:1, 6:1 leverage rates. Fannie and Freddie had 60:1 leverage ratios, just unsustainable. The investment banks that went under, Bear Stearns, 35:1 leverage ratios, money they didn't have. So that's what we're talking about here. 
   We need to do something about the regulatory burden that is crippling a  lot of those small businesses. But we need to understand that it's really the big guys that need to be part of the conversation that the small businesses, the small banks have been a part of for a long time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend Chairman Brady for bringing this legislation to the floor today, and for his work to ensure that our veterans are full and able participants in our democracy. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, last week, the VA revised its wrongheaded directive barring nonpartisan voter registration drives at VA facilities. Clearly, the VA felt the overwhelming bipartisan pressure from local, state and federal members who supported this legislation, as well as the Secretaries of State and countless veterans throughout the country who rightfully decried it. We have asked enormous sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, and it is simply unconscionable to deny them the right to participate in a government for which they have so valiantly served and fought for. 
   However, our presence here today attests to the fact that this fight is not yet over--while the VA has acted wisely in withdrawing their directive, they still retain the ability to reinstate it at some future date. The VA's recent policy shifts on voting registration have been sudden and unpredictable, and there is precious little assurance that they will not undergo another change of heart. 
   That is why I am a strong supporter of H.R. 6625. I have been to Connecticut's VA Hospitals and clinics, and I have seen and spoken with the generations of proud veterans those facilities care for and serve. They want to be able to enjoy the freedoms they worked to defend, and they deserve to be able to do so at VA facilities. Connecticut's Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General have joined this fight and support the legislation before us because they know our veterans' rights should not just be protected today, but for generations to come as well. 
   Not only will H.R. 6625 guarantee the right of veterans to register to vote at VA facilities, but the bill will also limit restrictions and expand access for nonpartisan voter drives and ensure that veterans get the assistance they need to complete the voter registration process. In an election year such as this, it's important that veterans, with their unique experience in serving their country, have their voices heard. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and stand up for our veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Chamber for its indulgence in allowing us to bring before it today the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2008, which is a reauthorization and improvement upon the existing section 811 supportive housing statute. 
   Before I go into very briefly the details and importance of this act, I would just like to thank those that have worked on this bill and this issue, including the chairman of the committee, Chairman Frank, the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Housing, Representative Waters, and especially the Republican cosponsor of this legislation, along with myself, Representative Biggert, who has been just a boundless champion for the issue of supportive housing, the issue of compassionate care for those individuals with physical and mental disabilities, and also to Mrs. Capito, who has led this committee and this issue so ably. 
   Mr. Speaker, the 811 program today is the Nation's primary program for funding supportive housing. What is supportive housing? Supportive housing is housing for people with largely mental disability or physical disability, that provides some basic supports around those living arrangements so that those individuals can live independently. Job skills, medication adherence, social work, a small amount of support given to these individuals living with these disabilities can make sure that those individuals can live on their own independently and live full and productive lives. It is a cost-effective and compassionate program that, unfortunately, has not worked as well as it should have in the past several years. 
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates, Mr. Speaker, that 1.3 million individuals, non-elderly disabled across this country, are low income, living in substandard housing; 1.3 million people, and our 811 program simply hasn't reached enough of them. 
   Last year, less than 1,000 new units were built around this country with 811 dollars, and, as we heard before the subcommittee, it has taken sometimes 6 years for projects funded with 811 capital dollars to go from the development stage to the completion stage.     
   That's an unacceptably long amount of time for projects that sometimes only encompass four or six or eight units of housing. This bill sets a, I think, very aggressive but reasonable goal, a tripling over time the number of units constructed in this country with 811 dollars. 
   How does it do this? Primarily it does this by taking the $87 million right now that are used as vouchers in the 811 program, and transferring those vouchers over to the larger section 8 program. What we have learned is that these vouchers that are supposed to be dedicated to people with disabilities have not been traced sufficiently, and in fact, probably are going to people without disabilities, in many cases. 
   The section 8 program will do, I think, a much better job, is much better equipped to track those vouchers going forward. We then take that money that has now been freed up through the transition of those vouchers to the section 8 program and use  much of it to fund a new demonstration program that will seek to leverage the capital dollars from coming from the 811 program with low-income tax credits, private dollars and State partnerships. 
   By doing that, we will be able to take existing, affordable housing projects that are in the planning stages and, with small amounts of rental subsidies, be able to reach out to those developers and essentially make them a deal that we will give them a small rental subsidy if, in exchange, they carve out a small number of units to be supportive housing. This has worked remarkably well in States that have endeavored this program already. North Carolina comes to mind most immediately where, over the last 7 years, 1,200 units of supportive housing have been built, in part, with this strategy put in place. 
   There are a number of other important improvements to the 811 program in this act, allowing States and State housing agencies to do much of the bureaucratic paperwork involved in these applications, which we believe will greatly expedite the application process, a study which will look into how we can better use dollars in existing housing projects, 202 housing projects, and other affordable housing projects, to get tenants that are living in other affordable housing sites, some basic support services that will help them live independently. It is a vast improvement over the current law, and we hope, as I said, it will potentially triple the number of units built across this country. 
   This is important. These are some of the country's most vulnerable citizens, who are playing by the rules, doing everything we ask, but simply need a small apartment of help to be able to live independent, productive lives in their community. This is one of the most compassionate things that this Congress can do is to try to extend out that basic building block of society, good, affordable housing to individuals with mental disability, with mental illness and with physical disabilities. 
   One last note, this bill is entitled the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act, and it is titled after the late Frank Melville, the founder, along with his wife, Ellen, of the Melville Charitable Trust. This charitable trust that they have built up through their generosity, the Melville family's generosity, has funded housing advocacy and specifically supportive housing advocacy across this country for a number of years. We would not have the housing advocacy community that exists today if it weren't for the generosity of the Melvilles. 
   Unfortunately, this world lost Frank Melville, who also happened to be a constituent of mine, recently, and this act, I think, is a very appropriate testament to the work that he has done. 
   I thank, again, Mrs. Biggert for her great work over the years on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank Mrs. Capito and Mrs. Biggert for their leadership on this issue. 
   Just in closing, Mr. Speaker, although this bill will help scores of individuals with physical handicaps, I think, to myself, of how much help this is going to provide the millions of individuals across this country with mental illness that are struggling to live independently. 
   Years ago, when this country and States across this Nation made the decision, the right decision to close down the institutions that housed many of those individuals, we made a promise that we would find new housing, new opportunities for those individuals to live on their own in the community. 
   We have not lived up to that promise. In Connecticut, those of us that care about this issue often wear a button around the halls of the State legislature entitled ``Keep the Promise.'' This legislation, I believe, is a step towards doing just that. 
   With that, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank my friend from Ohio. 
   There is delusion that's been happening here for a couple of days, and you hit a couple of nails right on the head. But there is this idea here; you mentioned what Mr. Buchanan said in the Chris Matthews' show that has been perpetuated on the House floor here for the last couple of days that they should pay for it themselves, the family, the kids, whomever it is, should pay for themselves. You know and I know that the reason we're here talking about expanding out access to 4 million new kids is because there is less private health care available today for more and more families. Families throughout this country who are doing  the right thing, playing by all the rules, doing everything we've asked them to do, go out, get a job, maybe two, maybe three jobs, don't have access to health care. Their employers don't offer it because the costs have gotten so high that they're crippling small and medium-size employers, so they can't get it anymore. 
   But here is the illusion, the idea that these kids don't get health care is an absolutely false reality. And to think that when a kid gets sick, that he doesn't end up on somebody's dime is to delude yourself. So what happens, and the President said it himself the other day when he said these kids can get health care, they can just go to the emergency room. Well, he's right, because we actually do have a system of universal health care in this country; it's just the most inhumane, inefficient system of universal health care in the world because it says to these kids, to a 6- or 7-year-old who comes down with pneumonia, who can't get to a doctor for treatment for medicine because his parents can't afford it because his parents' employer doesn't cover it, he ends up in the emergency room. He ends up getting much less efficient, more expensive care in the long run. 
   So for all of our fiscally conservative friends on the Republican side of the aisle who decry this as some expansion of government-run health care, this is cost-efficient health care. Getting these kids some preventative health care up front is not just the right thing to do, it's not just part of our moral obligation 
   as a Nation to see an injured child next to us and reach out and give them a helping hand, it's part of our fiscal obligation as stewards of taxpayers' money here in the House of Representatives. We have an obligation to construct a health care system that actually spends less money rather than more money. And that's what this bill is about. It's not just about the moral obligation; it is about the fiscal obligation as well, Mr. Ryan.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. It is just about the choices that you make. Who do you want to subsidize? Do you want to subsidize the oil companies and the big energy companies? Or do you want to subsidize people who are investing in renewable energy, in the energy of the next decade, the next century? That is a choice we made here in the energy bill we passed. Do you want to subsidize the banks who are doing pretty well these days? Or do you want to subsidize the students? We made the choice here in this Congress to subsidize the students instead. We are faced with a simple choice now. Do you want to continue to subsidize the military-industrial complex? Do you want to continue putting money into a war that is making this country less safe every day rather than more safe? More money into a civil, religious conflict between sectarian groups in Iraq? Or do you want to do health care for kids who have no other resources in which to get that health care. 
   My folks back home, to my neighbors, to my family, to the people that I get to represent here in my first term in Congress, these are real easy choices. Students over banks. Renewable energy over oil companies. Kids over a war that is going nowhere but backwards. It seems to me that we are getting more and more people on the Republican side to join us. We are getting more and more of the public. We have a list here, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Meek and Mrs. Tubbs Jones, we have a list 270 pages long of every single potential group you can think of, 270 different groups, the Consumers Union, Denver Area Labor Federation, the Easter Seals, the Forum for Youth Investment, Greater Hartford Legal Aid, you just go down the list. Everybody out there gets this, that this is the choice you're supposed to make. But what we get here is a lot of rhetoric.     
   Because, Mr. Ryan, you said at the beginning, this is more than about kids, for folks on the other side of the aisle, this is about ideology. They are having a political fight on the floor of the House of Representatives, and the kids, the 4 million kids who are going to go without health care if this bill doesn't get passed and signed, are the victims of that political choice. 
   I was in the Government Oversight Committee that I get to serve on the other day and we had Blackwater in front of us. We are giving them about $1 billion a year to basically form a private military in Iraq. The CEO who was before us wouldn't tell us how much he made, but he could at least tell us that it was well over $1 million. It was about seven times as much as the commanding general in Iraq gets to preside over 160,000 troops. 
   One of the Republicans came out and said, you know, this is unfair. The Democrats are picking on these contractors. All of a sudden the Democrats seem to care about the money that we are spending in Iraq. 
   Well, you better believe we do. Somebody has to.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Ryan, the only questions that the Republicans asked about spending money is when it benefits poor kids. That is what seems to happen here. When it is about spending money in Iraq, when it is about spending money for private military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are no questions asked. In fact, they decry people who ask questions. 
   But when it is about lifting up poor children out of poverty, making them healthy enough to get up on their two feet and go to school and learn, that is when the questions get asked.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mrs. Tubbs Jones, I think it is important that you are focusing on the President here, because Republicans do support this. We are talking with a fringe element of the Republican Party, mainly here in the House of Representatives, who stands up against kids getting health care. 
   Because you look across the country, a poll came out about a week ago that said by a two to one margin, registered Republicans in this country support health care for kids. In the Senate, you have 18-plus Republicans standing up for kids' health care. Here in the House, 40-some odd Republicans are standing up for children's health. 
   You have a small element of the Republican Party here, enough right now to sustain the veto. You have a President who is ideologically opposed to kids getting health care. But this really has been a bipartisan effort. 
   So maybe we risk overgeneralizing a little bit when we talk about Republicans on this issue, because we are really talking about a segment of this party just big enough to hold this bill up, just big enough to make sure these kids don't get health care. Because across-the-board Republicans are joining Democrats who understand that this is the right thing to do.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of articulate folks on the floor tonight. I come back to the idea of the concept of morality. We hear a lot about that from the Republican side, from the Republican Presidential candidates. 
   To me, when it comes down to it, if I really am my brother's keeper, if I am really supposed to live a moral life and represent my moral obligations as a human being, there is nothing more central to that moral obligation than reaching out to a sick child, who through no fault of their own can't get access to the care that will allow them to stand up on their two feet, straighten their back, take a deep breath, and gain the same access to the apparatus of opportunity that all of us enjoy who have led much more privileged lives. That is the moral obligation that lies at the center of everything that we do. 
   So I think it is going to be a proud day when we finally get over that mountain, when we finally reach that moment when we can extend health care to 4 million more children. Maybe there will be a couple more fights before we get there, but the reason we are going to spend 2 weeks in between the President's veto and the moment when we cast the vote to override it is because we know when our Republican colleagues go back home, they are going to hear cries from their constituents to live up to that obligation, to that moral and that fiscal obligation and do the right thing by their constituents. I hope that we will have a very different result.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Let me ask you this: If you were walking down the street and you saw a child injured on the side of the road, would you stop? Would you do everything necessary to help that child? I think everyone on this floor today has a simple answer to that question. Of course we would. 
   So why don't we also agree that for the millions of sick children around this country who have no access to health insurance or preventative health care, that we don't have a similar duty to do everything in our power to help them get healed? 
   That, to me, is the definition of compassionate government. And don't let  anybody tell you that these kids have access to health care and their parents are just negligent. The truth is that health care availability is shrinking, and the number of children who get sick because they can't get health care is growing. 
   And just like we have a moral obligation to help that injured child, we have a similar moral obligation to help heal a child who lies sick in their bed simply because their family cannot afford a doctor. 
   I don't understand why the President won't help that child, but I hope that together, by overriding his veto, we will.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, Mr. Altmire. I want to let you get back to the time line because I think it is important for people to understand where this started, and to talk a little bit about where we are going, because so much of the news these days is filled with bad news, bad news for our veterans, bad news for the security of our country. And we talk about that a lot here. Mr. Altmire, as you know, this place focuses on crises often and on bad news. 
   The good news is that things are changing. The good news is that there is a commitment now to make up for the wrongs of the past. But it is fairly mind-blowing to people out there to think that it took The Washington Post to uncover what was happening in our veterans system. Because, Mr. Altmire, as you know, veterans back in our districts, back in Pennsylvania and in Connecticut and throughout this country, have known what is going on with veterans for years. I mean, they have been down here in Washington, DC, month after month, year after year trying to tell this Congress that there are waiting lines for care; that the conditions are often substandard because of years of neglect in capital improvements; that they simply don't have the access to the funds necessary to pay for the rising premiums and rising copays. 
   And before this story in The Washington Post broke, you, Mr. Altmire, and those of us in the 30-Something Working Group were yelling about this on the House floor. We got here with that mandate, to change things. 
   So you are going to run through, I think, some fairly amazing comments from some of the soldiers and staff at Walter Reed Hospital in terms of what they have been dealing with over the past several years. But we just need to remind people out there that you can't absolve this former Congress in the last 12 years from the catastrophes that we are uncovering within our medical system, specifically, in this case, within our veterans medical system simply because The Washington Post didn't get around to writing about it until last month, because if you were back home listening to this, you heard it time after time again. 
   I mean, here is the thing. We are talking about a substandard level of care for our veterans. We should be talking about the gold standard of care for our veterans. And we shouldn't be talking about just lifting up Walter Reed Hospital so that it meets the standards of dignity that every other hospital in our health care system abides by. We should be talking about raising up veterans care so that this is the highest standard. It is what everyone else in the medical community and the provider community seeks to meet. The people coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq, people coming home from Vietnam and previous engagements should come home to the best care this country can provide, Mr. Altmire. 
   And I would like to yield back to you so you can continue to tell the story of what we have found at Walter Reed hospital.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Altmire can you yield for a moment? Because I want to talk about, as these revelations were coming out in The Washington Post and in articles that followed, this administration had a choice to make. They could open up this issue and they could allow for a vetting of these problems and put them out in the open air and come together, as Republicans and Democrats, to solve them; or they could try to paper over it and cover it up. 
   And some of the most disturbing things that have happened in this sequence of events, which are a little bit later on your time line, is what happened after these revelations came into the light. We know that in the days following that article that the soldiers at Walter Reed were told that they couldn't speak to the media about what was happening. 
   We know that the Government Reform and Oversight Committee, which I sit on, had to subpoena the former head, the fired chief of Walter Reed Army Medical Center after Army officials told him that he couldn't come testify at the hearing. 
   And so I am so thankful that we have a majority now in charge of this House which is actually going to do the work to uncover, I hope, not too many more abuses that we haven't already seen in the newspaper reports that have come out. But the fact is that right now we don't have an administration that is helping us try to correct this, Mr. Altmire. And it makes our job even harder; but makes me, I think, and I think the American people are in the same position, that they are thankful that there are people here doing that work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Altmire, you hit it right on the head. It is, fix the problem, hold people accountable, in that order. We need to start holding people accountable here. I think that is a lot of frustration that led to you and I coming here and 40 or so of our fellow new colleagues here. I think a lot of the impetus that brought us here was this sense that nobody was being held accountable for what was happening in the government, whether it be the failure of our military strategy in Iraq or whether it be the failure of many of our domestic programs here at home. 
   So we have got to keep the focus and the light of this place on finally holding this administration and the people in it and, frankly, even Members of this legislature accountable for their actions. But we have got to fix the problem first because people didn't send us here just to investigate and hold hearings and put out subpoenas. They want that responsibility of Congress to come back. They want us to fulfill that constitutional obligation. But they sent us here to get stuff done. And that is the miracle of what has happened here over the last 2 months is that we are fixing problems. We are not just talking about it. We are actually doing what we are saying. 
   The first 100 hours was all about that, Mr. Altmire. 
   It had to be for the two of us one of the proudest moments of our life to be here joining hands with many of our Republican colleagues and for the first time making this place work again. Passing new bills to fund higher education, reforming the Medicare prescription drug law, investing in stem cell research; doing it with Democrats and Republicans, making this place work again. 
   So here is the thing. We proved we can solve problems. We proved that we can work as Republicans and Democrats to fix things. And maybe we are confronted with our biggest problem; not just what we have uncovered in our veterans' system, what people like you and I have known for years, but the greater quagmire which exists in our military today in the situation we have got ourselves in Iraq. But we need to take both of these on, fix the problems to the extent that we can, and then hold people accountable because what we know is that we weren't ready for this war. We weren't ready for this war with the equipment, the trucks and the kits we needed for our troops. We know that, when this war began, we were $56 billion underfunded within the Army for the equipment that they needed. We know that, after the invasion, it took 18 months for American soldiers to receive body armor; 18 months of being on the front lines before they got the body armor that they needed. And we know the health care system wasn't ready for the legions of troops that came back. 
   I think I shared this on the floor the other night: A group of veterans came into my office and shared with me a statistic that was as interesting as it was sobering, that in conflicts earlier in this century, on average three wounded soldiers came back for every soldier that died on the battlefield. Today 16 soldiers come back wounded for every soldier that dies on the battlefield. And that is due to some of the advances in armor protection equipment. It is also due to the miracles of modern medicine and the response time that our medics and doctors in the field are able to perform. 
   But it means that we have more people coming into our hospitals with more complex, more lasting injuries. They need better care, and they need faster care. And it appears that no one at the outset of this war was thinking about this problem ahead of time. They weren't preparing our military for battle. They didn't have a plan to occupy that country. They didn't think, it seems sometimes, more than a few seconds about the political realities that would emerge on the ground as we invaded Iraq. And now it turns out they also didn't think about what to do with the veterans when they come back. 
   Mr. Altmire, I never served in the military. I never fired a gun. I have never been shot at. I get to serve in this Chamber on a cold night like tonight in Washington, DC, in a nice, heated place indoors because my contemporaries, my classmates made a different decision. They decided to go overseas and protect this Nation. And there isn't a day that I get up that I am not grateful for the decision that my friends and my relatives and my classmates made to allow me to serve this country in a very different manner. So as unfathomable as it is to me to think about what it is like to be on the ground in Baghdad today, to have veterans comparing their experiences in our own domestic veterans' health care system to the situations that they faced on the ground in Iraq is unconscionable to me. Think about what it must be like to come back to this country maimed, injured, perhaps with legs, arms amputated, and to enter a system with flies, with garbage, with syringes. I mean, we know what is happening with soldiers coming back with PTSD and other mental health issues from what they have seen on the battlefield, and to think that we are putting them into a system which not only abuses the sense of honor that we should have for those that come back. We should be celebrating them rather than putting them in these conditions.     
   But I am sure it aggravates what must be an unbelievably complicated transition back to life here in the United States. We need to start honoring their service again. And God forbid we ever have to engage in another military action in this country again. God forbid we have to send our brave young men and women overseas to fight. 
   You know that in our lifetimes we will see that moment. We hope we don't. We hope we are wise enough in this Chamber to prevent another foreign engagement from happening, but the chances are that you and I may vote sometime during our service here to do this again. 
   We better get it right that time. We better make the investment up front to make sure they are safe when they head over to that battlefield, and when they come home, the services are there for them. 
   We are going to fix it. We are going to fix it and hold people accountable, and we are going to do it in that order. The American people for a long time maybe didn't have confidence when people stood up here and said there is a problem and we are going to do something about it. In this Congress, that is going to be our hallmark. We are going to be able to go home in the coming weeks and months and tell people that what you read about, whether it be in Newsweek or the Washington Post, is going to be taken care of.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Altmire, we have to look at veterans' health care, care for our wounded as part and parcel of the cost of the war. The cost of the war is not just troops on the ground, the equipment, the weapons. The cost of the war is all of that, which, of course, runs into the billions, racking up hour by hour, day by day, but the cost of the war also includes top rate, gold standard care for those troops when they return to this country. 
   Sometimes you talk about the cost of the war and veterans' health care. They are in kind of different silos in Washington speak, and we are figuring out how Washington talks versus the rest of the world. 
   Out there, what our veterans and soldiers talk about is a cost of battle, a cost of sending our troops overseas, which includes making sure, when they come back to this country, they get everything they need. That is part of our challenge. We came down here I think, not to speak for both of us, but to sort of change how Washington thinks about this world and start making it match up with the reality out there in our communities. We sat there for the last 2 years campaigning to get here, listening to people screaming and yelling about rising energy prices. We listened to families talk about how they couldn't afford to send their kids to college, and we heard seniors talking about how the Medicare prescription drug bill does not work. And they watch Washington do nothing about it. There is a disconnect that has happened over the past 12 years, and certainly over the last 6 years especially, and how people talk about their problems in the world and how Washington views them. There is no better example than veterans' health care. 
   To veterans and soldiers, the cost of the war includes taking care of soldiers when they return to the United States. We have to make people understand that again. 
   We sat for that very long debate about the escalation of the war. We listened to the people on the other side of the aisle make a ridiculously simplistic argument. They said, to support the troops, you must support the commander of the troops. Part of supporting the troops has to be supporting everything he asks you to do. You can't make an independent judgment about whether what he wants is right or wrong; you simply have to line up with him, or we are going to tell you that you are not supporting the men and women who fight for this country. 
   We know that is wrong. We know that the American people don't believe that, and we know this election was in part about separating what is right for the troops, the country and what the President has asked them to do and has vastly under-equipped them to do. 
   But you just detailed maybe example number one where what the President's policies are over the past several years has been the exact opposite of what is right for our troops, cuts to veterans' health care, increases in premiums. That is as bold and plain and simple and concise as you can make it. 
   You can't stand here and say, in order to support the troops, you have  to support the President when the President puts forth a budget, year after year, budgets that don't do justice for the veterans who return. 
   I think the American people have weighed in on that issue on whether or not we need to support the President on everything he does in order to support the troops, but there is yet another example. 
   Mr. Altmire, I think we also have to talk about the issue of accountability here. Here is the problem, is that our military is stretched thin right now. This isn't just about supporting the troops; it is about supporting the generals that oversee those troops and supporting the commanders who are struggling to do more with less. 
   Let me read a quote from General Peter Schoomaker, the Chief of Staff of the Army. He says, ``To meet combatant commanders immediate wartime needs, we pooled equipment from across the force to equip soldiers deploying in harm's way. This practice, which we are continuing today, increases risk for our next-to-deploy units and limits our ability to respond to emerging strategic contingencies.'' This was from a Washington Post story. 
   That is a pretty amazing statement to come from our Nation's top military brass. To come out on the record, flying in the face of what the President is telling the American people and saying that we are endangering the lives of our troops by overextending the limits of our equipment and our machinery within our Armed Forces. 
   So we also have to force the military commanders who are desperately trying to do the right thing with a very flawed policy and with an administration which pays no attention to the root causes of the insurgency which puts our forces in harm's way and who doesn't give the Army the resources they need to fight this battle and obviously doesn't treat the soldiers the way they need to be treated when they come home. 
   This is about supporting our troops and about supporting our commanders and about supporting our Armed Forces in general. They are being asked to do so much more with so much less. This is no secret. When we come and vote on the supplemental request from this President, you better believe that Members on this side of the aisle are going to make sure that there is a historic commitment to veterans, just like there was in the continuing resolution. We have to make that a priority in this new authorization of funding because we are beginning to talk like everybody else talks out there. We are beginning to understand that the cost of this war is the money that it takes to fight the battle on the streets of Baghdad, but it is also the cost of taking care of those soldiers when they come home. 
   Mr. Altmire, you underplay your effect on that discussion. You were a real hero on that issue of making sure that the veterans' care and funding were in that continuing resolution. I hope people back in your district understand what you did on that issue to ensure that those funds were part of that continuing resolution.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let me highlight one thing before we leave this subject. This is going to be a chart that we might see a few more times on the 30 Something Working Group hour here. 
   I just want to make sure the people know we are back to business here. This is 81 hearings that have been held on issues related to the Iraq War this year. I mean, you go through the list just the week right after we got back from recess, the last week of February, on Tuesday, the 27th, two hearings; on Wednesday, the 28th, five hearings; on Thursday, the 1st, three hearings. 
   Now, that may seem like a lot. It seems like, well, what is Congress doing with all these hearings. There was so much work to be done to uncover all of these abuses. I think that is going to kind of level out over time, but right now we needed to get back to the work of starting to do some oversight when it comes to this war, to start uncovering many of these abuses. We will continue this chart going forward. 
   This idea that you presented that we have got two jobs, fix it and hold people accountable, we are doing both. This continuing resolution that kept the government running had historic levels of funding for veterans care. I think we are going to be able to do something similar with the supplemental authorization that we will vote on in the coming weeks.  
   But we are also doing that second part, which is holding this administration accountable, to make sure that it does not happen again, because I do not want to be here a year from now just trying to play catch-up and plugging all the holes that this administration creates. I actually want to solve the problems and make sure that competent people get into places that matter in this administration. 
   I want to make sure that the President starts putting budgets before us that make sense so that these oversight hearings, 81 hearings that have been held already in this Congress, are going to start to get us there. 
   That is maybe the moment to turn. We have got a few minutes left to talk a little bit about this budget.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I sit on the Government Oversight and Reform Committee, and in that committee, we found out that we sent $9 billion in cash over to Iraq, on pallets, handed it out in duffel bags. We found out that when we were subcontracting to these subcontractors to do security, they subcontracted again, and they subcontracted again, and everybody takes a little money off the top every time. We did not know. We had not heard about any of that until we started doing hearings. 
   So you are exactly right. Hammer that point home. This is not doing hearings for hearings sake. This is doing hearings to uncover the waste, fraud and abuse that has been happening in this government. This is my taxpayer dollars. This is my neighbor's taxpayer dollars that are going down the drain with some of these programs. This is real stuff.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. First of all, let me say that there is nothing that acts as a tantalizing teaser to whet the appetites of the American people than telling them if they tune in next time, we will talk about foreign-held national debt. That really gets people's blood pumping. 
   I cannot give the chart without letting people know out there that the clock is ticking. 365 days you have left officially in the 30 Something Working Group. Congratulations. Happy birthday today. I do not know why the rest of the Members are not here to celebrate.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and thank you again to the Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, for giving the opportunity to the 30-Something Working Group to come to the floor once again to talk about some of the great progress that we believe this House is making on behalf of our constituents, the American people. 
   We are going to have an abbreviated edition of the 30-Somethings today, and I am going to turn this over to Mr. Meek in a moment. 
   But suffice it to say that once again I think we did some justice when it comes to energy policy on the floor this week. We have passed, once again, a bill that will extend enormous tax benefits to thousands of Americans and, even more, small businessmen and the people who profit from those businesses, who work for those businesses, so that they can invest in the new American economy that is the green economy and do it through no additional cost to the taxpayers by simply repealing billions of dollars that we have given to the oil industry under the Republican Congress and turn those tax subsidies around to average consumers and average small businesses who are now going to do right by this new renewable economy that we are building.     
   It is a start. It is not everything. We have not done a 180 on energy policy, but we are beginning what will be a long but continuous path to energy independence. 
   And I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek).

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Mr. Meek. 
   I want to quickly let people know what this legislation does that we passed here. We have talked about the amount that it invests in this new economy, but let's talk about how it does that. 
   There is $8 billion in this new bill in long-term, clean renewable energy tax incentives for energy accrued from sources varying from wind to solar to geothermal, biomass, hydropower, ocean tides, landfill gas. Overnight, this bill is going to invest in these types of renewable energy sources that are going to power the next economy. 
   We know that energy independence doesn't come easy. We have become addicting over a long period of misguided and shortsighted Federal policy so that we have an unreliable and unsustainable reliance on dirty energy, on energy produced by oil, produced by gas-powered plants, produced by coal-powered plant. You don't change that overnight. It takes time. Now, government can't do it alone. We can't suddenly decide that we are going to take the generosity of the Federal Government and start buying up renewable energy to completely replace those old, dirty sources. 
   What we can do is use a little bit of Federal incentive to give reason for private individuals and private businesses to make those choices themselves. That is what we have done here. My office went through a long and important process of becoming carbon neutral, becoming energy independent. 
   How we did that, we brought some energy auditors into our office and we assessed our carbon footprint and then we found a number of ways, a myriad of different efforts that we could undertake to reduce that carbon footprint. It included everything from changing all the light bulbs in our offices to putting on automatic timers where we could, to making sure that we were printing on both sides of the page. 
   We tried to reduce our individual carbon footprint, as individuals and businesses can do, seeing that they find that not only the right thing to do by our environment, but the right thing to do from a cost standpoint as well. 
   But even after doing all of those things, Mr. Speaker, we still found we had an amount of pollution from old, dirtier sources that we couldn't completely eliminate. 
   So what we did, we went out to offset that remaining dirty carbon footprint by purchasing tax credits for renewable energy. Basically going out and purchasing, putting renewable energy out there on the grid to make up for what dirty energy remained in our office. 
   What we found for us was that it still cost a little bit more to purchase those renewable energy tax credits, those renewable energy credits, than it would have to have bought oil or gas or coal credits. But it was not four times as much. It is not three or twice as much. It is still a little bit more expensive for an individual homeowner or an individual business to purchase renewable energy, but it is getting less expensive every day. Why is that? 
   It is getting less expensive every day because the economy, those that invest and fuel the economy from an economic standpoint are figuring out that there is money to be made in renewable energy, that there is a demand for it, and that every cent that they can lower the cost of that renewable energy resource, the more profit there will be built in because of the greater utilization. 
   And so that is what we are attempting to do here. Rather than putting $18 billion into more tax subsidies, more regulatory subsidies for the oil industry, we are saying let's take that $18 billion and let's put it into tax subsidies for homeowners and businesses and local and State governments to make up that little difference between the price of old energy and the price of new energy. 
   And that small, little incentive not just makes the difference for the bottom line for that particular company or for that particular homeowner, it then starts to increase the volume of renewable energy that we are producing. It starts to create more capital for those companies that are doing the research and development into renewable energy so that they can advance their efforts to create newer, cheaper technologies. That's how we are going to grow this renewable economy. 
   And for some reason for a very long time, for the 12 years that the Republicans controlled this House, and in particular for the past 7 years, the 6 of it where the President served along with the Republican House, they didn't get it. They didn't get that you can start to incentivize and create this new renewable economy, this green economy, not with the largess of the Federal Government but with targeted, direct incentives to make up that small difference between old and new energy. And this is about building that new economy and this is also about trying to right some wrongs that this Congress has perpetuated on the American people for far too long. 
   I hope that people will look at the facts that underlie this chart standing beside me right now. The price of gas, and this is looking at increases in commodities and profits from 2001 to 2008, a 113 percent increase in the price of gas. Much of that has come just in the last few years, as more and more motorists, more and more commuters have found it almost impossible to make their budgets meet now that gas prices seems to be staying above that $3 a gallon level. 
   We all feel this one. There is a 213 percent increase in the price of home heating oil. My wife and I are flabbergasted on a weekly and monthly basis as we look at the amount that we are paying to heat our own very small and modest home. Even with all of the different improvements that we have tried to make regarding oil efficiency and heat efficiency, we, along with millions of other American homeowners, have an old house. We cannot make it completely, totally energy efficient, and so we are paying through the nose, as are millions of other American homeowners, for this 213 percent increase in heating oil profits. 
   The price of crude oil has gone up 215 percent during that time. And all the while, during that same period of time over the last 7 years, the profits of American oil companies have gone up 310 percent. 
   There aren't many things in this world in a 7-year span that increase threefold. Wages for the average Americans are lucky to creep up by 1 percent a year. Profits for most American businesses, in particular those small businesses and medium-sized businesses that power our economy, are lucky to grow by 5 or 10 percent every year. Even in robust economic times, 310 percent growth in profits over a 7-year period is unheard of. 
   And when those profits are derived in large part due to Federal policy through these $18 billion in Federal tax breaks that have gone to the oil companies, it should have a long time ago caused this Congress to step back and ask why. 
   Well, there are a lot of different reasons, and I am not here to suggest that those $18 billion in oil subsidies are the sole reason why you see a 310 percent spike in oil company profits. We have increased demand around the globe for oil, not just here in the United States but in India and China and in developing nations. 
   But I would also posit that another reason is not just because of the subsidies we have given these industries,  but also because we have done almost nothing here in this Congress, before 2007 when the 110th Congress was sworn in, to really start to work with the competitors of the oil industry, to try to give at least the same benefit that we give to the oil industry to the wind industry, to the solar industry, the geothermal industry, the tidal industry, all of the other energy competitors who ultimately will make sure that we never see another 310 percent, 7-year growth in profits.     
   And so I think a lot of us are really excited about the direction we're going with energy policy. It's not just the bill that we passed today which shifts that $18 billion in oil company energy profits to incentives and tax subsidies to individuals and small businesses and governments that are prepared to do the right thing and invest in renewable energy sources. This is also about what we've done to increase the fuel efficiency of vehicles, the first time in 30 years this Congress has passed and signed by the President an increase in fuel efficiency standards so that the average fleet sold here in the United States will now have to be up around the 35 mile per gallon standard, still not what it could be, but a lot better than the level that we've been sitting at for the last 30 years. 
   A new investment in green technology and green jobs, grants now going to businesses and nonprofit organizations that are going to do the training necessary to teach a whole new workforce how to compete and how to win in a renewable energy economy; and legislation that will say no more going to the store and looking at one product that's energy star or energy efficient rated and another product that hasn't had any improvements on it in the last 20 years, now every appliance, every microwave, every toaster that you buy, by virtue of legislation passed in the House and the Senate and signed by the President will make sure that appliances that you buy are going to meet the highest energy efficiency standards. 
   We still have to go farther. There's still so much more we can do. We can pass a renewable energy portfolio standard to say that 15 to 20 percent of the energy produced in this country comes from renewable energy sources. We should pass a cap and trade system that limits the amount of pollution and carbon that we emit into the air. But these are monumental steps forward that would have never happened if we didn't have a change in control of this Congress, because you've got a whole new group of people here. Mr. Altmire and I are the two members of the 30-Something Group that are part of this new class of freshman Members of Congress. But you have a new group of Members here, in particular this freshman class, that really had a sense, from spending the last 2 years, 2005 and 2006, out campaigning for office but just frankly being on the outside of this institution for all of our lives, that the public got it; that the public understood that it was about time that we started shifting our resources, both privately and publicly, into a renewable economy. They understood that energy independence is the Holy Grail of Federal and State energy, of Federal and State policy, period, because it's not just about energy prices, the fact that by investing in renewable energy, increasing volume, increasing research and development, that you will eventually drive down energy prices. 
   It's also about the environment. We could talk for another hour about the benefit that investments in renewable energy will do to the air that we breathe around us, what it will do to combat the growing trend towards the warming of this planet. 
   It's also about our economy, as we've talked about. And we may not make rubber balls in this country like we used to. We may not have the large volume manufacturing base that we did 20 to 30, 50 years ago, but we can be the center of research and development for renewable energy technology. There are great strides still ahead of us on cellulosic ethanol, on photovoltaics, on the hydrogen economy. Our economic future here in the United States can be based in renewable energy. 
   And lastly, folks out there know that it's about national security as well. They know that by creating a dependence on domestically produced energy, rather than on foreign produced oil, that we will make decisions with regard to international policy, based not on our national energy interests but on our national security interests. 
   And so on behalf of the 30-Something Working Group, we're pretty excited about the bill that we were able to pass today, as we are about the entire trend that's happening here in Congress with regard to energy policy. We have farther to go, but the reason that we, as the 30-Something Working Group, talk about this is because the investments that we make today will pay off in 10 and 20 and 30 and 40 years, when our future children and grandchildren are living in this world. They might not have to deal with the consequences of a Congress that ignored the energy crisis in this country if we make the right decisions over the next several Congresses. 
   So I appreciate, as we always do, the opportunity for the 30-Something Working Group to come down here. It's a busy day and evening here, so Mr. Meek was only able to join us for a short period of time. Mr. Altmire had to leave before the hour started. We know when we come back to this floor next week, we'll make sure to have the full contingent of 30-somethings down here on the floor. We miss Ms. Wasserman Schultz as well. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, again I thank you for the opportunity to speak before the floor today. I thank the Speaker for her engagement with the 30-Something Working Group.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Mr. Meek, and my condolences go out as well to the Davis family. 
   Mr. Meek, I am glad you started where we left off last time, talking about children's health care, because it is still on the table. For a lot us, we still believe that it has hope. This 2-week period in which we postponed a vote on the override will give our friends on the other side of the aisle the opportunity to rethink their position on this issue, to go back to their districts and talk to the millions of families, thousands and thousands of families in each congressional district across this country who are struggling with the real peril associated with trying to get health care in this country. 
   We are talking about 6 million kids which are going to lose health care if we don't reauthorize the national Federal Children's Health Program, the SCHIP program. We are talking about 4 million new kids that don't have health care now that could have health care. 
   We are really talking about families that are playing by the rules, who are doing everything we ask of them, working one job, two jobs, maybe even three jobs, but can't get health care through their employers. It just makes sense for us to reach out and try to help those families. 
   Mr. Speaker, it makes sense not only because it's the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, but we care about our fellow human beings, and we are our brother's keeper. But reaching out a helping hand to a sick child who lies in their bed simply because their parents can't afford a doctor, that is part of our moral obligation as Members of Congress, but it's also the fiscally responsible thing to do. These kids get health care, but they don't get health care until they get so sick that they end up in emergency rooms, and they end up getting the least humane, most expensive health care available to them. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill, the SCHIP bill, the Children's Health Insurance bill, which we hope we will have enough votes to override the President's veto on next week, this is not just about our moral obligation as a Congress, but it is also about our fiscal  obligation. I know Ms. Wasserman Schultz will talk about this today. 
   It is also about choices. This is not about play money, found money or new money. This is about taking funding that we have been sending for far too long into the civil, religious conflict in Iraq. Thirty-seven days worth of funding of that war could insure every child that the SCHIP bill seeks to cover, 10 million kids. In the end, this is just about choices. 
   Madam Speaker, we have still got time to convince a few folks on the other side of the aisle to join us. You remember, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, when this bill first came before the House, there were only a handful of Republicans that supported that. They went back to their districts over the course of August and they came back to take another shot, and, guess what? We had almost three to four times as many Republicans who, after they went back and heard from their constituents on this, decided they were going to stand with us, stand up for children's health. 
   I think the same thing can happen again next week if families throughout this country, if hardworking Americans who have no health care, go to their Members of Congress and say, listen, it is time to do the right thing for kids, time to do the right thing for families, time to do the right thing for health care. I think we can have a victory.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let me tell you a story. I know you have heard it, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, but it is pretty indicative of how low the other side is prepared to go to try to undermine children's health care.     
   There is a family, the Frosts. Their son, Graeme Frost, doesn't have health insurance. He is 13 years old and suffers with severe brain injury as a result of a car crash. The family has been the face of some of this discussion. The father is self-employed. He is a woodworker. The mother has had some part-time jobs on and off. They are not living in destitute poverty, but they are playing by the rules and doing everything we ask them to do. They are paying their taxes and contributing to society. 
   But because their son has a preexisting condition, they have been turned down for health insurance time and time and time again. And so they have to pay for injuries from a car crash for a 13-year-old boy out of their pockets. This is the kind of family that we are talking about. This is a family that has done everything that we have asked, a family that is getting by, but because their son has an injury that excludes him from most private insurance, he has no other recourse than the SCHIP program, a stopgap solution until the family finds some insurance program that does cover him. 
   Well, what happened. This family had their whole life uncovered by the right wing that is trying to stop children's health care from going forward. Every tax return, every purchase they have ever made, right down to the type of countertops they have in their kitchen was exposed by the right wing of this city to try to prove that this family is just leaching off the government. 
   This is a 13-year-old kid with brain injuries and a family that has done everything that they can to try to find insurance and haven't found it. 
   I was home this past weekend, and on Monday I listened to one of the talk show hosts in my district talk about the fact, he said: I don't understand why people are saying the poor can't get health care insurance. I went onto a Web site for one of the big health insurance companies, and I just plugged in for a family of four to see how much it would cost. He said, it is reasonable. You can get a 80/20 plan, he said, 80 percent covered by the insurer, 20 percent by you, with a $5,000 deductible for only $300 a month. That's a deal. That's a deal. 
   Madam Speaker, think of that, for a family making a little more than minimum wage, maybe making $22,000 a year, which in Connecticut just to have a roof over their head is paying about $10,000 a year in rent, now has to pay $9,000 a year for insurance.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. In my district, forget buying a house, if you want to rent an apartment with a couple of bedrooms, it is at least $600, $700 a month. You are talking $10,000 a year when it is all said and done. You add on $9,000 for health care costs, which under that plan that he found on a website, the minimum amount you have to pay before you even have a dime of health care coverage kick in, and you have $2,000 or $3,000 left over to do everything else, to put food on the table and educate your kids and pay for heat. It is mind numbing that people can't see that health care is so expensive that it is prohibitive for families doing the right thing. This is humane and it is right. 
   The conspiracy that gets thrown out there, and the stats and the numbers, by the right wing on this issue are  pretty easy to punch through in the end.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I was going to pick up on that point. We are so close. This has been a bipartisan effort. We have the votes necessary to override the President's veto in the Senate. You have Senator Hatch saying that the SCHIP proposal is an honest compromise that improves a program that works for America's low-income children. You have Senator Grassley saying it is a good bill, it is a good comprise. Pat Roberts rises to express his support for the SCHIP bill. So with 45 Members in the House supporting this bill, we are so close. 
   This is a picture, I believe, from earlier in the year. We have a President standing out in front of his loyal soldiers, the Republican caucus in their winter coats, which suggests it was one of the early meetings the President had to galvanize support for his plan to escalate the war. We have seen, as time goes on, that if the President were to regather this group for a conversation on SCHIP there might not be as many Republicans there. 
   I think as Members go back to their district and start to hear from constituents about how important this SCHIP bill is, all of those loyal soldiers are going to get a little smaller and fewer every day. As people start to figure out that the President is so far out on a limb on this issue, that not only is he doing damage to America's children, but he is doing damage to the prospects of his colleagues in the House, you are going to find a lot more people seeking that courage and finding that wisdom and coming on board here. 
   We hope it happens next week. But if it does not happen next week, we are not going away because the 4 million kids out there who are showing up in emergency rooms because they can't get the treatment to try to prevent the mental illness that will cripple them as an adolescent, they can't get the treatment to try to cure that physical ailment that ends them up in the emergency room, those kids aren't going away, so we won't go away. If we fall 15 votes or seven votes or two votes or one vote short, we will be back here next year, we will be back here next summer. If there is anything that is important to us, it is standing up for the kids. If there is anything that should be important to the entire Congress, Republicans and Democrats, it is standing up for the kids. That is our message here tonight. It is not just that we hope that the Republicans go out and find that courage and that wisdom, but they know, and all those children and all those families know, that we are not going to stop until we get a bill that insures kids of families in this country who so desperately need our help.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. It goes to the very subject that we opened with in talking about here, which is the war itself, and we believe that there is a much better way to spend pretty much all of that money, whether it be rebuilding our schools, educating kids, giving health care to children. 
   But even, even given the vast amount of money that we are spending over there, there has been virtually no check, virtually no oversight by this Congress and this administration. A  great example is the Government Oversight Committee, which has done really yeoman's work in trying to make up for the complete absence of oversight during the past several Congresses. The Oversight Committee held a hearing, very well attended, very highly publicized hearing a few weeks back with the CEO of Blackwater, who came before Congress, Blackwater, the private security firm which has basically created a privatized military in Iraq today. 
   Blackwater came before us, the CEO of Blackwater came before us the other week, and we asked him simply this. We said, tell us how much profit you are making. Tell us how much profit Blackwater is making off of U.S. Government contracts and said, You know what? It's none of your business. I can give you an estimation. I think we are making about $85 million a year in profits off of $850 million in contracts. But, basically, it's none of your business, United States Congress. 
   There weren't a lot of people on the Republican side of the aisle, on that government Oversight Committee that blinked at that suggestion, because that has been the practice in this Congress over the past several years. That has been de rigueur, as a matter of course here, that we don't ask any questions, that it is okay that Blackwater security, a private military operating in Iraq, can make $85 million in profit off of doing what we know the United States military could do themselves. 
   So it's endemic when you talk about private tax collectors, it's endemic when you talk about the issues such as PAYGO that Representative Wasserman Schultz raised and certainly in spending on the war. Time after time again we have seen no fiscal responsibility here, and time after time this Congress, Mr. Meek and Ms. Wasserman Schultz, is shedding light on that misused taxpayer funds, but passing legislation like the bill that we passed today, which changes the course, and we start spending tax money wisely once again.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I rise to offer this amendment along with my good friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) that will help restore access to voter registration for America's veterans. 
   You see, Mr. Chairman, on April 25, 2008, the Veterans Health Administration issued a directive stating the VA's clear policy to assist veterans, patients of VA facilities who seek to exercise their right to register and vote. And I believe all of us would agree here that such a policy is extraordinarily appropriate given that these men and women served by the VA are the very people who put their lives on the line to protect that right to vote. 
   Inexplicably though, on May 5, 2008, the VA withdrew this directive and issued a contrary directive. This new instruction made a similar commitment regarding voter assistance but it included a policy statement which prohibits nonpartisan voter registration drives on VA property. 
   Mr. Chairman, the mission of the VA is, in its own words, to ``care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan'' by functioning ``as a single, comprehensive provider of seamless service to the men and women who have served our nation.'' 
   It's disappointing that the VA would not consider assistance with voter registration as one of the fundamental components of offering this seamless service to veterans. Many of these soldiers have been wounded in combat and  have disabilities that make traditional voting difficult. The VA should be ready to provide these men and women with any and all assistance that they might need to make their voices heard in this democracy, whether that be delivering an absentee ballot to an amputee or filling out a ballot for a soldier who has lost his sight. 
   Secretaries of States and election officials all over the country will tell you that the registration drives that historically have been a critical portion of this outreach for veterans in these facilities has done a great service for our veterans. Over 20 bipartisan secretaries of State have joined us in expressing their disappointment over this policy. 
   We're not here today, of course, to restrict the VA's ability to manage their facilities and the care of their patients. On the contrary, they need that ability, and nothing in this amendment would diminish it. However, we believe it's the duty of the VA to work closely with nonpartisan veterans groups and elections officials to ensure that veterans have the ability to exercise that basic fundamental right to vote. 
   So our amendment is simple. It would not allow the VA to use any funds appropriated through this legislation to carry out that policy section of the May Directive. And while we hope the VA will still reverse this decision on its own, with this congressional action today we are sending a clear signal that this House believes that all veterans should have access to and the right the vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman for his assistance in putting this amendment before the House. I would also like to thank Robert Brady and Congresswoman Watson for their persistence and advocacy on this issue which has brought it to the floor today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge the amendment's adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I rise today to simply thank Chairman Waxman and many of his compatriots on the other side of the aisle for giving us this week. 
   If you want to know why there are so many new Members in this Chamber today, it is that there have been a lot of people in this country who have been waiting for this week. 
   You know, we sit around and we wonder sometimes why we feel this disconnect between the people out there in the American public and their government. Well, there is a sense on their behalf that the government somehow exists separate from them, that it is an entity that is wholly divorced from what is happening out in the real world, and that government has ended up setting its own rules that don't really have applicability to their own lives and how they manage their own existences. 
   And I think the issue of how we have gone about contracting, whether it be for this war or for other domestic and foreign endeavors, is a perfect example of how we have broken down that contract between government and its people. They look to the $100 billion in no-bid contracts, many of which going to companies that didn't need any more help. They look at Halliburton and other companies like it get rich while local programs that help people in the communities, middle-class working families with health care and education wither on the vine. And I think they look with a renewed sense of faith and optimism to this House, not just this week, but in how we have gone about keeping their money and regaining their faith. 
   It started on the first day when those of us who got sworn in were lucky enough to cast a vote in favor of new budget rules that will make sure that we keep better track of the money that comes in and don't rack up record deficits. And it continues today, Mr. Chairman, with a renewed commitment to responsible contracting. 
   I am happy to be standing next to my new chairman, Mr. Waxman. I am happy to be here today in our process of restoring that faith in the government that our people have lost.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I'm a new Member of this Chamber, and so I don't know all the history of SCHIP. I don't know all of the reasons why the bill was written, why it was, the history of negotiations, and with all due respect to my friends who were here, I don't really care, because what I know is that right now there are millions of children throughout this country who go to bed each night ill, simply because they can't afford to see a doctor. And let me tell you why I think it's a good thing that we should wait a couple of weeks in order to take this vote. Because, frankly, I'm a hopeless romantic when it comes to this House, the people's House's ability to impose the will of the vast majority of Americans. Call me crazy, but I think that when 80 percent of Americans, as the CBS News poll told us some weeks ago, support advancing children's health care, then maybe, maybe, this House should do something about it. I'm also unapologetically idealistic about our moral obligation as a society and as a Congress, because I know every single one of us, if we were walking down the road and we saw a sick child on the side, we would stop everything we were doing and try to help that child. And I don't understand why that argument isn't extrapolated to those children throughout this country who are sick only because they can't afford health care. We have a moral obligation to help those kids. And we have a fiscal obligation as well, because that system of universal coverage that extends only to people that go to emergency rooms when they get so sick that that's the only place that they can go, that costs us money. As moral and fiscal custodians of this great Nation, we have an obligation to pass this bill, to override this President's veto and to give all the time in the world to your constituents and our constituents to make that case over the next 4 weeks.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, how we treat those who serve this country abroad in our Armed Forces says a lot about this Nation. The greatest gift that we can give to those men and women who are returning to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan and the fields of battle is an education with the passage of the new GI Bill. When I went to Iraq last year, the troops said this version of the  same thing to myself and the five others that traveled there. They said, Don't forget about us when we come back home. 
   With the passage of the new GI Bill, we can make good on that promise that we all made to those troops on our visits there. I hope that Senator McCain and many of our friends here in this hall who have not supported this new GI Bill, who have not supported extending benefits to the troops as they return, to give them an education for a lifetime, will remember that you can't just go there and tell them that you support them, you have to come to this floor and to the floor down the hall and do it.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to kick off what I hope will be a very interesting hour. Every week we try to get together at least once as members of the 30-Something Working Group at the pleasure of the Speaker of the House to talk about some of the most pressing issues, not only to this country at large, but in particular to the young people of this country. I appreciate the Speaker giving us this opportunity. 
   We are hopefully going to be joined today by some of the veteran 30-Something Members, but we are going to kick today off with Mr. Altmire of Pennsylvania and myself and our special guest today from New Hampshire, young-at-heart Paul Hodes. 
   Madam Speaker, I think the gentleman from Georgia is right on one point at least, that this is a sobering week here in the halls of Congress. We have had a lot of bad news this week. We have mourned the death of far too many young people at Virginia Tech. We have mourned the loss of one of our own here on the House floor. We are wrapping up a month in which we have seen 86 more soldiers die on the battlefields of Iraq amidst a growing civil war, a war now that has cost over 3,300 lives, 24,000 wounded and $379 billion spent. 
   Our friend who just gave the final 5-minute speech on the other side of the aisle suggested that the silence was deafening from the Democratic side tonight in this Chamber. Well, we were talking all day. We were talking last week and the week before. There was no silence on this side of the aisle. For the first time, for the first time, this Congress picked its head up out of the sand to realize what is really happening over in Iraq. 
   You can talk all you want about failure and defeat and victory, but you have got to be a little bit clear about what we are talking about over there, because maybe we entered into a fight with an army commanded by Saddam Hussein, but we have now got ourselves mired in what is a civil war. 
   Madam Speaker, I got the chance, along with five other Members of this body, three Republicans, three Democrats, to go over to Iraq and Afghanistan a few weeks ago, and we asked the generals on the ground a very simple question: Of all of the fire that you find yourselves in the middle of on the streets of Baghdad, tell us what percentage of that which is directed at U.S. forces is a fight from insurgents directly against the United States, and tell us what percentage of that fire is sectarian strife, Sunnis and Shia fighting each other. 
   I have to tell you, listening to the other side, you would have no clue that the answer was 90 percent. Ninety percent of the fire directed at U.S. forces is simply by virtue of us being in the middle of what has become a civil war there. 
   So you can continue to bury your heads in the sand while we talk about this tonight, but we choose not to. We chose to side with the American people, 60 percent of whom say unequivocally that they want a timetable to bring our troops home. We sided with the Iraq Study Group, some of our top foreign policy leaders in this country, Republicans and Democrats, who unanimously stood up to say it is time to redeploy our forces. We stood with some of the brightest and most courageous military generals. 
   We have come to the position that it is de rigueur for generals to speak out against the war, because it seems that there is a new one coming out and talking about the tragedy of this war every day. Well, this didn't happen up until the Iraq conflict. You have never seen this number of former military men standing up and suggesting we need to set a different course. 
   So maybe this is a little bit of a quiet room tonight after a very long day, but, yes this was a loud and boisterous hall earlier tonight, because for the first time in a long time, this Congress stood up and excerpted the will of the American people. 
   Before I kick it over to Mr. Altmire and Mr. Hodes, let me just quickly talk about what we did here today. 
   You want to talk about supporting the troops. Let's talk about the fact that this bill had every dollar that the President asked for in it, and more. And more. We put in more money to make sure that every single troop has the equipment, the protection, the armor that they need. 
   This bill has $1.7 billion in additional money beyond what the President asked for for veterans, $1.7 billion beyond what the President asked for for healthcare for our existing armed forces. 
   You want to talk about supporting the troops, then you better look at the words and the numbers in this bill, balls what the President wanted, he got, and we put more on top of it to  make sure that every single soldier 
   is taken care of on the battlefield, and when they return to this country, they are not just given average healthcare, but they are given the gold standard of healthcare when they come back here. 
   What we did on that bill was for the first time suggest that this commitment cannot be open-ended. For Mr. Hodes and Mr. Altmire and myself, we have gotten the opportunity over the last few weeks to go back and talk to our constituents, and you are having to turn over a bunch of different rocks as time goes on to find people who are still willing to say that we should have absolutely no end to our commitment there. That we should do virtually nothing to force the Iraqis to stand up for themselves. 
   Let me give you one important quote from this week. Folks on the other side of the aisle will say that this timetable is somehow harming our efforts there. They maybe should speak to our own Secretary of Defense, who just this week said this: ``The strong feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable probably have had a positive impact in terms of communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment.'' 
   Our own Secretary of Defense, the spokesman on matters of war for this President, says that our discussion here about ending our open-ended commitment, about forcing the Iraqis to stand up for themselves, has had a positive effect. So to our friends on the other side of the aisle, they might want to check with the administration before they cast aspersions on the work that we are doing here. 
   The last thing to say. The last thing to say. We better put some definition on what war we are fighting here. I know Mr. Hodes wants to say something about this as well. This is not a war for us that needs to be fought between two sectarian parties in Iraq. This is a war on the people that attacked this country. Maybe some people on the other side of the aisle haven't noticed, but the people that attacked this country came from Afghanistan, a country that we have left behind. 
   We had a chance to visit Afghanistan just a few months ago, and we found that the Taliban is in a resurgence there. We found that the new power player in the Middle East, Iran, is starting to meddle in the affairs of Afghanistan, in part because we haven't put the money and the troops and the resources and the infrastructure dollars behind our effort there to make sure that it is a self-governing country. 
   We have got fights all over the globe that this country needs to be a part of if we really want to talk about making this country safe. So when we talk about redeployment, we mean it. It is not just about withdrawal. It is not just about taking every single troop who is over there and bringing them home to their families. We would love to do that. There is not a single one of us who hasn't spent an amount of time with the National Guard and the Reserve troops that have been so heavily stressed by these multiple deployments. There is not one of us who has not sat with active duty families who have seen their family members deployed once, twice, three times, over to Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   We would love to bring every single one of them home. But we know that the reality of this new world order is that we have got to have a much more global view. We have got to make sure that we have the troops necessary to be committed all over the globe, to make sure that we recognize how broad the threat to this country is today. 
   That is not what we are doing right now. That is not what we are doing. In fact, what we have done is created a safe haven for terrorists. We have created what our own intelligence community calls the cause celebre for the Islamic extremist movement in this world, to find shelter in Iraq, to breed, to train, and then to present an even greater threat to this country. 
   So, yes, Madam Speaker, there was a little bit of celebration on this side of the aisle when we passed this bill tonight. Not because this isn't the most serious subject that this House will face over the next 2 years. It certainly is. We take that as a grave responsibility that it so deserves. But because it is about time that we picked our heads up out of the sand and said in our gut, in our conscience, we cannot allow our military forces to continue to be the referee of a civil war. And in our gut and in our conscience and in our head we know that this fight is broader than just what happens on the streets of Baghdad. This is a global fight against the people that took us on, and by redeploying those forces, by doing the right things by the soldiers who are on the ground in the middle of this civil war, by making a commitment as strong as ever to our troops and to our veterans, we finally, we finally, started imposing a foreign policy that will guarantee the security of this country, not just for the next week or the next month, but decades and hopefully centuries. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like at this point to yield, if I could, to a good friend and one of our new 30-Somethings, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Altmire.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I want to read it one more time, Mr. Altmire, just because it backs up everything you said. I want to read it one more time. Secretary Gates. ``The strong feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable probably have had a positive impact in terms of communicating to the Iraqis this is not an open ended commitment.'' I mean, that's worth saying again, because for all the rhetoric that we get about what we are doing here and what kind of impact it has in Iraq, we have our Secretary of Defense telling us exactly what has been our intuition for years; that the only way, Mr. Altmire, just like you said, the only way for us to exert any pressure on the Iraqis to stand up for themselves, to get their military shop in order, to get their civil shop in order, to get their political stop in order, is to tell them that we are not going to be the crutch that they can rely on in the long run. We've recognized that here for a very long time. Our Secretary of Defense now joins us in that.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Hodes. The three of us are new Members. We came here on that tidal wave of increasing popular angst against this war. And this place shouldn't be dictated just by what happens in elections, but elections have to mean something. When the people get a chance to go out there every 2 years and weigh in on the direction of their Federal Government, they have to feel, at some level, like what they say matters.     
   And, Mr. Hodes, I mean you are right. When they pick up the paper whatever day it is going to be when he actually vetoes this, the feeling inside, that voter who thought they went out and cast a courageous vote for Mr. Altmire or Mr. Hodes or Mr. Murphy who decided to make a change when it doesn't happen very often that you have a change like this, maybe once every decade or every two decades, well, they are going to lose just a little bit of faith in this process. And every day that we continue to have an administration that refuses to honor where the American people want the course of this war to go, which, as we have said over and over again, it is not just the American people but it is the American people being backed up by generals, being backed up by the foreign policy community, the Iraq Study Group, there is a little piece of democracy that dies every day that that happens. 
   Let me just bring up an additional topic here. When I got out into Baghdad on the day that we were in Baghdad, what we saw was the escalation in progress. What the escalation essentially is, is it is asking these soldiers who are on their second or third tour of duty over there, who would normally do 12-hour shifts patrolling these incredibly dangerous streets, trying to dodge sniper fire, trying to keep clear of the increasing number of IEDs, roadside bombs, now those troops, after the 12-hour shift, aren't going back to safe barracks; they are lodging themselves in the neighborhoods, in some of the most dangerous, war-torn neighborhoods of Baghdad. They are living in bombed-out buildings with little or no electricity or running water, in squalid conditions. That is what the escalation is. 
   Now, if this was a fresh round of troops, if this was a group of young men and women who were there for the first time, maybe you could understand putting them in that position. But that is not what this is. Twenty-three percent of all the troops who are being deployed right now are National Guard and Reserve troops. Eighty-eight percent of those National Guard and Reserve troops are so poorly equipped that they are rated not ready right now. That is from the Washington Post, about a month back. 
   We know that the number of Active Duty and Reserve brigades in the United States that are considered combat-ready, zero. None of them. We have maxed out our military. We have asked, Mr. Hodes, as you said, our men and women to do everything we have asked them to do, and we have got to start asking ourselves the question, have we asked them to do too much? 
   One day they are in the middle of a firefight. The next day they are sitting down and trying to mediate a dispute between two rival neighborhood groups. The day after that they are overseeing the construction of a water filtration plant. They are, within a 3-day period, being asked to be fighters, diplomats, and civil engineers. 
   Having gotten to spend a couple days on the ground with these folks, they are by all measure the best people that we could send over there, the bravest, the most capable. If there is anyone in this world that could do this job, I know it is them. I knew it intuitively from back here in the United States. Having spent a few days on the ground, you know it from the moment you talk to them. But we have maxed them out. 
   And why I try to get here as often as I can to hear Mr. Murtha speak here on the floor is because there is no better in talking about this subject than Mr. Murtha. He said it here tonight: There is no one more in touch with the troops than he is. And our danger is not just in asking them something they may not be able to do, but permanently damaging the capability of this military going forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I want to yield to Mr. Altmire in a second. 
   But let me just underscore this to say none of us are happy to be in this situation. Myself, I think that this is the best course. I think that we need to set in law a sense of when our commitment is going to end there. The only way we will finally complete the training of our military and our Armed Forces within the Iraqi community is to give them a sense of when they will have to stand up for themselves. 
   Now, at the same time, there is no perfect option. In fact, there may be no good option here. We all have to admit at some level, Republicans and Democrats, that we have gotten ourselves into a mess here that there is no pretty way out of. And that is part of what government hasn't been pretty good about talking about. This administration, it is all about black and white to  them. It is good or evil. It is right or wrong. 
   There is a lot of gray, and we created most of that gray by being the bull in the china shop there. But what we put forward today, what the majority of this caucus supported this afternoon and this evening is not the perfect, and it is probably not even the good, but it is the best that we can do in a very bad situation. And it is certainly the best that we can do by the brave men and women who are fighting. 
   So as proud as we are, I think, Mr. Hodes and Mr. Altmire, standing up today and finally getting our head out of the sand and putting some direction in what has been a directionless conflict, at the same time it is a sobering day because we all admit, especially as new Members who didn't participate in the lead-up to this very troubling time, that getting ourselves out of it isn't going to be an easy process and it is not going to be a very brief process. 
   With that, I will turn it over to Mr. Altmire.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, I want to make sure everybody knows that there are no hard lines in the sand in this House. And, in fact, the bill that we voted on today is different from the bill that we voted on about 2 weeks ago. In fact, what this House voted on, and what many Members insisted upon several weeks ago, was a hard deadline in the sand that said that we had to be out of Iraq by next spring or, at the latest, next fall. And many of us stood up and said, for the reasons we talked about tonight, that in order to get the Iraqis to finally stand up for themselves, we have got to give them that sense. 
   The bill that we voted on today in an effort to bring the President to the table, to get him to sign a bill that puts every dollar he asked for, and, more for troops and veterans was a goal. It was a goal. Now, there are a lot of us who wanted to see more than a goal. All of this is an effort in compromise. But that goal even is apparently objectionable to this President. And I have a feeling that this House will move again and will try to come up with yet another means of resetting our policy and our course in Iraq that is acceptable to this President.     
   So if anybody has any idea out there that the House of Representatives is just saying X and the President is just saying Y, no, we're trying to make that effort. And you know what? People are going to look in the paper this morning and see a vote that has a lot of Democrats voting for it and a lot of Republicans voting against it. Lest they think that that's been the case day in and day out here, in fact, it's been the exception to the rule in how we have conducted ourselves in this House. The 100 hours agenda, making changes on our economic policy, our health care policy, our national security policy, our homeland security policy had record numbers of Republicans. We stood together and we have stood together on everything from the minimum wage to stem cell research to even the budget. 
   So we have made great progress, I think, in this House on bringing back together some of that partisan divide. Lest people look up at the vote that we took tonight and think that we didn't honor our pledge to really start to bring that back together, I think we have in large part. 
   And I think that's important to say because I know, Mr. Hodes, that as important as it is to the new Members to get Iraq right, to get health care right, to get energy right, it's also really important for us to start bridging some of the gaps here. And it pains us when these things do hit party lines, but on something as important as Iraq, the vote is what the vote is. And we'll get back to building those bridges as soon as we get beyond it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 507, the Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007. 
   This issue is simple, Madam Speaker, kids can't learn if they can't see. Providing early vision screening for our nation's children will make sure they are all ready to learn when they enter school and the Vision Care for Kids Act will help provide states with the means to offer this important care. 
   When I was in the Connecticut State Senate, I championed an initiative which made school-based vision screening a priority through the mandated reporting of pediatric vision screening on school health assessment forms. The passage of today's legislation will enhance my state's ability to enhance vision programs for children by providing a much needed federal stream of funding. Importantly, it will allow Connecticut's children to receive followup care when uninsured children are identified through my state's existing vision screening program. 
   The passage of today's legislation is another example of how this Congress is actively working to provide health services to our nation's children. This week, as the House contemplates whether we should provide 10 million American children with health insurance through the SCHIP program, we should take today as an opportunity to affirm our commitment to comprehensive health screening and coverage for all American children. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 507 and yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, why is it that we have so many Republicans here in the House, a veto-proof majority in the Senate, a poll that came out showing that Republicans across this country support expansion of the SCHIP bill by a 2 to 1 margin. Why is that? Because the expansion of the SCHIP bill is not just morally responsible. It is fiscally responsible. We have to stop pretending that these kids that don't have health care insurance don't have health care. They do. But they get it in the least humane and most expensive way. We have a system of universal health care in this country. It just doesn't get care to these kids until they are so sick and so crippled by their illness that they show up at an emergency room and get the worst care and most expensive care that you can get in this system 
   I come from a morally responsible district, but I also come from a fiscally responsible district, Madam Speaker, and that is why they support expansion of the SCHIP program.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to say it today that the conversation about corruption in Iraq, this isn't theoretical. It is not hypothetical. It is not just about numbers or statistics. Corruption in Iraq is real. It has a face. And, frankly, it is no secret to those Iraqis who are picking up their newspapers and their media outlets every day and finding out the corruption that is rampant there. So I think it is worthwhile just for a second to talk about the face of corruption in Iraq. 
   This is Salam al-Maliki, the former Iraqi Minister of Transportation. He is also the Prime Minister's cousin. He was accused of abusing his official position to purchase real estate at a fraction of its value. But the Prime Minister issued an order barring, barring, his case from being referred to court. 
   I want to now introduce you to Aiham Alsammarae. He was the Iraqi Minister of Electricity who was convicted in Iraq of the abuse of national funds; yet he escaped from the Green Zone with the help of U.S. contractors. He is now living, if you can believe it, in Chicago, running his own business and traveling around the world. 
   Finally, this is Hazem Shaalan. He was the Iraqi Minister of Defense, accused of embezzling almost $1 billion that should have been spent on weapons and vehicles for the Iraqi Army. Iraqi courts reportedly have audiotapes of his deputy discussing payoffs to various officials. After his conviction, he also fled the country, and he is now living in Europe or the Middle East. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is just the tip of the iceberg. But this administration doesn't think that the American people should be concerned or even know about this. By refusing to answer questions and retroactively classifying corruption reports, this administration has proved once again that they either don't trust the American people, or they know that their case for continuing this war is so weak that they have to obfuscate the facts on the ground. 
   Now government contractors are getting into the game. Two weeks ago, Erik Prince, the CEO of Blackwater Security, refused to disclose to this committee his salary or the profit margins of his company, despite the fact that Blackwater makes 90 percent of its money off of U.S. taxpayers. 
   This cannot stand, Mr. Speaker. I, for one, will never support another war funding authorization that doesn't provide for the redeployment of forces out of Iraq. 
   But for those on this floor who do support this war, I plead with you to at least demand accountability for the billions of wasted dollars that we have thrown at the Iraqis. Do not stand here on the House floor telling us that we cannot afford to heal children throughout the United States of America if we aren't even asking questions and getting the appropriate documentation that we require on the billions of wasted dollars in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (REAFFIRMING SUPPORT OF THE HOUSE FOR LEBANON UNDER PRIME MINISTER FOUAD SINIORA -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, as the representative of thousands of proud Lebanese Americans in Connecticut's Fifth Congressional District, I rise tonight in strong support of the democratically elected government of Lebanon and to condemn the recent violence perpetrated against the people of Lebanon by the terrorist group Hezbollah. 
   Lebanon is a vital ally in a region where we need all the allies that we can get. It is a vibrant society composed and defined by its diversity of religious and ethnic backgrounds. A culturally rich Nation renowned for its tolerance and democratic values, Lebanon stands at the crossroads of Arab tradition and Western culture. 
   Yes, Lebanon has struggled with the proxy wars fought inside its borders by powerful neighboring nations, but with the strong support of the United States, the strong independence and vibrant democratic tradition of Lebanon can and will continue. 
   Yesterday, this House considered H.R. 1149, which reaffirmed the support of this House for the democratically elected government of Lebanon, led by the governing March 14 coalition. This resolution was necessary because that government has recently come under vicious attack by Hezbollah-led opposition fighters, an outbreak of violence that has brought that country to the brink of civil war. 
   In response to legitimate actions by the government to protect the security of its own citizens, Hezbollah instigated riots, blocked roads, forcibly shut down media stations, and attacked the residences of prominent members of the ruling coalition. During the course of this violence, Mr. Speaker, more than 69 Lebanese citizens were killed and more than 250 were wounded. 
   These actions blatantly violated the commitments made by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who has always maintained that Hezbollah exists solely to defend Lebanon against Israel, and that its members would never take arms up against other Lebanese. That pretense is now clearly shown to the entire world to be false, as we have known it was for a very long time. Indeed, Hezbollah's primary purpose seems to be to act as the agent of Iran and Syria, which continue arming the terrorist group in order to maintain a presence in Lebanon and a military front on Israel's northern border. 
   This brief, but bloody, period of fighting was the worst violence Lebanon has seen since the civil war that engulfed that Nation from 1975 to 1990. It demonstrated the military strength of Hezbollah's militias, and it threatened the free media, religious tolerance, and cultural diversity that make Lebanon such an important ally of the United States. The streets of Beirut are now relatively calm, but Lebanon will remain under threat until that government becomes truly independent from foreign influence. 
   It has been more than 3 years since the Cedar Revolution, when the people of Lebanon took to the streets and demanded an end to Syria's occupation of that country. Unfortunately, while Syrian troops have withdrawn, its government has continued to undermine Lebanon's vibrant but fragile democracy. They do this by allowing weapons shipments to pass over their territory into Lebanon and by continuing to disrupt internal Lebanese politics. 
   The boiling over of tensions that have been building for months has brought the world's attention to the challenges facing Lebanon, and we must capitalize on that focus. 
   Last night, the government and opposition leaders concluded talks in Doha, Qatar, finally reaching an agreement that will allow for the formation of a government and the election of Michel Suleiman as President, probably as soon as this Sunday. This is a welcome development and one that bodes well for the future of Lebanon. 
   But a number of issues still remain unaddressed. These include the status of Hezbollah's weapons, the future of Lebanon's electoral law, and the long overdue investigation into the murder of former Prime Minister Hariri. 
   The Lebanese people have found a way to live side by side with all of their differences for years and years, and I for one believe that it is in the United States' best interest to do all that we can to use yesterday's political breakthrough to press for the total elimination of undue outside influence on the Lebanese government and Lebanese society. 
   As political negotiations move forward in Lebanon, the United States, its Arab allies, and the European Union must provide the Lebanese government with the economic, military and political support it needs. We have seen the difficulty of promoting new democracies in the Middle East; however, in Lebanon, we have the opportunity to preserve one. A window of opportunity has opened, Mr. Speaker. The United States must now work diligently and quickly with Lebanon and her allies to assure that the moment is seized.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Mr. Meek. The honor is also to be part of the 30-Something Working Group and to get to spend the precious moments on the floor with you and Mr. Ryan, Ms. Wasserman Schultz and Mr. Altmire and others who can't be here this evening. 
   As you noted, I am a new Member of Congress. I came from the Connecticut State legislature. I came here with some degree of trepidation, because coming from the Connecticut State legislature, a place in which partisanship has its day, but certainly is not the rule, the reputation of this place, at least under the last 12 years of Republican rule, struck fear into the hearts of a lot of new Members, because we came from experiences, at least those of us who came from experiences in the State legislature, where  the rule was that we reached out and worked across the aisle. The rule was that to get anything done, you needed to have Republican and Democratic support. 
   The reason that in Connecticut the State legislature enjoys a level of support and approval that the United States Congress has not traditionally had is in part because on the most important stuff, in Connecticut we found a way to do that. 
   I was the chair of the Public Health Committee for several years in the Connecticut legislature and we passed the Nation's first stem cell investment law. We did it with a Republican Governor. We did it on a bill that was introduced by a Republican senator and a Republican member of the House, even though Democrats had near veto-proof majorities in both chambers. We did it with Republicans and Democrats. Frankly, it didn't matter what the letter was after your name, R or D. It was the right thing to do. So I came down here as a member of the new Democratic majority wondering whether there was going to be a chance for that same type of cooperation. 
   As you pointed out, Mr. Meek, we saw it immediately in those first 100 hours. In the agenda we put forth on energy, on the minimum wage, on student loans, on ethics, we had Republicans and Democrats standing together. 
   Now, that hasn't happened every day here on the House floor, and the times it doesn't are the moments in which CNN and MSNBC and the talk show pundits jump on it. But, really, when you talk about the big things that have passed here, you have seen this House coming together. You saw it on the farm bill most recently, and you saw it today. 
   For anyone that was lucky enough to be here on the House floor, Mr. Meek, maybe you mentioned it, to see the debate on the defense authorization bill, it was a pretty remarkable bipartisan affair. In fact, the bill is named after the Republican ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Hunter, probably something that average voters out there who hear about the conflict that happens in this House every day wouldn't have expected. But there is, I hope, a growing spirit here on the House floor that we can cross the aisle that literally exists here on the House floor in order to pass important things. 
   But we need more of it. We need more of it because the most important issues for our constituents can't happen unless we have the votes here all too often to overcome the President's veto. We did that today with an incredibly important farm bill that begins the process of transferring unjustifiable subsidies for American farmers and turns them around to funding for conservation programs and nutrition programs. We are going to stand up to the President when it comes to sensible farm policy. But we need more of that. 
   When it comes to the GI Bill, which is this Congress' landmark effort to once again recommit ourselves to a notion that this Nation stood upon in the wake of World War II, that every returning GI from the field of battle should have access to a quality education in a school of their choosing in their State, we have withdrawn from that commitment since World War II, and this House and our compatriots in the Senate are attempting to make that commitment once again. 
   The funding for returning GIs has withered to the point that that commitment no longer exists. If you want to come back and you can go to school, maybe you will get a little bit of help, but you are still going to have to pay a significant amount of money, and you are probably going to have to do it part-time, because there has been historically not enough money for living expenses for those GIs. 
   We think if we are going to ask you to be a full-time warrior for this country in Iraq or Afghanistan, we should allow you to be a full-time student when you come back to the United States. We should be able to pay your way to the most expensive State college in your State, but we should also give you a stipend in order to make that journey through college education full time. If we are asking men and women to fight and die for us, to sustain injuries that change their lives on the field of battle, we should support them when they come home by providing them with educational benefits. 
   But we don't have the votes here on the House floor today to override that presidential veto, Mr. Meek. So we need more of that bipartisan cooperation that we have seen. Democrats are willing to stand up for returning veterans to give them a new GI Bill. We stood in lockstep as the majority party here last week to do that. 
   We had 30 or 40-some odd of our Republican colleagues join us in that effort, but that is not enough to get past the threatened presidential veto. 
   I can't explain to you why the President doesn't think it is the right thing to do, to stand up for our GIs when they come back home. He has stretched our militarily to the breaking point, and he is not willing to sustain them when they come back to the United States. 
   We clearly believe that one of the most important things that we can do in this Congress between now and the adjournment is pass that GI Bill and recruit enough of our colleagues on the Republican side so that we can overturn that veto. We have shown that we can do it. We did it on the farm bill. We have done it before. 
   We have also shown that we can go out and make our case to the American public so that the President changes his mind. The President, if you remember, Mr. Speaker, first threatened he was going to veto the college affordability bill, which transferred subsidies for banks into subsidies for students, lowering the student loan interest rate in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. The President said he was going to veto that. But when we went out there and made the case to the American public and asked them to make the case to the President that this was the right thing to do in a tough economy for millions of students and families out there that needed a little help, he changed his mind and signed that bill. 
   Just recently, after making a lot of noise in opposition to our efforts to suspend deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and put that oil instead out on to the market to lower gas prices by anywhere, who knows, from 5 cents to 20 cents, a small but meaningful decrease through the suspension of deposits into the SPR, after making a lot of noise that the President was going to oppose or veto that legislation, he ended up signing it. 
   So when it comes to the GI Bill, we have got two tasks ahead of us. Let's try to build the bipartisan consensus that we have had here on many days in the House of Representatives. Let's try to push beyond the 30 or 40 Republican Members that have supported the bill so far so that we don't have to worry about a presidential veto. But let's go out and talk to veterans organizations, to talk to military families, to talk to our educational institutions. 
   Let's grow a coalition over the coming weeks and months so that the President has the opportunity to change his mind, so the President has the opportunity to stand with us on the side of returning service men and women for the educational benefits that they deserve. Just like our grandparents, our parents, got that benefit when they came back from World War II, let's do it again for the thousands upon thousands of GIs returning every month from the field of battle in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Meek, you led off on the right note. There is an amazing amount of bipartisan cooperation happening here, but we have got to extend it to some of the most important measures that we can pass between now and the end of this historic legislative session.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let's just step back. There is no question when you are talking about where do American people stand on the redeployment of the troops out of Iraq. None of these bills suggest to do it tomorrow or the week after. This is the responsible redeployment of troops out of Iraq. Do it in a planful way that maintains the safety of those troops as they leave, and tries to do our best to try to maintain a stable government that we leave behind. There is no question where the American people stand on that. That is not just you and me listening to people when we go back home; that is also every poll that we have seen of the American public over the last 2 years. 
   There is no question, Mr. Meek, where people stand on the GI bill. The numbers are off the charts when you ask folks if they think that this country should guarantee a college education to every returning warrior from Iraq and Afghanistan. There is no guesswork involved here.  
   Now, I don't know where the President gets his direction from on his veto threats. But for all of us that are sitting here deciding whether we vote for these things in the first place or override the President's veto when they come back, there is no research that has to be done in the public opinion. There are no guesses that have to be made. This is all just common sense, whether you are listening to it when you go back to the district or you are reading the public opinion polls, Mr. Meek.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Meek, the President is not running again. The President doesn't have anybody to answer to, so the President is free now to act on his own instincts, to act on his own set of advice. And that means, to the extent that this President was ever listening to the American public, he is not doing it now. He doesn't need to do it. And, as you said before, he is not up for reelection. But every Member of this House, with the exception of those people who are retiring, are.     
   And so people in the Republican Caucus, our friends on the other side of the aisle, have got to think about what's the motivations behind the President's threats here. Is it because of a political calculation where he wants to be on the right side of where the American people are, or is it because he has no one to answer to any longer? 
   And sometimes, you know, we get a little bit of frustration when we go back home, Mr. Meek. People say, well, why hasn't more happened on the war coming to a close? Why haven't you done more to solve our health care problems? 
   Well, the answer is what happens just up Pennsylvania Avenue. We've put legislation on the President's desk to planfully exit Iraq. He vetoed it. We've put legislation on his desk twice to ensure 4 million more kids. Both times he vetoed it. 
   Over and over again, with the Republicans and Democrats standing together, we've put legislation on his desk, even under that threat of veto, and he has continued to stand against the American public, Mr. Meek. 
   I think we can still have some victories from here to the end of the year. I still think we can have moments where this House comes together and overrides presidential veto. 
   I can't think of a better bill to exercise the will of the American people as expressed through this House than on  the GI Bill, giving educational benefits to troops. I have no idea why the President has decided to exercise his veto threat against that legislation. If there's anything that we should be able to come together on, it's on supporting our troops when they come back home. 
   I think we should have done it for those 4 million kids that should have gotten health care insurance. I think that we should have done it when it comes to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq. But let's at least do it as one final salvo with this Democratic Congress and a Republican President when it comes to standing up for our GIs, Mr. Meek. It would seem to be the one place, amidst a lot of the times that we disagree here. You named all the moments on which we have agreed. But the culmination of a remarkable amount of agreement, amidst a reputation of disagreement in this House, would be to pass that GI Bill with a veto-proof majority, put it on the President's desk, dare him to veto it, knowing that we're going to have the votes to override when it comes back.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Your point is this, is that we've seen in the last 2 or 3 weeks, both the Republican minority and our Republican Presidential candidate all of a sudden start to use the word ``change.'' Well, to them it's just a word. To them it's just a part of their slogan. 
   To the Democratic majority in the House and the Senate, it's what we live by, it's why we're here, it's why we get up in the morning, it's why I gave up my entire life to run for the United States Congress; it's why you have given up 18 hours a day to do this job, because we're here to change the place. It happens to be in everything that we talk about because it's the definition of why we're Members of Congress. 
   For the Republicans here in the House and the Republican Presidential candidate, it's just a word. And that's what I think the American people are beginning to understand. That's why the American people are turning out in record numbers for our Presidential candidates on the Democratic side, and that's why we have won the last three competitive seats for special elections here in the House, because the voters out there, the American public, are figuring out that change is nothing if it's just a word coming out of your mouth. You've got to live it. You've got to breathe it, which is what we're doing here, Mr. Meek.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (IN HONOR OF B'NAI ISRAEL AND THE TOWN OF SOUTHBURY, CONNECTICUT, FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, in 1937 the residents of Southbury, a small town in Connecticut, came together to prevent the German American Bund, a group of pro-Nazi German Americans, from establishing a paramilitary training facility in their town. 
   Led by Rev. Felix Manley of the Southbury Federated Church and Rev. M.E.N. Lindsay of the South Britain Congressional Church, the town of Southbury passed its first zoning law to ban the use of land in Southbury for paramilitary training. 
   As a great Jewish writer once said, ``The opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference.'' Mr. Speaker, it gives me a great sense of pride to represent the town of Southbury, where this May 31, 2008, the congregation of B'nai Israel will host the Human Rights Festival, honoring the courageous acts of those citizens some 71 years ago and renewing the town's commitment to justice. The proud legacy of the religious community in Southbury and the work of B'nai Israel to recognize that legacy serve as a reminder to all of us that change and progress must come from the bottom up.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania and our colleagues from the Republican side for getting together and engaging in what has probably been one of the more productive dialogues that we have had in at least my short time here in this House. 
   I guess I wanted to offer just a few brief comments as a means to pivot to this next conversation because I think that you see Democrats, the majority party, focusing so much of our time on the issue that Mr. Hall will talk about, which is taking oil currently sitting right now available in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and putting it immediately in supply on the market. I think you see us talking about what Mr. Stupak will talk about, which is going after the very place in which the price of oil is actually set. As much as we talk about the oil companies and retailers, what it really comes down to is the price of a barrel of oil is set on a minute-by-minute, hourly basis on the commodities markets, the regulated/unregulated markets. I think you see us talking about those areas more than we talk about the subject that, quite honestly, occupies most of the time of our friends on the other side of the aisle because we see that as the means to immediate relief. I mean there is absolutely a conversation that should have occurred a long time ago and needs to occur right now to take this crisis that families are feeling and turn it into a long-term strategy both on the demand and supply side, changing the amount of supply and the very nature of the supply, changing the amount of the demand and the nature of the demand, to try to make sure that we don't get into this mess 5 years from now, 10 years from now. 
   But what we hear I know is what you hear. I mean this energy crunch doesn't discriminate based on the party you're registered with. Whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, you're paying the same prices in the Fifth District of Connecticut and Texas and in Georgia and all across the rest of this country. People are saying to us get us relief today. 
   So my estimation of why we have a disagreement at the very least on where the issue of drilling should fall on the priority list is because we just haven't seen the evidence yet that shows that this idea that drilling that will reach peak capacity in 20 years and may not start for another 6 or 10 years is going to actually lead to lower prices tomorrow or next week or the next month. 
   Now, Mr. Rahall is right. We don't have all these tools at our disposal. We want prices to come down $2 by sunrise tomorrow. It's not going to happen, and we don't have the ability in this Congress to make all of those big, broad, short-term changes. But what we are looking at is evidence that does not suggest that increased potential future supply is going to lead to lower prices today. I mean just look at what has happened over the last 6 years alone. We have seen a 361 percent increase in drilling permits. Now, there is no correspondence between that 361 percent increase in drilling permits and the price of oil. 
   Take a very specific example that we all read about just within the last 12 months and look and see how the futures markets responded to it. In November of last year, news came of potentially one of the most important oil field discoveries in the last decade, the Tupi field off the coast of Brazil. We  don't know how much is there, but the estimates already are you potentially have 8 billion to 10 billion barrels. You would expect, by the logic that we hear here, that that immediate notice of more supply around the corner with a government--there's no permit contesting here. There's no political problem that we may have in other countries. The Government of Brazil's ready to go. So we have got 8 to 10 billion barrels, and what do we see happen in world markets? Within 14 days the price doesn't go down, it goes up.     
   Within 6 months, a $13 increase in the price of a barrel of oil and in 9 months as we stand here today a $55 increase, the biggest oil field discovery that many of us have seen in the time that we've been in government service and the theory that that should lead immediately to the market's responding with oil prices decreasing doesn't happen. And so I think that is just a means of explaining why the oxygen on this side of the aisle gets spent on issues that Mr. Hall will talk about and Mr. Stupak will talk about, the SPR and the commodities trading reform efforts. Because we see that as the most effective means toward immediate price relief. 
   And I think if we had evidence that the markets have responded in a different way in the recent future that potential future demand with increased oil permits leading to lower prices or new discoveries leading to lower prices maybe there might be a different discussion here. But the fact is that we haven't seen that kind of response. So I just offer that as a means to pivot on to some of the conversations that we will have on our side of the aisle. Because I think that is part of the explanation as to why you say see a difference in focus. 
   And I would be happy to yield.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I wasn't here during that time, but I do clearly think that people can understand the difference. One of the reasons we are talking about the urgency, as Mr. Stupak will about affecting the commodities market, when you are talking about a speculative bubble on a commodity like oil, which is dependent on whether people can heat their homes in winter and stay alive and get to work on a daily basis, that the urgency about bringing down that speculative bubble is imperative on this body. 
   So I think the reason you hear so much commotion about bursting this bubble, and I wasn't here during the height of the housing and the height of the dot-com bubble, but the reason we are talking about the urgency of pressing government action to bring down the price to something that resembles the laws of supply and demand is because of the life-altering nature of the product that we are talking about.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, Mr. Altmire. 
   The point is that I think we would all have a slight degree more comfort with these numbers if we had confidence that those companies were investing back into capital, into exploration, into drilling a commensurate amount in comparison to what they're making in pure profit. I don't have the figures in front of me. I would be happy to see something that displays this to the contrary, but what I have seen is that you have not seen a corresponding increase in capital reinvestment--Mr. Stupak may know this and may want to comment on this as well--as you have seen in returns back to shareholders. 
   Now, everybody wants shareholders to do well here. We want there to be enough excess profit to make some of the people who have invested in these companies do all right, but I'd like to also see some evidence, as you have suggested, Mr. Barton, that there's a willingness to take a piece of that money and to put it into more drilling and into more exploration and into more supply. 
   I'd be happy to yield to Mr. Stupak.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to health care, I agree with the President in one respect, it is time to start redistributing resources within our health care system. The problem comes when we talk about where we bring those resources from. 
   The President's plan that he put before us in his State of the Union speech and in his budget presented to this House yesterday would take resources from families who have good insurance and give it to families who have no insurance. 
   I would propose instead, and many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle would propose instead, that we take resources from the HMOs that have enjoyed massive profits off our Medicare systems, to take money from the drug companies who have enjoyed the pleasure of not having to negotiate with the bulk purchasing power of the Federal Government, and redistribute resources from those that are making millions of dollars of profit off this system and put those resources into the hands of those who have nothing. 
   We can agree on some things. We can agree that this health care system has to be made better. It is just a matter of where we take and who we give it to.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank you, Mr. Meek. 
   It is an honor to be standing in the traditional place of Mr. Ryan today, and I will attempt to equal at least half of his eloquence on this floor. 
   You are right, I think there are a lot of missing pieces from that speech last night. It was my first opportunity to sit and listen to a Presidential State of the Union, and you couldn't help but leave disappointed. There were a lot of promises that I think the American people were looking to be fulfilled in that speech. 
   Mr. Meek, I think you were exactly right when you talked about a sense of bipartisanship, which I think is infectious in this building right now due to the first 100-hours agenda that, as we know, drew bipartisan support, on average 60 Members of the other aisle supporting each piece of that 100-hours agenda. That bipartisanship seems to be lost when it comes to the issue of Iraq. 
   It doesn't go without note that since the President had unveiled his plan to escalate this war, to put another 21,000 brave men and women in harm's way to do a job that Colin Powell and others will tell you 100,000 people can't do.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Meek, you are very right. And I am glad those quotes are going to be on the 30-Something Web site because it really is a cross-section of this Chamber, the people who have been really  speaking out and asking the President to revisit this plan to escalate the war. You have dozens of Republicans, more every day, that are coming out and suggesting that there has got to be a plan C, right? Plan A we know didn't work; we are now debating plan B, which everyone from foreign policy experts to the President's own military advisors suggest won't work. 
   And we hope that some of the folks watching us on C-SPAN right now caught some of the hearings, Mr. Meek, before the Armed Services Committees and other relevant committees because you have heard some remarkable testimony from the President's own military leaders expressing grave doubts about this plan to put new troops into Iraq and into Baghdad. 
   So we have got both sides of the aisle coming together and saying, listen, let's sit down and talk about plan C, because that is what this is about. This is not about just standing up here in front of TV cameras and telling people the President's plan doesn't work; it has got to be about setting another way. And there are other ways. We can talk about the redeployment of troops. We can talk about starting to rebuild our credibility in the world. 
   The President talked last night, Mr. Meek, about the unification of the world's communities around the President's strategy. Well, that certainty doesn't comport with reality, it doesn't comport with what we are seeing; but it doesn't mean that the opportunity is lost, it doesn't mean that we still can't go back to the world community and say, let's together build a new strategy to get ourselves out of Iraq in a way that leaves that country as stable as we can. 
   And, Mr. Meek, I don't know about you, but I think we can still do that. And I am actually interested. The President is going to speak to our issues conference in a week and a half, and I know there is some grumbling about that, but I am actually looking forward to him coming to us so that we might be able to have another chance to persuade him to work with both sides of the aisle here on this floor to come up with a new strategy that will allow us to lend stability to that country and rebuild the world community, and do it in a way that doesn't put more and more troops of ours in harm's way. And I know, Mr. Meek, of other Members who have been here much longer than I believe that we can do that together.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Meek is very right. It is going to be in a bipartisan way. And there are moments when maybe public opinion and things you hear back in the district don't always match up with maybe the things that you hear from the experts on that particular issue. That is inevitable in public service. And there are choices to be made, and inevitably your obligation in the end is to side with the people that you represent. 
   But on this issue there is a growing hegemony of opinion that backs up public opinion within the military community. Mr. Meek quoted some of the leaders of both parties who have come out against this plan for escalation, but the military has come out against this plan as well. 
   Let me just give a quick quote of Colonel Paul Hughes, who was the first person that was put in charge of strategic planning of the U.S. occupation in Baghdad, the first person on the ground to start planning on how we were going to keep Baghdad stable. We obviously failed pretty miserably in that mission, but here is what he said about the President's plan to escalate this war. He said: ``Just sending more troops to Baghdad is like pouring more water in the sands of Al Anbar. It's going to disappear without accomplishing anything.'' 
   And that is what we have heard over and over again. There may be a number of troops that you could put into Baghdad or, lest we forget, the 12 other, 11 other major areas of conflict in Iraq. There might be a number, but it certainly isn't 21,000. And the President in his speech talked about not only using those troops to secure Baghdad but also using them to secure Al Anbar Province, also trying to do increased training, also trying to better secure the borders around Iraq to prevent the insurgents from coming in. Twenty-one thousand troops can't do that, and what ends up happening, as many of our military experts have told us over and over again, is it just puts those men and women in even graver danger. That is an opinion shared not just by Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle but by the military community as well. 
   And Mr. Meek talked about the oversight that is going to happen here in terms of our strategy going forward. And I think that these hearings have been so valuable because I think they educate the American public and educate all of us about our options going forward. But the oversight also has to be about how we conduct ourselves so far, because if there was any faith in our ability to manage this war and manage the reconstruction, then maybe we would look a little bit differently upon the President's proposal. 
   But the fact is, and this number startled me, we have $8.8 billion of money, Mr. Meek, of money that is unaccounted for by the Coalition Provisional Authority, $8.8 billion that we can't even explain where it went. That is about enough money to run the State of Connecticut for an entire year. And that is not the money we spent; that is the money we can't find anymore. 
   Mr. Meek served on the Armed Services Committee. I am going to get the opportunity to serve on the Government Reform Committee under Mr. Waxman of California, and our focus there is going to be on that waste, fraud, and abuse that has happened within our military spending in Iraq. And it is important not just because of taxpayer dollars and because we were all sent here to make sure that every hard-earned dollar that our taxpayers send to Washington gets spent effectively, but it is important because it educates us on the inefficiency and the blundering in a lot of places that has happened in the conduct of this war and the conduct of the reconstruction. And there are a myriad of reasons why we should start listening to people like Mr. Murtha and others who are counseling us to redeploy our forces and to significantly draw down the number of troops we have there very soon. There are a number of reasons why we should take those arguments seriously and why many of us support bringing a large number of our troops home very soon. 
   But at the top of that list is the fact that the money we are spending there, even beyond the philosophy, just when you are talking about the money, the money isn't being spent to make that country safer, to rebuild that country. That money is being lost, and as you said, Mr. Meek, through the Speaker, much of that money we are now finding out actually finds its way into the hands of the very people that we are fighting in Iraq. We can't account for it, and thus it finds its way into the hands of the insurgents who are attacking the convoys, who are taking the oil that is being produced there, and are, in fact, using our own money to fight our own efforts there. So it is our obligation, Mr. Meek, as you have said, not only to investigate, not only to hold hearings into the strategy and the conduct of our military operations but also to ask some questions about how all of our taxpayer dollars are being spent there, because I think we are going to find some very interesting things as we go forward in the next few weeks.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you for yielding, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I think that was the feeling that a lot of us here for our first State of the Union felt as well. I was able to sit with a lot of the first-term Members to listen to the speech, and we all left shaking our heads, because when we went out and campaigned to come to this body, and when we go back to our districts to talk to people, I mean, it is very clear that they don't want patchwork solutions when it comes to health care; they don't want a little tinkering around the edges when it comes to energy reform. They want bold leadership from Washington. 
   It is no small thing for a bunch of people across this country to go out and cast out long-term incumbents, which is what happened in a lot of these districts. It takes a lot of courage in order to make that decision for change. And, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, I think you are exactly right that they are looking to us to have that same type of courage. They are requiring us to take that same type of bold action that they took by turning over this body into new hands, into new leadership. And the President's suggestions last night when it came to health care and when it came to energy policy simply don't measure up. 
   Let's think about it; 6.8 million people in this country have lost their health care insurance in the last 6 years. Premiums during that time have risen 81 percent in the last 6 years while wages stayed flat. Now, if the President, as you said, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, listened to counsel besides his own, he would know that a tax deduction doesn't help the people that don't have insurance because about 50 percent of the uninsured aren't paying income taxes right now. So the people that we need to help, the people that right now are clogging up our emergency rooms, and, as you know, this is not just a matter of doing the right thing for the uninsured, this is doing the right thing for all of us who are subsidizing the people who walk into the emergency rooms, get this extravagantly expensive care simply because they didn't have the insurance to get them in to have preventative care. The proposal he unveiled yesterday really, I think, does grave injustice to those people out there who were struggling with a system that is fundamentally broken, and it simply isn't going to be fixed around the edges.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, you are exactly right. I remember standing at a supermarket in my district during the campaign or maybe a few years before, and a woman who was, I think, 59, 58 years old, who had been laid off, and who understandably was having trouble finding new employment. It is difficult for older Americans to find a new job, especially one that has a comprehensive package of benefits. And she looked at me with this blank face and said, ``Why am I in this position? Why can I not get health care when I know the Medicare program is right there? I am willing to pay for it. I am willing to contribute to it. And yet I can't get access to this program simply because I have been put into a situation where I can't find a job or I can't find a job with benefits, and I don't qualify for the program.'' 
   So there are ways that we can help, as you said, those older Americans who are on the cusp of being able to qualify for Medicare, and certainly the millions of children around this country who have no health care insurance and end up getting sick. I mean, they get sick, and they come into our emergency rooms to get the care they need. Mr. Ryan said here the other night, we do have a system of universal coverage in this country; unfortunately, it is in our emergency rooms rather than in our doctors' offices and our primary care doctors' offices. 
   And maybe just to tie this back to what we were talking about before when it comes to the war in Iraq. You know, we have an obligation to our veterans when they come back, and what we have done here over the past 10 years to the health care system for veterans is a travesty of justice to the brave men and women who have fought for this country. 
   I absolutely support moving towards universal coverage. I think you are right, it doesn't have to be done all at once. In fact, I think the best proposals before this body are to really take some commonsense approaches to it. But maybe the first thing we should do is start to repair some of the damage that we did to the veterans health care system to make sure that when you volunteer to serve this country abroad, that when you come back, you are going to get the mental health care that you need, that you are going to not have to wait in line for a surgery that you badly need. Maybe that is our first obligation is to take care of those folks, because in the end we are here to serve everyone, but we are certainly here to make sure that those people that fight for us, Mr. Meek, are taken care of. And I would yield to you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, Representative Schwartz. I am thrilled to be here with Representative Pallone and Representative Allen, who have been advocating for this issue and many other issues regarding health care equity for a very long time. 
   I come from the State of Connecticut, where I served, as you mentioned, Representative Schwartz, in the State legislature for about 8 years, and I chaired the Health Committee there for the last 4 years. And what we figured out was what Pennsylvania figured out a little bit before us and what dozens of other State legislatures figured out over the past few years, which is that by expanding our SCHIP program, and we have got a cute name for that program in Connecticut, where we call it the Husky program after the mascot of our University of Connecticut sports teams, we figured out over time that not only was expanding children's health care, and we actually make some adults, some of their parents, eligible for that benefit as well, that not only was it 
   the right thing to do because, as you said and you are exactly right, in the high cost of living in a State of Connecticut, $40,000 doesn't go very far, and at a time we live in today where wages are remaining pretty much stagnant and flat, and when we celebrate a year in which the average health care premium increase stays at around 10 or 11 or 12 percent, you simply can't do much with an income hovering around $40,000, $45,000 or $50,000. In Connecticut certainly that becomes a problem. So what we figured out was that not only was it the right and fair thing to do to go out and insure these thousands of children who didn't have health care insurance before, but it was cost-effective thing to do it. We have referenced that on the floor here today. 
   I give some credit to the President in his remarks that he at least recognizes that we do have one single place that very ill children and adults can go, the emergency room. But what he neglects to mention in those remarks is that not only is it the most inhumane place to dump the sick and the ill but it is also the most expensive place for those patients to end up. We know that the care that children, and we are talking about children today, end up getting in the emergency room is amongst the most expensive care that you can get. And for just a few cents on the dollar in that preventative care that in Connecticut the Husky program provides and in Pennsylvania the CHIP program provides, you cannot only get care that is the right to do and the moral thing to do for those kids, but it, frankly, saves the health care system money in the end. The cost of insuring kids is actually pretty low compared to the cost of insuring you or me or other people out in the community. Kids are generally pretty healthy. They are cheap when they are healthy, but they are very expensive when they are sick. So if you don't get them that care upfront, and the reality is that a lot of illnesses that may not present themselves to be major that may not cause a parent, even without health care insurance, to drag that child down to the emergency room, it may end up being something very serious. And the barrier to getting that preventative care is often that $100 or $200 doctor visit that stands in the way. 
   The last thing to say is to just reinforce the notion that both of you have brought up here, which I am sure we will talk about, which is that bipartisan spirit in which this bill was brought into being. I wasn't here when the bill was passed, but my predecessor was. I was preceded in this House by Representative Nancy Johnson, a Republican who served here for a very long time. And she was very proud to come back here as a Republican and talk about her role in the passage of that bill. The problem was over time there were fewer and fewer people like her in the Republican caucus who were proud to talk about insuring children, standing up for kids. And you stand here now on the Republican side of the aisle that looks and sounds very different, unfortunately, than the group that stood up in 1995. 
   And, lastly, it is not just bipartisan within that House, but you also have a wide range of ideological and advocacy groups that are standing up for the reauthorization of SCHIP, and I will mention just one and that is the United States Chamber of Commerce. Not a fan of big government, if you have ever seen any of the propaganda coming from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. So when you listen to the President or Republicans talk about the Democrats and children's health care being yet another government program, listen to what their friends are saying. Their friends in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable and all of the groups that are traditionally the main cheerleaders against any minute expansion of government are standing up for children's health care, are cheering on the Democratic effort to reauthorize the SCHIP program, because they know what we know; that not only is it the right thing to do but it is the cost-effective thing to do. We figured that out in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Connecticut and Maine. And I hope that we will be able to return to that bipartisan spirit again.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Allen, if you would yield. I guess I come to the thinking, we wish we were in that position. I mean, wouldn't it be lovely, wouldn't it be wonderful if we were in the position in which the choice was between a government-sponsored program and an employer-sponsored program or a privately available sponsored program. It just isn't the reality. And anybody who spends time out in their communities, in their social halls, in their churches and synagogues listening to families will realize that, that there are just more and more families largely, as Mr. Allen noted, that work for small businesses and simply don't have the access to health care insurance that they once did. 
   And I want to hit one more point, and I mentioned it the other night when Mr. Pallone and I were down here talking about this. We also have to disabuse people of this notion that we all aren't paying for those kids and those parents who don't have health care insurance. If the employer doesn't provide it, and then the HUSKY program in Connecticut, the SCHIP programs go away, somebody is going to pay for that health care. And we pay for it largely in two ways: one, all of the premiums that we pay, as insured people, are higher because they are basically subsidizing the care of people that don't have health care insurance, because a doctor is going to have to treat, by law, someone that shows up in an emergency room, and the hospital has to be compensated for that.     
   So private insurance normally pays about 120 percent, 110 percent of what the average Medicare rate is. They are paying a 20 percent, 10 percent premium in order to subsidize the care of the uninsured. I don't know if this is the case in all States, but in Connecticut, we also have an uncompensated care pool, a taxpayer-funded pool, where tax dollars go directly to hospitals and health care providers to help them pay for the kids that walk in, 70,000 of them without health care insurance in Connecticut that have no insurance. 
   So the idea that we are going to be spending any more money on this, when really what you are doing is you are shifting money that we are all spending in our private rates and through these taxpayer-subsidized pools of money that go to hospitals, it is just shifting it to preventive care. We have to sort of remind people that we are paying every day for the uninsured that we have now. It is simply about building a more cost effective and more humane way of paying for it.

Just to add to that partnership, it is also a partnership of health care professionals as well, because, to tell the truth, in a lot of States, Connecticut being one of them, the rate that we pay physicians for participating in the program is a little bit below the level of sufficiency. So there are a lot of physicians who want to do the right thing, who want to get compensated, but are okay not getting compensated at the same levels that they do by private HMOs. 
   It really becomes in the end, it really becomes a partnership of not only the Federal Government and the State Government, but also the provider community as well who has agreed to say, listen, because we really care and we really want to take care of this constituency, we are willing to do it for a little bit less than we would do otherwise. That has been a great benefit to the Government, to be able to get away with paying a little bit less, at least in Connecticut, than private payers do. But it is a wonderful partnership of all constituency groups.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Let me just add some final thoughts to add to the theme of inconsistency here. This is a President who has presided over the largest expansion of a government paid for health care program in my generation at least with the addition of the prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. But it was okay when it resulted in a massive giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry. 
   But when we are asking to expand health care for kids who don't have, as Mr. Pallone said, not only do they not vote, but they also don't have political action committees and they also don't have lobbyists patrolling the hallways here and within the administration. When it comes to helping the most vulnerable, the most voiceless group of individuals out there, this administration results in a deafening, deafening silence. 
   So I am so glad we are down here talking about this tonight. I came to Congress, gave up my seat working on a health care policy in the Connecticut legislature because I figured out that this really had to be a Federal fix, to try to do something for the millions of uninsured. 
   I frankly hope in a lot of places I think I am am going to depart from the legacy of the person I replaced, but on this I hope to be able to work with all of you to join back across the aisle and build that bipartisan consensus to stand up for those voiceless, lobbyist-less PAC-less constituents of ours, uninsured kids.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. If the gentlelady would yield for a moment, let us also think about what this message is to those that would sign up for this volunteer military force being sent to defend our country overseas. Not only is this unconscionable to those who have sacrificed everything to fight for this country in Afghanistan and Iraq, but think about those who we are asking to join the Armed Forces. We don't have a draft any more, and many people are thankful for that. We rely on the decisions by courageous men and women across this country to join voluntarily our Armed Forces. 
   So when they see people coming back from these wars, being treated without the basic dignity that any of us would expect those men and women to be treated with, I would think, I hope it doesn't, but I would think it might give pause to those that would join our military. 
   So I think of this from a point of conscience deep inside me, and I also think about it from a standpoint of national security. What kind of signal are we sending to those who are going to be the next generation of troops when this is how we treat them when they come back.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Altmire. Your veterans in your district and veterans across this country have you to thank, along with others, that you helped rally to the cause to make sure that the continuing resolution that we passed here, which is effectively the Act that keeps the government operating, that provides the resources to different agencies, including the Veterans Administration, you made sure that that bill had the proper resources in it for our veterans. 
   Here is the good news. We are talking about what is past and we also have to talk about the prologue as well. A new sheriff is in town, and the good news for veterans and for the American people is that we are going to make those investments in veterans health care. We are going to change things in this Congress. Mr. Altmire and I ran in part to make those changes, and Mr. Meek and Ms. Wasserman Schultz stood up here night after night after night making the case for that change. 
   If the American people spoke out about many things, one of them certainly was that part of our change in foreign policy had to be doing justice to those veterans. So I hope that when people hear us talk about some of the bad things happening within our veterans system here, they understand that we are only saying it because we are part of the movement which is going to change that. 
   The Disabled Veterans of America were in my office today, and they shared with me a pretty remarkable statistic, and I hope I get it right. In previous foreign conflicts, the ratio of those killed to those that were wounded in battle was 3 to 1 wounded to killed in action. In this conflict, it is 16 to 1. Now, that is great news, that we have made advances in protection for our soldiers, in armor, in the ability of our medical professionals to intervene on the battlefield that we are saving that many lives. It is a tragedy that one is lost, never mind the 3,000. 
   The stress, though, that that puts on our system is a great one. We have more and more wounded, more severely wounded coming into our hospitals, and it means that we have to step up to meet that new obligation. We are so lucky to have people coming back that can still go on to lead productive lives, but only if we provide them with those resources. 
   The other story that they told me was of the number of young soldiers just back from this war who are ending up in in-patient care in our State veterans hospitals, those that have been afflicted not just by the physical wounds, but by the mental wounds as well. 
   Our obligation has to be not just to treat the broken bones, the damaged bodies, but also to the mental stress that these brave men and women have come back with. 
   I just want to talk for a minute about who we are talking about here, because we have fought previous battles in a very different way. We have relied largely on our enlisted men and women to fight these wars, and I think we need to remember who we are asking to go over to Iraq and to Afghanistan to fight because no longer is it just our enlisted men. 
   We are treating our National Guard basically like they are our normal Army today. Sometimes we forget that. It is good we are the 30-something Working Group here because sometimes young people that have only seen this conflict think that that is how things are, that the National Guard and the Reserve are sort of like everybody else and they get sent over there, and that is what they signed up for. Well, that is not what they signed up for. That is not how we have conducted our military interventions in the past. 
   We have zero active duty or Reserve brigades in the United States right now that are considered combat ready. We have 84,000 members of the National Guard and Reserve that have been deployed two times or more since 2001. The average mobilization for a Reserve or National Guard member is 18 months, and now, as we are learning that the President is once again going to rely on National Guard forces to be part of this new escalation in Iraq, we are finding out that these forces, as they get ready in their hometowns and their home States, are not even close to combat ready in terms of the equipment they need. 
   The Oklahoma National Guard reports that one-third of their members do not have the M-4 rifles.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. We are talking about the best of the best. If anyone was able to operate and achieve under the strain, it is the men and women in our Armed Forces, and so we expect a lot of them because we know the training they have been through. We know the kind of people they are, but we have asked so much of them that we can ask very little more. 
   We do differentiate at some level between our enlisted men and our National Guard and Reserve troops, and I think it is appropriate because when you are talking about them, you are talking about ripping somebody out of a family, out of a community. 
   These are not just fathers and mothers. These are small businessmen. These are employees. These are employers. These are members of the PTA. These are members of the Elks Club. These are people who hold communities together. That is the type of people that our members of the Armed Forces are. Those people that sign up for the Reserve and National Guard do that because they have this commitment to their community, and it does not end with their commitment to their military service. They are part of the community in ways that a lot of other people are not. 
   So when you talk about bringing people out two or three times to serve in the Reserve and National Guard, you are breaking up families and communities. That is why we had an enlisted service. 
   I think one of the discussions that we will have going forward, and one that I think will be bipartisan agreement on, as there has been with most everything we have done here, is that we need to have an honest conversation about increasing the troop strength of our military, increasing numbers of troops that are enlisted and doing this as a permanent job, because it has gotten to the end of the limit of a lot of the people who are serving in our National Guard and our Reserve.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank you, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I just want to bring up one other topic here as well before we yield back to Mr. Meek, and that is also, when we ask our men and women to go over there and fight, and then when they come home and they are not taken care of, we also need to remember who we are sending over there, our Reservists and National Guard, but who is joining them over there. This is a tangential but important topic. President Bush has talked a lot about this coalition of the willing, and we need to understand  that the American people, when they hear about the allied forces over there, know who they are now, because people are jumping ship faster than the evening news can keep up with it. Great Britain, Poland, Lithuania, South Korea. By the week, somebody else walks away. And as we make decisions in Iraq, like this plan for escalation in which there is not even a pretext of reaching out and forming some international consensus, remember when we went into Iraq in the first place, at least we tried to pretend that we were going to go through some international decision-making process. At least we sort of gave some faint illusion of using the United Nations as a forum for which to have this discussion. You didn't even hear a conversation about trying to reach out to our allies with this plan to escalate this war. I mean, we didn't. Because why? Because we knew if we asked Great Britain or Poland or South Korea or Lithuania to be part of this force, the answer would be pretty simple.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. If you sort of listen to the rhetoric coming out of the administration, you would think this grand coalition has, what, 50 percent American troops, 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent? No. Ninety-two percent. Ninety-two percent of the troops on the ground in Iraq are American forces. We went from a high of coalition troops, those are non-American troops, of 25,000, and now down to almost below 15,000 troops and dropping by the day. 
   So I think that is just a point of information that we have now decided on a path that isn't even going to have a hint of coalition-building. We have decided to go this on our own. And, frankly, I think that has grievous consequences for what is happening on the ground in Iraq, frankly has just as important consequences for the future of foreign policy when we have gotten to a point where we don't even talk to our allies about our strategy there. 
   And I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Florida.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I thank Chairman Miller and Mr. Watt for their leadership in bringing this bill through the committee. I want to draw attention to one provision of the bill and underscore the importance of the provisions here that prohibit steering of borrowers into higher-cost mortgages than they would otherwise qualify for. 
   This mirrors legislation that I introduced earlier this year, H.R. 3813, the Mortgage Kickback Prevention Act. The bill before us prevents mortgage originators from inappropriately steering consumers into higher-cost loans than they would otherwise qualify for. 
   This is a commonsense measure, and it is made more reasonable by the restriction to apply this only to subprime loans. To me and my constituents, it is pretty simple. Brokers and mortgage originators shouldn't have an incentive to put borrowers into more expensive loans than they would otherwise qualify for. 
   Frankly, as we move forward, I think it is important to understand that disclosure doesn't do the entire trick here. Most borrowers have no idea what it means when their broker discloses that they are going to pay a yield-spread premium amidst the mountains of paperwork that you are required to fill out for a residential mortgage. For these borrowers who have the least amount of leverage in the process, we need to have some clear lines. This bill does that. 
   That is why it makes sense to simply say the brokers and originators cannot inappropriately put borrowers into loans they otherwise would not qualify for. This Congress has responsibility, as we are doing today, to reset the rules.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to applaud my colleagues, Representative Klein, Representative Mahoney and Representative Ginny Brown-Waite, for bringing this measure before us today. 
   The rising premiums in the insurance world, the instability that this recent rash of natural catastrophes have brought to the insurance industry mandate a response from this Congress; and it's time, as Mr. Klein and Mr. Mahoney have said, to stop closing our eyes and pretend that the solution is to just continue to have a policy of crisis reaction, where we put Federal dollars after Federal dollars on top of these disasters. 
   This measure before us, very carefully considered and brought to the floor on a bipartisan basis, is a planful and market-based approach to the  issue of crisis mediation, especially on the eastern seaboard. 
   But to the extent that we are setting up a new Federal role, to the extent that we're contemplating potentially committing Federal dollars through loans, frankly as Mr. Klein has said in a much more responsible way than we have done in previous situations, we need to make sure that these dollars are being used wisely. 
   Now, the manager's amendment before us right now goes a very long way towards that goal in making sure that the programs themselves at the State level are fiscally sound or actuarially sound. 
   The amendment before us, brought to the floor today by myself, Representative Matsui, Representative Bean and Representative Larson, seeks to build on that duty of fiscal responsibility that we have as we potentially commit, in a planful way, Federal dollars through loans to coastal areas. 
   Therefore, this amendment that we're offering today would require that before a State insurance program qualifies to borrow from the Federal Government, the Treasury Department will ensure that the State has taken adequate steps to mitigate future losses. It's a pretty common sense measure. 
   To do this, the amendment simply requires that the Secretary of the Treasury certify that participating States, entities, these State insurance funds, have implemented internationally recognized building codes to ensure that the new homes that are being built in these States can withstand severe natural catastrophes like earthquakes and floods and hurricanes.     
   These State programs have also developed land use plans to further mitigate the risk and losses stemming from natural disasters. This amendment doesn't provide for new Federal building codes. It doesn't provide for new Federal land use requirements or Federal risk mitigation regulations. It just merely seeks to assure that before we are putting Federal tax dollars in State programs that these States have done everything that they can to reduce future risks from natural catastrophe. 
   I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr. Mahoney and Mr. Klein, for working with me and the staffs for working with my staff on this issue. I think it addresses many of the issues that Mr. Roskam and others on the other side of the aisle have and will raise today. I think it assures that this very positive step forward that has been introduced by Mr. Mahoney and Mr. Klein will be made even safer and sounder if it comes to the point of using Federal taxpayer dollars in these programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you very much, Mr. Altmire. It is a pleasure to be with my new 30-Something colleague on the floor here to discuss what I think you set out before us very accurately is a fiscally reckless and irresponsible budget, but also a morally irresponsible budget. 
   You outlined what the problem here is. The problem here, Mr. Speaker, is that we have got a budget that doesn't paint the whole picture for this Congress, doesn't tell the whole story for this country. We have got a budget which claims to be in balance. 
   Mr. Altmire, I remember being here for my first State of the Union speech, I did not sit too far away from you, and we listened to the President stand up at the podium there at the second level and say we could work together on a balanced budget, that we could do the right thing for the American people, do the things that Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan and Ms. Wasserman Schultz have been talking about for 2 years in the 30-Something Working Group, and that is making sure that we don't pass on the cost of government to our children and our grandchildren by these massive deficits that we are racking up. 
   Instead, the President handed us a budget today, a pretty big stack of papers there, that claims to balance the budget, but does so by omitting some of the biggest costs within the budget. 
   At the top of the list is the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are not in that budget. Those are emergency expenditures, emergency appropriations, and so the President hasn't seen fit to incorporate those in the budget. 
   He also doesn't include the cost of fixing what is called the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is a tax that, if not repealed, it was supposed to be for the wealthiest taxpayers, but because we haven't made any adjustments over the years, this Alternative Minimum Tax is all of a sudden not going to be much of an alternative, because millions of middle class families throughout this country are going to have to pay it. So that is not in there either. 
   By the way, it also assumes that we are going to take in billions of dollars in revenue beyond what most reasonable economists will tell you we are going to bring in in the next 5 to 10 years. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, what we have is a budget that doesn't tell the whole story. I can balance my budget pretty easily at home if I just, for instance, don't include the cost of my mortgage. I could spend everything. I could buy five flat screen TVs for my house, I could get a caretaker to mow my lawn and cut my shrubs, so long as my budget didn't include my mortgage. But, do you know what? My family and your family and everybody else's family in this country has to make their budget meet, their revenues and expenditures meet, by incorporating all of their costs. The budget that you held up there doesn't do that. It only encapsulates parts of our costs.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. We are talking here about adding $3.2 trillion to the deficit over the next 2 years, $3.2 trillion to a deficit that is already exploding beyond any numbers of previous Congresses. Remember, this Congress inherited when the Republicans took control in 1994 a surplus. They had money to spend and they have turned it into record deficits, and now the President is going to add on to it.     
   Now, here is the other part, Mr. Altmire, that creates the problem. This budget that was presented to us today not only doesn't include the cost of the war, doesn't include fixing this middle class tax increase, also paints a real rosy picture in term of revenues, but it also has some tax breaks in it, but they are tax breaks for the very, very wealthy. We have got another $2 trillion in tax breaks over the next 10 years in this budget, and as we know because we have all seen the charts in the 30-something Working Group, because I have watched them on TV talk about it for the last 2 years. Those tax breaks, Mr. Altmire, are going to end up going to the richest 1, 2, 3 percent of Americans, and the hard working middle class families in and around the Pittsburgh area where you are and in and around northwestern Connecticut aren't going to get the benefit of those tax breaks. 
   So what throws this thing so out of balance is not just that we are not counting some massive expenditures in the war in Iraq, and hopefully the Congress is going to do something about that, but it also includes in it these big tax breaks that just aren't going to go to families like yours or families throughout Philadelphia, throughout Connecticut, in fact throughout this whole country. 
   So Mr. Speaker and Members, we have got some work to do on this budget. And I am frankly upset by the budget that the President put before us, but I am glad that we have a party in control and a leadership in control of this House that is going to take that budget, it is going to take that budget and twist it and turn it so that middle class families end up coming out in the lead at the end of this process. Because what has happened in the past is the President puts forth one of these backwards budget, the Republicans sort of tinker with it here and there to make sure that it ends up favoring the special interests of the lobbyists that are currently in favor in Congress, and in the end people that we care about don't get helped at all. 
   So, Mr. Altmire, I am just looking forward to a budget process here which takes I think what is a very flawed document and turns it around and makes it work for regular middle class, working class families throughout this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Will the gentleman yield for a moment on that point? Just very quickly, I want to hammer that home. Because when people out there in the public, and I did this too when I was watching Congress for years, sees some of these cuts to programs here that people up here in Washington talk about, you know, the government tightening their belts and doing the right thing for curbing the growth of spending programs; what they don't understand is that just passes on the buck, as you said, to the states. Now, the States sometimes pick up the tab and pass it along in increases in the sales tax or the income tax. But in Connecticut what often happens is that the cuts to these programs just get passed down again. In Connecticut, they get passed down to the local towns, counties, and other States. And in Connecticut, the property taxes just go up. So all of this supposed belt tightening that happens here to programs that need to get taken care of, whether they be education programs or health care programs, just get passed down and somebody else pays for them. That really in the end, Mr. Altmire, to me is one of the worst cases of fiscal irresponsibility, because you are pretending that you are taking care of a problem when really you are just handing it down for somebody else to take care of. And we will take some hits up here if we need to in order to get taken care of what needs to be taken care of here rather than just making somebody else be responsible.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. To me, this budget does not spare anybody in who it offends. This budget has something to offend poor people, middle class folks, and it has a lot to offend rich people in this country. 
   My district is good enough that it has a little bit of everything, and part of the reason that some of us got sent here after having the other party represent our districts for a very long time was that the fiscal policies of this President, which are symbolized by this document he sent here, are offensive to people of every income bracket. For the folks at the bottom of the scale who need those public schools, who need those health care programs, well it takes money out of their pocket. From middle class families, who are trying to get their kids through college, who are trying to fill up their tank and go to work, it does not do anything for them either. It cuts alternative energy programs. 
   For people at the top end of the income scale who admittedly are giving a decent percentage of their income to the Federal Government, they are looking at the charts that Mr. Ryan is throwing up here and saying how on earth can I justify giving a big chunk of my income to the Federal Government and the Federal Government sending more and more control of our money overseas to Chinese and OPEC Nations. 
   One last thing on that point. We also do not give people at the upper end income brackets enough credit. They see what is happening to the poor families, to the senior citizens struggling to decide whether they pay their property tax bill or whether they pay their prescription drugs. Those same people who have enjoyed these massive tax breaks, a lot of them will say to me, you know what, I cannot understand the government who has the choice to put $40,000 in my pocket or help the guy around the corner from me pay for his prescription drugs for another month and he chooses to give me $40,000. 
   There are people of every income in this country who will find something offensive in this budget, and Mr. Ryan is exactly right. For the last 6 years, as you guys said over and over again, all this House was was a big rubber stamp on that budget when it showed up here and no longer. 
   We now have to stand up for all the people who have found something to object to in that budget.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I think every Member in this House, Republican or Democrat, can tell the same story about what this does for their district, and it is particularly acute in Pennsylvania. But let us hammer home what we are talking about. Mr. Ryan said it very eloquently, we are not just talking about writing a check. You are, Mr. Ryan. 
   We are talking about making choices, we are not talking about solving these problems by putting money into health care, putting more money in education. We are talking about where to make choices on the budget, on who to help and who to take from, who to help and who to take. 
   Let's start with the health care budget for a moment. Let's start with the premise that we need to rein in the health care budget. It is spiraling at a cost well above inflation, it is one of the biggest cost drivers in our budgets, in State budgets, families' budgets and small businesses' budgets. But here is the choice that you have. You can either raise the costs for beneficiaries for seniors and for people within the children with within that SCHIP program. 
   You can cut people out of the system, you can take kids off the rolls or seniors off the rolls, or, you can choose to ratchet down some of the profits that you are handing to the drug companies, or you can choose to roll back some of the massive overpayments that we have given to the HMOs, the health maintenance organizations, in the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. 
   Common sense tells you that as you are looking at massive record profits being wrapped up by the latter groups, that maybe, maybe, if you have that choice, you should take a look at wiping away that little slush fund that you gave to the HMOs, or allowing the Federal Government to negotiate using their bulk purchasing power to just trim a little bit off of those billion dollar profits being made by the drug companies. Instead, this budget makes a different choice. It cuts people off of the rolls and it raises the fees for people on there. So this is not just about writing a bigger check.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. We needed an off night tonight. We got an off night from the playoffs. So those of us that wallowed in the Boston defeat are glad to have a little separation to let our team regroup and rethink how they're going to approach this. 
   It's rare that we have five members of the 30-somethings here. As the two new Members here, I want to make sure we understand our place. So I'm going to be very, very brief and just say this: To add on to all the great reasons why we should do this, this is reaching out to families that have done everything that we've asked them to do; they're playing by the rules. They simply can't afford insurance in a market in which in a State like Connecticut you're going to pay $8,000 or $9,000 out of pocket before an insurance company picks up dollar one for the average family plan that you look at on a lot of these insurance programs. 
   It's the right thing to do because it saves money in the long run because you're getting preventative care to the kids that are going to end up sick and in the hospital later on and end up costing the system way more money because you didn't invest in prevention and end up paying for crisis care. 
   I think it's also important to note that this bill is paid for. This bill is part of an effort here in this Congress to advance some of the most important programs in the middle class. We're talking about health care programs, student loan programs, minimum wage and do it in a way that doesn't add to this enormous, unfathomable deficit that the Republican Congress put us under. 
   Let's just talk about the facts, because Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek especially talked about this over and over and over again on the floor here. 
   When the Republicans took control, they had a $5.6 trillion surplus that President Clinton left them with. They have now turned it into, along with this President, a $2 trillion 10-year deficit. The debt which started at the beginning of the President's administration at $5.7 trillion has ballooned to $9 trillion. 
   So our biggest task here is to make sure that we don't add to that just unbelievable amount of money that this country and every single citizen here owes, and guess what, we are able to do that, to pass a 5-year budget that's going to be balanced after 5 years, to pass a rule that mandates that we don't spend a dime of new money without accounting for how we pay for it. We're able to run the most fiscally responsible Congress that this country has seen in a very long time, while maintaining our commitment to expand programs that help the middle class. 
   That's what we have to remember when we talk about this SCHIP bill, the children's health bill, is that this isn't more deficit spending. This is targeted spending on people who need it, the middle class. It's paid for.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I don't have notebooks; I just have loose scraps of paper. I haven't reached that level of organization of veteran Members like yourselves. 
   Let me talk about one more myth. There is not a bill that comes before this House, and you and I, Mr. Altmire, are new here, so we are figuring this out as we go along. But there is not a bill that comes before this House that somebody on the other side doesn't scream ``illegal immigrants'' over. Right? That is just sort of the buzz word that accompanies every bill here. 
   We had a Native American housing bill before this House a couple of weeks back, and somebody on the other side filed an amendment to make sure that no Native American housing benefits went to illegal immigrants. Now, I know that we run our programs pretty inefficiently in this country, but you have to really mismanage the Native American housing program in order to give some of the housing to illegal immigrants. 
   So what they are saying on the other side is that this children's health care bill is going to go to illegal immigrants. Not true. Find me anywhere in that bill that allows for that. In fact, Mr. Altmire, it doesn't even allow for those health care benefits as part of the SCHIP program to go to legal immigrants, people who have their papers, did everything right, are waiting to become citizens of this country. They can't get the children's health care program under this bill.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. It lays it out, black and white. So yet another example of if you say it over and over again and you hope that people believe it. As we have said over and over, the agenda here is pretty clear. Republicans and the President simply do not want this Congress to extend basic foundational health care rights to middle-class, to kids, and they are coming up with all sorts of crazy arguments that don't have truth, a strain of truth in them to try to stop them.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I just think in the end this is about choices, Mr. Altmire. Mr. Ryan was talking about it before. This is about whether you want to continue to throw billions upon billions of dollars into a war in Iraq that, frankly, is probably making this country less safe rather than more safe as it breeds terrorism and Islamic jihadists within the boundaries of Iraq. 
   It's about whether you want to continue to give away $12 to $18 billion of tax breaks to the oil companies that the oil companies themselves say they don't need to continue putting products into the American market. Do you want to continue to subsidize the drug industry, which is making out like bandits off of a prescription drug program that pads their pockets and their profits, as we just found out from a new report from the Government Oversight Committee that tells us that we're wasting $15 billion a year on the Medicare prescription drug program. 
   You want to help drug companies or poor kids? Do you want to help oil companies or poor kids? Do you want to throw more money in a religious civil war, or do you want to help poor kids? I mean, the reason why these polls, one after another, come out pleading with Congress to get its act together and pass children's health care is because everybody out there in the community, at the social halls, at the union halls, at the churches, at the synagogues, at the pasta suppers and the pancake breakfasts, the PTA, they've all figured out that we're making the wrong choice; that in the end the choice is easy. You help middle-class families afford college. You help them get health care. You boost their wages up to a livable wage, and you can do that without spending another dime in taxpayer money in the end. I mean, that's the great thing. You don't want to have to raise anybody's taxes to do it. You just make different choices. Iraq, oil companies, drug companies, instead, minimum wage, health care, kids going to college. I mean, that seems like common sense, Mr. Ryan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, Mr. Ryan. I am only making a name for myself by associating myself with the works and deeds of Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan. 
   You are exactly right. As you know, I am able to join you here as a second time as a new Member of this Congress. 
   What we were charged with doing was really taking back this House and this place for people who are struggling every day to make ends meet. The cost of tuition since 2001 has gone up 41 percent, while we know wages have essentially remained stagnant, the minimum wage staying exactly where it has been for the last 2 years, while the cost of everything from food to school to gas goes up exponentially. 
   What we are doing here, piece by piece, is really restoring that American dream, that idea your kids might be able to do better than you, that your grandkids are going to live in a world with a greater quality of life than you were able to live in. The first 100 hours were about doing that, and, as I know you both have remarked, doing it in a bipartisan way, doing it in a way in which the votes that came before in the first 2 weeks drew an average of 60 Republican votes. 
   As Mr. Meek was saying as I walked into the Chamber, I think the President tonight will find a very receptive Democratic side of the aisle if he seeks to embrace that same type of middle-class/working-class agenda that we have made really the central feature of this place for the last 2 weeks. 
   Mr. Ryan, if I might, I wanted to talk just for a moment about health care, because we are going to hear something from the President that, unfortunately, we have heard for the last several years. We have heard that the President wants to focus on the rising costs of health care, the trouble that middle-class families are finding in trying to find insurance. 
   It is about time on the issue of health care that this administration starts to meet words with action. We have seen a lot of verbal compassion, but we haven't seen a lot of meaningful reform from this administration, as the profits being made by those who would make money off of this health care system are in record numbers today. We are seeing on the other side record numbers of families falling into the ranks the uninsured. 
   Tonight we are going to hear a proposal that will essentially lop off families who are receiving good insurance and put them into the ranks of those families that have very bad insurance or are underinsured. Essentially the President is going to propose tonight to make health care cheaper and worse, whereas the Democrats, we know we can find a way to make health care cheaper and better. 
   I simply look forward, Mr. Ryan, to engaging the President on that debate and trying to convert he and his administration to the new-found wisdom we found in this Chamber to put middle-class families rather than those lobbyists and corporate interests first.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank Mr. Meek. 
   There are already reports that the words we may get tonight are going to give a little short shrift to the issue of Iraq. If the President wants to put forth a plan that is so unpopular that it is not backed by his own military leaders, it is not backed by our civilian foreign policy expert, it is not backed by the American public, well, then he should also have the courage to talk about it, to defend it, to put it before us. But knowing that it is unpopular, we may not hear too much about it tonight. 
   To get back to, Mr. Meek, your point on health care, let us be honest about  what is going to be proposed tonight, how we are going to save money on health care. It is not by investing more in prevention; it is not by moving people out of emergency rooms and putting them into real programs and care. It is taking people who have good insurance and making their good insurance bad insurance. It is going out and taking folks who have had the great benefit of working for an employer that provides a comprehensive package of benefits, and it is becoming less and less likely these days that even good employers out there can afford to give a robust package of benefits. 
   What the President is going to propose today is that for families that have had the good fortune to find a good insurance plan, they are going to tax that employer. They are going to make it less likely that you are going to get good insurance anymore. So we are going to get a proposal today which is going to actually result in worse health care for a lot of families. 
   I guess the point here is that, you know, again, if we are going to listen to the words that come from this administration, we heard in last year's State of the Union that we need to confront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor/patient relationship and help people afford the insurance coverage we need, if we want to talk about that, then we need to do something about that. And how we do something about that is not by taking the haves and putting them into the column of the have-nots. It is by keeping the haves where they are on health care and taking the have-nots and giving them that same level of health care. 
   We can absolutely do that without adding cost to the system, because those have-nots, as Mr. Ryan said, end up getting care. They just end up getting the most expensive, the most unfortunate type of care, that being crisis care. We can do a better job on that. 
   And, Mr. Meek, as you said, we can make sure that we continue to have that discussion on Iraq, which may be missing tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (CONGRATULATING CHESHIRE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS SWIM TEAM -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, you know, we live in a world that's hard to reconcile sometimes. Now, our focus often is on the evil that exists in this world, but all too often we let that focus overwhelm the counterbalancing good things that happen in our communities every day. And I rise today to recognize that strange, delicate symmetry in my hometown of Cheshire, Connecticut. 
   This week, the Cheshire High School girls swim team broke the record for the longest dual-meet winning streak in American history with their 235th straight victory. As you can imagine, this is a pretty remarkable record to break. In fact, the girls on this record-breaking swim team that broke the record on Monday night weren't even alive when that streak began some 21 years ago. 
   I wasn't there Monday night, unfortunately, but hundreds of parents and friends and siblings and supporters were in attendance, and I heard that the record-breaking night was pretty magical. But strangely, something else happened that night, something that the girls probably didn't even notice or seek out. Monday night, the girls swim team at Cheshire High School transcended statistics and records and wins and losses. And the most important marker that they set down that night was not as the best swim team in the country, but as a bright, beaming emblem of a resurgent community with so much to celebrate. 
   You see, my town has been grieving over the past several months. And it's hard to figure out what else to do when you wake up one morning and find out that three of your neighbors, a mother and her two young, vibrant daughters, lost their lives in an unspeakable act of barbarism. It becomes difficult, impossible even, to square the wonderful, serene existence of life in a quiet small town with the random and brutal acts of violence that left Dr. William Petit mourning the unexplainable loss of his family. 
   How do you reconcile the two? How do you wake up, even for those of us who didn't know the family personally or live in that neighborhood, and pretend that the veil of safety and goodness that always seemed to envelop Cheshire, Connecticut, was still there after that? I thought about little else in the days and weeks following that incident, and I know that I wasn't alone. 
   But then the unexpected happens. And I know it sounds silly to even talk about a murder and a swim team in the same sentence and, frankly, of course, the two are incomparable, but therein lies the problem. There is no and there will be no one clear moment when we collectively decide that the moral order has been restored in our community. And so we're left to seek out those moments that simply remind us of why we love Cheshire in the first place and why we have confidence that our community will heal, that we will persevere, and that we will recover. This week is one of those moments. 
   I didn't grow up in Cheshire, so I certainly can't claim to know the town like those who call it their birthplace, but I did know a good thing when I found it. And Tuesday morning, when I heard that the record had broken, I couldn't help but wonder whether it wasn't just a coincidence that a national record 21 years in the making matured at the very moment that a burst of good news was most needed in our community. And I couldn't help but think about how this streak, which started two decades ago and has been the careful construction of hundreds of girls and thousands more family members, friends, supporters and coaches stands as a testament to the strength, persistence and spirit of our little town, not just on one night, but over the span of decades. 
   And so, yes, one unspeakable act can and probably should shake the confidence and faith of a community. And  nothing will ever repair that damage, certainly not for the Petit family, and probably not entirely for the community that they call home. 
   And so we're left to look for those moments of triumph, those instances of community reaffirmation that remind us why Cheshire is such a special place to live. Well, we found one this week. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Cheshire High School girls swim team and to thank them for everything that they have done. Cheshire is a pretty special place to live, and Monday night reminded us of why that is.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I would like to welcome my colleagues to another addition of the 30-Something's hour. I would like to thank the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, for allowing us the opportunity to get together and talk not only about some of the most important issues that face this hall this week and at this moment but also talk a little bit about how these issues are of particular concern to people of younger generations in this country. 
   We are going to be joined today, I know, by Mr. Altmire, who just gave a very compelling 5-minute address to the House and, hopefully very soon, by Ms. Wasserman Schultz, one of our favorite members of the 30-Something Group. 
   Madam Speaker, hopefully we will get to touch on a few different topics, but I think we need to touch on at the beginning of this hour the subject that really dominates the debate in Washington, D.C., right now, that dominates  most of the discussion out in the coffeehouses and pancake breakfasts and pasta dinners happening across this land, and that is, what is happening in this town? What is happening in Washington, D.C., inside the beltway? And that is, why can't government figure out what everyone else has figured out across the country, that we need to set a new direction when it comes to this country's policy in Iraq. 
   Now, I am certainly starting to feel that frustration. People thought when they weighed in on the national elections in the beginning of November of last year that they were actually saying something; that when they stood up in record numbers in some parts of this country and made courageous decisions district by district to replace long-time incumbent Members this Congress with relatively new Members, such as myself, such as Mr. Altmire and some 40-odd number of our friends on this side of the aisle that became new Members this January, they thought that it meant something. They thought that that voice that they spoke with in the beginning of November was going to be heard down here. And I can tell when I go back to my district, and I just came back this last weekend and I have been back every weekend since we have been down, that the patience of the American people is starting to wear thin. Now, it is not necessarily directed here. I think some people are still in some sort of sense of euphoria that we finally have a Congress that is listening to the American people again. Their anger is directed at the President of the United States. Their anger is directed at an administration that just doesn't seem to get it, that refuses every step of the way to step up to the plate and have some type of accountability for what is happening here, refuses to listen to the American people. 
   And the American people have spoken in the election, and they continue to speak today. A CNN poll that came out just a short while ago said a majority of Americans, 65 percent, oppose the Iraq war, and a full 54 percent disapprove of the President's decision to veto the Iraq accountability bill last week. Nearly six in ten Americans, in a recent Gallup poll, support setting a firm timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops out of Iraq; 61 percent of Americans, in another CNN poll, favor a bill that sets benchmarks that the Iraq government must meet to show progress that is being made in Iraq; 55 percent of Americans think it was the wrong thing for the United States to go to war in the first place. That is an amazing number, Madam Speaker; 55 percent of Americans, the majority of the Americans, now today believe that it was the wrong decision to go into Iraq in the first place. 
   Before the time of Mr. Altmire and me, the 30-Something Democrats, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek and Ms. Wasserman Schultz, liked to point out third-party verifiers. It is not just our saying it. Things that we stand here and say have actually been said time and time again by people who know what they are talking about and the American people. 
   Here is third-party verification: The American people by large numbers support not only the actions of this Congress when it comes to setting firm benchmarks for the Iraqis to stand up for themselves but also to set firm timetables by which we would start to redeploy our troops. Now, the American people join a growing hegemony of opinion within our foreign policy community. There are very few times when Republicans and Democrats outside this hall decide to agree on a course forward on something as weighty as the foreign policy issues that confront us in the Middle East. But the Iraq Study Group, five Democrats, five Republicans, Mr. Altmire, came together and told us, it is time to set a new course. It is time to start bringing our troops home, start redeploying them to fights that matter. Record numbers of retired generals. 
   Now, it has become kind of de rigueur to see on a daily basis retired generals from across America to come out and start to criticize the President's policy. This didn't happen before in these numbers. This is not the normal course of business for the men and women who have spent their lives fighting and leading American troops to then turn around after they have left their military service and criticize the very government that they have worked for, fought for and bled for all of those years. But that is what is happening today because the stakes are so high. The American public, bipartisan leaders on foreign policy issues and former military leaders are standing up and saying enough is enough.     
   We need to set a new course. 
   Now, there seems to be a very powerful sound barrier that has been built around the White House. Because for as many voices, the multitudes of American people, the multitudes of foreign policy experts, of retired generals, many of which ended their careers on the ground in Iraq, for all of those people throwing the might of their collective voices at the White House, a deafening silence. 
   Madam Speaker, I got the chance to go over and visit our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; and the first thing you're struck by is the unbelievable and unconditional bravery that they show this Nation. The capability of these forces is almost beyond explanation, and I got the chance to come back and talk to the President very briefly about it in a visit to the White House. 
   Those troops know that the situation on the ground has changed dramatically, that the fight that began as a battle against the autocrat that was Saddam Hussein now has become a civil war. The troops know it because they're right in the middle of it. 
   We asked our military leaders, how much of the fire that is being directed at American troops is the result of insurgent forces and al Qaeda forces firing at Americans and how much of it is simply a sectarian war that we find ourselves in the middle of? And the answer was the same no matter who you asked. Ninety percent of the fire directed at American forces are Sunni and Shia fighting each other, sometimes Shia and Shia fighting each other, that we are caught in the middle of. 
   This President, for some reason, refuses to understand how things have changed on the ground in Iraq and how things have changed when it comes to the opinion of foreign policy leaders, military leaders and the American public. 
   I think many of us were very proud to stand together, certainly the freshman class and as a caucus, to support our leadership's position to set a new course; and we were dismayed to see a President who is unwilling to work with this Congress. We will take another shot at that this week by presenting the President with another alternative on his desk once again to set that new direction. And from what we hear today, it will be met with the same resounding deafening silence and indifference to the will of the American people. 
   I am so glad to be joined here by one of my great freshman colleagues, Mr. Altmire from Pennsylvania, who I think shares with me, as new Members, as two young guys who have only spent about 4 or 5 months down here, that sort of growing sense of frustration when we go back to our districts and we hear people who wanted that change feeling like they're not getting it here because there is an administration that simply won't join that growing unanimity of opinion to set a new course. 
   I would like to yield to my friend from Pennsylvania.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Thank you, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. 
   Your question is a perfect one: When will this madness end? When will we recognize that we need to set a new course, that we need to start paying attention to not just what's happening within the borders of Iraq but what's happening in Afghanistan, what's happening on our own shores, where we still haven't appropriated the amount of money to devote to the resources that we should in order to secure our own borders and our own ports? 
   And here is what it comes down to: If the Democrats weren't in control, the madness would never end; it would go on forever. There is absolutely no commitment, no willingness, no one on the other side of the aisle, very few at least on the other side of the aisle and certainly very few in the administration have woken up to the new reality here. 
   And to me, I won't say who it was, but a member of the Republican leadership the other day was quoted in the paper as saying this. This person said, you know what? The President, we are going to give him some time to put forth this plan to escalate the war in and around Baghdad.     
   But if it doesn't work, he is going to have to tell us what plan B is. Guess what. We are not on plan B we are on plan like double R. We have tried everything. We have been in there for longer than we were involved in World War II, and we still haven't found out what works. 
   Well, at some point, we are going to have to wake up to the notion that nothing that our military may try is going to work. 
   Now, if anyone can do this job, I think our military can do it. The problem is that we have gotten ourselves into a political quagmire, and the sooner we realize that plan A and plan B and plan C and D and E and F all didn't work, in large part because we have gotten ourselves into a mess that has probably, we hope, a political and diplomatic solution but may not have a military solution. 
   Ms. Wasserman Schultz, I just want to talk for a minute, I know we really want to talk about some domestic issues here, but I want to talk about some of the stress we have put on our forces here at home. Because I have to tell you, as we watched some of the tragedies unfold in the Midwest, in Kansas, and we saw the inability of our National Guard in that State to respond, unfortunately, it took that incident for a lot people to finally wake up to the notion that our Reserve units and our National Guard units, the very troops that we relied on for years, decades, to provide us with security when tragedy befell our compatriots here at home, aren't there any longer. We heard it from Governors in Iowa, Minnesota and, of course, now in Kansas. 
   The administration, as usual, seems to be more interested in throwing around blame than they seem to be interested in actually solving the problem. When the Governor of Kansas came out and said, listen, here you see it; we don't have the resources to respond to this devastating crisis because our National Guard units have been deployed over and over again overseas in a way that we never asked our National Guard and Reserve units to be deployed in the past, the White House came back and said, well, you know what? That is not our fault. That is the Governor's fault for not telling us that she had problems. If she had just told us she had problems, we would have done something about it. 
   Well, guess what? She did. Last year, quoted in the New York times, the Governor of Kansas said, we are not only missing National Guard personnel, we are also missing a lot of the equipment that is used to deal with situations at home, day in and day out. 
   Well, you know, we have heard a lot about how folks in the White House don't read newspapers with the rigor that some of us do. They certainly did not read The New York Times that day when the Governor of Kansas almost a year ago sounded the bell and said, if we don't start replenishing our units here at home, we are going to be in big trouble. And we are.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, let me set the stage to kick it over to Ms. Wasserman Schultz. 
   Here it is. The President took office January 22, 2001, $1.47; $1.47, that is like sort of a mystical number now. I can't even fathom when we were paying $1.47 for gas. Today, the average price for a gallon in the United States, $3.05. 
   Now, I am going to admit that in my part of the world, in northwestern Connecticut, probably like everybody's district, we have a couple of conspiracy theorists up there. We have a couple of people that are not actually willing to believe that the best of intentions are always at the root of decisions made in our political and economic system. 
   I have to tell you, the cynic in me and the conspiracy theorist in me, and there is a little bit of it, wonders a little bit why gas prices dipped down, curiously, right about the time when we were all up for election and reelection. Just when there was this sort of wave of economic discontent swinging across the country and all of the people were talking about finally taking our economy back from the oil companies. Just as this country was poised to make a decision to finally end, as Mr. Altmire said, our firm decades-long dependence on oil and foreign oil in large part, why did gas prices just dip right then? And then as soon as January, February came around, creeping up and up, a little bit more and a little bit more. Now as we head into the summer, into the prime driving months of the year, we are at $3.05 a gallon. 
   Now, I am not willing to say that is just politics, but the cynic in me has to wonder sometimes whether or not our gas and oil companies were just hoping, hoping that they could stem the tide and that they wouldn't have a Democratic majority here who would make a difference.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. On the heels of introducing some of our colleagues and members of the administration to a gas pump, and I think you are right, it is hard to understand how people can be so indifferent to the rising costs. Maybe they haven't seen a gas pump 
   I want to introduce them to something else. 
   This is a wallet. If you are an oil company executive, your wallet is busting at the seams. So your wallet is going to look different. This is a thin wallet. This is what the American people, working-class individuals throughout this country are dealing with. They are dealing with wages that have been pretty much flat for the last 5 years. 
   Oil company profits over the last 5 years have gone from $6.5 billion in 2002 to $30.2 billion in 2007. I want to make sure that while we are introducing some of our colleagues and some people in the administration to a gas pump, let's also introduce them to the thin wallet. If the average worker's income doubled from 2001 to 2007, I would say no problem, you can handle gas prices that doubled over that time. But the fact is that wages for average Americans have remained flat. Why? Because we have set up an economy that is designed to fail for regular, working-class individuals in this country, the folks that we represent, the people working in small businesses, who are living from paycheck to paycheck and can't take these increases at the pump. 
   As much as we have to introduce people to the notion that we have to start redirecting our energy policy, we also have to reintroduce people to the fact that there are millions of Americans out there playing by the rules who simply don't have the means to deal with these increased prices.

For a very long time, the only people that really mattered in this system were the people gathered at the tip of the pyramid, the people with the big political action committees and who could afford to hire 10 lobbyists to patrol the halls of Congress. And all of us, you know, that exist down at the bottom of that pyramid, and when we come here we get to be closer to the top than the bottom, but the regular folks who sit wondering, and even if they don't wonder if they can afford to fill their tank, they wonder whether increasing gas prices means they can save less, whether this will have some impact on their retirement savings. All of those folks that exist at the base of that pyramid didn't matter any longer. 
   As much as for me and Mr. Altmire, as much as we care about setting a different course in Iraq and taking on the hegemony of the oil companies and setting a new course for health care policy, I think for us this election was as much about sort of flipping that pyramid on its head and saying we have got to start taking the time to form consensus back at the base of that pyramid and having those decisions be the ones that matter here in Washington. 
   I have to tell you, standing here as a member of the 30-Something Working Group, nobody knows more than we do about how many Americans now stand on a precipice of jumping off a cliff to having faith in their government. Young people, whether in their 20s or 30s, but people now in their 40s, 50s and 60s have just lost any faith that what they care about will actually be reflected in what happens in Washington.     
   Guess what, in January, when a new Congress got sworn in, it all changed. Now, it may not change so much that things happen here with the alacrity that people may like. This government is still designed not exactly to respond overnight, but you would not be seeing the policy proposals that you are outlining, whether it is taking on the royalties and the tax breaks, whether it is taking a look at antitrust provisions, whether it is passing a strong price-gouging bill. You just would not see that. 
   You would hear a lot of bluster, but you would not be seeing action if we did not flip government on its head in January and start once again listening to people out in communities rather than just listening to the conversations that happen perpetually within the halls of government. All those conversations are focused on one thing, the status quo.

   So, we are on honored to be able to have this opportunity that the Speaker has given us, Mr. Altmire and I, certainly to be able to join our colleagues who have been up here for the last few years beating the drum.

<DOCNO>Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank my good friend from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4. 
   The average guy out there doesn't ordinarily pay much attention to the minute details of Federal prescription drug law. You have to screw up pretty bad to create a grassroots movement centered around a one-line sentence buried deep in the depths of the Medicare Act, but that is exactly what happened here. 
   For those of us who are coming here anew, we have spent the last 2 years talking to our seniors and our taxpayers about the horrors of this bill. As the cost of this program skyrocketed, as premiums increased, as the donut hole expanded, seniors suffered and drug companies prospered. 
   And guess what? The American people started to notice that little sentence buried deep in that Medicare Act that seemed so out of place and so unnecessary. 
   My presence here today is a living example of this popular discontent which those on the other side of the aisle seem so eager to ignore. And even if this bill doesn't fix that Medicare drug program overnight, it is an unmistakable signal to the people that I represent back home that this House is no longer a place where industry can profit off of a desperately needed social program; it is a place now where common sense comes first.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I want to underscore how important it is that you have seen a remarkable degree of coordination and bipartisan cooperation in the House on the second stimulus package. Because you and I both know as acutely as anybody in this Chamber, because we were out there campaigning for change here in Washington, that folks were sort of sick and tired of everything being a fight here, everything being lined up as Republicans against Democrats, conservatives against liberals, X against Y, A against B. That was kind of the order of the day here during the last 12 years before the election of 2006. Everything was going to be a partisan fight, and there really wasn't going to be any real effort to reach across the aisle. That's changed. You and I weren't here, but we know what the perception was from the outside. And the perception, and I think Ms. Wasserman Schultz will testify, that was backed up by reality. 
   Now, cooperation that you see on the economic stimulus package doesn't mean that you still don't fight for what you believe in when you have an honest-to-goodness disagreement, and we are going to talk a little bit tonight about some fights that are about to come, some lines in the sand that we, as Democrats, are prepared to draw with the President and his Republican followers here in the House. But there are so many other things that you don't need to fight about, there is honest-to-goodness agreement on, whether it be jump-starting this economy with an economic stimulus package, whether it be passing reasonable restraints on the mortgage market, opening up access to liquidity for people who want to refinance their homes, have a means to do it but can't find anybody to give them the money and the access to capital. Those are issues that don't have right and left divides. The economic downturn doesn't discriminate against you whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. 
   So we are passing bills here to deal with this economic slowdown with Republicans and Democrats behind it, and that's what people want us to do. 
   Now, that doesn't mean they want this Chamber to be Kumbaya on every  single issue. They sent us here to fight for what we believe and what the American people believe in. But you don't have to default to one position all the time or the other position all the time. You don't have to be cooperating on everything or fighting on everything. You can pick and choose. That's what a parent does every day. I mean, you choose the battles that you are going to fight with your kids. As a kid, you choose the battles you are going to fight with your parents. There are things that you get along with them on and things you disagree on. 
   This place, for a very long time, resorted to the fault of fight about everything, never bother to reaching across the aisle, never try to pass a package with the Republicans and Democrats. I mean, why would you have to? If you have a majority of Republicans here, you can just pass it with Republicans. So why reach out to Democrats? The majority rules in the House. 
   That's not what the American people want. They want to see that bipartisan partnership. They want to see bills not passing 51 percent to 49 percent. They want to see some bills passing by a real majority. That's what you saw with the 100 hours agenda, and that's what Ms. Wasserman Schultz pointed out. That's what you saw with the economic stimulus. You might not see it every time, but you are going to see it a lot more times in this Congress.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I think it serves us to point out that this belies conventional wisdom that Democrats are the ones to draw the line in the sand when it comes to fiscal responsibility. I mean, the image out there, for whatever reason, for a long time was that if you cared about deficit reduction, if you cared about drawing the line on spending, you might vote Republican. Well, that hasn't been backed up by facts for 12 years now. It was the Clinton administration that had record surpluses. It was a Republican President and a Republican Congress that racked up those enormous deficits. So now, we, as Democrats, are the ones coming down here and saying, listen, if you care about fiscal responsibility, this is the party that you want in charge of your Congress. This is the line that we're going to draw in the sand. 
   And it bears pointing out the sort of strange irony of that because for a long time the conventional wisdom was the opposite. But the facts back up the reality, which is that if you care about spending, it's the Democrats that are going to offer to draw that line in the sand.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Altmire, we're talking about giant numbers here, but let me give you another point of comparison. I mean, there are so many different ways to make this point to the American people that we have allowed spending in this budget to spiral out of control under Republican leadership and to hammer home the point that the problem that the Democratic majority has inherited is one that is going to take a long time to fix, but it is only going to be fixed by having a truly fiscally responsible leadership here in the House in charge. 
   Here is another way of putting it. I mean, this is remarkable, Mr. Altmire. And this is a chart that Ms. Wasserman Schultz and Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan have shared several times,  but it bears putting out here one more time. Forty-two Presidents took 224 years to rack up about $1 trillion in foreign-owned debt, debt owned by China, European countries, OPEC nations. 42 Presidents, 224 years, over two centuries they took to get $1 trillion in debt held by foreign countries. This President, one President, has now, this number isn't even accurate anymore, has now racked up $1.33 trillion in foreign-held debt. One President in about 7 years has racked up more debt than 42 Presidents in 224 years.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Well, it's not that hard, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, maybe to grasp over 224 years, but it's hard to grasp how you do $1.3 trillion in foreign borrowing in just 6 years. And I'll be honest, I can't name every guy here, but I bet you there are some pretty wild spenders in that group, and I bet you there were some real deficit lovers somewhere buried in that group of Presidents. And still, all of them together, $1.01 trillion, this one President. 
   Remember, a President alone can't do this, Ms. Wasserman Schultz; you have to have a Congress that's willing to back you up on this kind of deficit spending. And he had it, but he only had it for 6 of his 8 years. I mean, that's the difference. He had a Congress that's willing to spend that kind of money, that's willing to rack up those kinds of deficits for 6 of his 8 years. For the last two, he doesn't get that deal. For the last 2 years of his Presidency, he gets a fiscally responsible Democratic Congress that for the first time in 8 years is going to push back. It might not be successful every time, but we're going to push back for the first time in a long time.

Well, we're the 30-something Working Group. We're here, in part, to represent the concerns of some of the younger voters in this country.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. That's right, that this is going to be their problem, that these loans that we've taken out from China and from the Caribbean and from OPEC nations, they're going to want that money back. And they're going to want that money back 10 years from now, 20 years from now when folks who are now in their teens and their 20s and 30s are in their prime earning years. Just when they need to be mustering the money to send their kids to college, they are going to be paying exorbitant taxes to the Federal Government because we're going to have to start paying back that debt. 
   So this is an issue that the 30-something Working Group talks about a lot because the problem is today, but even more gravely, the problem is in 20 or 30 years. And it's our obligation to be making policy not just for next week, but for the next decade.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, I know we want to talk about that budget and how clear, once again, the President has made it, that his priority is going to be to turn the Federal Government's back on regular working folks out there who need a little bit of help getting their parents into a nursing home, who need a little bit of help getting quality education for their kid, who want to make sure their streets are safe. We're going to talk about that. 
   But I think it's worth noting that we've gone through one budget cycle already here with Democrats in charge of the House, and we have shown this place, Washington, D.C., that we have shown everybody out there in America that you can have a responsible budget that sets you on a path towards balancing that budget within 5 years, and you can do it in a way that is still compassionate about the people out there who need a little bit of help from their government. You can do both. 
   Mr. Altmire, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, and I all come from pretty fiscally conservative districts. We have people who want to see the Federal Government spending their money right. But we also come from districts full of people who do want to help their neighbors, who do want to reach out and give a helping hand when it's needed and when it can be done on a reasonable and efficient basis. And the budget we passed last year, it has a very modest growth in spending, but it invests in the right programs. It gives increases to programs like health care, research. It gives investments in community policing. It gives increases for elementary education. And it does it all while setting a course to balance the budget in 5 years. 
   So you can do both. You can get fiscal responsibility, and you can make sure that you're covering your bases in the programs that help regular, average Americans. And we did it as a Congress. The President, once again, has submitted a budget to us that isn't going to do that.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, let me just get this right. So we have spent billions upon billions of dollars, another 170 this year, on the war in Iraq, which is feeding the international terrorist movement, and this isn't our saying it, that's the 22 most important national intelligence organizations through the National Intelligence Estimate, that is feeding the frenzy of international terrorism and is growing the ranks of the people who want to do harm to us. So we're spending money in Iraq to increase the ranks of people who might do harm to us, and then we are cutting the money here at home that would make sure that none of them lands on our soil and does harm to us. That 
   is a very odd thing for the President or the Republicans or anyone who supports that policy to have to explain to somebody.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. If the gentlewoman would yield, it's a wonderful world to live in, though, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I mean this world in which you can spend money on all of these things that you want to spend money on, that you can have no one pay for it, that you can kind of convince yourself that all of the people that are lending you the money aren't going to really ever ask for it back, that you can additionally convince yourself that the fact that you owe money to all of your enemies isn't going to have any consequences when you want to fight them or negotiate with them. I mean, that's a great place to live in. A world full of no consequences. A world full of postponing all bad things until a moment in which no one is here to answer for them anymore. It's a wonderful place to live. 
   But I've got to believe that that's why Mr. Altmire and I got sent here as part of the new class last November, that the American people kind of figured out that it was a myth. I mean, they figured out that it was an alternative universe. Now, they might not be as big a science fiction fan as you are, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, but they figured out that something was up. I mean, I come from a district that was Republican for 24 years that has these Rockefeller Republicans that are sort of socially moderate but fiscally conservative, and they came out and voted for Democrats in droves this year because they figured out what you knew all along, that this was just a made-up world here where you could just spend wildly on a war in Iraq, that you could borrow in order to pay for it, that you could rip the guts out of social services, and everything would be all right. So the American people, I think, have figured it out and they sent us here to fix it.

Today we get reports from the Nation's largest retailers telling us that they still have not unburied themselves from the holiday malaise. We had a report recently from the service sector showing the service economy starting to bottom out. We have news yesterday from the Labor Department telling us that worker productivity continues to slow. We have an economy after 6, 7 years of the Bush administration's policy left over from 12 years of neglect by the Republican majority that is as weak as it has been in a very long time.

Ms. Wasserman Schultz, just to leave on some good news, I think the passage with the Republican and Democratic votes of the economic stimulus package shows that this Democratic Congress has the potential to reach across the aisle and push back on a lot of these policies that we have been talking about today. This is bad news, the President's budget he submitted to us. It is not a good budget for people, for families, or for fiscal discipline. 
   But the good news is that we have shown a record here of being able to work together, Republicans and Democrats, to be able to push back.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Chairman, I thank my friend for his great work on this issue. 
   I think it is important to address the concept presented by our friends on the other side of the aisle that the folks who are the recipients of these vouchers are victims. Well, they might be victims, but they are victims of an economy which says to far too many people out in this world that if you play by the rules, if you do everything we ask of you, if you go out and get a job, a full-time regular job, that you are still going to be living in poverty, that you are still going to need a little help to be able to survive in this world.     
   In a high-cost-of-living State and a high-cost-of-housing State like Connecticut, 5,000 vouchers does not do it for the working poor there. We have people in our neck of the woods that are paying 60, 70, 80 percent of their income, hard-earned income on rent. 
   We are a part of the world that desperately needs more section 8 housing vouchers to help the working poor, the people who are doing everything this society asks them to do. But because we live in an economy where wages are stagnant and the cost of living continues to rise, a program like this is a very valuable and needed helping hand.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   For all that we disagree on here today, we agree on one thing: We all want a stable, independent Iraq. What I can't understand is how anyone can still believe that our continued, open-ended military intervention there will lead to a stable nation. In fact, it's doing the opposite. 
   The Iraqi Parliament and ministries are in unprecedented disarray. The President's own report to Congress will say that we haven't met any of our political benchmarks there, and an estimated 13,000 Iraqis are dead since the escalation began. 
   The fact is, as someone much wiser than I said, the Iraqis today are paying wholesale rather than retail for their political decisions. So long as we are the military bodyguard for every major Iraqi political group, so long as we are subsidizing the political decisions of Iraqi political leaders, they will never make the difficult political concessions necessary to create a stable society there. 
   I support this bill, Mr. Speaker, because not another American soldier should die for a strategy that is unfathomably making Iraq less safe and less stable.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I often get confused with my good friend from Pennsylvania. 
   Let's just touch for one minute, before I address the resolution on the question that our friends from the other aisle brought to us today and that Mr. Ryan was so good enough to talk about as well, that is this notion that in order to support the troops, you have to support the commander of the troops. 
   Well, having spent the last 2 years walking around talking to every sector of the constituents of the Fifth District of Connecticut, having a sense of where the American people came down in November on this question, the American people seem to agree with folks on this side of the aisle, which says this: There is a difference between supporting the troops and supporting the commander. 
   It is not an issue of patriotism necessarily, it is an issue of differentiating between the brave men and women who are over there fighting and dying for this country, and the man who sends them into battle. You can disagree with him and you can support the troops. You can do that out in the public as a matter of your private advocacy, and you can do that here on this floor. 
   That is where the American public came down on election day. They said loud and clear that day, ``We support the troops.'' They go every day to celebrations of those troops when they leave and when they come home. They go to much more somber ceremonies when they don't return home. And then on election day they come out and they say this: ``I support those troops. I don't support the man who put them into harm's way in the manner that he did that.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer for allowing us to be here this morning. It is late at night, and I will be brief in my remarks on the resolution before us. 
   Amidst the embarrassing overabundance of thorny foreign policy questions before this House currently, the question before this Chamber tonight is a fairly simple one: Do we agree with the Nation's military establishment, with the country's foreign policy community, with popular opinion, and reject this President's very wrongheaded plan to send 21,000 more troops into Iraq? Or do we remain silent in homage to Congress' past and allow this potentially disastrous escalation to move forward? 
   I think the question answers itself. And I am proud today to stand here in support of this resolution, and register my strong support of our troops and my strong opposition to escalating this war. 
   As we finish the debate tonight, I have been joined in these final remarks by some of the younger colleagues in the House of Representatives. And I think our unity is significant. I should remind other Members of this House that we are discussing the fates of many young men and women, my classmates, my friends, that are this hour fighting and dying in a country halfway around the world.     
   As younger Members we also serve as reminders that our duty here is not just to set policies to secure the safety of our country in terms of months or years but also in terms of decades. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have never fought in a war. I haven't shot another man on the battlefield nor have I been wounded myself. But I have been allowed the privilege to represent my constituents in this body because of the selfless bravery of those men and women around this country that made a different choice than I did, those that volunteered to go overseas and fight and defend this country. It is my duty to stand here today and thank them for their service, thank their families for their service, but also to be their advocate here tonight. Because the President is asking a cadre of our bravest young men and women to go house to house in Baghdad to root out an insurgency while he does virtually nothing to address the systematic causes of that insurgency. One hundred thousand troops may not be able to do the job that the President is asking 21,000 to do. Escalating the number of troops in Baghdad hasn't worked in the past and it most likely won't work here. Through his actions, the President is putting our soldiers' lives at unnecessary and unconscionable risk. There is a resolution in Iraq but it's a political solution. It's not a military resolution. And we owe it to our soldiers who have done everything that we have asked them to do to stand up to a President who would ask them to do a job that  they cannot and should not do. And beyond our duty to our current generation of troops on the ground, our responsibility, quite frankly, also lies with the generations to come. I decided to seek a seat in this House at a relatively young age because I was fearful that the decisions that were being made here today would have dramatic consequences for the world that my future children and grandchildren will grow up in. And I came here to begin a conversation that acknowledges that what will make this Nation safe for generations is not a Nation built on bullying, not a strategy based on scattershot military intervention but a comprehensive foreign policy that combines American might with American diplomacy. In order to secure this Nation for the next generation, we need to acknowledge that the most important question we must ask is not who do we attack next, but instead how do we reset our place in this world in a way that would prevent the forces who would do America harm from becoming stronger? 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to come to grips with the fact that we live in a world in which our own supposed allies create societies that foster extremism and violence amongst their most marginalized members. At the same time our Nation often strangely views cultural and political global detachment as a virtue rather than a weakness. This combination causes those that speak different tongues and those that worship different gods to look upon our great Nation with undeserved derision. This must change. 
   For my mind, we do that in three parts. First, we must pass this resolution in order to pivot to a much broader conversation. And in that conversation in the coming days and months, we must redeploy our troops both to home and to fights that are central to the war on terror, such as in Afghanistan. The gentlemen from the other side of the aisle are right. This battle with terrorists who may do harm to this country does not end no matter what happens on the ground in Iraq. But we must focus on our energies there. Lastly, we need to begin, going forward from today, to renew that multilateral spirit that once made this country great by proving ourselves in the future to be both a strong America and a humble America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, since President Bush took office, the price of oil has skyrocketed from $30 a barrel to a recent high of $150 a barrel. These prices are debilitating millions of American families who can't even afford to go to the grocery store. 
   Two months ago, Congress forced the President to take action and stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is already at its highest levels ever. On July 1 we stopped putting oil into the reserve, which could lower prices at the pump anywhere from 10 to 25 cents. This action will have real results for the American people. 
   And now Democrats are urging the President to release oil from that reserve to provide additional assistance right now to American consumers. 
   Some say that we should only use oil from the reserve in an emergency.  Madam Speaker, I suggest that if families not being able to put food on the table or freezing this winter isn't an emergency, I don't know what is.

   Listen, I am not going to endeavor to try to guess as to exactly why from all of the different reasons that our constituents may have sent us here were at the top of their mind, but I think one of them was that they had figured out for 12 years in this House while the Republicans controlled it and the President for 6 of those years was in the White House, that conservation was simply not a policy of this Congress, that they were following the lead of Vice President Cheney who now somewhat infamously stated that conservation, in his mind, and we can guess in the administration's mind, is a personal virtue, not a policy. 
   So I don't think it's any coincidence that that seemed to be the ruling mantra of this House, that conservation wasn't something that the government should get involved in, it's just something you do in your private life. And during that time, that 12 years that the Republicans controlled the House of Representatives, we saw absolutely no action on conservation. In fact, it took the Democrats taking control of the House and the Senate to pass, for the first time in 30 years, a very simple increase in fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, up to 35 miles a gallon. You and I know that's low-hanging fruit. I think we're going to be embarrassed in just 5 or 10 years to think that we set our sights so low as 35 miles per gallon. I think we are going to get up to 45 and 50 miles per gallon on the average fuel efficiency of fleets in this country. 
   The fact is, I don't suggest that Republicans weren't personally for conservation, I am sure many of them practice it in their own homes. The fact was they weren't setting policy here to actually make that a reality. That fuel efficiency bill that we passed, first time in 30 years, when we passed it, when gas prices were a little bit lower than they are now, that was a $1,000 savings per year for every commuter, for every car owner. 
   It's probably now, unfortunately, up to $1,500 per year in savings, but that's real action on conservation. That's actually taking words and putting them into action.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. If the gentleman would just yield for a moment. 
   I think it's worthwhile also to talk about what was happening here during the time that the Republicans controlled the House of Representatives, during the time you and I, Mr. Altmire, were watching with agony from afar. 
   During that time, they passed an energy bill in 2005 that was written by the oil companies in secret at the White House in Dick Cheney's office. That, no so coincidentally, gave billions in tax breaks to the oil companies, leading today to the biggest profits--not in the history of the energy industry, not in the history of the oil industry, the biggest profits in the history of American capitalism are being made today by the oil industry. Guess what? The actions taken by this Congress to give away more tax breaks to that industry had something to do with that. 
   During that time, they continued to spend money out of control, racking up record deficits in this country, which has led to the devaluing of the dollar, which is a big part of the problem today. Maybe 25 percent of the increased cost of a barrel of oil in this country is attributable to the dollar, which has fallen in value, which is attributable to the actions of this Congress during that time. Over and over again they took steps here to basically invite the crisis that we have seen here today. 
   And so, Mr. Altmire, I think you're right to say that they had a lot of time to do good things, but one of the biggest problems is during the time in which the Republicans were in control of this House they did a lot of bad things, which led us to the place we are today. 
   Mr. Meek.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Meek, you said it right, it doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or Democrat, when you pull up to that pump you're paying a price that you can't afford. It doesn't matter whether you're a conservative or a liberal, if you can't afford to heat your home this winter, you're going to freeze. 
   That has nothing to do with partisan politics. 
   I think we come down to this floor and we try to educate people on some of the differences between the two sides of the aisle here. But when it comes down to it, you're very right. I mean,  the people didn't send us here to have a Democratic idea or a Republican idea, they sent us here to try to find some common ground to make this world a better place. And I wish more of that happened here. I mean, I wish we didn't have a chart like the one that you just put up that showed so many vetoes and veto threats from the President. Because I think sometimes the folks in the White House don't understand that pain, that bipartisan, nonpartisan pain that's happening out there. I think some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't maybe feel that as well. I think sometimes, as Mr. Altmire said, it feels like the debate down here is more about scoring political points than it is actually getting things done. 
   And so, Mr. Meek, I'm glad you put it that way because I think it's important for us to continue to remind our colleagues here on this floor, through the Speaker, that we can come together, that there are things that we agree on. And if we put politics aside, we can do the will of the American people. 
   Mr. Altmire.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Meek, you're very right. And we could watch this housing crisis unfold, this energy crisis continue to squeeze families and we could sit here and do nothing. But as you said, we got sent here to do something, to sit down and figure out solutions. And I think it's incredibly relevant as to whom you ask about what the solution should be. 
   In the last few years when there was a problem with energy prices, this Congress went and asked the oil companies how you fix it. When they wanted to write a new bill to bring prescription drug coverage to seniors, they went and asked the drug industry how to solve the problem. When this housing crunch came down, when foreclosures started to increase, when neighborhoods started to fall apart, we went to our constituents. We went to the people who sent us here. We went to the very people who are being affected or at risk of being affected by this problem, and said, you tell us how we should solve this problem. And what we heard was, listen, give us a chance to stay in our home. I don't want a handout. I don't want a giveaway. I don't want a bailout. I want a chance to stay in my home. I want to pay my fair share. I want a chance to pay a decent rate. But give me a chance. So we passed the expanded FHA insurance program to allow people who were in exorbitant and unfair interest-rate mortgages to get back into something reasonable, at a loss and a haircut to them and to their lender. When people said, I want to buy my first home, but this is a really dangerous time to do it, I think we responded in this bill we  passed today by passing a $7,500 refundable tax credit to allow people a little bit more flexibility to get into that first home. 
   When people said, I need some help getting counseling to find out how I avoid foreclosure, we put money into counseling agencies to help people help themselves. When you go to the people who are really hurting, you get the right answers. And I'm just as proud as you are, Mr. Meek, for voting for this piece of legislation this afternoon. It may be the most important housing legislative package that this House and this Congress has passed in the past several years. And I'm just as proud of where the genesis of the ideas came from.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the American Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. This legislation, debated over many weeks and months, and evolving over that time, is extraordinarily important to the financial health of not only the housing market but the Nation's economy. 
   As we create a new world-class GSE regulator, provide refinancing assistance to hundreds of thousands of families, provide for an affordable housing trust fund and provide the Treasury Department with the tools it needs to ensure the solvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we should also continue to consider measures that could further increase the stability and transparency of the housing market. 
   Congress should continue to look into the role that appraisals have had in skewing the housing market and thus encouraging the proliferation of overvalued mortgages. I hope that we could take a serious look at requiring the GSEs to incorporate the Cost Approach for appraisals in the method they currently rely on to appraise properties. 
   For more than 60 years before the standard was changed in 1996, the GSEs required the use of the Cost Approach on home property appraisals. The Cost Approach is a method used as a way to benchmark the actual monetary value of the structure being appraised which in the least provides a floor for an accurate appraisal. With only a reliance on market values, appraised values of properties have had less and less to do with the actual demonstrative value of the structure and more and more to do with a housing market that we are now finding out was over inflated. 
   By continuing to take a hard look at issues like the Cost Approach, this body can ensure that we will not rest on the passage of today's legislation but will continue to aggressively act to ensure that the housing markets operate in a manner based more strongly on true economic fundamentals.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey). 
   I came to the floor today to speak about the underlying legislation, which is incredibly important to those of us who reside in Connecticut, where 340 miles of this proposed route lies, more than in any other State along this historic trail. But I can't sit here and not respond to some of the comments from our friends from across the aisle. 
   I appreciate this newfound interest in trying to make this country independent of oil outside of our bounds, independent of energy sources produced outside of the United States. The problem is that our friends on the other aisle who controlled this House of Representatives for 12 years are too late to the game. 
   It is a shame, a travesty, that we are sitting in this situation that we are today, not only with gasoline in Connecticut, where I come from, at $4.30 a gallon, but across this Nation families are being held hostage by a product produced and priced outside of this country. 
   We could have made different choices in this House if we had had leadership on the Republican side of the aisle, who controlled it for 12 years in conjunction with a President who sat in the White House for six of those years. We could have been in a very different place today. But we are not. 
   So, as Democrats, we are standing up, passing legislation to hold OPEC accountable for price fixing; investing in renewable resources to try to finally get this country off of that oil that we are far too addicted to; and going after those who would try to price-gouge and take advantage of the current economic situation. In all of those situations there are veto threats from the President and far too few of our friends from the other side of the aisle joining us. Now, there is consistency there. For 12 years they neglected the growing energy crisis, and now we don't have enough bipartisan cooperation across the aisle. 
   So I appreciate the fact that on a bill that is very important to those of us in Connecticut, that we have a little bit of an opportunity to talk about the crisis that is affecting American families. I just wish that our friends on the Republican side of the aisle had been doing a little bit more talking about this subject before we got here, the new members of this class. I wish that we had been talking about this 5 years ago and 10 years ago, and we wouldn't have to be talking about it in such grave terms here today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to talk just for one moment about how important this underlying bill is going to be to us in Connecticut, for it is important for us to celebrate our heritage. What makes us so great as a Nation is that we celebrate it, we respect it and we pass it on to new generations. And so when I look at that 340 miles of this historic trail that is going to lie in Connecticut, I think great things about what it is going to mean to have more resources and more Federal recognition for the students and the children who will walk that trail, who will visit the monuments and markers across it, and will have even more reverence for the history that brings us here today.     
   Graves of French soldiers still sit in Waterbury, Connecticut; the spot on which the Caleb Baldwin Tavern sat in Newtown.

   Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. I thank the gentleman from New York. 
   A historic tavern in Newtown, Connecticut where General Rochambeau and his troops made several stops continues to be talked about today as an important part of the historic tradition of Western Connecticut. 
   This is going to add to the historic legacy that of course makes us what we are in New England, makes us so proud of our very unique role in the making of this Nation. And what makes this Nation great is that even in moments of trial like we have today, with families faced with increasing costs of energy and health care and education, that we can come together and propose solutions. I just think that it is too bad that we didn't do something about this before this moment. I think it is too bad that we have to come to this floor in such a crisis mode as we do today. I wish our friends from across the aisle had done a little bit more when they controlled this House. I think that would have done a lot more to fulfill the legacy that we celebrate today than the moment that we are in right now.
