<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (THE FIGHT FOR OUR FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, in the days after the 9/11 attacks, politicians, journalists and assorted experts rushed to claim that America and the world had entered a new era and that the battle with al Qaeda would define the first decades of the 21st century. 
   As the fight against al Qaeda has continued and intensified, we have come to see the impact of that fight on a key national security paradigm of the post Cold War era: the quest for energy security in an industrializing and ever-flattering world. 
   The United States has long recognized that our global leadership and economic strength depended on cheap, abundant energy from the Middle East. Disruptions to that supply as a result of the 1973 oil embargo, the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait had demonstrated our vulnerability to events halfway around the world. Rather than taking the steps necessary to wean ourselves from Middle East oil, we sought to create stability in the region by aligning ourselves with pro-Western autocrats whose powerful internal security forces kept restive populations in check. 
   Capacity and price, the first high and the second low, stayed our hand. Cheap and plentiful oil powered the American economy to preeminence while solar, wind and biomass energy were expensive. Environmental concerns, including increasing evidence that the burning of fossil fuels was altering the Earth's climate, were relegated to secondary status. 
   All of that has now changed. The 9/11 attacks and the Iraq war have highlighted the seething political instability in the Middle East. The rise of China and India have increased competition for oil even as the global supply has remained stable. Finally, the Earth's climate is changing more rapidly and more profoundly than many scientists had forecasted, leading to a global consensus that humanity must take immediate steps to curtail the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. 
   This confluence of political, economic and environmental factors is one of the greatest challenges that this Nation has faced in its history, but just as we have risen to meet other challenges--from the Revolution to the Civil War to the Great Depression and the totalitarian dictatorships of the 20th century--I am confident that we will emerge from this crisis stronger and better positioned than our economic rivals to prosper in this new world. 
   As for the other problems that we have faced, finding a solution will require us to put our faith in American ingenuity and in our enormous capacity to fund and focus research and development efforts. In the last 2 years,  we have dramatically increased funding for research into renewable energy, but we must do even more by declaring a new Apollo Project for energy independence. 
   Even as we provide incentives to accelerate scientific research into reducing the cost of renewable energy, we must also act now to reduce our fossil fuel imports. The cheapest and quickest way to accomplish this is to reduce energy and fuel use through fuel efficiency, energy efficiency, conservation, and green development. We can also reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil in the short term by a responsible increase in domestic production, but this must be viewed for what it is--a short-term expedient and a bridge to a future based on renewable energy. 
   We cannot convert our economy from one dependent on fossil fuels to one that is based on renewable energy overnight, but we must take the position that our continued use of oil and gas will be largely phased out in the coming decades and that renewed, environmentally responsible exploration is intended to ease the conversion to a post-fossil fuel economy. 
   As a threshold matter, we must improve the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks, as Congress mandated last December, and develop plug-in hybrid vehicles to drive further efficiency. Doing this will not only break our addiction to oil, it will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent. 
   This effort should be undertaken in conjunction with the national effort to improve our public transportation system, which still receives just a fraction of the investment that we put into roads. Congress has acted to increase public transit, but more needs to be done both at a local level and, more importantly, at State and regional levels. 
   We must also make our homes more energy efficient by installing rooftop solar panels, switching to energy-efficient appliances and enabling consumers and businesses to pay lower prices for electricity at night so that we can reduce the daytime spike in electricity usage that requires utilities to keep high-price power generation on call. 
   Companies have invested and workers have trained themselves in industries that were supported by our past Tax Code and its provisions. Climate change legislation will change those incentives, and while many high-tech American industries will prosper, some industries will suffer. For example, in my home State of California, solar and geothermal are growing by leaps and bounds. There are start-ups throughout the State building solar energy plants and installing solar energy systems. The silicon shortage that has slowed solar development in the last 3 years is fading as new factories come online. 
   But this new development is still dependent on the tax incentives that Congress has still not extended past the end of the year. We must not let these tax incentives expire and, instead, extend them for several years so that this expanding industry can become a driver in the economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, my constituents are telling me they want Congress to take the steps necessary to transition our Nation to clean, renewable energy. I urge us to do exactly that.  
   They have told me that the energy crisis has imposed enormous hardship on them and on millions of other Americans. But, as in crises past, they also believe that our ingenuity, our can-do spirit and optimism will enable us to bequeath to our children and grandchildren a world that is cleaner and more prosperous. I share their hopes and their determination.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, last year the President and the Director of National Intelligence pushed for legislation that would make it easier for the NSA to collect intelligence on Americans and groups abroad. Among other things, the administration's legislation would allow warrantless eavesdropping of virtually all communications of Americans with anyone outside the U.S., so long as the government declared that the surveillance was directed at people reasonably believed to be located outside the U.S. 
   I opposed the bill when it was considered by the House and instead joined with Chairman Conyers and Chairman Reyes in support of a responsible alternative that would have met the needs of the Director of National Intelligence  without compromising the privacy of law-abiding Americans in ways that don't improve our security. The proposal included robust oversight and audit provisions designed to determine the impact of these changes on Americans. Unfortunately, Congress was forced hastily to pass the administration's version before adjourning in August. Nonetheless, Congress provided the law would sunset in 6 months to ensure that modifications were quickly made. 
   Over 2 months ago the House returned to this debate by passing the RESTORE Act, legislation that updated FISA, provided these effective surveillance tools while ensuring robust oversight. Importantly, the RESTORE Act also provided protections to ensure that communications of U.S. persons were not acquired without some court involvement or supervision, provisions that were left out of the proposal passed in August. 
   The other body has also drafted legislation aimed at modifying the bill that passed out of the House in August to provide oversight and additional protections. Unfortunately, they haven't completed their work. Some very thoughtful proposals like that by Senator Dianne Feinstein offer fresh ways to break the impasse over some very difficult issues. The proposals that they are debating and attempting to finalize have a number of notable departures from the House-passed version. With the August bill set to expire in 3 days, it's necessary for us to seek a temporary extension in order to ensure this House has a role in crafting its revision. The impending deadlines necessitate an extension, and I'm proud to support that very modest extension.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise to speak very strongly in favor of these PAYGO rules as a very strong step to restoring fiscal responsibility to this House. 
   Over the last 6 years, the President and the Republican-controlled Congress essentially had a policy of borrow and spend. We didn't have the discipline to turn down new spending requests; we didn't have the discipline to pay for additional tax cuts. We even had, in the most ironic of weeks, a situation where we voted to increase the national debt by $800 billion in the same week we voted to cut taxes by $800 billion, and we made it very clear that we were borrowing the money to fund these additional tax cuts.     
   This is not the way to restore fiscal responsibility to this House. PAYGO is. The first rule of PAYGO is when you are in a hole, as we are in, when you are in a budgetary hole, stop digging. If we want new spending, we need to find a way to pay for it. If we want new tax cuts, that is great, too, we need to find a way to pay for it. And we cannot pay for it by asking these young men and women fighting for us in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere to come home and pay for it later and have their children pay for it. Because right now all we are doing is shifting this obligation onto our children and grandchildren. That has got to stop.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I want to begin by commending Chairwoman Lowey for her extraordinary work on this bill and the really exemplary way that she has chaired this committee. I also want to commend our ranking member, Mr. Wolf. 
   Our Chair and ranking member have crafted a bill that I think reflects the bipartisan approach to America's engagement in the world that we should have. It supports a view that I share that a healthier, better educated and more secure developing world means a safer world for America. 
   After several years where diplomacy was marginalized and the men and women of the State Department were relegated to junior-partner status in the national security policymaking apparatus, this committee is moving our policy towards a new primacy for diplomacy. 
   This bill is important to our efforts to fight terrorism, foster peaceful diplomacy, and improve the quality of life for millions of the world's most vulnerable citizens. 
   The bill recognizes the inextricable ties between development and security. It is mindful of the fact that we are ultimately locked in a struggle for hearts and minds and that an excessive reliance on military force as the primary lever of American policy can be counterproductive, and that terrorists often seek to draw an American military response and may be strengthened by it. 
   I also want to point to two provisions that I think have broad implications for the global environment and the quest to stem the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. 
   The bill supports innovative new approaches to fostering renewable energy that Steve Israel and I have advocated by including a provision to encourage the Export-Import Bank to seek out investments in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008 and will encourage the  use of renewable energy worldwide while helping the U.S. producers of renewable energy and green products. This is a step forward in our competitiveness and a step forward for the environment. 
   The bill also includes language that supports the Small Arms/Light Weapons destruction program, a State Department initiative to destroy grenades, guns and man-portable air defense systems that might otherwise fall into hostile hands. By funding this important program, we have increased our commitment to countering the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, weapons that could end up in the hands of terrorists, criminals and human rights-abusing governments around the world. 
   I thank the chair and ranking member for their extraordinary efforts.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Martin Luther King Day that we celebrated earlier this week. Americans celebrated the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King who would have turned 78 this month. While there is much left to be done, Dr. King's dream of a colorblind society is closer to reality this year than last. 
   Dr. King championed nonviolent resistance as a means to bring about fundamental change. He sought such change to bring about equality between peoples of all races, an end to segregation and racial injustice and improved working conditions for all. 
   Dr. King was a master of rhetoric, and he used his power to bring together Americans from a variety of backgrounds to march in pursuit of equality and justice. And Dr. King achieved great success at attaining these lofty goals, despite his murder at the age of 39. 
   At only 26 years of age, Dr. King became a national figure by leading the Montgomery bus boycott. At that time, Dr. King was the new pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church and was spurred to action by the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to give her seat on a public bus to a white man. Dr. King inspired action through his words, ``There comes a time when people get tired of being trampled over by the iron feet of oppression.'' With that, he called for a citywide boycott of public transit and demanded first come, first served seating, courteous treatment by bus operators, and the employment of African American bus drivers. The boycott lasted 382 days and in that time, Dr. King's house was bombed and he was arrested. Ultimately, the United States Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation on public transportation. 
   With the success of the Montgomery bus boycott, Dr. King noted, ``We have gained a new sense of dignity and destiny. We have discovered a new and powerful weapon, nonviolent resistance.'' 
   Nonviolent resistance, which had been pioneered by Mohandas Gandhi in India, became a cornerstone of King's strategy to gain full civil rights and equality for all people. Over the next 13 years, Dr. King achieved basic civil rights for African-Americans, desegregation, the annulment of Jim Crow laws and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King Day allows us to reflect on the steps that we, as a nation, have made towards fulfilling Dr. King's dream. Dr. King's 1963 March on Washington was organized around numerous demands for civil rights, many of which are still very relevant today. One such demand was full and fair employment, including a raise in the minimum wage from $1.25 to $2 at that time.     
   I am proud that last week is part of the 110th Congress' first 100 hours. The House of Representatives addressed this issue by raising the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25. This will significantly benefit a great many low-income families, including the 2.1 million African American minimum wage earners. Other legislation in the first 100 hours will improve health care and education for American families, including 3.9 million African American Medicare beneficiaries and 2.3 million African American college students. 
   This past weekend I commemorated the work of Martin Luther King, Jr., at the Jackie Robinson Park and at the Metropolitan Baptist Church in my district. At these celebrations my constituents and I examined our progress over the past 40 years since Dr. King's tragic death and remember his line from ``I Have a Dream'' about the fierce urgency of now. Dr. King preached then that now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children, and it is still that time now. 
   With continued and wide disparities and access to higher education, wages, and access to health care, we as a Nation still have much work before us. Now, even as we celebrate one of the truly great men in this Nation's history, it is time to recommit ourselves to the vision of Dr. King and bring about racial equality and opportunity for every American.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (ENERGY SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, in these opening weeks of the 110th Congress, the Democratic majority in the House has succeeded in passing a package of bills that is designed to secure America. We passed a bill to improve our Nation's ability to prevent another 9/11 style attack on our country. We have made life a little more secure for millions in the United States who toil at the minimum wage, and millions of young people who leave college with a degree and a mountain of debt. We have secured the ability of America's medical researchers to explore and exploit the life-saving potential of stem cells. We have committed this government to safeguarding our economic security by ending years of fiscal irresponsibility. And today, we have begun what may be the most important project of all, to ensure America's energy security by ending our dependence on foreign oil and developing clean, green renewable sources of energy. 
   Ensuring our energy security will require more than just the protection of American oil supplies from terrorists in hostile nations. It will also mean we find homegrown fuel sources that reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  
   It will mean that we pare down our energy consumption and promote efficiency. It will mean that we transition to renewable energy sources that ensure a clean, dependable energy supply for years to come. 
   There are those who say that it would cost too much to shift our infrastructure over to new energy sources. They say that the market has decided that coal and oil are the cheapest energy, and that switching to renewable energy would harm our economy. 
   This is shortsighted, false, and, ultimately, dangerous because much of the true cost of oil and coal don't appear on the gas pump or on our electric bills. Extracting coal and oil harms the environment and burning fossil fuels produces pollution that clogs our cities and greenhouse gases that warm our atmosphere. Tens of thousands of Americans get lung cancer and other respiratory diseases from power plant air pollution and this, too, is part of the true cost of ``cheap'' energy. These expenses are paid by the American people just as surely as they pay their electric bills. 
   But to find the true cost of a barrel of oil, we must look further, to a foreign policy beholden to oil and gas, and that price is too steep. 
   Today the House passed a bill that will roll back tax breaks for oil and gas companies and reform the royalty relief system that has cost American taxpayers billions of dollars. The $13 billion dollars saved by this overdue reform will be placed in a strategic reserve to be spent on programs to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy and alternative fuels, promote energy efficiency, and step up research on advanced energy technologies. Initiatives like these are the only way to permanently reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and this bill is a good first step on the road to true energy security. 
   European and Asian competitors are already developing technologies that will reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions of greenhouse gases. Rather than American entrepreneurs, it is our competitors who are prospering from these developments. By marshaling America's great strengths, our inventiveness, our technological prowess, and our entrepreneurial spirit, we can better secure our Nation, save our environment, and become the world leader in this cutting-edge industry. 
   We must encourage the development of flexible-fuel and hybrid vehicles. These vehicles can be built with today's technology and will enable a smooth transition from gasoline to biofuels. 
   We must raise the corporate average fuel economy standards. 
   We must invest in research and development of new energy technologies, like wind power, cheap solar cells, plug-in hybrid cars, and cellulosic ethanol. The new energy economy will be dominated by rapid innovation, and the scientific investment we make now will be paid back with interest by the technologies it creates. 
   We must encourage employers to offer mass-transit benefits so that employees can commute without their cars, and support mass transit systems around the country. 
   We must pass global warming legislation to reduce our output of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Many of America's most successful companies have realized that something must be done to contain global warming and they are now pushing Congress to lead. 
   We know what must be done to end our dangerous addiction to oil. All we need now is the will to do it. 
   Madam Speaker, we have lost so much time since 9/11, time that could have been so profitably used to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. But it is not too late to abruptly and constructively change course. The American people are ready for a clean energy economy, and the bill we passed today will begin to put our country on that new road to energy independence and a more secure future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Reverend Tyrone Skinner of the Metropolitan Baptist Church in Altadena, California, as guest Chaplain of the House of Representatives. 
   Pastor Skinner embarked on his career as a preacher at a remarkably young age. He delivered his first public sermon at the age of 10. While at Bishop College in Dallas, Texas, in pursuit of his bachelor's degree, he joined the First Baptist Church of Hamilton Park. He earned his Master's of Divinity Degree from the Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University in 1989. One year later, he became pastor of Metropolitan Baptist Church. 
   Under Reverend Skinner's charismatic leadership, the Metropolitan Baptist Church has seen incredible transformations. Pastor Skinner has enriched the worship experience for 800 members and has overseen significant infrastructure improvements to the church facility. Pastor Skinner was instrumental in engaging church members in a Body and Soul program by serving as a judge at a men's cook-off and encouraging members to become more healthy physically as well as spiritually. 
   Pastor Skinner helped establish Praise Team, Praise Dancers, Soldiers for Christ Stomp Team, and several other ministries in the church. He also established a 501(c)3 nonprofit, the Metropolitan Community Action Services Corporation, which has been a sponsor of the Young African American Male Conference. 
   The list of Reverend Skinner's accomplishments is long, his altruism is broad. Last year, Metropolitan celebrated its 100th anniversary, and today is a fitting capstone to his service to the church, the community and now to the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the chairman of the committee for his superb work on  the bill and the chairman of the full committee, as well as the subcommittee. 
   I'm going to reserve the balance of my time, but I do want to acknowledge what the gentlelady has said before reserving the balance of our time, and that is, there is a deep philosophical difference between the Members of the minority party who are here today and those of us speaking in opposition to the amendment. And of course there's a philosophical difference between the Members that are here on the floor today and their fellow Republicans in committee who unanimously supported this bill, those Republicans on the committee and in the House as a whole who have made every effort to work with Democrats and find common ground in dealing with the fiscal challenges that we face, but also recognizing the need to invest in America as our parents' generation did and as their parents did. 
   Yes, there's a philosophical difference. We're facing a constrained fiscal environment. We've got to get our budget in balance. Some here on the floor tonight we'll hear say, well, we can afford to balance that budget by taking it out of funds for the elderly or taking it out of funds for the homeless, taking it out of funds that help serve Native Americans, taking it out of funds that would make our aircraft more safe. 
   That's a philosophical difference, I think, with a bipartisan majority of this House that thinks that those aren't the right places to find savings, that we ought to look elsewhere. We ought to look, for example, at the generous corporate welfare payments that we make at a time when the oil industry, for example, has not only had record profits of the year or record profits of the decade, but record profits in the entire history of the oil industry. And not just the history of the oil industry, but record profits of any corporation at any time in the history of the world. 
   Now, that corporate welfare, my friends on the philosophical other side of this issue don't want to touch. That's sacrosanct. They won't cut those historic profits by 6 percent, or by 1 percent or even by a half of one percent because that's contrary to the philosophy. But they're more than willing to cut those who are desperately in need. And that's where we do have the divide. It's what I will be addressing when I conclude the remarks on our side of the aisle. 
   But at this point, I will reserve the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Again, I thank the gentlewoman for offering the amendment to this bill, as she did to one of the prior bills, because it really does highlight the philosophical difference between the bipartisan majority of the House and the self-described ``fringe'' represented by the views we've heard tonight. 
   What is that philosophical division between the bipartisan majority and the Members that we have heard from this evening? Well, the bipartisan majority of this House believes that if we're going to ensure a stronger America, then we have to make an investment in that America. But we have to make the same kind of investment that our parents made and their parents so that we can enjoy the prosperity that we enjoy now; that we can't simply say, well, we're going to let our children and our grandchildren fend for themselves. 
   The bipartisan majority believes that that requires a responsible investment in our roads and our highways; a responsible investment in our aviation system; a responsible investment in our aviation security; a responsible investment in housing for the elderly, for the disabled, for those who are in need. That is a priority of the bipartisan majority. This is our philosophy. 
   Now, my friends expressing the minority view say, well, let's look at what the American family would do when the American family is facing budgetary pressures. So let's look at what the American family would do. My friends expressing the minority opinion tonight say they would set their priorities. Well, that's absolutely right, they would set their priorities, which means they wouldn't cut everything identically in their lives, which is just what the gentlewoman's amendment would do. It would cut everything across the board. 
   The American family, when they're facing a fiscal constraint, doesn't say, we're going to cut our medicine equally, we're going to cut our food equally, we're going to cut our essentials equally with how we cut cable TV, was one illustration given by my friends in the minority. No. They don't say we're going to cut the necessities the same amount we're going to cut the luxuries. They prioritize. 
   But my friends in the minority, with their across-the-board cuts, don't prioritize. And so they do make cuts, real cuts, not like my friend from Arizona claimed, which is, unfortunately, not correct. My friend from Arizona just claimed that nothing is really cut in the across-the-board amendment. But the reality is there are a great many things that are cut, real cuts, that don't have an increase in the bill sufficient to offset what the gentlewoman's amendment would cut. 
   So what are some of the real cuts the gentlewoman is proposing tonight? She is proposing real cuts to the number of critical safety staff in aviation, safety staff that deals with the Office of Flight Standard and Aircraft Certification. They would be real cuts. Not cuts in growth, but real cuts, fewer people doing the safety inspections for our aircraft. Is that what the American family would choose to do when they're faced with a fiscal constraint? Would they choose to cut things that have the effect of making their families less safe? I don't think that's where they would look for the cuts. 
   What other real cuts has the gentlewoman been advocating? She's advocating real cuts in emergency response training for hazardous material transportation. That's a real cut the gentlewoman is advocating. 
   She is also advocating cuts in Native American housing grants. Is the gentlewoman prepared to tell the Native Americans back in her State that she favors real cuts to their housing assistance? I will be willing to yield on that question if the gentlewoman is ready to say, not hide behind an across-the-board amendment, but is ready to say to the Native Americans in her State, I support real cuts to your housing. 
   I will yield if the gentlewoman would like to respond to that question. Is the gentlewoman prepared to say, yes, I'm advocating tonight real cuts to the American housing in my State? 
   I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Well, I yielded the time to the gentlewoman, but she did not answer the question. Evidently she wasn't willing to tell the Native American population in her home State she is proposing an amendment to cut their housing tonight. She is willing to hide behind an across-the-board amendment, but is not willing to tell them directly what the effect of that amendment is. 
   The gentlelady's amendment would also cut, in very real terms, homeless assistance grants. 
   Now, let's get back to that philosophical difference between the bipartisan majority and the minority here tonight. One of my colleagues, my colleague from New Jersey, said, well, the American family has to make tough choices. And maybe they need to make the choice that not all of their kids can go to college. Well, that's the philosophical view of the minority opinion we hear tonight. Maybe the American family needs to make the choice that not all of their kids can go to college. 
   Well, the philosophical view of the bipartisan majority is that every child in America that wants to go to college should have the ability to go to college, notwithstanding whether they are rich or poor. That's our philosophy. And that's why we increased support in the Labor-HHS bill which, again, the  gentlewoman wanted to cut, to help more kids go to college. That's our philosophy, that if we're going to look after the future of this country, we're going to have to invest in the future. That means investing in our kids. And that means not putting American parents in a position where they have to say this child goes to college, this child does not. That is not our philosophy. It may be the philosophy of the gentleman from New Jersey; it may be the philosophy of the minority on the floor here tonight. It is not the philosophy of the bipartisan majority of this House, nor the American people. 
   Now, some of my friends in the minority here tonight say, okay, 6 years of GOP rule; we ran the country into the ground financially, we admit it. But we weren't responsible, we few here on the floor tonight, because we were standing up at the time. Well, I have to say that when we could have used your voices, we didn't hear them. When we could have used your voices, for example, earlier this year to try to achieve savings in the expenditures on oil and gas, when people go to the pump and they're paying record amounts, when we wanted to try to take that and invest it in the country's future instead of investing it in oil company profits, the friends in the minority here tonight had nothing to say. None of them were on their feet saying, yes, this is the time where we must cut corporate welfare because we can't afford it. Let's cut it 1 percent across the board. 
   When our seniors are trying to buy medicine and can't afford it and we take action here to bring down the cost of that medicine and save the government money because we're living in a finite world, did our friends stand up and say, yes, we have to be fiscally responsible? We have to try to help those families who are working, both heads of household, and can't afford medicine, or those seniors who can't afford medicine, so we're going to stand up for them; we're going to cut those corporate subsidies and corporate welfare? No. They were silent. It's only when it comes to cutting homeless assistance, cutting assistance for the elderly, and even cutting support for additional safety inspections for aircraft that our friends in the minority here tonight are willing to stand up. 
   So, yes, there is great philosophical difference here tonight between the bipartisan majority that believes we have to invest in the future of this country, between the bipartisan majority that doesn't think a parent should have to decide which child can go to college and which child can't, not based on the merit of that child, not based on the academic ability of that child or the gifts of those children, but because they can't afford to send both children to college. 
   There is a philosophical difference between the bipartisan majority that says that is unacceptable in America, that is not the America we want to see in our future, and the philosophical views of the minority here tonight that say that's fine with us. We won't look elsewhere. We are willing to balance the budget on the backs of our kids and their kids, the homeless, the elderly and the others. Just stay away from corporate welfare because that is untouchable. 
   That is not the philosophy of the majority of this House. It will not carry the day when this amendment comes to a vote. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with the bipartisan majority and defeat these cuts to these vital services, and also to step up to the plate when we have the opportunities to reduce corporate welfare so that we can finance these essential services to let their voices be heard. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Musgrave). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to make, essentially, two points. First, my friends in the minority lack credibility on the issue they have raised last night and today; and, second, this bill is far too important to be stalled, delayed, put off by blatantly partisan tactics. 
   On the first point, why does the minority party lack credibility on this issue? Well, one of the two parties during the last 6 years took the largest surpluses, I think we have had in history, and managed to turn those surpluses into deficits, a multitrillion dollar turnaround that was accomplished in a record short time. That party was the party of my friends in the GOP. That's the same party today that is arguing for fiscal responsibility. 
   One of the two parties presided over the greatest growth and expansion and acceleration and abuse of the earmarking process in history, brought that process to a point where it accounted for more earmarks and more dollars than ever before. That party was also the GOP.  
   One of the parties in this House presided over a period that resulted in more indictments of Members, more investigations of Members, more appearance of impropriety than any time since ABSCAM or Watergate. That party was the Republican Party. 
   That same party that abused the earmark process, that had no earmark transparency is now objecting to what? It is now objecting to an earmark process that is better, that is more transparent than it has ever been. That party is objecting to the work of the majority which eliminated all earmarks in last year's bill. 
   So here you have a party that has demonstrated over the last 5 or 6 years utter fiscal irresponsibility, a lack of willingness to reform the earmark process, now complaining that, okay, the Democrats are reforming the process, they are making it more transparent, but we are complaining because we think they should take it much farther. 
   Well, I think the last 6 years demonstrated a lack of credibility, a serious lack of credibility among my friends in the minority party. 
   Why is this bill so important? Why is this bill essential to move forward, and why are these partisan stalling tactics so questionable? 
   This is the bill that provides the resources to defend our country. I am just going to focus on one because there are numerable areas of this bill that are so vital. But if you go back 5 or 6 years ago when President Bush and Senator Kerry had their debate, they were asked what is the number one security threat facing this country. Their answer surprisingly was the same, nuclear terrorism, the idea that al Qaeda could get nuclear material and bring it into this country. 
   Well, there are only so many things that prevent al Qaeda from doing that. It's not their lack of motivation or will. Osama bin Laden has already talked about wanting an American Hiroshima. The obstacles are getting the materiel, fashioning the bomb, and getting it into the country. Getting the materiel, unfortunately, is not very difficult, given the plentiful amounts of highly enriched uranium in the former Soviet Union. 
   Building a bomb is not that difficult because the technology is now decades old. Getting into the country, unfortunately, is not very difficult. That's something this bill seeks to address by deploying radiation-detector portal technologies; and more than just deploying them, as essential as that is, doing the analysis to find out which of the portal technologies will be most effective in keeping a nuclear or radiological weapon out of the country. These are the kinds of investments that are being delayed, stalled, run down by a party that has run our Nation's finances into the ground in the last 6 years, that is complaining about an earmark process better than anything they proposed. 
   We need to move this bill forward. My friends in the minority don't have the credibility on this issue. They may have had it at some point, but they lost it in the last 6 years. This is not the way to retrieve it. 
   We need to move this bill forward. Now is the time to do it. We need to implement these reforms to improve our safeguards against nuclear material getting into this country. We need to ensure that our cargo is protected. 
   We need to ensure that any number of investments that are made in interoperable communications equipment and our firefighters and our police officers are made, and they are made now. 
   I urge this bill move forward. I urge the delay come to an end.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (CHI MUI POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding, and I want to thank him, Mr. Waxman and the staff on the committee for working with me on this legislation. 
   I'm proud to stand here today to honor a well-respected and dedicated leader from the San Gabriel Valley. Mr. Chi Mui was a beloved member of the Asian American community in Southern California, and the mayor of the city of San Gabriel, where he dedicated himself to improving the quality of life for his neighbors, community and country. I can't think of a more fitting tribute to such an exceptional man than naming the post office in San Gabriel, the town where he touched so many lives, in his honor. 
   Chi Mui's story epitomizes the American dream. Born in Toisan, China, Chi Mui was a man of humble origins whose early experiences enabled him to relate and connect to the Asian community in California. 
   After spending many of his early years in Hong Kong, Chi moved with his parents to New York City's vibrant Chinatown in 1963, at the age of 10. Chi spoke Cantonese with his parents, who were a seamstress and a cook, but quickly immersed himself in the language of his new home. As a new immigrant, he remembered feeling like an outsider on the edge of society, and found refuge, his own oasis in the New York Public Library, where he broadened his mind and developed a lifelong commitment to supporting public libraries. 
   His time reading and studying in the library served him well as he continued his schooling, graduating cum laude with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Polytechnic University in New York in 1980. After attending New York University, he moved west and began his distinguished career in public service. 
   In Los Angeles he served as deputy to one of our colleagues, LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD, and later to California State Senator, Richard Polanco. As their deputy, and in his own time, Chi began working to better the lives of immigrants in the region. Chi Mui's immigrant roots and experiences gave him a special insight and the wisdom and ability to connect with generations of people who came to this country for a better life. 
   Chi was a key player in the development of 600 units of affordable and senior housing in Los Angeles' Chinatown, and taught citizenship classes to help hundreds of legal residents become U.S. citizens. In 1999 he led an alliance of community leaders, neighborhood groups and businesses to save 50 acres of open space known as the ``Cornfield'' in downtown Los Angeles. This land became California's first ever urban State park, and is now known as the Los Angeles State Historic Park. 
   An avid runner and an athlete, he cared deeply about improving recreational facilities and opportunities for youth in the urban area of Los Angeles, and helped obtain $35 million in State funding in 2001 for recreational facilities and activities in the new Los Angeles State Historic Park. 
   Chi also helped expand the capacity of the Alpine Recreation Center, which doubled in size due to his efforts. He volunteered his time to coach youth at the Alpine Center where he taught teamwork and sportsmanship. 
   He also founded and co-founded the Los Angeles Chinatown Athletic Association Volleyball Club and created a night basketball program for at-risk youth. Youth are still benefiting from his legacies. Both programs are still going strong today.  
   Chi Mui's experience as an immigrant and his close ties to his Chinese heritage led him to be active in the Chinese American community in the L.A. area. In recognition of his leadership, he was elected President of the Los Angeles Chinese American Citizens Alliance twice. The Alliance was founded in San Francisco in 1895, and advocates for equal political, economic and educational opportunities for Chinese Americans. 
   Chi believed in working together with everyone, and often brought different cultures and races together to work on common problems. While he was close with the Chinese American community, he also worked hand in hand with the Indochinese and Chinese-Vietnamese communities, and he was an important link between the Asian American community in San Gabriel and all other residents where he served on the San Gabriel City Council. 
   Chi Mui was one of only a handful of first-generation Chinese Americans to successfully run for office when he was elected to the San Gabriel City Council in March of 2003. He made history as the first Asian and Chinese American City Council member and mayor since the City of San Gabriel's incorporation in 1913. 
   Remembering how important library access was to him, Chi was a devoted member of the Friends of San Gabriel Public Library, and led the effort to open the county public library in San Gabriel on Saturdays to provide more services to residents and students without increasing costs. 
   However, his personal passion on the City Council was the ``greening'' of the community, and he worked tirelessly to preserve the quality of life that San Gabriel residents value. A long-time advocate of parks and open space, Chi Mui helped the city obtain funds for the master plan and redesign of Vincent Lugo Park, and successfully pushed for additional trees and greenery on neighborhood streets. 
   For several years, Chi fought a courageous battle with cancer, during which he continued his work for the residents of San Gabriel. On April 27, 2006, at the age of 53, Chi passed away with his wife Betty and a few close friends at his side.     
   He was greatly loved by the City of San Gabriel, and those who knew him saw his commitment to making the city a wonderful community for life-long residents and new commerce as well. 
   I greatly enjoyed the chance to work with him during his tenure on the city council and know I speak for a great many when I say how much we all miss him. 
   People around the country recently finished celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month which ended on Saturday, May 31. Asian Americans have touched many lives around the country, and Chi Mui is no exception. It is fitting that we pass this legislation, H.R. 5477, which will add yet another Asian American name to a very short list of post offices honoring this important community. 
   Chi Mui will never be forgotten by those who knew him. He had a profound effect on the people of southern California and the City of San Gabriel. Future generations will recognize his good work in our community as we preserve his memory and rename the San Gabriel post office in his honor. 
   I thank again the gentleman from Illinois.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by acknowledging the fine efforts of my colleague and Chairman Howard Berman to approve this deal, and I find myself in reluctant opposition. 
   I believe our relationship with India is one of our most important. Our interests are inextricably linked, and our economies draw ever closer. In the past, that relationship has been strained by the issue of nuclear proliferation--India never signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and continues to build nuclear weapons. 
   The agreement we vote on today began as a valiant attempt to bring India into the nuclear mainstream while binding our business communities closer together. Unfortunately, it has ended with an agreement that falls short of either goal: the safeguards are not strong enough, the incentive for other nations to proliferate is too great; and while opening India's nuclear market to the world, it places American companies at a competitive disadvantage compared to the French and Russian firms. 
   Even worse, the deal is really no deal at all. The Indian government and the administration have been issuing contradictory statements about it for the past year. This is not a problem of each side interpreting the treaty differently. The two sides have apparently signed different treaties. The next time India has a new government, which could be as early as winter, it may withdraw from the agreement, and the net result of all of this negotiation will allow foreign companies to sell nuclear technology to India. No nonproliferation goals would be accomplished, no new business would be generated for American companies, and no new relationship with India would be achieved. 
   When it became clear that the real winners in this deal were the Russians and other nuclear powers that indiscriminately and irresponsibly sell nuclear technology around the world, why didn't the administration pull out? When the administration realized that India would not accept the deal that ended cooperation if it decided to test a nuclear weapon, a requirement of the Hyde Act, why did they continue to negotiate? When the administration realized this deal might undermine the MPT, a treaty that has succeeded in dramatically limiting the number of nuclear nations, why did they not take steps to strengthen other nonproliferation efforts? 
   Some proponents of the deal have said that it brings India into the nuclear nonproliferation mainstream. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the agreement.  
   Mr. Speaker, my friend and colleague from California, Chairman BERMAN, has worked tirelessly over the last year to make this deal better. He has been a great champion of nonproliferation in this House, and he has led many efforts to prod and question the Bush administration on the negotiations with India--pressing for a deal that would enhance our relationship with the world's largest democracy while protecting the global nonproliferation regime and our interests around the world. Unfortunately, the administration resisted many of his efforts and that of others, and I am forced to oppose the final package. 
   I believe that our relationship with India is one of our most important. Our interests are inextricably linked, and our economies draw ever closer. In the past, that relationship has been strained by the issue of nuclear proliferation--India never signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and continues to build nuclear weapons. The agreement we vote on today began as a valiant attempt to bring India into the nuclear mainstream, while binding our business communities closer together. Unfortunately, it has ended with an agreement that falls short of either goal: the safeguards are not strong enough, the incentive for other nations to proliferate is too great, and while opening India's nuclear market to the world, it places American companies at a competitive disadvantage compared to French and Russian firms. 
   Even worse, the ``deal'' is not really a deal at all. The Indian Government and the administration have been issuing contradictory statements about it for the past year. This is not a problem of each side interpreting the treaty differently--the two sides have apparently signed two different treaties. The next time India has a new government, which could be as early as this winter, it may withdraw from the agreement, and the net result of all of this negotiation will be to allow foreign companies to sell nuclear technology to India. No nonproliferation goals would be accomplished, no new business would be generated for American companies, and no new relationship with India would be achieved. 
   So, I have a few questions for the administration, which have not yet been answered, and I thInk they're important questions to consider as we vote on this proposal. 
   When the administration realized that India would not accept a deal that ended cooperation if it decided to test a nuclear weapon, a requirement of the Hyde Act, why did they continue to negotiate. 
   When it became clear that the real winners in this deal were the Russians and other nuclear powers that indiscriminately and irresponsibly sell nuclear technology around the world, why didn't we pull out? 
   When the administration realized that this deal might undermine the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a treaty that has succeeded in dramatically limiting the number of nuclear nations, why did they not take steps to strengthen other nonproliferation efforts? 
   When it became clear that we couldn't get the assurances we needed to stem proliferation, why didn't we shift gears and produce a deal in renewable energy, information technology, or another area that would bring actual benefits to the American economy without harming our national security? 
   Some proponents of the deal have said that it brings India into the nonproliferation mainstream. But in fact, India remains free to test nuclear weapons, has not agreed to abide by the Nonproliferation Treaty, has not signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and will only allow international inspectors access to a few of their civilian power plants. That is not the mainstream. 
   India has become a vital partner in a world that has grown dangerous and unpredictable. But tragically, an agreement in any other field of renewable energy would have brought us more, without seriously weakening our efforts to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and South Asia. 
   As a strong supporter of improving our relationship with India, but a firm advocate of nonproliferation, I cannot support this agreement, and I must urge my colleagues to oppose it as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE TRANSPARENCY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2630, the Campaign Expenditure Transparency Act. This is legislation that I introduced to my colleague, Representative Castle, in early June in order to ensure that Federal officer holders and candidates are not personally enriched from expenditure of campaign funds. I want to thank Mr. Castle, the majority leader, the chairman of this Committee on House Administration for working to bring this bill to the floor today. 
   Numerous Members of Congress employ their spouses and family members for campaign activity, and the vast majority of them do this work appropriately and ethically. Unfortunately, others have not, and this practice has shown the potential to foster corruption and invite abuse. I joined my colleague, Mr. Castle, in introducing this legislation because I believe it will help preserve the integrity of the institution and end the perception that office holders and candidates can benefit themselves financially from their campaigns or service. 
   The Campaign Expenditure Transparency Act would end the practice where Federal office holders and candidates employ their spouses in their  campaigns and financially benefit from contributions to the campaign. The bill also requires a separate disclosure to the FEC of all of the payments, including direct and indirect compensation which are made to immediate family members. 
   Specifically, H.R. 2630, as amended, would prohibit any Federal office holder or candidate from directly or indirectly compensating his or her spouse from any political committee he or she controls for services to the committee. This language was used to ensure that someone could not get around this prohibition by acting as a subcontractor or vendor to another individual or company receiving payments from the political committee. 
   Additionally, this would ensure that the legislation does not prevent a spouse from being employed by a company that provides a service to a political committee, unless the spouse's compensation is increased as a result of that business. For example, a spouse could be employed by a phone company that the campaign contracts with so long as the spouse's compensation is not increased based on that contract. 
   Similarly, a spouse that is a shareholder of a publicly traded company could receive dividends from that company notwithstanding the fact that a committee purchased services from that company. 
   The legislation also does not prohibit committees from paying for legitimate travel and campaign expenses that are incurred by a spouse, as long as the FEC has determined the expenses to be appropriate campaign expenditures. The bill recognizes that spouses are often properly involved in campaign activity and that committee funds can be used to reimburse appropriate expenses. 
   The Campaign Expenditure Transparency Act, as amended, stipulates that the penalty for violation of the provisions of the bill, if the candidate knew of the violation, would be imposed on the candidate and not on the committee. The amended version of the bill also clarifies the penalty is not a reimbursable expense by the committee. 
   The legislation has the strong support of a number of reform-oriented organizations, including Democracy 21, the Campaign Legal Center, League of Women Voters, Common Cause, Public Citizen, and U.S. PIRG. 
   I would also like to stress that many of our colleagues again have employed their spouses or immediate family members in their campaigns and have done so lawfully and ethically. Our family members are frequently our most trusted advisers and are willing to put in long hours for little compensation. However, we are aware of cases in which this practice has been abused, and it is for this reason that this legislation is regrettably necessary. Given the low public confidence in all public institutions at this point, this legislation is one important way to begin restoring the public's faith that elected officials are working in the public's interest and not in their own. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I want to take just a minute to address some of the comments that my friend from Texas has made. 
   First, of course, there is nothing in this legislation that would break up a good team. There is nothing in this legislation that prohibits spouses from working. And where, like most families these days, both members of the household need to work to support that family, there is nothing in this bill that would stop it. 
   It does provide that a spouse that has CPA skills or other skills employ those skills on someone else's behalf for compensation. They are more than welcome to provide those skills, as many of our spouses do, I think almost all of our spouses do, on a volunteer basis to help our campaigns. But the appearance of propriety, and in some cases the actual impropriety, of having spouses working on commissions where a percentage of everything the campaign raises effectively goes into the household of the office holder is one of the driving forces behind this legislation. 
   I should mention that in my colleague's own home State of Texas, the State legislature and the Governor have passed and signed legislation prohibiting this practice in Texas. So if you were running for the State legislature in Texas or you were an office holder in the State legislature in Texas, you would not be able to employ your spouse and pay your spouse out of campaign funds. That is a misdemeanor in Texas. So there are States that are really leading the way in terms of making sure that we avoid any appearance of impropriety. And I think that Congress, given the problems have been manifest in this institution as well, needs to follow the example of some of those forward-thinking States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for his comments, but it is hard to avoid the irony of my colleague's objection that the bill is going too fast. For weeks now, we have been hearing the objection that the ethics reform measures in the House have been moving too slow; that we passed the lobbying reform bill in the House, that it hasn't gone through the Senate, we haven't gone through the conference committee. We are not progressing with the process of trying to clean up the institution.     
   It's going too slow. Well, today we're hearing the problem with this bill is it's going too fast. It seems like we can't get the speed exactly quite right. It's either too slow or too fast. 
   The reason that we're here today and moving quickly on this bill is that the bill was the subject of an amendment by my colleague in a separate bill introduced by a Republican Member, an amendment introduced by myself, a Democratic member on the Rules Committee. The bill itself was introduced by Members on both sides of the aisle. The subject matter is very straightforward. Should we pay spouses out of campaign funds, or should we not pay spouses out of campaign funds? Should we disclose whether family members are getting paid, or should we not disclose whether family members are getting paid out of campaign funds? 
   There is, I think, a fairly broad, almost unanimous agreement on the merits of the bill. Even my friend that just stood up to object to the bill says he agrees with the substance and the intent of the legislation. So it's a consensus work product, a bipartisan work product, and given the criticism that we haven't moved fast enough, we're trying to move fast. This is an effort to move fast, but also to move thoughtfully, and that's why we're here today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I just want to address very quickly the comments by my friend, and then reserve the balance of our time. I don't have any remaining speakers. 
   I think that, if anything, there's a more compelling case here in Congress than there is in my friend's home State of Texas to enact a prohibition like the one contemplated in this bill. Texas may be in session only 180 days of the year. My guess is that the Texas members of the legislature are paid probably substantially less than we're paid in Congress, and the financial burden on those members of the legislature is probably, therefore, greater than the financial burden that we face. Whether they have to have a full-time campaign office or not probably depends on what kind of a district they're running in. If it's a very competitive district, then they probably pretty much have to be in campaign mode all the time. So if Texas can do it, where their members are paid less, where the financial pressures are probably greater, we should be able to do it here. 
   It's not often, I have to say, that I point to Texas as the example to follow, but when Texas gets it right, I'm more than happy to acknowledge it. 
   There is also, I think, a certain irony with my friend's argument that the Democratic majority promised an open government, and then here we're offering this bill, and we're moving quickly on this bill, and his stating opposition to a bill that is designed to bring transparency to the process. 
   I don't know how you can argue in favor of open government and be opposed to a bill that offers greater transparency. Part of the reason the present system is inadequate is people do pay family members, but there's no way for the public to know that they're family members because they may not have the same last name, or they may pay a business that is controlled by the family member. And so there's no transparency, and the public doesn't know that that money is really going to the family; that when the candidate is out there, or the officeholder, asking for contributions for their campaign, that a certain percentage, whether it's explicitly on a commission, or it's just by virtue of a paycheck, that a certain part of that money is going into either the candidate's own pocket or the officeholder's own pocket because it's going to their spouse, or it's going to their son-in-law who doesn't bear the same name, and people aren't aware that it's going to the candidate's son-in-law and daughter.  
   So this does bring about greater transparency. I think it's needed. 
   There are Members that have been very open also. And this is why we've gone to a prohibition vis-a-vis spouses. There are Members who have been very open about the fact that they pay their spouse on a commission for every dollar they bring into the campaign, and they make the same argument my friend makes, which is it's very out in the open. Everybody knows about it. People that contribute to my campaign know that a certain percentage of that is going to go to my spouse, and they make the same argument; it must be fine since people are aware of it. 
   But part of the problem is that people making the contributions are aware of it, and so they know that by giving an officeholder a contribution, they're also giving that officeholder a personal contribution through their spouse. And maybe that interest that wants to curry favor with that Member thinks, what better way than giving a contribution where I know actually a part of that's going to go directly into the pocket of the officeholder. 
   So that's part of the reason why we're here. And I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I'll close very briefly. 
   I appreciate the points that my colleague is making. There is a need for the transparency, even in the case of a spouse, particularly a spouse that may not carry the same last name as the officeholder. 
   But more particularly, if a spouse even has the same name, or a son with the same name sets up a company, the company doesn't bear the officeholder's name, there's no way for the public to know that that money is actually going to the family. 
   But more than that, you know, I think sometimes we get in the habit of thinking about how does this affect us; how does this affect our family; does this seem right to us, rather than how does the rest of the country view this. What does the rest of the country think about this? What does someone out in California or Texas or any of our 50 States think about this? 
   And I don't think they view it the same way we're discussing here today. I think they look at this and they say, gosh, when I send a contribution to this Presidential candidate or this Senate candidate or this congressional candidate, I expect that to go to the campaign. I don't expect that to go to their family. That's not right. And I don't think they would be moved by saying, well, you know, those officeholders, they often have a difficult financial situation themselves, and certainly many do. But I think that the public has the right to expect that when they support a campaign, when they support a candidate, that the funds go to the campaign, they don't go the candidate or their family. Or if they're going to go to the family, outside of the spouse, that there's very broad disclosure so that the public can make an informed decision about how they want to use their resources. 
   That's the purpose of the bill. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Again, I want to thank my colleagues Mr. Castle and Mr. Platts on the other side of the aisle. I want to thank our chairman and our majority leader and our Rules Committee Chair for their support, as well as the Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, today we have the opportunity to raise the wages of 13 million Americans, and we should take it. 
   Why raise the minimum wage in America? For the simple reason that men and women in the richest Nation on Earth should not work full time and still be relegated to living in poverty. What does it mean for the father or mother in a family of three to live on the current minimum wage? It means an income of $10,000 a year. 
   Imagine living in Glendale, Burbank or Pasadena, or any city in America, and trying to get by on $10,000 a year. A raise in the minimum wage will be an additional $4,000 for that family of three. It will mean more groceries on the table and a greater opportunity to get health care. It will mean potentially pulling that family out of poverty. It is the right thing to do. We have the opportunity today to make that happen for millions, and we should take it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for including my amendment in the en bloc package. 
   My amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to explore ways in which we can reduce the likelihood of an accidental nuclear launch from arsenals around the world. 
   Since the end of the Cold War, the procedures required to launch nuclear weapons have remained virtually unchanged. Both the U.S. and Russia still maintain thousands of nuclear weapons on high alert that can be launched at a moment's notice. Though the risk of a deliberate nuclear war with Russia is now very low, the danger of an accidental launch has increased. 
   In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in January, George Shultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger and Sam Nunn said that we must ``take steps to increase the warning and decision times for the launch of all nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, thereby reducing risks of accidental or unauthorized attacks. Reliance on launch procedures that deny command authorities sufficient time to make careful and prudent decisions is unnecessary and dangerous in today's environment.'' 
   This amendment to the defense authorization act calls for a study of the methods by which Chinese, Russian and American weapons can be made safer in a multilateral framework, and I urge its support.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I want to congratulate my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois, for his leadership on this issue and thank him for including any amendments and language on the topic that I have prepared. 
   Our amendment attacks the difficult problem of nuclear trafficking. Illicit nuclear material has been intercepted in transit many times since the end of the Cold War, and the material we catch is probably a small fraction of the total trafficked. 
   Nuclear attribution would allow us to identify the provenance of nuclear material in transit, or, God forbid, in the aftermath of a detonation. That knowledge would help us decide how to respond, and it would also provide a deterrent. If nations around the world knew that they could be identified as the source of material used in a nuclear attack, even irresponsible nations would be disinclined to proliferate. By developing a robust attribution capability, we can usher in an era in which proliferation is not just discouraged, but deterred, because those responsible would be found and punished. 
   This amendment supports nuclear attribution by strengthening our nuclear forensics capability. Nuclear forensics involves studying the mix of isotopes and other nuclear material that give it a particular signature. Physicists at the Department of Energy are world leaders in this field, but more research is needed to make our capability prompt, mobile and accurate. This amendment calls on the Secretary of Energy to develop a research and development plan for all the technologies involved so we can direct our funding appropriately.  
   Nuclear terrorism is a threat of paramount danger and uncertain probability. It is not a threat we can measure in brigades, ships, or warheads, but it is no less pressing for that. I believe this amendment is an important effort to reduce the risk of a calamitous nuclear event.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the fight against terror is, at one level, a military struggle, but it is also, at its roots, a battle over hearts and minds. 
   On Sunday, we suffered a major setback in that battle when the President of the United States vetoed legislation that would unequivocally state to the world that we do not condone torture in any form, in any place, under any circumstance. Instead, by appearing to abandon the rule of law by appearing to step away from the Geneva Conventions, by failing to renounce the use of  torture in the clearest of terms, we are only undermining our standing in the world and endangering the lives of our very own men and women. 
   When the Attorney General of the United States recently testified before the Judiciary Committee, he could not tell us if and when waterboarding constituted torture. He even suggested that a determination whether something constitutes torture depends on who is being subjected to the technique and the desirability of the information that is being sought. His testimony was murky. It was ambiguous. It failed to establish any bright line for our personnel or for the rest of the world. He could only say that if it were done to him, well, then that would be torture. 
   Instead, the bright line standard, if there was one to be found in his testimony, and the one that he asked us to hold up to the rest of the world, was whether or not a harsh interrogation technique is part of a program authorized by an attorney in the obscure Office of Legal Counsel. I am deeply concerned about what this says to our own personnel and about what it says to the rest of the world. 
   This is, indeed, no intangible loss, for the effects of this failure of moral leadership may tragically be visited on those brave men and women serving in our Armed Forces. 
   Who among us can fail to recall the opening ways of the Iraq war when American troops had been captured and were paraded in front of the cameras? We were disgusted with their treatment, and rightfully so. If we hesitate, equivocate, or otherwise fail to ban the use of waterboarding, how can we have any confidence that when American troops are captured they will not be subjected to this form of torture? How can we make the case that other nations or other enemies must not torture because we don't torture? How can we win the battle for hearts and minds if we surrender our most powerful weapon, the power of our good example?     
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the override of the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (CONFRONTING REALITY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, yesterday's decision by President Bush to escalate the U.S. troop commitment in Iraq will not bring stability to Baghdad. It will not ameliorate the growing civil war in Iraq. A troop increase will not result in a more rapid exit for the more than 130,000 American troops serving there, many of them on their third or fourth tour in Iraq. And worst of all, it makes apparent that the President has paid little heed to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, a multitude of experts, both civilian and military, the Congress and, most importantly, an overwhelming majority of the American people. 
   For a long time, many of us have been calling for a new way forward in Iraq, and the White House billed last night's speech as a dramatic departure from current policy. But while the rhetoric may have been different, the plan outlined by the President was more of the same, and he clearly intends to stay the course. This is a position that I believe is unwise and that I strongly oppose. 
   I will support a resolution of disapproval, and I am willing to explore other options to force the President to truly change policy in Iraq. 
   In his remarks, the President told us that failure in Iraq is unacceptable, but his prosecution of the war has made success in Iraq recede further and further from our reach. The latest escalation is another in a long series of poor decisions by the administration that have cost the lives of so many brave and dedicated troops, cost American taxpayers more than $350 billion and left Iraq in chaos. Shiites and Sunnis who once lived in integrated neighborhoods in Baghdad are slaughtering each other now at a terrifying  pace. Iraqis spend 16 of every 24 hours without electricity. 
   Rather than sending additional troops to combat the insurgency, we should begin to responsibly redeploy our forces in Iraq while redoubling our efforts to train and equip Iraqi forces to provide their own security, an effort which is at the very heart of the Iraq Study Group recommendations for bolstering security in Iraq. 
   President Bush rightly characterized the most recent pushes to stabilize Baghdad, Operation Together Forward and Operation Together Forward II, as unsuccessful, because there were not enough Iraqi forces to hold areas cleared by American troops. But the President's assertion that we will now be able to rely on 18 Iraqi army and police brigades to shoulder much of the burden in a new offensive in Baghdad is clearly at odds with reality.     
   The Iraqi Army has not distinguished itself in combat. And four of the six battalions that were deployed to the capital last summer failed to show up at all. 
   The Iraqi police, which are under the control of the Ministry of the Interior, have been heavily infiltrated by Shiite militias and death squads and cannot be expected to take on Shiite extremists as Prime Minister Malaki has pledged. There is little support for an escalated American military presence in Iraq. American military commanders do not see an increase as improving the security situation on the ground, and the strain of multiple deployments has seriously eroded our capacity to respond to other contingencies should the need arise. 
   The American people, Democrats and Republicans alike, do not support an increase in the troop strength in Iraq. Perhaps most important of all, the Iraqis do not want more American troops in Iraq. In fact, if there is one thing that unites Iraqis, it is the desire that American forces should not remain indefinitely. 
   Furthermore, by continuing to bear the brunt of the fighting against insurgents, foreign fighters, and militias, the United States has fostered a dangerous dependence that has slowed efforts to have Iraqis shoulder the burden of defending their own country and government. 
   Even as we focus our military efforts on training Iraqi security forces, we need to push the Sunnis and Shiites to make the political compromises that are the necessary precondition to any reconciliation process. I have been arguing for more than 2 years that the struggle in Iraq is primarily a political one. The Iraq Study Group and numerous outside experts have also pressed the administration to force the Iraqi Government to make the hard decisions on power sharing, minority rights, and the equitable distribution of oil revenues that could help quell the Sunni insurgency and undermine support for Shiite maximalists like Muktada al Sadr. 
   I also believe the United States must work to convene a regional conference to support Iraq's bringing together its neighborhoods to find ways to stem the flow of weapons and foreign fighters into Iraq and to pursue common strategies in support of reconstruction and political reconciliation efforts. 
   There is hard evidence that Iran is facilitating the flow of weapons, trainers, and intelligence to Shiite militias in a bid to assert greater control over its neighbor. At the same time, the long and porous Syrian border has continued to be a transit point for foreign jihadis who have carried out some of the spectacular and devastating attacks on U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians. 
   Finally, our efforts in Iraq cannot be pursued in a vacuum. We need to do more to engage the Arab and Muslim world, and there must be a renewed effort to start peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. This week's passage of the 9/11 implementation bill included excellent proposals for buttressing our leadership by improving our communication of ideas and communication in the Muslim world and by expanding U.S. scholarship exchange and other programs in Muslim countries. 
   Mr. Speaker, failure is unacceptable, but so is staying the course. I hope and expect that the debate we are going to have, the first real debate we have had in years, will convince the President to listen to those who are calling for a new way forward and not more of the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday, May 3, was World Press Freedom Day. Two years ago, in conjunction with World Press Freedom Day, Congressman Mike Pence, Senator Chris Dodd, Senator Dick Lugar and I established the Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press. Since then, this bipartisan, bicameral caucus has sought to highlight the importance of free expression around the world. The caucus is a forum where Members of Congress can work to combat and condemn media censorship and the persecution of journalists worldwide. 
   Our caucus works to send a strong message that Congress will defend democratic values and human rights wherever they're threatened. We work to highlight abuses of press freedom and foster reforms in support of press freedom around the world. We have hosted panel discussions with press freedom experts, journalists and victims of press freedom crimes. We have written to the leaders of countries which jail journalists, impose censorship, and allow harassment, attacks and threats to occur with impunity. And we've spoken out here on the House floor and in the media to call for reforms in countries that seek to censor freedom of speech and expression. 
   The caucus enjoys the support of a wide range of organizations, including Reporters Without Borders, Freedom House, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the National Endowment for Democracy's Center for International Media Assistance, as well as the legendary Walter Cronkite. 
   World Press Freedom Day was first designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1993 as an occasion to pay tribute to repressed journalists and to reflect upon the role of the media in general in advancing fundamental human rights as codified in international law, regional conventions, and national constitutions. In keeping with that tradition, we have hosted a Special Order hour in honor of World Press Freedom Day each year since the inception of the caucus. 
   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is a foundation of the postwar human rights movement, guarantees freedom of expression in article 19. ``Everyone has the right to freedom  of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of any frontiers.'' It may not be as elegant as our first amendment, but its effect and its desire and goal are the same. 
   For Americans, this day should spur us to consider the role that journalists play in our society and to ponder what our Nation would be like if this cornerstone of liberty were to be curtailed. Many Americans take the concept of a free press for granted and don't realize that an unfettered press is vital to America's national security and to our democracy here at home. 
   Freedom of the press is so central to our democracy that the Framers enshrined it in the very first amendment to our Constitution. Thomas Jefferson so valued the principle of press freedom that he said, given the choice between a free government or a free press, he would choose a free press. He said, ``The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspaper without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.'' 
   Journalists have jealously guarded their rights and American courts have, in the main, carved out broad protections for the press. In the United States, the press operates almost as a fourth branch of government, the Fourth Estate, independent of the other three, and positioned as an agent of the free people. 
   Winston Churchill agreed with the idea that a free press was almost another independent branch of government saying, ``A free press is the unsleeping guardian of every other right that free men prize; it is the most dangerous foe of tyranny. Under dictatorship the press is bound to languish, and the loudspeaker and the film to become more important. But where free institutions are indigenous to the soil and men have the habit of liberty, the press will continue to be the Fourth Estate, the vigilant guardian of the rights of the ordinary citizen.'' 
   From the pioneering work of journalists during the Civil War, to the ``muckrakers'' who were committed to exposing the social, economic and political ills of industrial life in the early 20th century, to the work of the Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in uncovering the Watergate scandal a year later, journalists have performed a crucial role as watchdogs of American freedom. 
   But in order for the press to do its work properly, it must be free, and journalists must be able to do their work without fear of retribution. Information is power, which is precisely why many governments attempt to control the press to suppress opposition and preempt dissent. 
   Far too often, the reporters and editors who demand reform, accountability and greater transparency find themselves at risk. The censorship, intimidation, imprisonment, and murder of these journalists are not only crimes against these individuals, they also impact those who are denied access to their ideas and information. 
   Freedom of expression and a free press is not just a cornerstone of democracy, it has also proven to play an important role in economic and social development. James Wolfensohn, former President of the World Bank, has long argued that ``a free press is not a luxury, it is at the core of equitable development.'' 
   The media exposes corruption, helps build a public consensus to bring about change, and facilitates the transmission of innovative ideas and valuable information that empowers people to share and shape their own destinies. There is an emerging consensus among development institutions that a skilled and a viable 
   media sector is a society's most promising tool for motivating government reform and poverty reduction. 
   Regrettably, censorship, intimidation, imprisonment, and even murder of journalists are far too common in countries all around the world. The map to my right provides a visual representation of press freedom rights by country. This map was provided by Freedom House, which releases an annual index called Freedom of the Press: A Global Survey of Media Independence. The countries that are highlighted in green are listed as having a ``free'' press. The countries in yellow represent countries that are ``partly free.'' And the countries colored purple are countries they describe as ``not free'' in terms of press freedom rights. And as you can see, in addition to problems here, we have vast expanses in Africa, in Asia, in the Middle East, and in South Asia. 
   To break it down a little more, when taking population into account, 42 percent of the world's people live in countries that have a press that is ``not free.'' Forty percent of the world's population live in countries that have only a ``partly free'' press. That is exhibited here in yellow. And in green we see that only 18 percent of the world's citizens enjoy a ``free press.'' Quite remarkable; 18 percent ``free,'' 42 percent ``not free,'' and the additional 40 percent only ``partly free.'' 
   More than 80 percent of the world's people, therefore, are denied full access to information. This is not for economic reasons, as you might expect, such as printing costs, lack of Internet connections or illiteracy, all of which are problems in their own right. Eighty-two percent of the world's population, 82 percent of the world is being denied access to information because their governments don't want them to have that access. 
   It's also important to note that even as the world continues to globalize, tragically press freedom continues to slip. This was the sixth consecutive year that Freedom House's index showed a reduction in global press freedom, a worrisome trend. 
   As I mentioned, this is the third Special Order hour we have held in recognition of World Press Freedom Day. The first year we launched our caucus, we outlined the intention of our caucus and press freedom abuses around the entire world. Last year, we decided that each year we would focus on a particular hot spot and highlight a single country where press freedom rights are particularly limited. 
   Last year, we focused on Russia. We profiled 18 journalists murdered in Russia during the administration of outgoing President Vladimir Putin. All of these journalists were believed to be killed due to their work. Most of these murders remain unsolved to this day. 
   Tonight, I will focus on the lack of press freedom in China leading up to the 2008 Summer Olympic games in Beijing this August. I have chosen to highlight press freedom in China for a number of reasons, including its failure to implement promised press freedom reforms before the Olympics, its incarceration of more journalists than any other country, its lack of independent media, and its censorship of the Internet, all of which I will be discussing tonight. 
   As the world's most populous country, China denies more citizens access to a free press than any other country. It is also tied for 181st place out of 195 countries in press freedom rights in Freedom House's survey. To give you a bit of perspective, China ranks between Syria and Iran in the survey. And Russia, which as I just mentioned lost 18 journalists, murdered journalists, during one president's administration, that country is ranked ahead of China on the survey. 
   As I speak here tonight, the Chinese Government limits more than 1 billion people's access to an open Internet and an independent media, despite the fact that article 35 of the Chinese Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, assembly, association and publication. Unfortunately, other articles in its Constitution subordinate these rights to what is called the ``national interest.'' This allows the ruling communist party to maintain direct control over the news media through the Central Propaganda Department, the CPD. 
   The Chinese Government has even proposed fines for domestic and foreign news organizations that report ``sudden events,'' such as protests, disease outbreaks, or national disasters without government authorization. Some of these are public health emergencies, epidemics that the Chinese government wants to have the ability to hide. These are just a few of the examples that I've chosen to highlight China tonight. 
   China is an enormously important country. China has emerged in a big way on the world stage. And China is a  country of immense promise. It is important both to the Chinese Government and to the Chinese people, as well as to the rest of the world, that we help to promote press freedom in our largest neighbor in the world, and one that will take a position of increasing importance in the years to come.     
   Before I continue, I want to thank all the press freedom advocacy organizations that helped provide this information for tonight's discussion: The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, the National Endowment For Democracy, and Freedom House have all been chronicling press freedom abuses in China, and much of what I will share with you tonight is a product of these groups' research, investigation, and reporting. I want to thank them not just for their efforts in helping us here tonight but, more importantly, for all of their work to defend journalists and journalism around the world. And I also want to take a moment to thank Sean Oblack of my staff for all of his effort and leadership in helping to put this caucus together and the presentation tonight. 
   During the Olympic bidding process, as international opposition grew to rewarding the Olympics to China, the Chinese Government promised to strengthen human rights in China. This included a commitment to press freedom. In the days leading up to the Olympic vote, Wang Wei, Secretary General of the Beijing Olympic Bidding Committee, said, ``We will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to China.'' 
   Regrettably, though, China has not delivered ``complete freedom'' to its own reporters. In September, 2007 Teng Biao and Hu Jia, two of China's most celebrated human rights activists, in an open letter to the international community, detailed China's failure to live up to its Olympic commitments, including press freedom. Teng and Hu wrote: 
   ``As of this writing, 35 Chinese journalists and 51 writers are still in prison. Over 90 percent were arrested or tried after Bejing's successful bid for the Olympics in July of 2001. For example, Dr. Xu Zerong, a scholar from Oxford University who researched the Korean War, was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment for `illegally providing information abroad.' Qingshuijun, Huang Jinqiu, a freelance writer, was sentenced to a 12-year term of imprisonment for his online publications. Some writers and dissidents are prohibited from going abroad; others from returning to China.'' 
   Due to this letter, due to this letter, Hu Jia now sits in jail. I will be profiling his case later in the hour. 
   Human Rights Watch reports that Chinese journalists remain closely observed by state security agencies to ensure that their reporting reflects the official government position. The government's Publicity Department heavily influences the weekly editorial content for print, radio, and television platforms by preventing the reporting of sensitive topics that fall under the vague metric of issues affecting ``social stability.'' Journalists that stray from the government line, as Teng and Hu noted, face imprisonment, travel restrictions, or are effectively deported. 
   Foreign correspondents do not experience ``complete freedom'' either when reporting in China. On January 1, 2007, the Chinese Government introduced a temporary measure that was intended to increase foreign reporters' freedom in China before, during, and after the Olympic games. This measure was set to expire in October, 2008. While some foreign correspondents have experienced increased journalistic freedom since the measure went into effect, most have not.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, today is World Press Freedom Day, a day that the international community has set aside to honor the work and sacrifice of journalists around the world. 
   World Press Freedom Day was first designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization in 1991 as an occasion to pay tribute to journalists and to reflect upon the role of the media in general in advancing fundamental human rights as codified in international law, regional conventions and national constitutions. 
   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the foundation of the postwar human rights movement, states the principle broadly in article 19. ``Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. This right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.'' It may not be as eloquent as our first amendment, but its effect is the same. 
   For Americans, this day should spur us to consider the role that journalists play in our society and to ponder what our Nation would be like if this cornerstone of our liberty were to be curtailed. 
   Although most Americans take the concept of a free press for granted, I believe that an unfettered press is vital to America's national security and to our democracy here at home. 
   A year ago today, my colleague from Indiana, Mr. Spence, and Senators Chris Dodd and Richard Lugar joined me in launching a new bipartisan, bicameral caucus aimed at advancing press freedom around the world. The Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press creates a forum where the United States Congress can work to combat and condemn media censorship and the persecution of journalists around the world. The launch of this new caucus sends a strong message that Congress will defend democratic values and human rights wherever they are threatened. 
   In launching the caucus, we were encouraged by the wide range of organizations and individuals, such as Reporters Without Borders, Freedom House, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Musa Klebnikov, the widow of Paul Klebnikov, the editor of Forbes Russia, who was shot to death outside of his offices 2 years ago, and the legendary Walter Cronkite, all of whom enthusiastically endorsed our effort.  
   Freedom of the press is so central to our democracy that the Framers enshrined it in the first amendment of our Constitution. At the time, there was little in the way of journalist ethics, and newspapers were filled with scurrilous allegations leveled at public figures. Even so, our Founders understood its importance to advancing the new Nation's experiment in democracy. 
   In the Virginia Report of 1799-1800, touching the alien and sedition laws, James Madison wrote that, ``Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of everything, and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press. It has accordingly been decided by the practice of the States that it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches to their luxuriant growth than by pruning them away to injure the vigor of those yielding the proper fruits. And can the wisdom of this policy be doubted by any who reflect that to the press alone, checkered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression, who reflect to the same beneficent source. The United States owes much of the lights which conducted them to the rank of a free and independent nation and which have improved their political system into a shape so auspicious to their happiness.'' 
   Throughout much of our history, Madison's argument has guided our national attitude toward the media. Journalists have jealously guarded their rights, and American courts have, in the main, carved out broad protection for the press. In the United States, the press operates almost as a fourth branch of government, the fourth estate, independent of the other three and positioned as an agent of the American people. 
   From the pioneering work of journalists during the Civil War, to the muckrakers who were committed to exposing social, economic and political ills of industrial life in the early 20th century, to the publication of the Pentagon Papers by The New York Times in 1971, to the work of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in uncovering the Watergate scandal a year later, journalists have performed a crucial role as the watchdogs of our freedom. 
   But in order for freedom of the press to do its work properly, it must be unfettered, and journalists must be able to do their work without fear of retribution. Information is power, which is precisely why governments, many of them, attempt to control the press to suppress opposition and to preempt dissent. Far too often, reporters and editors who seek to demand reform, accountability and greater transparency find that their livelihoods and even their very lives are in danger. The censorship, intimidation, imprisonment and murder of these journalists violate not only their personal liberty, but also the rights of those who are denied access to these ideas and information. 
   The United States, as the world's oldest democracy and the greatest champion of free expression, has a special obligation to defend the rights of journalists wherever and whenever they are threatened. A free press is one of the most powerful forces for advancing democracy, human rights and economic development. So our commitment to these larger objectives requires active engagement in the protection and the promotion of this freedom. 
   These are difficult and dangerous days for reporters around the world. According to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, 56 journalists were killed in the line of duty in 2006, most of whom were murdered to silence or punish them. The toll was 9 more than the 47 journalists killed in 2005, just the year before, and well above average for the last 2 decades of reporting. Another 30 reporters were killed, but law enforcement authorities cannot confirm that their deaths were the result of their work. 
   Outright murder is not the only tool that the authorities use to silence reporters. As of December 1, 2006, 134 journalists were imprisoned around the world as a consequence of their work. Of these, more than 100 were held by only five countries: China, Cuba, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Burma. 
   These countries which imprison journalists for straying beyond the bounds of official censorship are not the most dangerous for journalists, however. Since 1992, more journalists have been killed in Iraq, Algeria, Russia, Colombia and the Philippines than anywhere else. 
   We are all familiar with the dangers inherent in covering war and insurgencies, and many of those killed in Iraq, Algeria and Colombia have died covering conflicts in these countries. In the Philippines, the murder of journalists has been part of a larger campaign against perceived left-wing activists. 
   But it is Russia, where more than 20 journalists have been murdered in 6 years since Vladimir Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin, that we wish to address this evening. 
   All alone among the top five countries where journalists are murdered, the deaths of journalists in Russia seem to be part of a concerted effort to silence the few remaining journalists who refuse to tow the Kremlin line. China, Cuba and others have been rightly condemned for imprisoning journalists who raised the ire of their governments. Moscow seems to have taken a different tack. Instead of censoring jailing journalists it doesn't like, the Kremlin seems to look the other way when they turn up dead. 
   There is no direct evidence tying the Putin government to the murder of journalists in Russia, but there is a wealth of circumstantial evidence pointing to at least acquiescence in the death of journalists. 
   The number of journalists killed, the circumstances of their deaths, the stories they were working on, and perhaps most telling, the fact that not one of the crimes has been successfully prosecuted involving the murder of these journalists in Russia, is indicative of a deliberate decision not to dig too deeply into these murders. 
   Others hint at something darker. In an editorial the Washington Post recently stated, ``The instances of violence against journalists in Mr. Putin's Russia and of the brutal elimination of his critics both at home and abroad have become so common that it is impossible to explain them all as coincidences.'' 
   The evolution of Russian journalism from its dismal Soviet past to its current role as the Kremlin's sycophant is distressing. During the latter part of the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev loosened many of the Soviet era's restrictions on the press and the Soviet media became an important player in Gorbachev's policy of Glasnost. 
   Under Gorbachev, journalists began to explore the full range of issues that had remained hidden for so long by the Soviet Government, the Afghan war, the gulags, the miserable performance of the Soviet economy and the endemic corruption of Soviet society were laid bare. There is little doubt that the Soviet media's revelations were a catalyst in the disintegration of the Soviet Union. 
   In the immediate post-Soviet era, the Russian press foundered as the economy collapsed, but the first Chechen war, which lasted from 1994 to 1996, revitalized Russian journalism. Television was especially powerful, and its coverage of the war turned millions of Russians against the conflict. In many respects, this period was the high watermark for an independent press in Russia. 
   But even as NTV and other television outlets helped to shape domestic opposition to the Chechen war, Russian journalism was shedding its independence. As Michael Specter wrote in the New Yorker about this period in Russia, ``The moral tone of the journalist's world began to shift from idealistic to mercenary. The practice of writing biased news articles for money became routine, even at the best papers. Restaurant owners, businessmen and public officials knew that, for the right price, it would bring them favorable coverage almost anywhere.'' 
   This distortion of the journalistic creed of objectivity and neutrality was exacerbated in 1996 when President Yeltsin, whose support and opinion polls had fallen into the low single digits, faced off against Communist Gennady Zyuganov in the Russian presidential election. Knowing that without third-party intervention Yeltsin was doomed and that Zyuganov would reimpose control over the media, Russia's media elite intervened. 
   Over the course of the campaign, NTV and other media outlets collectively swayed Russian public opinion and Yeltsin ended up winning. But the  damage was done. As a former anchor for NTV told the New Yorker's Michael Specter, the election ``put a poisoned seed into the soil, and even if we did not see why, the authorities understood at once mass media could very easily be manipulated to achieve any goal. Whether the Kremlin needed to raise the rating of a president or bring down an opponent or conduct an operation to destroy a businessman, the media could do the job.''     
   Once the Kremlin understood it could use journalists as instruments of its will and saw that journalists would go along, everything that happened in the Putin era was, sadly, quite logical. 
   The ascension of Vladimir Putin to the Russian presidency cemented the link between Russia's rulers and the press. Even without government censorship, the press has become a passive booster of the president's efforts to centralize authority and to restore Russia to its former status as a great power. To that end, the Russian media has ignored the corruption and cronyism that has become institutionalized in Russia since the Yeltsin period, and has largely been uncritical of the prosecution of the second Chechnyan war which has raged for nearly 8 years. 
   But even as the vast majority of their colleagues censor themselves and follow the Kremlin line, a few brave journalists have dared to investigate, to question, and criticize. Journalistic independence in Russia is dangerous. And in a few minutes we will introduce you to some of the journalists whose brave voices have been stilled. 
   When my colleague arrives back on the floor, MIKE PENCE, I will introduce him. He has been a leading voice in the House on human rights and serves as the other co-chair of our Congressional Caucus For Freedom of the Press. 
   But this evening I will start in highlighting the Russian journalists who have lost their lives by talking about Ivan Safronov, who died in early March of this year after falling from a fifth floor stairwell window in his apartment building in Moscow. 
   He was a correspondent at Kommersant, and is the most recent journalist in Russia to die under a cloud of suspicion. Russian officials quickly called his death a suicide. However, according to colleagues of his at Kommersant, he had a very happy family life and had no motive to commit suicide. It was not until Kommersant and some other news media suggested foul play that the authorities agreed to investigate the circumstances of Mr. Safronov's death. 
   According to his editors, Mr. Safronov, a military affairs writer, was working on a story about Russian plans to sell weapons to Iran and Syria via Belarus. Mr. Safronov had been a colonel in the Russia Space Forces prior to reporting for Kommersant. He frequently angered authorities with his critical reporting and was repeatedly questioned by Federal authorities which suspected him of divulging state secrets. One such report that Mr. Safronov filed that angered officials revealed the third consecutive launch failure of a new Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile. This had been a pet project of President Putin's which was supposed to show the world Russia's nuclear strength. 
   Strangely enough, no charges were ever brought up against Mr. Safronov. He was well aware that he was reporting on a sensitive issue and was very careful in his work always to have a way to prove he was not divulging state secrets. He was known for making meticulous notes and conducting thorough research so he could always prove he got his information from known sources. 
   It would seem that sadly Mr. Safronov's reporting was too good and the only way to silence him was by eliminating him. Mr. Safronov is not on either of the lists of journalists that we have tonight to highlight because his death is so recent. But his tragic death is another example of the lack of progress being made to protect journalists in Russia. 
   Before I begin highlighting 13 of the journalists on the committee to protect journalists of the most recently murdered journalists in Russia, I would like to introduce my colleague from Indiana, MIKE PENCE, who is one of the co-chairs of the caucus and does a superb job advocating for the rights of the media.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for your generosity and commitment. I know my colleague probably feels as I do that there is many a morning I get up and read the newspaper, seeing my own name in it, and not feel that this is the day I want to champion a free press. That does happen from time to time. But notwithstanding those occasional morning papers, we almost always recognize the importance of the institution. That is why we are here tonight. 
   When we have gotten together in the past, it is to highlight journalists who have been imprisoned or murdered or killers who have gone with impunity around the world. But because of the magnitude of the problem in Russia, because of the prevalence and the pernicious nature of what is going on in Russia, we felt that we needed to spotlight one country tonight and devote the entire hour to Russia. 
   Let me start by highlighting some of the 13 journalists in Russia who have been killed contract-style since President Putin was elected president in 2000. 
   This list of journalists was compiled by the caucus to protect journalists. These 13 journalists are all believed to have been deliberately killed due to their work as journalists. Their names and the dates they were killed and the media outlets they worked for are listed on some of the graphics that we have here tonight, and these are the faces of the 13 slain journalists. 
   It is one thing when we talk about the numbers of journalists that have been murdered this year and the number that were murdered last year or the number killed in Russia alone over the last several years. Those are only numbers; but when we look at this chart and we look at these journalists and we realize that these were each promising lives, these were each important lives, these were real people doing a courageous job who are no longer among us, we can understand the enormity of the crime that is going on. 
   The first of the journalists on the committee's list and the second most recent journalist in Russia to be murdered, probably the most well-known internationally is Anna Politkovskaya. Her portrait is behind me. Anna was found shot to death in her Moscow home on October 7 of last year in a murder that garnered worldwide condemnation.     
   Her death sparked protests from governments around the world, the European Union, and civil society groups concerned with freedom of the press. 
   Anna was a courageous and world-renowned writer for the paper Novaya Gazeta. For many years she had campaigned against the war in Chechnya, corruption, and shrinking freedoms throughout the Russian Federation. Anna was a fearless journalist committed to reporting the truth about the conflict in Chechnya, which she called ``a small corner of hell.'' 
   In 7 years covering the second Chechen war, Anna's reporting repeatedly drew the wrath of Russian authorities. For simply reporting the truth about the conflict, she was threatened, jailed, forced into exile, and even poisoned. Even that was not enough to silence her. 
   In an interview with the Committee to Protect Journalists, Politkovskaya noted the government's obstruction and harassment of journalists trying to cover the Chechen conflict. She pointed out the difficulty of covering the 2004 hostage crisis in the North Ossetian town of Beslan that left 334 civilians dead. She said, ``There is so much more to write about Beslan, but it gets more and more difficult when all the journalists who write are forced to leave.'' 
   Apparently the authorities were not content with simply forcing Politkovskaya to leave. She was poisoned on her way to cover the Beslan crisis. After drinking tea on a flight to the region, she became seriously ill and was hospitalized, but the toxin was never identified because the medical staff was instructed to destroy her blood tests. 
   Politkovskaya was threatened and attacked numerous times in retaliation for her work. In February 2001, security agents detained her in the Vedeno district in Chechnya, accusing her of entering Chechnya without accreditation. She was kept in a pit for three days without food or water, while a military officer threatened to shoot her. Seven months later, she received death threats from a military officer accused of crimes against civilians. She was forced to flee to Vienna after the officer sent an e-mail to Novaya Gazeta promising that he would seek revenge. 
   When Politkovskaya covertly visited Chechnya in 2002 to investigate new allegations of human rights abuses, security officers arrested her, kept her overnight at a military base, and threatened her. In October of that year, Politkovskaya served as a mediator between armed Chechen fighters and Russian forces during a hostage standoff in a central Moscow theater. Two days into the crisis, with the Kremlin restricting media coverage, Russian forces gassed the theater and 129 hostages died. Politkovskaya delivered some of the most compelling accounts of that tragedy. 
   Just prior to her murder, Anna was working on an article, accompanied by photos, about torture in Chechnya. It was due to be published days after she was killed. Her article, however, never arrived at the newspaper. 
   In her last book, Russia Under Putin, which was published this year in France, she not only criticized atrocities in Chechnya but also corruption and human rights violations in Russia. 
   Anna was internationally acclaimed for her courage and her professionalism, and now you can see why. She was named by the Committee to Protect Journalists as one of the world's top press freedom figures of the past 25 years in the fall 2006 edition of its magazine, Dangerous Assignments. 
   Anna may have been killed, but her memory continues to live on. Today, Anna was named this year's winner of the prestigious 2007 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. This is the first time the honor has been awarded posthumously in its 10-year history. 
   While the Russian Government claims that many leads have been examined, so far the investigation has stalled, and no charges have been filed, a sadly familiar tale when a journalist is murdered in Russia. 
   This is the face of a woman of great courage, who gave her life so that the truth could come out and be told, and tonight we honor her memory and we point to her example. 
   I will turn now to Mr. Pence to highlight our next journalist.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   The next casualty in Russia's war on journalism that we will highlight tonight is Paul Klebnikov whose photo appears here. 
   Paul, editor of Forbes Russia and an investigative reporter, was gunned down as he left his Moscow office late at night on July 9, 2004. Authorities in Moscow described the case as a contract murder and said that he may have been killed because of his work. Paul, a U.S. journalist of Russian descent, was 41 years old when he was shot at least nine times from a passing car. 
   I had the opportunity to speak with his widow a year ago today when Representative Pence and I launched this caucus, and I expressed my deep sorrow to her and their three young children about this tragic occurrence. 
   Paul had just started as the editor of Forbes Russia, which had launched three months prior to his death. He had risen through the ranks of Forbes over the prior 15 years with the magazine, starting as a reporter covering Russian economic reform and the rise of the country's new business elite. As a son of Russian emigrants with a long military tradition across the political stratosphere, Paul developed a significant expertise in Russian and Eastern European politics and economics, which he used to report on the murky world in post-Soviet Russia where politics and business meet. 
   Over the course of his career, Paul conducted hundreds of interviews with top Russian officials and business leaders and had interviewed nearly all of Russia's most famous businessmen, its oligarchs. His research into the activities of these leaders led to his first book. Further research into organized crime in Chechnya led to his second book. In 2003, he published a groundbreaking article on corruption among Iran's theocratic rulers. 
   When given the opportunity to launch Forbes Russia, Paul considered it a great opportunity to bring the best of Western values to a Nation struggling through a difficult political, economic and social transition. He wrote that Russia, despite setbacks, was entering an era where lawful, innovative, free enterprise capitalism could emerge. In Forbes Russia's inaugural edition of April 2004, Paul published an investigative piece that led to criticism from the Kremlin. The following May issue included a list of Russia's 100 richest people, noting that Moscow had more billionaires than any other city. Both articles incited the subjects of the pieces, and Paul's tradition of creating enemies through his reporting continued. 
   That history followed him to the night of his murder when Paul, after leaving work, was shot multiple times and killed. In his dying words, he said he couldn't imagine who wanted him dead. 
   A special crimes unit was assigned to investigate Paul's murder. 
   On September 28, 2004, Moscow police said they arrested two Chechen men suspected in the murder. But the suspects denied involvement, and police backed off their initial assertion. Less than two months later, on November 18, 2004, Moscow police and the Belarusian security service arrested three other Chechens considered suspects in the murder. Authorities provided only limited information about the evidence they used to link the new suspects to the crime. 
   Some analysts reacted to the arrests with skepticism. After the September arrests were reported, Oleg Panfilov, director of the Moscow-based press freedom group Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations, told an interviewer that authorities were pursuing a ``farfetched Chechen trail.'' 
   Today, Paul's case remains another unsolved murder in Russia. 
   Paul may have believed Russia was entering a new era, but today we can still see that with independent reporting stifled and investigative journalists living in fear of contract killings, post-Soviet Russia still must close a vast gap to begin to have a free and unbiased press. 
   I yield to my colleague from Indiana (Mr. Pence).

   Mr. SCHIFF. It is a sad commentary on the number of journalists that have been murdered in Russia, that in an hour we will not have time to discuss all of them. 
   There are several journalists we may not be able to fully describe this evening who are featured on our chart. I do want to let those know who are listening and watching know that the full biographies and facts that we are outlining tonight can be obtained from the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders. Much of the material we are using tonight is drawn from their sources, and we are deeply grateful for their work and assistance. 
   The next journalist we will highlight tonight is Dmitry Shvets. Dmitry's picture appears here in the middle of the chart. On April 18, 2003, the 37 year-old deputy director general of the independent television station TV-21 Northwestern Broadcasting in the northern Russian City of Murmansk, was shot dead outside of the station's offices. 
   An unknown assailant shot Dmitry several times at approximately 5:00 in the afternoon in front of witnesses and escaped in a getaway car that was waiting nearby. Dmitry died instantly. Dmitry was well known in Murmansk, not only for running the television station, but also for his political activism and a number of commercial interests. Although he had not worked as a journalist in many years, Dmitry remained in a managerial position and on the station's board of directors. According to press reports in the Moscow-based Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations, he influenced the station's editorial policy and TV-21's reporting. 
   The Murmansk media covered Dmitry's murder widely and actively speculated about the possible motive. Dmitry's colleague said the TV-21 had received several threats for its critical reporting on several influential politicians, include Andrei Gorshkov, a candidate in the city's mayoral race. 
   Several weeks before Dmitry's murder, Gorshkov had threatened TV-21's journalists several times after they broadcast a tough interview with him. TV-21 news editor Svetlana Bokova told the Committee to Protect Journalists that at the time of his death, Dmitry was using his contacts at the police and prosecutor's office to investigate the mayoral candidate's links to organized crime. 
   Police investigated various motives behind the murder, including Dmitry's political, commercial and journalistic activities at TV-21. Dmitry's colleagues maintain that he was killed in retaliation for TV-21's critical reporting on local politics. 
   Sadly, Dmitry's murder has yet to be solved. 
   I now yield to the gentleman from Indiana.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman very much, and particularly since the gentleman conducted a special order hour before this one, I am amazed that his voice has held up this long. I thank the gentleman for all your work, and appreciate you joining me tonight. 
   The next journalist that I will highlight this evening is Eduard Markevich, and Eduard's picture appears in the upper left-hand corner. Mr. Markevich was the 29-year-old editor and publisher of Novy Reft, the local newspaper in the town of Reftinsky, Sverdlovsk Region. He was found dead, shot in the back. 
   Novy Reft often criticized local officials, and Eduard's colleagues told the ITAR-TASS news service that he had  received threatening telephone calls prior to the attack. This was not the first attack on Eduard, the Region-Inform news agency reported. In 1998, two unknown assailants broke into his apartment and severely beat him in front of his pregnant wife. They were never caught. 
   In 1999, Eduard was illegally detained for 10 days after local prosecutor's office charged him with defamation over a Novy Reft article questioning the propriety of a lucrative government contract that gave a former deputy prosecutor the exclusive right to represent the Reftinsky administration in court. 
   In May 2001, federal prosecutor general Vladimir Ustinov reprimanded the local prosecutor for violating Eduard's constitutional rights. 
   Police investigated, or launched an investigation into Eduard's murder. Now 6 years after the journalist's death. Authorities have made no progress, the Moscow-based Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations has reported. There is continually no progress made. 
   His wife continues to publish the Novy Reft, and, this evening, Eduard is in our thoughts and in our memories. 
   The next journalist I will highlight this evening, is Adam Tepsurgayev. Adam's picture appears just here to my right. Adam was a 24-year-old Chechen cameraman. He was shot dead at a neighbor's house in the village of Alkhan-Kala. His brother, Ali, was wounded in the leg during the attack.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (HRANT DINK'S FINAL ARTICLE -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, about a week and a half ago, a courageous journalist by the name of Hrant Dink was murdered outside of his newspaper office in Istanbul. I would like to read today some of the comments that he made in his last newspaper article Agos on January 19, the day that he was shot dead. 
   He wrote, ``At first, when an investigation was launched against me for insulting Turkishness, I did not feel troubled. This was not the first time ..... 
   ``I had complete trust in what I'd written and what had been my intentions. 
   ``Once the prosecutor had the chance to evaluate the text of my editorial as a whole, not that single sentence, which made no sense by itself, he would understand that I had no intention of insulting Turkishness and this comedy would come to an end. I was sure of myself. But, surprise! A lawsuit was filed. 
   ``In covering every hearing, the newspapers, editorials and television programs all referred to how I had said that the blood of the Turk is poisonous.  
   ``Each time they were adding to my fame as the enemy of the Turk. 
   ``In the corridors of the courthouse, the fascists physically attacked me with racist curses. 
   ``They bombarded me with insults. Hundreds of threats hailed down for months by phone, e-mail and post, increasing all the time. 
   ``I persevered through all of this with patience, awaiting the decision that would acquit me. 
   ``Then the truth would prevail and all those people would be ashamed of what they had done. 
   ``My only weapon was my sincerity. But when the decision came out, my hopes were crushed. From then on, I was in the most distressed situation a person can possibly be in. 
   ``The judge had made a decision in the name of the Turkish nation and it had legally registered that I had denigrated Turkishness. I could have coped with anything but this. 
   ``In my understanding, the denigration of a person on the basis of any difference, ethnic or religious, is racism, and there was no way this could ever be forgiven ..... 
   ``Those who tried to single me out and weaken me have succeeded. With the false information they oozed into society, they created a significant segment of the population who saw Hrant Dink as someone who insults Turkishness. 
   ``The memory of my computer is filled with angry, threatening lines sent by citizens from this sector. 
   ``How real are these threats? To be honest, it is impossible for me to know for sure. 
   ``What is truly threatening and unbearable for me is the psychological torture I placed myself in. The question that really gets to me is: What are these people thinking about me? 
   ``Unfortunately, I am now better known than before and I feel people looking at me, thinking: Oh, look, isn't he that Armenian guy? 
   ``I am just like a pigeon, equally obsessed by what goes on on my left and right, front and back. My head is just as mobile and fast. 
   ``What did foreign Minister Gul say? Or Justice Minister Cicek? There is no need to exaggerate about Article 301 on insulting Turkishness. Has anyone been actually put in prison? 
   ``As if going to prison was the only price to pay. This is the price. This is the price. 
   ``Do you ministers know the price of making someone as scared as a pigeon? 
   ``What my family and I have been through has not been easy. I have considered leaving this country at times ..... 
   ``But leaving a boiling hell to run to a heaven is not for me. I wanted to turn this hell into heaven. 
   ``We stayed in Turkey because that was what we wanted, out of respect for the thousands of people here who supported me in my fight for democracy ..... 
   ``I am now applying to the European Court of Human Rights. I don't know how long the case will take, but I do know that I will continue living here in Turkey until the case is finalized. 
   ``And if the Court rules in my favor, I will be very happy and will never have to leave my country. 
   ``2007 will probably be an even harder year for me. The Court cases will continue. New ones will be initiated and God knows what kind of additional injustices I will have to face. 
   ``I may see myself as frightened as a pigeon, but I know that in this country people do not touch pigeons. 
   ``Pigeons can live in cities, even in crowds. A little scared perhaps, but free.'' 
   Well, Mr. Dink, unfortunately, found otherwise when he was gunned down outside of his office by young men no doubt inflamed by the passions that the government did so little to quell. Hrant Dink, who had the courage to talk about some of the darkest periods of Ottoman history, of the genocide of the Armenian people, the first genocide of last century that claimed a million and a half lives, paid for that courage with his life. 
   Well, we will have the courage here soon to take up a resolution on the Armenian genocide. All we have to do is vote. That is very little compared to what Hrant Dink did and the price that he paid. 
   I had a chance to meet him in Istanbul a couple of years ago. He was optimistic about the future. He was optimistic about Turkey's future, about its willingness to examine its past. Regrettably, that optimism was misplaced. 
   Today we remember a courageous journalist, Hrant Dink. And his legacy lives on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, the announcement in Beijing yesterday that the Government of North Korea has agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons program is a positive step, and I applaud the efforts of Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, as well as the efforts of our negotiating partners, Japan, South Korea, Russia and China. 
   Obviously much work remains to be done to ensure that North Korea follows through on its pledge to halt plutonium production at Yongbyon and to allow the return of international inspectors, as well as to resolve other outstanding issues; most noticeably, the need for complete declaration from Pyongyang of all of its nuclear activities and final disposition of North Korea's existing nuclear program. 
   As with past agreements with the reclusive regime of Kim Jong-Il, this agreement could collapse at any time. 
   There is now, however, rare optimism that a significant ratcheting down of tensions with the North is possible. The agreement should serve to remind those in the administration who see confrontation as the only way to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear program, that diplomacy can be effective, even if it is often immensely frustrating. 
   I hope that the President and Secretary of State will use this breakthrough with North Korea to reinvigorate diplomatic efforts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 4 years since President Bush ordered American military forces into Iraq with the intention of toppling the government of Saddam Hussein. Now, after more than 3,100 American troops have been lost and this Nation has spent in excess of $365 billion, we find ourselves at a crossroads. Do we endorse the President's decision to escalate the conflict, or do we, as a coequal branch of government, exercise our prerogative to force a change in course? 
   In October of 2002 I voted for the resolution authorizing the use of military force in Iraq based on three assumptions: First, that the intelligence community correctly assessed that Iraq had active stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was pursuing a nuclear bomb; second, that President Bush would exhaust all diplomatic efforts to resolve the international community's standoff with Iraq over its weapons programs; and, third, that if the President determined that a resort to force was necessary the prosecution of the war and its aftermath would be competently managed by the President and his administration. 
   Each of these assumptions proved to be wrong. Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and no nuclear program; President Bush did not exhaust all diplomatic efforts; and perhaps most tragically, his administration made terrible, costly and repeated blunders in its conduct of the war. 
   I have been to Iraq three times to visit our troops and to thank them for their service and their sacrifice. I have met the families of five soldiers and marines from my district who have been lost in Iraq. I have visited with our wounded here and overseas. 
   Words cannot convey the admiration that I have for the magnificent job that these men and women, many of them still in their late teens and early twenties, are doing on our behalf in Iraq. Whatever failings there have been in the prosecution of this war by the administration, our troops have performed magnificently in wretched conditions and against an often unseen enemy that has targeted U.S. military and Iraqi citizens without discrimination. 
   We must and we will continue to ensure that they have the resources they need to do their jobs and to come home safely, and once they are home, we will provide them with the care and benefits that they have paid for in blood. 
   Unlike some of my friends in the minority, I have never construed support for the troops to require a blind, unquestioning and slavish devotion to the Executive, even when the Executive is wrong, even when its policies will not achieve the desired result, and even when those very policies place our troops unnecessarily and unproductively at greater risk. On the contrary, on the contrary, an engaged Congress is essential to meaningful support for the troops. 
   On many occasions here on the House floor, in committee and in meetings with senior officials, I have pressed for accountability, oversight and a more vigorous commitment to force protection. In October 2003, I voted against the $87 billion Iraq supplemental because I believed that it shortchanged security for our troops and allocated too much for no-bid contracts. 
   Now, more than 3 years later, our reconstruction efforts in Iraq are a disaster and a national disgrace. Too many of our troops still ride into battle in vehicles that are not properly protected against IEDs and other weapons. 
   Last June I voted against the administration's ``stay the course'' resolution that sought to conflate the war in Iraq with the entire struggle against al Qaeda, even as it failed to acknowledge that our strategy to stabilize the country was not working and that its country was slipping into civil war. 
   Now, against the advice of Congress, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, most military experts and the American people, President Bush has determined that victory in Iraq can be achieved by deploying 21,000 additional combat troops to Baghdad and its environs. 
   Regrettably, I cannot see how this escalation can be successful. Instead, I believe it will further the cycle of dependency that has allowed Iraq's Shiite dominated government to avoid making compromises with Sunnis and to avoid building capable security forces. It will increase the strain on our military at a time when the Army and Marines are already stretched to the breaking point. And, most of all, it will deepen our military commitment to Iraq at a time when there is a national consensus that we should be taking steps to reduce our combat role and reinvigorate the diplomatic process. 
   The administration and the minority charge that those who do not support the escalation have no plan and that this is the only possible path to success. I disagree. The Iraq Study Group laid out a strategy that centered around a reduced American combat presence in Iraq, increased efforts to train Iraqi forces, increased pressures on the Iraqis to make compromises and a regional conference to hammer out a common approach to Iraq. 
   This resolution is a clear message to the President that his approach has lost the confidence of this House and we need a change of direction. I hope he chooses to take our counsel. But he should be aware that the days of a rubber-stamp Congress are over, and we are willing to take other steps to insist on charting a new course in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (MANAGING ARSON THROUGH CRIMINAL HISTORY (MATCH) ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1759, the Managing Arson Through Criminal History Act, or the MATCH Act. This is legislation that my colleague, Congresswoman MARY BONO, and I introduced earlier this year to create a national registry of arsonists that would give law enforcement officers an important tool to track arsonists and share information across jurisdictions. 
   I want to thank Mrs. Bono for her leadership on this issue. I also want to thank the chairman of our committee for moving this bill through the committee and the majority leader for bringing it before us today. 
   In October of this year, the Nation saw the destruction caused by fires in southern California. Over 1,500 homes were destroyed, half a million acres of land burned, seven people died, and more than 85 were injured, including 61 firefighters. These brave heroes put their lives on the line every day to protect people, homes and wildlife.     
   The MATCH Act would create a national registry and require convicted arsonists to report where they live, work, and go to school. And the database would include photographs, fingerprints, vehicle information and other information on the arsonist. The length of time that an arsonist would be required to register is based on how many acts of arson they have committed: 5 years for one offense, 10 years for two, and lifetime for a serial arsonist who has committed three or more offenses. The information would only be made available to law enforcement agencies, not the general public. Most important, when a convicted arsonist updates his or her information with a change of residence, notification would be sent to the appropriate law enforcement agencies. 
   When arson has occurred, it's critical to find and find quickly the individual involved to prevent future acts of arson and to prosecute the one responsible. Frequently arsonists use the same trademark tools, such as a unique incendiary device, a manner of starting a fire, or similar targets, such as houses of worship or even auto dealerships. In a case where the arsonist may have come from one place or a State to commit the act of arson, the information in the database will give law enforcement an important tool to identify convicted arsonists that may be connected to the very similar act of arson. Most importantly, the registration can also prevent future acts of arson by requiring convicted arsonists to update their information when they move or change jobs or schools. In addition to putting law enforcement on notice, this also lets the convicted arsonists know they can't hide from law enforcement for the purpose of committing another act of arson. 
   When I was a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles, I worked on an arson investigation that really brings to mind for me the merit of this bill. That case demonstrates how an arsonist registry would be of great benefit. This was a situation where someone was setting a string of fires in the San Bernardino forest. The individual used a unique incendiary device that he could throw in the brush and drive far away before the brush would be ignited. They couldn't catch the culprit in the act and eventually succeeded in tracking him down through the use of video surveillance and a complex investigation. The suspect was arrested and interviewed and admitted to setting fires in the taped interview. However, the tape recording malfunctioned and the confession was lost along with most of the case. As we pursued the investigation, we found a probation officer of the suspect from many years earlier who found his records in his basement storage. The file on the suspect detailed that many years earlier he had set fires using the same incendiary device. When confronted with the evidence, the suspect pled guilty. If we had a national arsonist registry at the time, we would have known of convicted arsonists who lived in the region. We would have known their modus operandi. We may have been able to stop him before he committed several later fires. Keeping your records in the basement is not a successful law enforcement strategy; the national arsonist registry created through the MATCH Act is. 
   Again, I want to compliment my colleague Mary Bono. Thank you very much for your leadership on this. It's very important to all Californians. 
   And, Mr. Chairman, we are very grateful for your moving this bill through committee so quickly in such a bipartisan spirit.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6049, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I rise in support of this energy and jobs bill and, in particular, want to talk about two provisions that are very important to my constituents and I think very important to the country. 
   The first are provisions that would extend tax credits for the solar energy industry. In my district alone, there are hundreds of jobs at stake. These are hundreds of good, well-paying, clean jobs that not only are good for the citizens in my district, but also are good for the country. We need an Apollo project like effort to wean ourselves off fossil fuels. 
   We want the ability to be able to tell the oil producing nations of the world that they can take their oil and they can keep it, that we don't need it. 
   We want to be able to address global warming. We want to be able to make sure that we have a sound energy policy based on this Nation's future. And solar energy is a big part of the solution. 
   So this tax credit alone, I've had business people in my district tell me if this tax credit goes away, those jobs will go away. It's as simple as that. Homeowners won't be able to meet the financial burden of putting solar power panels on their roofs. Those that produce those panels will have to lay off the people in that industry. People will become more reliant on fossil fuels, not less. 
   There's a second provision, very important to my constituents and also very important to an industry that has a positive balance of trade with every other country on earth, and that is the entertainment industry. We have tax incentives to try to keep production in this country of small and medium sized films. We're losing a lot of that production to Canada. We'll lose even more if the tax credits that incentivize those small productions go away. I'm very proud that we're taking action to deal with the problem of runaway production. Again, good, well-paying jobs that we want to keep in this country. This legislation will help keep them there. 
   Many of my constituents are losing those jobs to Canada, Australia and other countries because those other countries are offering incentives to keep and move production there.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution, introduced by Bob Filner of California, chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, is both appropriate and timely. It expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that American flags flown on Federal Government buildings and on Federal property should be made in the United States. 
   As with many basic products sold in the U.S. today, it can be difficult to find a flag that is made in America. But the American flag is not just any product. It is our national symbol, and especially when it flies over Federal Government property, it ought to be made in America by Americans. 
   I am proud that the Architect of the Capitol flies only American-made flags. When one of our constituents or a community organization receives a flag flown over the Capitol, they can be sure it was made in the U.S.A. 
   When we see the American flag, it should remind us of American workers whose jobs are sometimes now being shipped overseas to countries with lower labor and worker safety protections. The American flag represents the values of our Nation, values that cannot be reconciled with the conditions in many overseas factories. 
   There is a lot we need to do to ensure that America retains the jobs that drive our economy. But as one step, if only a small symbolic step, let us assure the American people that we will not fly imported American flags over Federal property. The flags we fly will be made by American workers in American factories. They will never be made in foreign sweatshops or by children. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. And I want to commend the gentleman from California for introducing it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (CRIMINAL HISTORY BACKGROUND CHECKS PILOT EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Criminal History Background Checks Pilots Extension Act of 2008 will allow a simple 6-month extension to the National Child Safety Pilot Program passed as a part of the PROTECT Act of 2003. 
   I am proud to sponsor the House version of this bill. The Senate has already taken up the legislation by unanimous consent, so if the House votes to pass this bill, as I hope it will, it will go to the President to be signed into law. 
   We're fortunate to have millions of Americans who generously give their time and energy to volunteer and mentor children. In 1986, as a then young lawyer, I volunteered as a Big Brother for a 7-year-old in the Greater Los Angeles area. That relationship has been one of the most rewarding and enduring that I've ever had. It also taught me firsthand the trust that we place in the adult in a mentoring situation. It's important that we protect children by taking reasonable and practical steps to help guard against the chance that a convicted child abuser or sex offender might conceal his or her past and place our children at risk. 
   Since 2003, and earlier, States have been authorized to access national fingerprint-based background checks through the FBI on behalf of youth-serving organizations. Unfortunately, as of today, only one-third of States have the infrastructure in place for a youth-serving organization to get a background check from the FBI in an affordable and timely manner. 
   In passing the PROTECT Act, Congress acted in response to the need to protect children from predators who could gain access to children under the guise of volunteering. Mentoring groups, large and small, want access to the information they need to protect children, and the pilot has been extremely successful in providing that access through a fee-supported system at no cost to taxpayers. 
   The pilot demonstrated that there was a clear need for this program to protect children. Six percent of checks conducted came back with serious criminal records, in many cases records that would have not turned up through a search of a State database or through a name-based commercial search. We have cases from around the Nation in which applicants for volunteering positions with children were sex offenders, repeat felons, and child abusers. 
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reviewed files in which an applicant had a criminal record in four States, including a conviction for murder, which they didn't reveal to the organization. Losing access to these checks would be disastrous for hundreds of small, community-based mentoring organizations. 
   Due to the success of the program, we have extended the pilot twice before. It is now set to expire July 31 unless we extend it again. This bill would provide a 6-month extension to give us all time to work on an appropriate permanent bill that protects our children, while also protecting the privacy of potential volunteers. 
   I am proud to sponsor, along with my colleague, Mr. Rogers of Michigan, the Child Protection Improvements Act, a bill which would do just that. We will continue to work with stakeholders and the Judiciary Committee to put in place a permanent system of protection. 
   The pilot program has demonstrated that youth-serving organizations correctly want to watch out for children and want access to affordable, accurate and prompt background checks to help them do so. We need to keep the pilot program in place while we develop the permanent bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (REGULATORY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Federal regulation process is one of the most important ways by which our Nation implements public policy. Each year, agencies issue thousands of regulations to promote safety in our lives, from the food we eat, to the cars we drive, to the air we breathe. 
   Although regulations play a critical role in protecting so many aspects of our daily lives, there is no independent, nonpartisan entity that Congress can rely upon to help us ensure that these regulations are working as intended. 
   The Administrative Conference of the United States was just such an entity, a public-private think tank that provided invaluable guidance to Congress about how to improve the administrative and regulatory process. 
   First authorized by President John F. Kennedy, the Conference made numerous recommendations over the course of its 27-year existence, many of which were enacted into law. The conference was last funded into in 1995. H.R. 3564, the Regulatory Improvement Act of 2007, would reauthorize it for 3 years. 
   Some might ask why we are reauthorizing an entity that has been out of existence for so long. Let me mention three important reasons. First, the Conference can save taxpayer dollars, in fact, millions of dollars. When it was in existence, it helped agencies implement many cost-saving procedures and make numerous recommendations to eliminate excessive litigation costs and long delays. 
   Just one agency alone, the Social Security Administration, estimated that the Conference's recommendation to change that agency's appeal process yielded approximately $85 million in savings. Indeed, Justice Stephen Breyer testified before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law about the ``huge'' savings to the public resulting from the Conference's recommendations. Justice Antonin Scalia likewise agreed that it was an enormous bargain. 
   Second, the Administrative Conference promoted innovation among agencies. For example, it convinced 24 agencies to use alternative dispute resolution for issues concerning the private sector. The Conference also spearheaded implementation of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, governing consumer product warranties. 
   The Conference played a major role in encouraging agencies to promulgate smarter regulations. It did this by working to improve the public's understanding and participation in the rulemaking process, promoting judicial review of agency regulations, and reducing regulatory burdens on the private sector. 
   Third, and perhaps most importantly, Congress needs the conference. Experience with the Congressional Review Act proves that there are limitations in Congress' ability to provide aggressive oversight of the regulatory process. 
   Congressional recognition of the Conference's significant contributions to the regulatory process is probably best evidenced by the fact that legislation assigning responsibilities to it continues to be introduced in nearly every Congress, including the current one. 
   The Congressional Research Service advises that reactivation of the Conference now would come at ``an opportune time,'' especially in light of efforts by the White House to augment its involvement in the regulatory process. 
   There are few entities that have enjoyed more bipartisan support than the Administrative Conference, and understandably so. It is all about promoting good government. 
   I commend my colleague, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, Chris Cannon of Utah, for his leadership in continuing to pursue reauthorization of the conference. 
   Last October, the House passed this bill on suspension by voice vote without amendment. The Senate late last month finally acted and passed the bill with a small amendment which essentially reauthorizes the Conference at a level of funding in the amount of $3.2 million. 
   I urge my colleagues to concur in the Senate amendment so we can send this bill to the President. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

Congress is doing its best to oversee these agencies, but we can use the assistance of this important conference, and I join my colleague in urging passage of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (DEBBIE SMITH REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5057, the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2008, authorizes the Attorney General to provide grants to States to assist them in reducing the enormous DNA evidence backlog in the Nation's laboratories. This important legislation will help to solve more crimes. It will help to solve more crimes more quickly, and perhaps most importantly, it will help to ensure that other crimes are prevented altogether. 
   Across our Nation, law enforcement officers and prosecutors have come to recognize the role that DNA evidence can play in solving crimes. As a result, ever-increasing numbers of DNA samples are being collected from crime scenes and offenders. There is no better example that demonstrates the effectiveness of DNA technology in solving crimes than that of Debbie Smith, the bill's namesake. 
   In 1989, Ms. Smith was kidnapped in her Virginia home and viciously attacked by a stranger who threatened her life should she report the attack. Nevertheless, with remarkable courage and determination, she reported the rape, and the crime lab preserved the DNA evidence of her attacker. Eventually, when the perpetrator was required to provide a DNA sample for a separate violent crime he was convicted for, a match was made to the sample collected from his attack on Ms. Smith, identifying him as her attacker. 
   Mr. Speaker, Debbie Smith and her husband, Rob, are here with us today, and I would like to ask them to stand so we can not only acknowledge their presence but thank them for their courage and determination and their work which has served as the driving force behind this legislation. 
   The remarkable law enforcement value of DNA evidence has unfortunately been limited by the enormous backlog of DNA samples still awaiting analysis. This means that crimes remain unsolved, violent offenders remain at large, and innocent individuals may be wrongfully imprisoned. H.R. 5057 would significantly increase the funding levels authorized for this important program and would also provide for important studies to further improve the system. H.R. 5057 also includes a number of other important initiatives that were adopted during the committee process.  
   Beginning in the 1990s, the Nation's crime labs were largely unprepared for the onslaught of requests for DNA services. Samples continue to pour into our Nation's crime labs at a pace faster than they can be processed. In order to address backlog problems, many States have begun outsourcing some of the work to accredited private laboratories. However, the FBI requires the crime labs perform in-house technical reviews of 100 percent of database samples from contract labs. While this requirement is certainly important with regard to forensic casework samples, it is found to be an onerous requirement with regard to the rather simple swabs that are taken from convicted offenders.     
   In fact, these requirements add substantial additional costs and further delay backlog reduction. Indeed, even Debbie Smith grant funds are expended on fulfilling these onerous requirements. 
   The National Institute of Justice has confirmed that ``the burden of these requirements has increased the backlog of convicted offender samples, cost millions of dollars, and forced crime laboratories to remove staff from analyzing rape kits and other forensic samples.'' 
   In order to address this issue, I offered a bipartisan provision with my colleague Representative Dan Lungren that would create a new National DNA Index System Advisory Board to ensure diverse representation of views, including State and local lab directors, officials from the FBI and DOJ, and other relevant stakeholders. 
   The board is directed to develop new standards governing the use of the Federal index that provide for the expedited uploading by State and local forensic labs of convicted offender profiles generated by private labs. These new standards are to be issued within 6 months. 
   In addition, the board is directed to look into the feasibility of other measures that would greatly expedite analysis and uploading, as well as backlog reduction. These include the feasibility and desirability of entering into agreements with private forensic labs to enable direct access to CODIS for the purpose of uploading DNA analyses of samples obtained from persons convicted of crimes; the feasibility and desirability of providing for more limited technical review audits of DNA analyses of samples prior to uploading such data into CODIS; and the feasibility and desirability permitting greater participation in the technical review process of contractor personnel. 
   I also authored another provision in this legislation that aims to increase the crime-solving abilities of our DNA databases. 
   Today, 12 States collect samples from murder and sex crime arrestees, including my home State of California. Four of these States, including California, collect or are preparing to collect samples from all felony arrestees. 
   Virginia was the first State to expand its database to include arrestees, and since then, the State has seen a total of 398 hits to their arrestee database, 74 of which were associated with sexual assault cases. For the first two months of this year alone, six hits to arrestees were made, the first hit coming just after the upload of the first 80 samples into the database. 
   A 2005 Chicago study examined the criminal activities of only eight individuals and found that 60 violent crimes could have been prevented, including 53 murders and rapes, if DNA was required for felony arrests. 
   In one example, Andre Crawford was charged with 11 murders and one attempted murder/aggravated sexual assault. If the State had required him to give a DNA sample during an earlier felony arrest, the subsequent 10 murders and one rape would not have occurred. 
   In another example, Mario Villa was charged with four rapes, linked by DNA to two other rapes, and a main suspect in an additional rape and two attempted rapes. If the State had required him to give a DNA sample during an earlier felony arrest, eight rapes or attempted rapes could have been prevented. 
   A recent Maryland study looked at the criminal histories for three offenders and found that 20 crimes, including rapes, sexual assaults, and murder could have been prevented had their DNA samples been required upon arrest. 
   Mr. Speaker, States who have moved to collect arrestee samples, such as Virginia and California, are greatly increasing the power of the national DNA network, while States with far narrower collection regimes are making the Federal database, which Congress has invested a substantial amount of money in, less sufficient. These States can still avail themselves of the Federal database and take full advantage of the expansive collection regimes of other States. 
   Therefore, a provision of this bill would provide incentives for States to follow the lead of the 12 States that currently collect samples from individuals arrested for or charged with murder and sex crimes. These States who would enact such an enhanced collection process would be eligible for a 10 percent increase in Federal formula law enforcement funds. 
   Since State backlogs are so huge and Federal funds remain limited, States have had to share a significant portion of the burden to fund these activities. However, State funding can fluctuate from year-to-year given the budget process and competing priorities. Some States, such as California, have penalty fee structures in place that provide a more stable and consistent funding stream. 
   Proposition 69 in California provided for a $1 penalty for every $10 or fraction thereof upon every fine, penalty and forfeiture levied on criminal offenses, including traffic expenses, but excluding parking. Over $40 million has been raised in California since its inception, and this has taken some of the burden off the Federal Government and the Debbie Smith grant funds available each year. 
   States should be encouraged to put such structures in place and for their ability to not rely as heavily on Federal resources. 
   Therefore, I authored a provision in this bill that would authorize the Attorney General to provide matching funds to those States that have implemented permanent funding mechanisms that generate funds, whether by fees or penalties, that are allocated by the State only for the purpose of analyzing DNA samples for law enforcement purposes. 
   Finally, this legislation includes a separate grant authorization for upgrading laboratory capability and infrastructure. And it provides supplemental grant incentives for States to fund their own DNA initiatives. 
   We have a comprehensive bill that will give lawmakers the best information for formulating policy, as well as provide law enforcement the most up-to-date tools and technology for solving crimes. 
   I'd like to commend Carolyn Maloney of New York for her leadership in authoring this bill. I also want to thank Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith of Texas, as well as Subcommittee Chairman Bobby Scott and Ranking Member Louie Gohmert for their leadership in making this a fully bipartisan effort. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, the reauthorization of this important program also provides us with an opportunity to investigate some important related issues. 
   From my work on this issue, I've learned that the Federal Government is unable to determine how many hits the Federal Government informs States about are actually followed up on by law enforcement. I think this data is very important for policymakers to have. 
   A few years ago, USA Today engaged in a comprehensive examination of DNA cases. In one case, the DNA of a convicted child molester matched DNA from an attempted sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl. Police did not contact the offender until after he had molested another 10-year-old child 6 months later. 
   In another case, the DNA of a career felon matched DNA left at a rape and abduction from 2001. At the time the offender was serving a prison sentence for assault. The police did not contact him until 8 months later, after he had been released from prison and only after being alerted by the rape victim, who encountered the offender by chance while walking in a local park. 
   These are two examples of situations where there was a match made in the Federal database. States were informed about it, but no action was taken, with tragic consequences. Therefore, I have authored a provision in this bill that would direct the Department of Justice Inspector General to investigate and report on how many CODIS database hits are actually followed up on by law enforcement, how many of those hits are ultimately brought to the attention of a prosecutor and how many go to trial. 
   Importantly, the report will also shed additional light on the factors that play in the event that matches were not followed up on. In particular, we asked the IG to determine the reason why matches were not pursued accordingly, and to determine the resulting impact on the criminal justice system, namely, whether other crimes were committed that could have been prevented if the matches were pursued accordingly.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5464, the ``A Child is Missing Alert and Recovery Center Act,'' helps address the terrifying experience of when a family member or friend goes missing. 
   Under current law, there are programs such as Amber Alert to help missing children who are abducted or become victims of foul play. But these programs do not extend to situations where a child or elderly person becomes missing in other more innocent ways. H.R. 5464 fills this gap and authorizes money for annual grants to the A Child is Missing Alert and Recovery Center. This national nonprofit program provides assistance to local law enforcement throughout the country in all situations of missing persons, not only those involved in criminal activity. 
   The center helps when a small child fails to come home from school or a grandmother suffering from Alzheimer's disease walks out of her home in the middle of the night. When the terrifying event of a missing person is reported to the police, the responding police officer can call the center, which operates 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Based on information from the call, the center quickly prepares a recorded message that includes a description of the missing person, along with a location where the person was last seen. Within minutes, the center sends this recording to thousands of phones within a radius of the last known location. This activity can save not only precious lives, but also critically needed enforcement resources that would otherwise be spent in extended searches for missing persons. 
   The bill before us today will make a significant contribution to the protection of children and vulnerable adults throughout the United States. I want to thank the sponsor of this bill, Ron Klein of Florida, for his leadership on this very important issue. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution commemorates the life and work of Thurgood Marshall on the 100th anniversary of his birth, which was July 2, 1908. 
   I commend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for his leadership in allowing us to recognize an American whose life work was marked by the principles of justice, equality, and freedom, and I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation. 
   It is hard to know where to begin in reciting Justice Marshall's accomplishments. While best known for breaking the color barrier on the Supreme Court, Justice Marshall is honored because he was an expert jurist who worked on behalf of all Americans. Born 100 years ago in Baltimore, Maryland, and with just one generation between him and slavery, Thurgood Marshall experienced its legacy of segregation and racist hatred in his own time. 
   Rather than allow that legacy to defeat him, however, he dedicated his life to removing its stain from our society. His courageous determination propelled him to success in the classroom, in the courtroom, and on the bench. 
   When he was denied admission on the basis of race to the University of Maryland's School of Law, he attended Howard University's School of Law and graduated first in his class in 1933. 
   When he challenged the separate-but-equal status quo in his capacity as legal director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, from 1940 through 1961, he won 29 out of 32 cases before the Supreme Court, the most Supreme Court cases won by any attorney. 
   Later, as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1961 to 1965, he would author 112 opinions, with not one of them being overturned. 
   Thurgood Marshall would continue his service to this country in two very distinguished capacities. He served as the first African American Solicitor General, from 1965 until 1967. That year, he was appointed associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, the first African American Justice, where he served until he retired in 1991. 
   While Justice Marshall is best known for his lead role in the cases culminating in the 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which laid the foundation for the dismantling of Jim Crow segregation, he fought racial segregation in every aspect of society, and this pursuit for a fair and just America made him one of the Nation's best advocates of civil rights. 
   In Chambers v. Florida, he challenged a biased criminal justice system. In Shelley v. Kraemer, he challenged discrimination in housing. And in Smith v. Allwright, he challenged inequitable voting practices. 
   Finally, in commemorating Justice Marshall, we acknowledge not just a good lawyer and judge, but a good man who reminded us that ``in recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings, we pay ourselves the highest tribute.'' 
   Thurgood Marshall should be remembered as an individual who raised the morale, spirit and conscience of this country and who tirelessly fought social injustice throughout his life. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution that calls upon us to recognize the important legacy of Thurgood Marshall, a man who challenged and inspired Americans to live up to the principles and ideals on which this country was founded. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   The Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant, or Byrne/JAG Program, is named after Edward Byrne, a New York City police officer killed by a violent drug gang 20 years ago. 
   The Byrne/JAG Program is the only source of Federal funding for multi-jurisdictional efforts to prevent and fight crime. The funding is used by States and local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime and to improve the criminal justice system. 
   Specific uses include law enforcement, prosecution, and court programs; crime prevention and education programs; community-based programs; drug treatment, planning, and evaluation efforts; and crime victim and witness programs. 
   Simply put, this program enables States to employ all aspects of fighting crime, rather than simply using the so-called ``get tough'' approach limited to making more arrests and making sentences longer. 
   Nationwide, the program has resulted in major innovations in crime control, including drug courts, gang prevention strategies, and prisoner reentry programs, all of which provide proven and highly effective crime prevention. 
   In turn, these innovations demonstrate that the best crime policy incorporates programs that help at-risk youth avoid criminal behavior and that prepare prisoners for reentry into society so they have meaningful and productive alternatives to crime when they return home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the brave men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration on the occasion of its 35th anniversary. The DEA's employees include not only the special agents, but intelligence analysts, diversion investigators, program analysts, forensic chemists, attorneys and administrative support staff, together with task force officers and vetted foreign officials. These men and women work tirelessly to hunt down and bring to justice the drug trafficking cartels that profit by poisoning our citizens with dangerous narcotics. 
   The DEA and its dedicated officers have served our Nation with courage, vision and determination, protecting all Americans from the scourge of drug trafficking, drug abuse and related violence. It is fitting that we recognize their accomplishments and express our gratitude for their service. 
   Throughout its 35 years, the DEA has combated the evolving trends of drug trafficking by aggressively targeting both domestic and international organizations involved in the unlawful growing, manufacturing and distribution of such substances as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, Ecstasy and controlled prescription drugs. These successes are unfortunately not without tragic costs. 
   Over its history, more than 75 DEA employees and task force members have given their lives in the line of duty, with many others wounded. During the time I served with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, I had many, many occasions to work with DEA officers. I saw the professionalism of their work, their determination, their bravery and courage. 
   For some time I worked on the investigation into the capture, murder and torture of Enrique Camarena and, along with my colleagues, worked to investigate and bring to justice some of those that were responsible for the death of that courageous agent. So I have great personal regard for the many employees of the DEA, their proud history and the great work they do. 
   It is a commitment to duty almost too great to ask of anyone, yet these dedicated men and women of the DEA and their families face the risks and endure the hardships to make our Nation safer for all of us. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a well-deserved tribute to the DEA on the occasion of its 35th anniversary. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, just to conclude on the legislation recognizing the 35th anniversary of the DEA, I recall very well the loss of two DEA agents in the City of San Marino, very close to my district, back when I was with the U.S. Attorney. They were involved in a buy-bust. It was a small amount of drugs, a small amount of money, I think amounting to some $35,000. These two agents, one was killed in a shoot-out with the drug dealers, the other shot at point-blank range execution style when these young drug dealers decided they would rather keep the $35,000 and kill two people for it. 
   This is the kind of risk the DEA agents face every day. We're extraordinarily grateful to have such courageous men and women working within the agency. I urge the passage of the recognition bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (IN MEMORY OF U.S. ARMY SPECIALIST CARLA JANE STEWART -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of my constituent, Army Specialist Carla Jane Stewart of the 250th Transportation Company based in El Monte, California. Specialist Stewart was killed in action on January 28, 2007 in Tallil, Iraq, when her military convoy vehicle overturned. 
   Carla was born in La Canada Flintridge, California to an Armenian American family. Her father, Edmond Aprahamian, a former Marine, and her mother, Emmy Aprahamian, are proud parents who will cherish the memory of their daughter who chose to enlist in the U.S. Army at the age of 35. After completing her basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, she told her family and friends that if her unit was not deployed to Iraq, that she would volunteer to go. As it turned out, the 250th was deployed to Iraq last year and is due to return home in March. 
   Carla learned mechanical drafting alongside her father. Her family and friends have spoken with reverence of her distinctive commitment to duty, her dedication to her unit, her love of country and family. According to her father, Carla always had a smile. She was a small woman; her unit called her Stewart Little, but she was gutsy and in every other way giant. 
   It takes a special commitment to volunteer for military service in a time of war, and even greater devotion to country to do so at the age of 35, a time when most of us have put aside thoughts of abandoning the comfort of home to take up arms in the fight for liberty and freedom. Specialist Carla Jane Stewart did both, and on behalf of the United States House of Representatives, we honor her memory.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (CONGRESS SHOULD DUST OFF OVERSIGHT PLAN FROM 30 YEARS AGO -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, in December 2005, we learned that the Bush administration was using the National Security Agency, the NSA, to eavesdrop on Americans on U.S. soil without a warrant or judicial oversight, in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   Over a year later, Congress has yet to address this issue, and the NSA's secret surveillance program has continued unabated. Just last week the administration continued its unilateral approach, announcing that notwithstanding its protestations last year, that it could not possibly allow the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to oversee the NSA program; it would now submit to the court's jurisdiction, but not tell the Congress how the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would oversee the program or why its policies have changed. 
   When Members of Congress questioned the Attorney General and the National Intelligence Director regarding this shift in policy, both officials refused to provide information regarding the nature of the administration's new policy in this area. 
   Indeed, we have no idea whether the administration is now seeking warrants on an individualized basis or broad programmatic approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. 
   Congressional silence in this area and others has had other repercussions. Earlier this month Congress was again caught by surprise when we learned that the President has claimed potentially sweeping new powers to open Americans' mail without a court warrant. 
   Again, the administration could obtain a warrant, and quickly, from a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge, but has chosen not to submit this effort to court supervision. Interestingly, the developments over the last year bear a striking resemblance to events that occurred some 30 years ago, when a series of troubling reports  began appearing in the press concerning domestic intelligence activities and surveillance of political activities of U.S. citizens. 
   These revelations and others revealed by the Watergate scandal convinced lawmakers that Congress had been too permissive and trusting, failing to carry out its oversight responsibilities over the executive branch. 
   In response, a U.S. Senate committee was formed to investigate intelligence activities by the government. The United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, commonly referred to as the Church committee, after its Senate chairman, issued more than 50,000 pages of reports in what is considered the most comprehensive review of intelligence activities in the country. 
   Ironically, the reports included sections on mail opening as well as the National Security Agency and fourth amendment rights. In rebuffing recent congressional requests for information on the current NSA program, the administration has made the argument that the NSA surveillance program is too sensitive to be shared with Congress, even to Members in the classified setting. 
   When these same concerns were weighed by the Church committee in 1975, the opposite result was reached, with the committee refusing to neglect its oversight responsibility merely because their work would be harder. In fact, the extensive oversight and the substantial record generated by the Church committee inspired the creation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. 
   Both have worked effectively to ensure that the President has the tools necessary to thwart attacks while ensuring respect for the civil liberties of Americans and the adherence to the rule of law. FISA, as it is called, has provided a measure of oversight over foreign intelligence activities on U.S. soil, and with it the confidence of the American people. 
   This administration, however, has undermined that trust by circumventing FISA. Congress should follow the example of the Church committee, by vigorously examining the NSA surveillance program and determining what legislative action is necessary. The administration should cooperate and work with Congress as we engage in our oversight responsibilities, and make the case for statutory change if revisions are required to meet new challenges in the war on terror. 
   If, however, the administration rejects congressional oversight in this area and continues to defy requests for information, Congress should seek other means of redress. I have introduced bipartisan legislation with Representative JEFF FLAKE that can serve as a basis for examining these issues and restoring the rule of law. 
   The NSA Oversight Act, H.R. 11, would reiterate existing law requiring court approval for the surveillance of Americans on American soil, and would provide greater oversight of NSA's surveillance activity. Our legislation also makes some key changes to FISA in order to streamline and expedite the process in response to the administration's argument that the current framework was too cumbersome. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Congress to fully examine this issue, step up its oversight responsibility, and take legislative action if necessary.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (CELEBRATING EARTH DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago we celebrated Earth Day, a holiday that began in 1970, when Senator Gaylord Nelson recognized the growing public movement that we now know as environmentalism, and called on environmentally concerned citizens to join him in cities around the world to demonstrate, teach, and learn about preserving the world's natural wonders. 
   Speaking on that occasion, Senator Nelson said of the first Earth Day, ``It may be the birth date of a new American ethic that rejects the frontier philosophy that the continent was put here for our plunder and accepts the idea that even urbanized, affluent, mobile societies are interdependent with the fragile life-sustaining systems of the air, the water, and the land.'' 
   Today, we have accomplished many of the goals of the first environmentalists: Cleaning up rivers so polluted by industrial waste that they burned, and air polluted with lead, mercury, and sulfur. But there are still many pollutants that we have not eliminated, and we have come to realize that pollution is not a local problem, but a global one as well.     
   We alter the environment with factories and refineries, but also through agriculture, fishing and mining. In many ways we are lucky. Drawing on our long experience of environmental remediation and policy-making, we know some of the solutions to the endemic, international problem of climate change. 
   This is a problem of such scope and depth that it can seem daunting at times. But if I were ever tempted to retreat from confronting this problem because of its size, I need only look at my daughter Alexa, who is here with me today, and my son Eli and realize that this is not a problem I am willing to leave to them. 
   But Earth Day was first a day for awareness, and I would like to continue that tradition today by taking a short break from the important debates we had earlier today, and celebrate some of the small steps people around the country are taking to reduce their impact on the world we all share. 
   Some Americans have found that the wind passing over their farms and ranches is as valuable a resource as the oil beneath the farm or ranch once was, and have replaced their oil wells with windmills. 
   Some have jumped on board in the most American of ways--by starting a business. The green-tech sector is growing by leaps and bounds with companies developing technologies for solar, wind and geothermal energy, biofuels, carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency, smart electric grids, and low-carbon agriculture, to name a few. 
   Some have replaced their windows and washing machines with more energy-efficient ones, and installed extra insulation to reduce their heating bills. They have discovered that just changing the light bulbs to an energy-efficient model will reduce their electric bill dramatically and save energy. 
   Some companies now offer transit passes and bike racks to encourage their employees to commute efficiently, and many employees are taking up that challenge. 
   But Earth Day is also a day to look forward to see what we can do next. 
   Many Americans will install solar panels, solar water heaters, attic fans and geothermal heat pumps in our homes to reduce our dependence on the power company. Many Americans will buy houses made of renewable materials and cars that run on biofuels. Those same cars will plug into a grid during the day, providing a buffer against blackouts and brownouts. 
   Other Americans will enjoy public transportation that reaches further out into our suburbs and links our communities more tightly together. And still other Americans will work for companies that build green technologies and sell them all over the world to countries desperate for an answer to their polluted water and air, and mounting energy needs. 
   These are the efforts that we must begin today so we can see the fruits of our labor tomorrow. But today, we must all remember that Earth Day is an opportunity to teach our children to respect the planet we live on. By taking them hiking or fishing or camping or bicycling, we introduce them to a world of mountains and forests and beaches that they will continue to enjoy and appreciate for the rest of their lives. We protect the environment so our children will have a healthy planet to live on, and we teach our children to be environmentalists so that their children will have the same healthy home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, one of the most important findings of the 9/11 Commission was that the failure to anticipate the attack was a failure of imagination. The idea of such an assault was so abhorrent it was difficult to think about. 
   We cannot know for sure what form a future attack may take, but as we struggle to prevent it, we must be willing to consider the most horrific possibility, a nuclear or biological attack on an American city. The idea of 100,000 people killed in an instant is an idea too terrible to contemplate. But to ignore this threat, or fail to act upon it with the greatest urgency is to be grossly, criminally, negligent with our Nation's security. 
   Osama Bin Laden has termed the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction ``a religious duty.'' He has called for an American Hiroshima. This is his Mein Kampf. 
   H.R. 1 includes many of the best ideas from around the country on how to combat nuclear terrorism. But the one fundamental idea is, we must prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or material because once it is acquired, it may be too late. This bill will strengthen the Global Threat Reduction Program and accelerate the global clean-out of the stockpiles around the world. And I urge everyone's support.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, which is long overdue and I commend the Speaker and other members of the Leadership for making this a priority. 
   One of the most important findings of the 9/11 Commission was that the failure to anticipate the attack was a ``failure of imagination.'' The idea of such an assault was so abhorrent that it was difficult to think about. We cannot know for sure what form a future attack may take, but as we struggle to prevent it, we must be willing to consider the most horrific possibility: a nuclear or biological attack on an American city. The idea of 100,000 people killed in an instant, is an idea too terrible to  contemplate, but to ignore this threat, or fail to act upon it with the greatest urgency, is to be grossly, criminally neglegent with our Nation's security. Osama bin Laden has termed the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction ``a religious duty.'' He has called for an American Hiroshima. This is his Mein Kampf. 
   H.R. 1 includes many of the best ideas from around the country on how to combat nuclear terrorism. But the one fundamental idea is that we must prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or material, because once they are acquired, it may be too late. 
   Programs throughout the government are struggling to secure nuclear weapons and materials around the world, and prevent nuclear trafficking. But there is little overall organization of these efforts. That's why our bill establishes a Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism in the Office of the President. The Coordinator will formulate and coordinate a comprehensive strategy for U.S. nonproliferation activities, oversee all nonproliferation and nuclear terrorism prevention programs, and advise the President and congress on the progress that each program is making. 
   To assist the Coordinator, this bill establishes a bipartisan blue-ribbon commission to assess the current state of U.S. nonproliferation and nuclear terrorism prevention activities, develop a clear, comprehensive strategy, and identify the areas in which accelerated effort is most urgent. 
   Currently, the President must certify that Russia is meeting certain conditions before authorizing the release of Cooperative Threat Reduction funds. This has caused delays in shielding vulnerable weapons when the President was unable to fully certify Russia. This bill removes those restrictions, granting the President more flexibility in negotiations with Russia. It also gives the President the flexibility to direct Cooperative Threat Reduction funds outside of Russia when necessary. 
   The bill will strengthen the Global Threat Reduction Program, to accelerate the global clean-out of the most vulnerable stockpiles of nuclear material. At the current pace, cleaning up the most vulnerable nuclear sites around the globe will take more than a decade. Given AQ's desire for these weapons, how can we be assured that we will have this much time--we can't. 
   The bill also urges the President to expand the Proliferation Security Initiative, an international program to intercept weapons of mass destruction shipments. It encourages joint training exercises, particularly with China and Russia, to strengthen our cooperation on security issues, and encourage them to adopt strict standards for WMD security. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 broached the idea of international standards for securing nuclear material, but was brief on the specifics. Now the U.S. must take the lead in establishing those standards, through organizations like the Proliferation Security Initiative. 
   I hope everyone can support this long-awaited overhaul to our anti-nuclear-terrorism efforts.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership. 
   Over the last 2 years, I have worked with my Republican colleague JEFF FLAKE of Arizona to ensure that the government has all the tools necessary to pursue al Qaeda and all the other terrorists who would seek to harm our country while ensuring that the requirement of court approval of surveillance of Americans on American soil is met. 
   I am pleased that the committee has included many of the items we proposed, including reiterating FISA's exclusivity, providing robust oversight reporting, requiring FISA Court involvement when U.S. persons are involved, and clarifying that the interception of foreign-to-foreign communications does not require a court order. 
   To address a concern raised by Mr. Flake, our language makes clear that a court order would not be required for electronic surveillance directed at the acquisition of communications between persons that are not known to be U.S. persons and are reasonably believed to be located outside the U.S., without respect to whether the communication passes through the U.S. or the surveillance device is located in the U.S. 
   We have also placed additional safeguards to ensure this section is not abused and used to acquire communications of U.S. persons.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (WHY THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE MATTERS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, tonight I plan to speak on the anniversary of the Armenian genocide; but before I do, I want to join my colleagues in expressing my sincere condolence at the passing of Juanita Millender-McDonald, someone who in my very first days of Congress impressed me as a courageous, intelligent, dedicated public servant who, every time I went to her for help on an issue in her committee or outside her committee, was generous with her time and her energy, always ready to help, always of good cheer, and someone that I think enjoyed the unanimous and bipartisan respect of everyone in this body. Her memory will be cherished; her presence will be deeply missed. 
   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 92nd anniversary of the start of the Armenian genocide. In January, I introduced a resolution in the House, along with my colleagues, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Knollenberg and Mr. Radanovich, that would recognize the Armenian genocide. This resolution should be passed. Ghazaros Kademian is one reason why. 
   Ghazaros Kademian was just 6 years old when his family was forced into exile by Ottoman Turks bent on annihilating the Armenian people. His father was murdered by Turk gendarmes, and the rest of his family was forced to flee on foot to Kirkuk, where his mother died from cold and hunger. He was separated from his siblings and orphaned. 
   Mr. Kademian's story is terrible, but is not remarkable. Over a million and a half Armenians were murdered in the first genocide of the last century as the Ottoman Empire used the cloak of war to wipe out a people it considered alien or disloyal. This mammoth crime was well known at the time. Newspapers of the day were filled with stories about the murder of the Armenians. ``Appeal to Turkey to Stop Massacres'' headlined the New York Times on April 28, 1915, just as the killing began. By October 7 of that year, the Times reported that 800,000 Armenians had been slain in cold blood in Asia Minor. In mid-December of 1915, the Times spoke of a million Armenians killed or in exile. 
   Thousands of pages of evidence documenting the atrocities rest in our own National Archives. Prominent citizens of the day, including America's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, and Britain's Lord Bryce, reported on the massacres in great detail. Morgenthau was appalled at what he would later call sadistic orgies of rape, torture, and murder. ``When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a whole race. They understood this well and made no particular attempt to conceal the fact.'' 
   Even those who most ardently advocated sweeping the murder of a million and a half people under the rug of history have conceded that the vast majority of historians accept the Armenian genocide as historic fact. And how could they not? For it was the Government of Turkey that in early 1919 held a number of well-publicized trials of some of the young Turk leaders and executed the Keimal Bey, governor of Diarbekir, specifically for his role as one of the Ottoman Empire's most savage persecutors of the Armenian people. The trials were as widely covered in the American press as was the genocide itself. 
   So if the facts are not in dispute, why are so many nations complicit in modern Turkey's strenuous efforts to deny  the genocide ever took place? First, opponents argue that recognizing the unpleasant facts of the genocide and of the mass murder risk alienating an important alliance with Turkey. There is no question that Turkey is bitterly opposed to recognition and is threatening our military and commercial relationship, including access to the Incirlik air base, but Turkey has made similar threats to other nations in the past only to retreat from them and the European Union's insistence that Ankara recognize the crimes of its Ottoman's forebears before Turkey is admitted to the EU has not dimmed Turkish enthusiasm for joining the EU. 
   If Turkish relations with the U.S. do suffer, it is far more likely that the genocide recognition will be a pretext. The Bush administration has done such a poor job managing our relations with Turkey over the last 6 years that we have already seen the limits of the U.S.-Turkish alliance tested and found lacking. 
   During the run-up to the war in Iraq, Turkey denied us permission to bring in ground forces from its soil, allowing the Saddam Fedeyeen to melt away and form the basis of a now persistent insurgency. Oddly enough, critics of recognition decry it as pandering to the victims, but are only too happy to pander to the sensibilities of an inconsistent ally, and one that has shown no qualms about accusing the U.S. of genocide in Iraq. 
   Second, opponents take issue with the timing of the resolution and argue that Turkey is making progress with recognizing the dark chapters of its history. This claim lost all credibility when Orhan Pamuk, Turkey's Nobel Prize winning author, was brought up on charges of ``insulting Turkishness'' for alluding to the genocide, and Turkish Armenian publisher Hrant Dink was gunned down outside his office in Istanbul earlier this year.  
   Tomorrow marks the 92nd Anniversary of start of the Armenian Genocide. In January, I introduced a resolution in the House that would recognize the Armenian Genocide. It should be passed. Ghazaros Kademian is one reason why.

Yet some opponents go even further, such as a former Ambassador to Turkey who argued that the time may never be right for America to comment ``on another's history or morality.'' Such a ludicrous policy would condemn Congress to silence on a host of human rights abuses around the world. After more than ninety years and with only a few survivors left, if the time is not right now to recognize the Armenian Genocide, when will it be? 
   But the most pernicious argument against recognition is the claim that speaking the truth would harm relations with Turkey ``for no good reason.'' How can we claim the moral authority to decry the genocide in Darfur, as we must, if we are unwilling to deplore other genocides when it would inconvenience an ally? Elie Wiesel has described the denial of genocide as the final stage of genocide--a double killing. If you don't think he's right, talk to Ghazaros Kademian. But you had better hurry.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great appreciation and admiration for Hoover High School student Lauren Arana, who saved her friend's life earlier this year. I am truly proud to have Lauren, who is now a 10th grade student from Glendale, as a constituent of mine. 
   On May 14, Lauren received a text message from a friend of hers in Nebraska who said that she was going to commit suicide. Lauren did not hesitate for a second in responding to this call for help. She immediately took the initiative to try and contact her friend's mother, and when she was unsuccessful, she contacted her friend's school in Sioux City, Nebraska. 
   Upon receiving Lauren's call, an assistant principal stepped into action  and went to the troubled student's home, where he found her with a knife to her neck and having already consumed antifreeze. Thankfully, due to Lauren's swift actions, the assistant principal was able to intervene in time to save her friend's life. This is a remarkable story, and demonstrates Lauren's extraordinary character. 
   Youth suicide is a tragic problem plaguing our Nation. It is the third leading cause of death for 15-to 24-year-olds and the sixth leading cause for 5- to 14-year-olds. Lauren's heroic intervention is a perfect example of how anyone should react to such a call for help. We should all learn from this story which, thankfully, avoided a tragic ending.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCHIFF. (NUCLEAR FORENSICS AND ATTRIBUTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the chairman of the full committee for his leadership on this issue and for his indulgence of my perseverance. I'm very grateful that the bill moved so quickly and for his support of it. I also want to thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, Science and Technology, JIM LANGEVIN, for his leadership, and also thank the Ranking Member Mr. McCaul. I really appreciate all of your help. It's been a bipartisan effort from the very beginning, and that's the way it should be. 
   Through this legislation, we're taking an important step to prevent nuclear terrorism, and I appreciate, again, all of the work of the committee and staff. 
   Nuclear terrorism is the preeminent threat of our time. Many countries around the world now have access to technology that was once the realm of only a few. Just last week it was reported that an advanced nuclear weapon design was found on a computer connected to one nuclear smuggling ring, and that was the one mentioned by my colleague, Mr. Langevin. Illicit nuclear material has been intercepted in transit many times since the Cold War, and the material we catch is probably just a small fraction of the total amount trafficked. 
   The President and Congress have recognized that a nuclear attack on the United States is the most important national security threat facing our country. In the ongoing effort to strengthen our border, this Congress has made it more difficult to smuggle a nuclear weapon into the United States. But with thousands of miles of borders to secure against weapons just a few feet in size, we cannot simply play defense at the border. We must also prevent the weapons and materials that lie in storage around the world from falling into the wrong hands. 
   During the Cold War, we deterred the Soviet Union with the threat of nuclear retaliation. Unfortunately, the decentralized flexible terror networks that we face today are not as easily deterred. Osama bin Laden has termed the acquisition of mass destruction a religious duty. And there is no question that using such a weapon against America is consistent with the group's contempt for human life. 
   The Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act is designed to help shut down trade in nuclear material by deterring those parts of the trafficking network susceptible to deterrence. If we identify the source of nuclear material, then when we intercept it in transit, we can hold responsible those who created it and shared it with terrorists or rogue nations. In the aftermath of an attack, God forbid, this capability would also help determine the identity of those responsible. Nations, companies, and individuals could be dissuaded from proliferating knowing that their malfeasance could be traced back to them. 
   The first part of this bill expands our ability to determine the source of nuclear material by strengthening our nuclear forensics capability. Nuclear forensics is the study of the chemistry and physical properties of nuclear material that give it a particular signature. Scientists and engineers skilled in the field can also use information from the packaging and accompanying materials to pinpoint a source. 
   But acquiring, analyzing, characterizing, and attributing samples is a complicated process. Though we have the capability to perform each step, our expertise is split between the Departments of Energy, Defense, Homeland Security, and State. 
   This bill authorizes a national technical nuclear forensics center in the Department of Homeland Security. The center will coordinate the various agencies and ensure that a sufficient combined response is present whenever nuclear material is intercepted or used in a weapon. It will also advance the science of nuclear forensics bringing in new radiochemists and physicists into a rapidly aging workforce and funding research on new methods to identify materials from around the world. 
   But this bill also has another purpose. As with fingerprints or DNA, the strength of nuclear forensics depends on the strength of our database. Nuclear material can come from many nations, some friendly and some unfriendly.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. That will be the last of my perseverance, Mr. Chairman. 
   The strength of nuclear forensics depends on the strength of our database. That material can come from many nations, some friendly, some unfriendly, and the individual recipes are closely-held secrets. However, little of the information needed for nuclear forensics is of direct use to our adversaries, and in the case of our allies, the risk of not sharing the data and failing to discover a security breach is much greater than sharing the information. 
   Thus, the bill asked the President to negotiate agreements with other nations to share information on the make-up of their nuclear materials. We can come to bilateral agreements with our allies or sign multi-lateral treaties through the IAEA. We can even begin the database with just civilian reactor materials where information security is less of an issue. But we must get started now. 
   The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center should play a key role in the negotiations since in the end, the data we obtain must be the data that the experts need. Nuclear terrorism is a threat of paramount danger  and uncertain probability. As communications and transportation bring us ever closer to our friends, they bring our enemies closer as well. This modest but effective bill will help keep us safe as we navigate the years ahead. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman Thompson for his leadership and the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee for their assistance and sponsorship, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the chairman, and I'll be brief at the outset and intend to reserve our time for the conclusion of the debate. 
   But we're here again to really talk about what the priorities of the Nation are and the competing philosophies of the bipartisan majority and the small minority that has taken to the floor here today. 
   The value of the bipartisan majority is to invest in this country, to make sure that what we have been able to enjoy, the struggle and the sacrifice that our parents and their parents made, is a tradition that we continue in the sense that we want to leave an America that is stronger and that is safer than the one we inherited. 
   And efforts like this, to cut our investment in law enforcement, to cut our investment in trying to keep our communities safe, our police officers safe, are very shortsighted. 
   Now, we all believe that the budget has to be wrestled to the ground in the sense that over the last 6 years my friends in the Republican majority borrowed and spent into oblivion. We now have a massive national debt. As a result of that fiscal responsibility, we've got a problem on our hands that we need to wrestle to the ground, and we are. In the majority we have instituted pay-as-you-go rules, something that the prior majority, my friends in the GOP, were unwilling to do. That has been along the philosophy of when you're in a hole, stop digging. So we've stopped the digging. 
   At the same time, we can't stop investing in our country, we can't stop investing in our future, we can't stop investing in the security of our neighborhoods; and that's what this bill is about. 
   The cuts that my friends in the opposition are proposing here today have only one merit, and that is they're indiscriminate. They cut the top priorities along with the lower priorities, all at the same time. 
   My friends in the, not the minority party, because frankly, we have a great many Republicans who have joined us. All the Republicans on the Appropriations Committee support the work product. But the minority that's speaking here on the floor today isn't willing to do the hard work and to say this is a high priority; we can't afford to cut it. This is a lower priority; maybe we can trim this here. No, they're not willing to do that. They're willing to say let's cut everything equally, the essentials with the non-essentials. And let's not raise the revenue we need to support our law enforcement by ending corporate welfare. They've been unwilling to do that. 
   These are some of the philosophical differences we'll hear during the debate on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm going to reserve the balance of my time and look forward to an opportunity to address the House in a few minutes.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to make just two quick points in response to my friend's argument that these are not real cuts, these are somehow imaginary cuts, and the illustration he gave of the allowance he gives his child. Two things, one factual and one philosophical. 
   On the factual side, my friend's across-the-board cuts will mean very real, very direct, very incontrovertible cuts, less money now than the year before in many vital programs; not every program, but many vital programs including some I will point out in my friend's home State of Georgia, things that law enforcement in Georgia and around the country care a great deal about. Real cuts. We will talk about some of them. 
   We can't hide behind an across-the-board amendment and say, we are not really cutting anything, because you are. Basically what you are telling your child in the allowance hypothetical is we are going to cut how much we are going to spend on your education, a real cut. We are going to cut how much we are going to spend on your health care, a real cut. Let's hope you don't get sick. 
   One of my friends in the opposition, in support of this same amendment, last week said, American families are just going to have to make the decision, we can't afford to have each of our kids go to college. Maybe we will have to choose one child who won't go to college. Well, philosophically the bipartisan majority of this House doesn't accept that for America. We believe every child who is bright enough to go to college ought to go to college. The fact that his parents may be rich or poor shouldn't matter. And we are willing to make the investments in our colleges to make sure that no parent has to say this child can go to college and this one can't because we are not willing to make the investment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   A couple quick points. Of course we hear the mantra from my friends on the other side of this bill's representing a tax increase when there is no tax increase in this bill. We have now heard the same statement applied to the farm bill. There is no tax increase in the farm bill. 
   My friends seem to think that the corporate welfare that we provide, if you cut corporate welfare, that somehow we are increasing taxes on average Americans; if we do away with offshore tax savings, that we are somehow doing away with the income of ordinary Americans. But I think ordinary Americans would rather have the investment in our law enforcement. They would rather have safe streets than safe shelters overseas. 
   And one point I wanted to make with respect to a comment that my friend from Georgia made. He said the departments here aren't even asking for the resources we are providing them. None of the agencies want the resources that they would be provided in this bill. 
   Maybe my friend represents a very different district than my own, but I have never had police officers from my cities of Burbank, Glendale, or Pasadena come to me and say, Congressman, we have too much money for cops. We have too many cops on the street. We don't want any of your help. Thank you, but no thank you. 
   Now, maybe things are quite a bit better in Georgia. Maybe there is no crime in Georgia, and maybe your police departments are saying, we don't need vests, we don't need cops, we are doing great, thank you, but no thank you. 
   That is not what I am hearing. What I am hearing is they have got greater responsibilities in the war on terror. They have got higher gang violence. They need the resources. They need the people on patrol. That is what I am hearing. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for pointing out the cuts to the FBI and other law enforcement that would be occasioned by this amendment and others that my friends are offering. 
   The cuts go deeper. They cross the board in terms of everything that the Justice Department does. My friend's amendment would cut funding for victims of child abuse. My friend's amendment would cut funding for the COPS program. It would cut funding for violence against women, victims of violence against women. But let's hone in on a very specific, because my friend says, well, these aren't really cuts. Let me talk about one program specifically that my friend's amendment makes a very real cut to, not artificial, not Orwellian, not imaginary, and that's bulletproof vests. 
   Back in 2003, the Attorney General announced the Body Armor Safety Initiative in response to the failure of bullet-resistant vests. One in particular worn by a police officer in Pennsylvania was discovered that the xylan vests, when they were old and used, weren't stopping bullets the way they were supposed to, and so the Justice Department started a program to replace these vests. 
   The COPS program funds an effort to provide vests for local police departments. That program has been very successful. In my friend's home State of Georgia, for example, he can pick any city, Alpharetta City, the program bought 40 new bulletproof vests for the police officers in Alpharetta City. Across Georgia, there were 1,100 of these xylan vests replaced that needed to be replaced. 
   In the new COPS program that we're funding here, Alpharetta City got 25 new bulletproof vests. Cherokee County got 293 bulletproof vests. Cobb County got 566 bulletproof vests. DeKalb County got another 240. Georgia, in total, just in this particular year, I think 2005, got 4,789 new bulletproof vests. 
   My friend's amendment makes a real cut to the number of bulletproof vests we can provide cops, not a decrease in the rate of increase, but makes a real cut. Under my friend's amendment, the cops in Georgia are going to get fewer bulletproof vests than they would get without it and than they got last year. 
   Now, I can't go home to my district and tell the cops of Burbank, Pasadena and Glendale that I cut their funding for their bulletproof vests, but the indiscriminate nature of this amendment means that is exactly what it would do in my district, in my friend's district in Georgia. 
   My friend from Colorado, who has an amendment, I'm sure, for another across-the-board cut, Fort Collins, Colorado, they got five vests. Greeley City got 53 bulletproof vests. Longmont City got 28 bulletproof vests. Colorado, in this particular year, got 3,900 new vests. These across-the-board cuts mean fewer bulletproof vests for cops in Colorado. 
   My friend's amendment from Ohio, with even bigger across-the-board cuts, would be devastating in Ohio. Ohio, in this program, got 5,200 new vests. So what is that going to mean? A 6 percent cut. That means, what, several hundred fewer bulletproof vests? Well, that may not mean much to us here, but if you're one of those cops that can't get their vest replaced and that vest isn't going to work so well against one of those assault rifles or one of those other heavy-caliber munitions they're facing out there on the street, it means a heck of a lot. 
   And I don't know about my friend from Georgia, but I don't have the cops from my district coming to me and saying, we've got more money than we need. We don't need bulletproof vests. We don't need interoperable communications equipment. A lot of the cops out in the County of Los Angeles can't talk to each other because their communications equipment won't talk to each other. We fund that here. My friend's amendment cuts that here. 
   How can my friends, not on the bipartisan majority, but in the minority that has expressed themselves here today, say they're for law and order, say they're standing behind the men and women in uniform, and then make real cuts to what we provide? Or, as my chairman points out, if you don't just look at last year, compared to last year where we didn't do very well by them either, but if you look at where we were in 2001, we're going backwards, not forwards. We're not even at where we were 5 years ago. 
   This amendment is a mistake, and I urge my colleagues to reject it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   And the gentleman said, well, we didn't cut the money for your vest; you're wearing it. But the officer says, I've got no vest on. And the Congressman says, that's my story, and I'm sticking to it. 
   It may be a good story, but it doesn't protect him from bullets.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank my colleague from Texas for reading a letter from constituents out in the State of Texas. But I wonder how that family in Texas would feel if that family were asked: Do you think that we should continue to allow oil companies to earn the greatest profits in the history of any industry, in the history of the world? Or, do you think we ought to take some of those oil revenues and devote them to putting more cops on the street? I think that family would say, ``You know, I would be willing to pay a little less at the pump or have the oil company earn a little less at the pump if it meant pumping a little more of that money into the FBI to keep me safe, or if it meant another bulletproof vest for a police officer.'' I think that family would say the record profits of that industry, that we had a chance to actually take some of those resources and plow it into this country, invest in this country, I think that family in Texas would say, ``That means more to me than making sure that these companies enjoy corporate welfare and astounding profits.'' 
   Now, my friend says this is only a $31 million cut. How much difference could that really make? But my friend isn't willing to say where he would cut the money. He wants to spread it around. But he used the example of the FBI. Let's say we devoted this entire cut to the FBI, and it simply means that you would have one FBI agent working a few less hours. Instead of working maybe an 8-hour day, 5 8-hour days, they would work 4 8-hour days and a 7-hour day. Well, I don't know how much they are paying FBI agents in my friend's part of the State; I am from a different part of California. I don't think they pay them all that much. I think if you cut $31 million out of the FBI, you are cutting a lot of positions out of the FBI.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I am not yielding my time. My colleague had 15 minutes to try to make his point. 
   So I don't think cutting $31 million out of the FBI makes sense. And this gets back to the question that our Chairman posed: What is the need? And are we devoting the resources that meet that need? 
   The need that I am hearing, the need that our Homeland Security Committee is hearing, the need that the 9/11 Commission recognized is the need to make greater investments in the safety of our country. That is the need that we are recognizing in this bill. 
   Do we need those extra FBI agents? Yes, I think we do. Do we need those extra cops on the beat? Yes, I think they do. I wish my friends in the opposition who fight so hard for our friends in the gun industry would fight half as hard for our cops to have the best that they need here in this debate on the House floor today. 
   I think we need to make these investments in our future. I think we need to make these investments in our American family. And, I think that my colleagues in the minority here, not in the minority party, because, again, this bill enjoys the support of the bipartisan majority. But the minority viewpoint that is expressed here today, I think they need to ask: What would these families choose, if we give them the real choice, not between whether they invest in the FBI or they don't invest in the FBI, but whether they invest in the FBI by ending corporate welfare for oil companies? I think the answer would be yes. I think the answer would be absolutely. And I think the answer would be, we want to invest in the country, make it stronger, make it safer, give our children a chance to grow up in safer neighborhoods. 
   That is the answer I think that letter writer and others around the country would give and have given, and that is why I urge this amendment to be defeated.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Again, I would just point out that my friend hasn't shown any willingness to trim the profits of his friends in the oil industry by 0.00000005, which would amount to probably about the same $31 million we are talking about here. He is only willing to take that $30 million out of our law enforcement efforts across the board, but not out of oil industry profits. And that is the difference in philosophy, I think, between my colleague and myself. 
   MR. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, during this debate we have seen all sorts of charts and heard about all sorts of numbers and saw a display of dollars. Here are the statistics that count, Mr. Chairman: 
   The past 2 years, violent crimes in America are up 3.6 percent. Federal law enforcement grants have declined 46 percent. So, under their leadership, Mr. Chairman, Federal support for local law enforcement has already been cut 46 percent; now we are saying we should cut it another five-hundredths of a percent. 
   FBI counterterrorism casework is up 100 percent. Meanwhile, FBI investigative resources are down 29 percent. 
   So what we have here, Mr. Chairman, is more criminals on the streets, and an attempt to reduce investments in cops on the streets. What we have here, Mr. Chairman, is a bigger caseload of potential terrorists, and the FBI being told, ``Shave your budgets.'' That is how far some ideologues will go, Mr. Chairman. 
   I can't imagine any American watching these proceedings, and then hearing the news, learning about the National Intelligence Estimate, which says that al Qaeda is proliferating and regenerating, and saying, ``Now is the time to cut the FBI budget,'' or, ``Now is the time even to reduce increased investments in the FBI.'' 
   Al Qaeda is not cutting the rate of their increase, Mr. Chairman. Terrorists are not cutting the rate of their increases, Mr. Chairman. This is not the time to begin cutting these budgets. 
   The other side is talking about specific reductions in the number of FBI agents on counterterrorism cases. They are talking about a specific reduction in the number of deployments of cops on the street; crime going up, Federal law enforcement grants going down. There is a correlation between the two. And now we add insult to injury by saying, let's cut it another 0.05 percent, or one-five-hundredths of a percent. 
   I want to close, Mr. Chairman, by reminding the Chairman and the American people through the Chairman that this debate really isn't about one-five-hundredths of a percent; it is about what priorities make sense to the American people: $14 billion tax cuts to the biggest oil companies on Earth, or 2,800 cops on the street; $90 billion in tax shelters for offshore companies that register their headquarters in Bermuda to avoid paying their fair share of taxes here, or more cops on the street?     
   The gentleman talked about a family in his district. I don't know of any family in my district that gets to sit at their table, their kitchen table with their accountant and be given the advice that they should register themselves at a P.O. box in Bermuda to avoid paying their fair share of taxes in the United States. You know what they want for their tax dollars? Cops on the street, FBI agents protecting them. That's what they want. They don't have the right to just go off to Bermuda, register themselves at a P.O. box and not pay taxes. 
   We understand that every tax dollar has to be jealously safeguarded, and that's what we do in this bill. The difference between us is not one-five-hundredth of a percent. The difference between us is $90 billion. They would rather spend that $90 billion on those offshore companies with P.O. boxes in Bermuda. We would rather spend a fraction of that making sure that there are cops on the street, that kids are protected from meth, that women don't have to deal with domestic violence, that they can be prosecuted, that the FBI has counter-terrorist agents, that they have investigative resources. Because as I said before, all the statistics bear it out, crime is increasing. Terrorists are proliferating. They are not cutting their budgets. They are not cutting their numbers. They are not even cutting their rate of increase. And we should not turn our backs and allow them this advantage, their advantage in the name of a one-five-hundredth of a percent cut in this budget. 
   This isn't substance. This is politics. And if it weren't so serious, it would be silly. 
   We want cops on the street and counter-terrorist agents with the FBI. That's what the American people want. That's why every Republican on the Appropriations Committee supported this bill. And that is why, at the end of this debate, we go back to where we were at the beginning of this debate. 
   This is a small group of Members, a fringe group of Members who say 3 percent's not enough, 2 percent's not enough, 1 percent's not enough. We're going to go to one-five-hundredth of a percent to make our case. 
   Every single one of those amendments has been defeated on every single one of these bills because Republicans and Democrats in the mainstream know better. We understand the priorities of the American people. And  that is why this amendment will face the same fate as all the other amendments before them. It will be defeated. 
   And Mr. Chairman, let me make one other point. With all due respect to my friends, they have spent more taxpayer dollars prolonging this debate offering amendment after amendment after amendment, keeping this House in session when every single one of these amendments was defeated, than the one-five-hundredth of a percent cut that they're offering today. 
   I would suggest to the other side that they could save taxpayers a lot more money by doing these amendments once, getting them over with, let them get defeated as they always have, and let this Congress go on with the business of the American people and putting cops on the street and investing resources in the FBI to keep them safe. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank Mr. Mack for his strong work on this issue and his protection of civil liberties in this regard and many others. 
   Most disturbingly, from my view, from the Inspector General's report was the fact that the FBI issued at least 739 exigent letters to obtain telephone toll records in violation of internal Justice Department guidelines. 
   These exigent letters are used in emergency situations when an attack can be imminent and information is required immediately. They said things like this: ``Due to exigent circumstances, it is requested the records for the attached list of phone numbers be provided. Subpoenas requesting this information have been submitted to the U.S. Attorney's Office, who will process and serve them as expeditiously as possible.''     
   The problem with these letters, in at least 739 cases there was no grand jury meeting. There were no subpoenas requested, and none would ever be delivered. And so here you have the prospect of the FBI going out to a phone company or other provider and saying, this is an emergency, we need this information, subpoenas to be forthcoming, and none were. 
   Now, as a telephone company, you get the FBI knocking on your door asking for records, saying, this is an emergency, someone's life may be at risk, we may be at risk of an attack, you're going to want to comply. And then after the fact, after the FBI discovered that it had issued all these letters erroneously, unlawfully, it then issues an NSL, National Security Letter, asking for the information that was provided for in these exigent letters, basically to cover up, to try to give a patina of legality over an illegal practice. 
   This is deeply disturbing, and my friend's amendment, that I was pleased to join him in cosponsoring, would prohibit the expenditure of funds on these exigent letters when the claim is made that a grand jury subpoena is forthcoming when there's no grand jury even impaneled on the issue. 
   We need to put a stop to this practice. I very much appreciate my colleague raising this issue. I'm proud to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment but I thank the gentleman for offering it, because it reminds us of what this debate is really about. We are debating about whether we will invest in America's future. We are debating what kind of a Nation we expect to be. 
   My chairman, fellow committee members of both parties, and the vast majority of people around the country believe in America's future. We believe that America's best days are ahead of us. We believe that the American people can compete and succeed in the global economy, and that the most talented, industrious, and ingenious people on Earth are the American people. And we believe that, to ensure our bright future, we must invest in the American people today. 
   The America we see ahead of us is one where every child has the opportunity to go to college regardless of whether their parents did and regardless of whether they are rich or poor. They receive the best job training, develop the strongest skills, are empowered to create by laws that reward innovation, and have a government that is working for them, not against them, in foreign markets. 
   In the America we see, every child and their parents has access to decent health care, and no one working full time, playing by the rules and contributing to the prosperity of the country, has to become impoverished because of the catastrophic illness in the family. No parent should have to mourn the loss of a child it could not provide health care for, and no child should grow up in a home without one of its parents for lack of the same access to care.  
   For our parents' generation, this vision of America's future resembles their own fondest hopes. Our parents and their parents struggled so that we could enjoy a higher quality of living, better schools, better hospitals, and a safer world than what they knew. And, by and large, this greatest generation was successful. America is a better, more prosperous Nation because of their struggle. 
   But the generations that went before us did more than struggle; they also invested. They built schools, they built hospitals, they built our Armed Forces, and they invested in America's future. If America is to enjoy the same bright future we have in mind, that investment must go on. 
   Fortunately, this vision of an America where our best days are still ahead of us is a bipartisan vision. It crosses every economic, political, and generational line. We all want and believe that we can bring about a more secure and more prosperous future for our children and grandchildren. And we believe we can do so, must do so, in a fiscally responsible way by paying as we go. 
   Sure, there are some who do not share these values or who believe that we can achieve this bright tomorrow without any investment, without any contribution or sacrifice on our part. They are the ``get something for nothing'' crowd, the ``I got mine, you get yours'' crowd. They do not believe America needs our investment. And the future? Well, the future can take care of itself. 
   Some of these naysayers you will hear from today, some you have heard from already. Masquerading under a banner of fiscal prudence they will say, ``We cannot afford the investment.'' It is a masquerade. These are the same people, of course, who drove our national debt to the highest in history through a half decade of borrowing. And theirs was the worst form of borrowing; borrowing that led to no investment and, therefore, to no improvement in the Nation's foundation. 
   Our parents' generation had them, too, these masqueraders, the ``something for nothing'' crowd. But just kind of imagine what kind of an America we would live in today if our predecessors had followed their irresponsible siren song. We would still be traveling along dirt roads instead of highways, with crops rotting in the fields, long-term economic stagnation, a bleak presence, and an even bleaker future. We would, in sum, have become that Nation that Franklin Roosevelt so presciently warned against, a Nation with a substantial portion of its people ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure. 
   It is indeed fortuitous that these voices are few now and were few then, that the overwhelming bipartisan majority of committee members and Americans recognize that we have a responsibility to our Nation's future, and that responsibility requires sound investment. 
   In 10 years, 2.7 million more kids will be in K-12 schools, and America will be ready for them because we insist on it. In 10 years, 2.2 million more students will be in college, and our universities will be ready for them with a state-of-the-art education because we insist on it. In 10 years, the global economy will be even more extensive and American workers will be competing and winning because we will have invested in them. And, yes, it is because we are insisting on it now. 
   We believe in America's future. We believe our best days are ahead of us. And we share the belief that our parents had before us that we are responsible for that bright future, and that future requires investment.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I think I may have the gentleman's answer to where was the fringe when the giveaways to the oil  companies and the Halliburtons were taking place; why wasn't there an effort to cut those giveaways by 1 percent. 
   Those who wanted to cut those profits and those giveaways were not part of the fringe. The fringe we are talking about here today is the fringe that says we want those obscene oil company profits. We want those obscene profits for Halliburton. But we want to cut over $1 billion out of education, out of health care. That is the fringe we are talking about. 
   The overwhelming bipartisan majority of us want to balance the budget. We are working hard to do that. But we don't want to balance the budget on the backs of our kids and on the backs of those who need health care and on the backs of our workers who need training. And that, I think, is the fringe that we are talking about here today.

   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I wanted to take a moment to address the nature of the proposed amendment, and the amendment before it, and perhaps the amendment after it, the whole nature of the across-the-board amendments. Because I think the beauty of across-the-board amendments, in the eyes of the authors of those amendments, is that they're anonymous in their cuts; they're anonymous in the pain they distribute. They can go home to their district and say, oh, I'm not in favor of cutting education, I'm in favor of across-the-board cuts. Or I'm not in favor of cutting home heating oil for people, no, that would lack compassion, but I am for across-the-board cuts. What's a 1 percent cut? What's a half of 1 percent cut? Well, what it is is hundreds of millions of dollars taken out of education or out of home heating oil or out of health care or out of cancer research or out of special education. 
   So let's not take ourselves off the hook here. And I would be willing to yield to my colleague from Colorado. 
   Do you support cuts in home heating oil assistance? Are you ready to stand up here and say to your constituents, yes, I am for cutting home heating assistance? Do you support cuts in special education? Are you willing to say here today to your constituents that I support cuts in special education? I support cuts in abstinence programs. I support cuts in cancer research. Would you tell us if you support cuts in home heating assistance?

   Mr. SCHIFF. Reclaiming my time. I'm not surprised that I can't get a yes or no answer. I'm not surprised that the gentlewoman is not willing to stand up and say, yes, I support cutting this because I have other priorities. Home heating oil, that's not one of them. Large oil industry profits, that's one of my priorities. Halliburton, that's one of my priorities. But cutting heating oil, that's not a priority, or cutting special ed. 
   Let me ask you another question; do you think that cuts in college education funding, higher education funding, can be done without cutting the number of kids who have access to college? Do you think we can cut funding from this bill for higher education funding without reducing the number of kids that can go to college? 
   And you say, it's just half a percent we're cutting from higher ed, or the increase in higher ed, or however you want to phrase it. But the cut is real that you're proposing. So what does that mean? 25,000 more kids can't go to college?     
   Is that a fair number? Well, maybe that is too much. Should we say 10,000 more American kids can't go to college because of your cut? Is that a fair number? Would you support that? Would you support your amendment if you knew that?

   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to address some of the arguments. 
   I wanted to say about my friends on the other side of the aisle because, in fact, my friends on the other side of the aisle in committee, the Republican Members, uniformly supported this bill and support this bill. So I have to say that I address these remarks to a minority of the minority, the self-applied fringe that we've been describing or talking to today. 
   The beginning of their argument was, well, we want across-the-board cuts, we don't really want to have to identify exactly what we're cutting. That's a little hard to sell back home, so we're going to do across-the-board cuts. That's a little more palatable. 
   We said, well, let's look at where we're cutting, and then the argument was, okay, they're not cuts. They're reductions in the increase. 
   So then we point out, well, actually you're giving the impression that everything's being increased. Everything is not being increased. Many things are being kept flat. So aren't we really cutting those things that are flat in the budget? And my friends in the minority of the minority said, yes, I guess that's right. I guess we are really making real cuts with these across-the-board proposals, but let's not really look at what we're cutting. That's not very attractive. 
   And my friend says, okay, so if we're making real cuts, is it really the end of the world if we're making real cuts? Well, I guess it depends on who you ask. 
   One of the things we're making a real cut to is the bone marrow program. Is that the end of the world for us here in Congress to make a real cut, in real dollar terms, to the bone marrow program? Well, it may not be to any of us at this moment, but for some child out there, it just may be the end of the world. For some parent of that child, some parent has to watch their child suffer with cancer, the inability to get a bone marrow transplant and the failure of research into bone marrow  transplants, it just might be the end of the world for that parent as well as that child. 
   What are the things that my friend would make real cuts to? He would make real cuts to scholarships for disadvantaged students. He would make real cuts for nurse education. Does my friend think we have more nurses than we need? He would make real cuts for emergency medical services for children. Again, is that the end of the world? Well, for one child it just might be. 
   He would make real cuts for organ transplantation, real cuts for the National Cord Blood Inventory. Is that the end of the world? Well, for some child, maybe not our children, it just might be. 
   We would make real cuts, under the gentleman's amendment, to children's mental health. Is that the end of the world? Well, for a child who ends up taking their own life, it just might be the end of the world. 
   It sounds a lot more palatable when we say, well, it's a 1 percent cut or it's a half a percent cut. Is that the end of the world? Well, for one child it just may be.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   There really is a lot of common ground in this debate. My friends on the minority side of the aisle want to make sure that when one foreigner is talking to another on foreign soil, that doesn't need to go through a FISA court, and we agree. 
   The only real area of disagreement is when we make an effort to surveil a foreign suspect, and whether inadvertently or advertently we capture the conversations of Americans, should there be court supervision. If the programs expand and, in fact, we capture the conversations of thousands of Americans, should there be some court oversight of that? 
   I think on a bipartisan basis the Members of this body feel there should be. The courts should be involved, the Congress should be involved when we are talking about the surveillance of Americans on American soil, whether they were the target or the incidental effect of that surveillance. And I also think that if we got three Members from our side of the aisle and three Members from yours and sat down with the admiral, in about an hour, we could hammer this out. 
   We ought to do supervision when Americans are surveilled. This bill provides that, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, on Friday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its fourth report on the state of climate change science. This report is the most comprehensive, unbiased summary of the climate situation because it evaluates all peer-reviewed research published around the world and draws only the most conservative conclusions. 
   The report found that the evidence of global warming is unequivocal, and that the culprit is almost certainly our emissions. 
   However, this troubling scientific consensus is not acceptable to some, like the American Enterprise Institute, which sent a letter to climate scientists offering them $10,000 to write articles challenging the IPCC's analysis. This is an appalling attempt by vested interests to buy science that is more convenient for their outdated philosophy. However, it is also encouraging because it demonstrates just how desperate the climate skeptics are. 
   The IPCC report is the writing on the wall. The American people are demanding comprehensive climate change legislation, and we can delay no longer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, February is Black History Month, a time that we have set aside to honor the contributions that African Americans have made to this Nation. Some question the continuing need for a month-long celebration; others see it as a poor substitute for concerted national action to address the needs of African Americans. But Black History Month remains a time for reflection on the progress of our national journey towards a truly equal and just society. 
   America has traveled a long way in the last few decades, but we have a  long way yet to go. We have seen the promise of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s vision of a colorblind America, but its reality lies in too many ways still beyond our grasps. 
   In some respects, this is a historic moment for this country, and historians may look back on this period as the true beginning of a post-civil rights era, a time in which the statutory gains made by an earlier generation are bearing fruit as a new generation fully realizes its dream for themselves and their children. 
   The current Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, and her predecessor, Colin Powell, are black. One of the front-runners in the Democratic Party's 2008 Presidential contest, Barack Obama, is African American. 
   In 1974, Boston was the scene of protracted racial violence as the result of a court-ordered busing to integrate the city's schools. Last month, Massachusetts inaugurated its first black Governor, Deval Patrick. 
   Here in the House of Representatives, the Chair of the Democratic Caucus is African American, and five committees are chaired by black Members: Homeland Security, Judiciary, Ways and Means, Government Administration, and the Ethics Committee. Last Sunday for the first time two black head coaches faced each other in the Super Bowl. 
   It would be easy to look at these examples of African Americans who have made it to the summit of our national life and conclude that the shackles of oppression and prejudice have finally been released, but that is not the case. And even as we honor those who have risen, we cannot neglect the millions more who are still trying, including many whose lives were shattered by Hurricane Katrina only a year and a half ago. As Senator Obama has said, things are better, but better is not good enough. 
   It would be easy to look at the achievements of Dr. David Satcher, who served as Surgeon General of the United States from 1998 to 2002, or Dr. Keith Black, the chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai in L.A., and conclude that African Americans are well represented among the Nation's physicians. Unfortunately, while blacks make up 12 percent of the population, they comprise only 3.6 percent of the Nation's doctors. This paucity of African American doctors is one reason why blacks lag behind whites in a host of crucial medical indicators. 
   White women in the United States can expect to live more than 4 years longer than black women, and white men have a life expectancy that is over 6 years longer than African American men.     
   African Americans in the U.S. also have higher mortality rates than Caucasians for many diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS. Nationwide, the infant mortality rate for blacks is double that, double that of the white population. 
   Or we could look with optimism on the achievements of black business professionals, who are increasingly found in the upper management of American corporations and who are starting their own businesses at an ever-increasing rate. African Americans who own businesses increased by nearly a third in the 5 years from 1997 to 2002 and now number more than half a million nationwide. But these numbers cannot compensate for the fact that only four of the Nation's Fortune 500 companies are led by African Americans. 
   More generally, the median income for white households is $48,000, while that of black households is only $31,000. More telling, nearly one in four African Americans live in poverty, while fewer than one in ten whites do. 
   It would be easy to look at the achievements of Neil de Grasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium, and Dr. Stephen Mayo, an associate professor of biology and chemistry at CalTech and think that the burden of inferior schools has been lifted from the shoulders of African Americans. Sadly, that is not the case. 
   At every level of education, blacks are disadvantaged in the classroom. According to the NAACP, far less money is spent on black pupils than on white pupils, more than $1,400 less per student in most impoverished areas. This inequality means that black children do not get access to the technology and other resources that white kids have. 
   More importantly, the quality of teachers in predominantly African American schools is not equal to that of teachers in white schools. These schools have the least experienced teachers, the highest percentage of out-of-field teachers, the highest teacher mobility rates, the greatest incidence of teachers who leave the profession. The consequences are predictable: profound gaps in reading and math that emerge in early elementary school and persist through high school, and much lower high school graduation rates. 
   So, Madam Speaker, even as we celebrate the many and profound gifts that African Americans have made to our country, we cannot lose sight of the urgent need for all of us to do more to rededicate ourselves to achieving the equality that is the cornerstone of American democracy. Things are better, but better is not good enough.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the chairman for yielding, and rise in support of H.R. 5959. 
   I want to congratulate our chairman, Mr. Reyes and his staff for putting the bill together. In particular, I am proud that this bill authorizes the funding that our intelligence community needs to help prevent terrorists from attacking the United States with a nuclear device. 
   A nuclear terrorist attack on the United States or on our troops in the field is the greatest national security threat facing our country. While part of this fight occurs at our borders, the intelligence community is the tip of the spear, at the forefront of our efforts to prevent a nuclear terror attack. The many analysts and officers of the intelligence community ensure that we know as much as possible, not only about the terrorists who would attack us with a nuclear device or a radiological disease, but also about those who may sell fissile material that they seek. This bill supports our men and women in the intelligence community as they attempt to ensure that nuclear material stays out of the wrong hands. 
   It is much easier to prevent terrorists from getting a hold of nuclear material than prevent them from getting nuclear material or a nuclear device into the country. Our country is large, our borders are porous, and we have to stop the access of people who mean us ill from gaining nuclear material. 
   The bill protects Americans against nuclear terrorism by funding the Nuclear Materials Information Program as well, a Department of Energy-led effort to understand how much nuclear material is stored worldwide, what the security is at these sites, the signatures of this material, also a key ingredient of our nuclear forensics efforts. 
   But there is more that we still must do. H.R. 1, signed into law by the President almost a year ago created the position of the United States Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation and Terrorism. We must have an individual, a single person who can marshal all the resources and expertise to prevent the most horrific attack imaginable. However, no one has been appointed to this post. It remains vacant. I urge the President to fill this position as soon as possible. 
   Nuclear terrorism is the preeminent threat of our time, and all efforts have to be made to mitigate that threat. What we need to do is imagine what a post-nuclear 9/11 Commission report would look like, what would its recommendations be? And we have to implement those recommendations now; not wait until there is a calamity. 
   I am proud that this legislation addresses the threat by authorizing the resources our intelligence community needs to meet that threat. 
   And again, I want to thank you, Chairman Reyes, for your leadership, and urge all of the Members to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Chair, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Chair, today I offer an amendment with my Republican colleague Jeff Flake from Arizona that would respond to the President's unilateral assertion of power with regard to the electronic surveillance of Americans on U.S. soil and reassert that our existing statutes govern the operation of such surveillance. 
   Madam Chair, the Federal Government has a duty to pursue al Qaeda and other enemies of the United States with all available tools, including the use of electronic surveillance, to thwart future attacks on the United States and to destroy the enemy. 
   While the President possesses the inherent authority to engage in electronic surveillance of the enemy outside the country, Congress possesses the authority to regulate such surveillance within the United States. 
   When Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, it intended for this statute to provide the sole authority for surveillance of Americans on American soil for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information. Our amendment reiterates this important principle. 
   The President has argued that the authorization for the use of military force provided him with the authority to engage in warrantless electronic surveillance of Americans.     
   It is hard to believe that any of us contemplated, when we voted to authorize the use of force to root out the terrorists who attacked us on September 11, that we were also voting to nullify FISA. Our amendment makes clear that in the absence of explicit statutory authority, FISA is the exclusive authority for the conduct of domestic electronic surveillance of Americans. While the administration appears to have finally agreed that electronic surveillance occurring as part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, or TSP, should cease to operate without the approval of the FISA court, the administration has not conceded that it cannot conduct such electronic surveillance of Americans unilaterally outside of FISA with no judicial oversight either now or in the future. 
   While we have been told that surveillance in this program was limited to phone calls where one of the parties is outside of the United States, there appears to be no limiting principle to the Executive's claim of authority provided by the military force resolution. In fact, when we questioned the Attorney General on this point in the last session, he would not rule out the proposition that the Executive has the authority to wiretap purely domestic calls between two Americans without seeking a warrant. 
   No one in Congress would deny the need to tap certain calls under court order, but if the government can tap purely domestic phone calls between Americans without court approval, there is no limit to executive power. Congress cannot be silent in the face of this assertion of authority. 
   In working to meet the real national security needs of the country, we must also ensure that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to ensure that fundamental liberties are not compromised. Absent congressional action, law-abiding U.S. citizens may continue to have reasonable fear of being the subject of extra-judicial surveillance. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, when the President announced in January that he intended to escalate the number of American troops in Iraq, he sought to betray the increase in American combat forces as a necessary precondition for Iraq's government to make the political compromises necessary to prevent Iraq's civil war from spiraling completely out of control. In that speech, the President pledged to hold the Iraqi leadership accountable and to demand progress in two main areas: political reconciliation and security. 
   Now, more than 6 months later, it's unfortunate but also undeniable that little sustainable progress has been made on either front. Even as we speak, the administration is downplaying the significance of an interim report on the effect of the surge in Iraq. 
   On the security front, the heroism and sacrifices of American forces has caused a drop in sectarian killings, leading to an overall drop in the number of Iraqi deaths, but the reduction of Iraqi casualties has come with a horrific increase in the loss of our own troops. More than 600 Americans have been killed since January. 
   Moreover, as American troops leave cities that are quieted with their own blood, there is every indication that Iraqi troops will not be able to sustain the calm. If the past is any indicator, insurgents and militias are merely waiting for us to exhaust ourselves and move on before returning, and Iraqi security forces will be powerless to stop them.  
   When President Bush announced in January that he intended to escalate the number of American troops in Iraq, he sought to portray the increase in American combat forces as a necessary precondition for Iraq's government to make the political compromises necessary to prevent Iraq's civil war from spiraling completely out of control. 
   In that speech, the President pledged to hold the Iraqi leadership accountable and to demand progress in two main areas: political reconciliation and security. 
   Now more than six months later it is unfortunate, but also undeniable that little sustainable progress has been made on either front. Even as we speak, the Administration is downplaying the significance of an interim report on the effect of the ``surge'' in Iraq. 
   On reconciliation, the Iraqi Government has failed to meet any of the political benchmarks endorsed by the President in January and which this Congress mandated earlier this spring. These political goals are the best indicator of the prospects for reconciliation in Iraq and, tragically, all signs indicate that political reconciliation has been non-existent. 
   The Iraqi Parliament has yet to begin consideration of the oil law or an associated revenue-sharing law. Given the disparate geographical distribution of Iraq's oil reserves, these laws are essential if Iraq is to have any hope of remaining a united country. 
   More alarming, is the lack of progress in healing the Sunni-Shiite rift. Of greatest importance, is the need to reverse some of the 
   more draconian edicts of the postwar de-Baathification orders promulgated by former Coalition Provisional Authority chief Paul Bremer. These decrees removed any incentive for Sunnis to participate in creating a better future for Iraq. Other laws--to disarm militias and to grant amnesty--are still being formulated, and most observers believe that the prospect of disarming militias is so remote that it will not be possible in the foreseeable future. 
   On the security front, the heroism and sacrifice of American force have caused a decline in sectarian killings and suicide bombings, leading to an overall drop in the number of Iraqi civilian deaths. But the reduction of Iraqi casualties has come with a horrific increase in the loss of our own troops--more than 600 Americans have been killed since January. 
   Moreover, as American troops leave cities they have quieted with their own blood, there is every indication that Iraqi troops will not be able to sustain the calm. If the past is any indicator, insurgents and militias are merely waiting for us to exhaust ourselves and move  on before returning--and Iraqi security forces will be powerless to stop them. 
   There has been one very positive development--in al Anbar province, Sunni tribal leaders have decided that al Qaeda's indiscriminate killing makes them a bigger problem than we are, and they have taken up arms against our common foe. This alliance of American forces and former insurgents is desirable and should be encouraged elsewhere. But, like most marriages of convenience, it is not sustainable and cannot form the bedrock of a secure Iraq or reconciliation among Iraqi sects. 
   For almost two years, I have been calling for a change in our mission in Iraq--from policing a civil war to training, containment and counter-terrorism. This necessitates a responsible redeployment of our combat forces from Iraq, and I believe that this bill does an excellent job of providing a framework for that redeployment, while still giving our armed forces the flexibility that they need to respond to contingencies. 
   Iraq's future must be decided by the Iraqi people and that solution must come from political reconciliation. Every day that we maintain our forces in the crossfire between warring sects is another opportunity for hatreds to harden and radicals to consolidate their grip on Iraq's ethnic and sectarian communities. We should change our mission now, and begin the withdrawal of our combat forces. 
   In planning for the inevitable withdrawal, we must recognize that a poorly executed departure could result in an escalation of civil war violence as Iraqi sects compete for power. As we draw down our forces, we must make every effort to prevent a magnification of this catastrophic violence. In particular, we must not compound the error of the lack of pre-invasion planning, with an equally tragic failure to adequately anticipate the post-occupation environment. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is long past time to begin to end the war in Iraq. I support this bill and urge its passage by the House today.
