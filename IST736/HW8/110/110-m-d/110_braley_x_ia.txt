<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank and congratulate my friend and mentor, Iowa State Senator Mike Connolly. Mike has represented the City of Dubuque and Dubuque County in the Iowa General Assembly for the past 30 years. He has also served for 30 years in the Dubuque community schools as a teacher and as an administrator. 
   When Mike was getting started in the General Assembly, Iowa was facing tough economic times. The farm crisis was challenging the entire State, especially Dubuque, but Mike believed we could rebuild. He is an integral part of the leadership team that has guided the economic and cultural rebirth of Dubuque and Iowa. He has worked tirelessly to make Iowa schools among the best in the Nation, to make health care affordable and accessible, and create sustainable and good-paying jobs. 
   Madam Speaker, integrity and humility are two trades we could use a lot more of in American politics. Mike Connolly has always served with integrity and humility. He has sacrificed to make his community a better place  and kept his actions consistent with his principles. 
   Senator Connolly, on behalf of all Iowans, I congratulate you on your legacy of service and wish you well in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, last week President Bush told the American people that the status quo would continue in Iraq for 10 months. Last year, the American people demanded a change of course in Iraq. They wanted us to begin the process of bringing our troops home. The President's response: a troop escalation plan that sent an additional 30,000 troops to Iraq. 
   At the time, he said that if the Iraqi Government did not meet certain economic and political benchmarks, they would lose the support of our Nation. After months of delay, September became the moment of truth; and despite the fact that the nonpartisan GAO report found that the Iraqi Government had failed to fully meet 15 of the 18 benchmarks, the President said the troop escalation plan is going to continue until next summer. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is now clear that the President's only plan for Iraq is to stay the course until he can hand off the war to his successor. 
   The time for stalling is over. Staying the course is no longer acceptable. It is time for Republicans to join us in charting a new course.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend, Jerry Northey, on his retirement after 12 years as president of UAW Local 838, and after 36 years of working at John Deere in Waterloo. Jerry has served four terms as president of the local 838 in my hometown, making him the longest-serving president in the local's history. In fact, he served as president more than twice as long as any of his predecessors. 
   As president of Local 838, with over 3,000 members, the largest union local in Iowa, Jerry has been a strong and effective advocate for workers. Under his leadership, the local has seen a net gain of more than 500 jobs over the life of the current contract. Thanks to Jerry's leadership, the union and John Deere have successfully settled every collective bargaining agreement since 1987. 
   Jerry has also led corporate ventures between John Deere and the UAW, including recently coming together to raise an impressive $1 million for the Cedar Valley United Way campaign. 
   I know that Jerry will be greatly missed at the local hall and at John Deere, and I would like to thank him for his tremendous service, congratulate him on his many accomplishments, and wish him the best of luck in his retirement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise this morning in a pair of work boots that I have owned for 26 years to express my strong support for H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   I wore these boots when I worked for the Poweshiek County Road Department building roads and bridges on the county roads where I grew up. I wear them proudly today as a reminder of the hard work and sacrifice made every day in this country by working men and women who exercise their constitutional right to freedom of association by joining labor unions. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act provides greater protection to that freedom of association by providing for majority sign-up, first contract mediation and binding arbitration, and tougher penalties for violation of workers' rights. 
   Protecting the rights of workers has been a long and difficult struggle. Seventy-five years ago this month, Congress passed the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which declared it to be the public policy of the United States that employees be allowed to organize and engage in collective bargaining, free from coercion by their employers. The Employee Free Choice Act reinforces that public policy for labor negotiations in the 21st century. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important bill, and I look forward to the day when it is signed into law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Minnesota. It was a great thrill for me to walk on to the floor today and fulfill a campaign promise I made, and that is by wearing a pair of 26-year-old boots that I first wore when I worked for the Pauchet County Road Department in my home county building bridges and roads and farm-to-market roads for the people of the small county where I lived. 
   One of the reasons I wore these boots today is because it is very personal to me what is happening in the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   When I worked there during the summertimes back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a lot of the people that I worked with would complain every year that they did not feel like they were getting a fair share for the work that they were performing, and they were always talking about whether or not they needed a union to represent them. I am very proud of the fact that now those same secondary road workers in my home county are represented by a union, and they benefit from collective bargaining in the workplace. 
   One of the reasons that I wore these boots today was a reminder of the hard work and sacrifice made every day in this country by working men and women who are simply executing and exercising their constitutional right to freedom of association. That is what collective bargaining is all about, and that is what the Employee Free Choice Act does. It gives those hardworking men and women greater protection to exercise their freedom of association by providing for majority sign-up, first contract mediation and binding arbitration and tougher penalties for violating the provisions of workers rights.     
   Now, let's talk about why this month is so significant. This month, we will celebrate in a couple of weeks the 75th anniversary of the Norris-La Guardia Act, one of the first acts that recognized as a matter of law that workers have a right under the Constitution to collectively organize and bargain with their employers. That act was sponsored by a Republican senator from my neighboring State of Nebraska, George Norris, who had the vision and the foresight to recognize that, unless we protect workers rights, none of us will reach our full potential as human beings. 
   George Norris was one of those eight brave Members of Congress that John F. Kennedy featured in Profiles in Courage because of the courageous actions he took without regard to partisan politics, because it was the right thing to do. That is why we are here today to celebrate, 75 years later, a new protection for workers that will have just as much impact on their lives as the Norris-La Guardia Act did 75 years ago by making sure that they have protection in the workplace for labor negotiations in the 21st century. 
   Seventy-five years ago, it was yellow-dog contracts that everybody was concerned about, which was a method that employers were using all over the country to say: You cannot get a job here unless you sign an agreement in advance not to join a union. That is how bad it was 75 years ago. And yet, under the past 25 years, through the interpretation of the existing National Labor Relations Act by conservative judges, we have seen an erosion in the right of workers to collectively bargain, to organize, and to protect their rights in getting first contracts. 
   That is why I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act, because there is another story to these boots that I am wearing. I wore a different pair of boots the first 3 years I worked for the Poweshiek County Road Department. And when I graduated from college and got accepted to law school, I thought I wasn't going to need those boots anymore, and the last day I worked that summer, I took my boots out in the yard and I lit them on fire and said good-bye to them. 
   When I started law school, I lost my father and his parents within a 3-month period of time, and I ended up going back and working for that same county road department after my first year of law school and I needed a new pair of boots. These are the boots that I wore that year. I made a vow to myself I was never going to get rid of them; and that is why I am proud to be with my new members in the Democratic class of 2006 here on the floor celebrating this historic day for workers of the United States. And I am so proud to be here with you.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. One of the things we are talking about in terms of these myths is really the fundamental shift that happened here today, that now, under the Employee Free Choice Act, it will be as difficult to certify a union as it is to decertify a union, because one of the myths that you have up there is that somehow by passing the Employee Free Choice Act, it will be harder for companies that no longer share the support of the workforce to have that union represent them in a collective bargaining agreement, that somehow what we did today will make it more difficult to decertify the union. In reality, it has always been fairly easy to decertify a union and nothing about the Employee Free Choice Act changes that. 
   So I would ask my friend from Kentucky if he could talk about some of the other myths that we heard today and throughout the week during the discussion that we know aren't based on fact and aren't based upon changing anything about the law that currently exists under the National Labor Relations Act.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Well, I think one of the things that we deal with every day in this hallowed body are issues of human dignity. And to me, that is the essence of the vote we took today on the Employee Free Choice Act. It is not about giving one side in the bargaining negotiations an unfair advantage over the other side. It is about leveling the playing field so that all people have the means to reach their full potential as human beings. I believe with all my heart that that is what the Employee Free Choice Act helps to achieve. 
   I think it gives workers trying to enter into their first contracts greater assurances that their rights are going to be protected and their voices are going to be heard. I think that it puts more teeth into protecting those workers when employers choose to engage in tactics that have been prohibited under existing law, but have not been enforced as they should have been. And I think that when the rules are clear, and the penalties are clear, then everyone involved in the collective bargaining process has greater motivation to do the right thing. And, after all, that is what this is all about, giving people on both sides of the negotiating process the motivation, the incentive to do the right thing, to treat each other with dignity and respect and to  give them the best opportunity to achieve a good and profitable business venture that benefits the employer and the employee. 
   To me, that is what today's vote was all about, and that is why I am hopeful that the bill will be sent to the Senate and receive the same type of respect and debate that it did in this body, and that it will get sent to the President for his signature and be signed into law, so that all workers in this country will know that they have the protection that they deserve to reach their full potential as human beings.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to be here today to talk about the need for more civility in this body. I would like to remind the House that the last Member to be sanctioned for being assaulted on the floor of this House was Lovell Rousseau, who was involved in an assault on a representative from Grinnell, Iowa, the city I was born in. 
   I think we can all think back to those days and be grateful that we now serve in a body where respect is a daily part of the operations. I think it is never too late to learn from the past and to make sure that we continue to express the importance of treating each other in a manner that provides respect to this body and also brings honor to it. 
   When I was out on the campaign trail, I often talked about growing up in my hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa. When people had a problem there, they never asked if you were Republican or a Democrat, they asked for your help, and they got it. I think that is the purpose this body, to solve problems and to do it in a way that brings respect and honor on this body. 
   I am very honored that this new rules package promotes greater civility and does it in a manner that is consistent with House rule XXIII, which requires us to conduct ourselves at all times in a manner that shall reflect credibly upon this House, and by promoting an atmosphere where we are required to be on guard against abuses in voting time and reforms to the conference committee process. We will all do more to bring respect for the people who elected us to this body to serve.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Chairman, I am in strong support of my amendment that will help improve our ability to forecast deadly tornadoes. I regret my absence today to speak and vote in favor of this amendment. However, I have had to return to Iowa due to major flooding in my district. I would like to thank Chairman Gordon for offering this amendment today in my absence. 
   In the last three weeks, 12 people have lost their lives in Iowa due to tornadoes. On May 25, parts of my district in northeastern Iowa were hit by an EF-5 tornado with winds of up to 205 miles per hour. Eight people died, and over 70 people were injured due to this tornado, which was the strongest to hit Iowa in 32 years. Just yesterday, a tornado ripped through a Boy Scout camp in Harrison County killing 4 Boy Scouts and injuring 48 people. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Boy Scouts, their family members, friends and all those affected by this devastating tornado in western Iowa. I hope that all of those injured in the western Iowa tornado make a speedy recovery so that they can continue on with their lives. 
   It is clear that the destruction caused by this tornado would have resulted in more injuries and lives lost had it not been for the warning sirens that went off before the tornado hit. Those warning sirens gave most people the time needed to evacuate and take shelter. However, this warning was, unfortunately, not enough to ensure the safety of every person in the path of these deadly storms. 
   I'm offering this amendment today to ensure that NASA is actively pursuing research opportunities to accurately predict and forecast tornadoes. My amendment would require NASA to cooperatively work with the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, on tornado research. NOAA is actively involved in tornado research at 
   its Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, and coordination between these agencies could  prove very beneficial. At the Prediction Center, NOAA is studying ways to improve the prediction and location of tornadoes. 
   I believe that NASA has a lot of valuable technology and input to offer on the study of tornadoes. However, it seems that NASA has done very little work with NOAA on this important life saving research. My amendment will give NASA and NOAA the opportunity to find ways to work cooperatively on tornado research which will help us accurately predict these deadly storms. 
   My amendment would also require NASA to make any existing cooperatives with NOAA on tornado research a high priority. In the past, NASA has proven that they have a lot to offer with tornado research. Their past work with NOAA on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite has shown us that sudden increases in lightning in strong super-cell thunderstorms can increase the chances of a tornado touchdown. NASA must commit more resources to this program and other programs dealing with tornado research. Committing more resources to already existing programs will help us accurately forecast tornado touchdown locations. 
   I urge the House to adopt this amendment to give NASA a better opportunity to offer its technology and expertise in the area of tornado research, and to improve and provide additional resources to its already existing tornado research programs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, today I encourage constituents to ``Buy American.'' 
   Unfortunately, I am unable to speak on the floor today in support of H. Res. 977 because of a developing crisis in Iowa's 1st Congressional District. Massive flooding is leading to evacuations and it is only expected to get worse. Although I realize how important it is to cast votes in Washington, the well-being of my constituents comes first, and I need to be in the district to assist in any way I can. 
   This January 29th Congress passed a bipartisan economic stimulus bill that provides rebate checks of up to $600 per individual and $1200 per married couple, plus an additional $300 per child. This stimulus package is temporary, timely, and targeted, and it will bring relief to working families. On February 13th President Bush signed this stimulus legislation into law. 
   Just prior to that, on February 12th, I introduced H. Res. 977, a bipartisan Congressional resolution urging Americans receiving economic stimulus bill tax refund checks to buy American-made goods or services from American-owned companies with these rebates. 
   Under the economic stimulus package passed by the House and Senate, 1.2 million Iowa households--and 117 million American households--will receive a tax rebate. The average Iowa household will receive a rebate of $917. 
   The purpose of the economic stimulus package is to provide a jump-start to the American economy. The economic stimulus legislation will put money back into the hands of low-income and middle-income Americans--those who need it most. 
   In 2007 the U.S. manufacturing sector lost 269,000 jobs. Manufacturing employment now accounts for less than 10 percent of the job market for the first time since data began being collected in the 1930s. Buying American would help keep manufacturing jobs in the United States. 
   The annual trade deficit has grown to the $700 billion range in the past decade, up from the $100 billion range in the early 1990s. If constituents use their rebate checks to ``Buy American,'' they will not be contributing to the size of the growing trade deficit, which many economists contend is unreasonably large. 
   If the millions of American families receiving tax rebates from the stimulus spend their checks on American-made goods and services, the effect of the stimulus will be magnified. Buying American will infuse an additional $10 billion into the American economy, creating jobs here in America and helping to narrow our growing trade deficit. 
   I am proud this bill has been endorsed by a long list of organizations, including the Communications Workers of America; United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; United Steelworkers; International Brotherhood of Boilermakers; International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; United American Nurses; United Mineworkers of America; Air Line Pilots Association; American Federation of Teachers; International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers; National Association of Letter Carriers; Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO; and the United Association of Pipefitters and Plumbers. 
   I want to thank Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell and Ranking Member Joe Barton, for their support in bringing this important legislation to the Floor. 
   I'm pleased this bill has such strong bipartisan support, with 106 of my colleagues as cosponsors. I want to thank them for joining me today in letting the American people know we are behind them when it comes to doing everything we can to promote a strong U.S. economy and to ensure access to stable, good-paying jobs.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, today I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6003, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. I am glad to see this bill on the House floor, as it shows a commitment by this Congress to strengthening and improving America's passenger rail system and moving Amtrak forward. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. This bill includes development of new intercity passenger rail services, including $500 million per year to states to cover the capital costs of investing in new intercity passenger rail services. By investing in new rail  infrastructure, this legislation creates jobs, increases tourism and spurs economic development in the communities impacted by new rail service. 
   In Iowa's First District, this bill will help fund two new routes that would both increase rail services and provide economic benefits. The routes between Chicago and the Quad Cities and Chicago to Dubuque, Iowa would encourage economic development in both Iowa and Illinois, while creating local jobs and decreasing traffic and congestion. Both of these routes would provide another piece to a new transportation corridor through the center of the country, which would be beneficial for business and recreation from coast-to-coast. 
   I am also glad to see Section 220 up for House passage today that includes the `Study of the Use of Biobased Lubricants.' This language instructs the Federal Railroad Administration to issue a report on the feasibility of using readily biodegradable lubricants by freight and passenger railroads, partly through comparisons of these lubricants with the petroleum-based lubricants traditionally used. The National Ag-Based Lubricants Center (NABL) at the University of Northern Iowa would be a perfect partner for the Federal Railroad Administration in this study, as NABL's expertise and resources in biobased lubricants is unmatched, and it is the only entity whose primary mission is the research and testing of agricultural-based lubricants. 
   I thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown, and the rest of Transportation & Infrastructure Committee for their work on this legislation, and I look forward to seeing these important changes becoming law.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the week after Memorial Day to salute the brave men and women of the Iowa National Guard's 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry. Their devotion to serving their country is worth recognizing, because these men and women put their lives on the line, day in and day out, in Iraq. 
   On Memorial Day weekend, CBS's ``60 Minutes'' devoted an entire hour to telling the story of the 1-133rd, one of the first times since 2004 that they devoted an entire hour to one subject. Many Iowans watched intently that Sunday night as they saw the story of their friends, neighbors and loved ones. We saw a group of Iowans mature over 2 years from their deployment to their pending return back home. 
   We speak a great deal in this body about our troops and the war in Iraq, and for good reason. But if I have learned anything from my interactions with the 1-133rd over the past several months, it is that the sacrifices we ask our troops to make when they are deployed in a hostile situation thousands of miles from home really are incalculable. 
   The story of the 1-133rd should be required watching for all the Members of this body, who must weigh the decision to send our troops overseas. 
   Again, I commend these brave men and women from Iowa.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa. 
   It's my honor to be here to honor the life and memory of Wiley Mayne. I did not have the good fortune of meeting Wiley, but I did know his son John very well. And if children are a reflection of their parents, then he certainly was a wonderful person. 
   And actually, I'm here for many reasons. One of them is, Wiley and I had many things in common. Wiley was an elder in a Presbyterian church in Sioux City, and I was an elder in a Presbyterian church in Waterloo. 
   He was a past president of the Iowa State Bar Association from 1963 to 1964, had a distinguished service in the U.S. Naval Reserves serving on destroyer escort duty in World War II. 
   But I think one of the things that Congressman King mentioned that Congressman Latham and I and all of the other Members of the Iowa delegation feel so strongly about is that Wiley was the type of person who really exemplified what we feel are Iowa values. He was somebody who believed that representing his constituents did not require him to tear down someone else or their constituents. 
   He was an incredibly handsome man, if any of you have seen pictures of him. His dedication to his family was evident from the way that he lived his life. 
   When I had the opportunity to work with his son, John, on some cases up in the Sioux City area, we spent a lot of time talking about his father and the work he did in the House of Representatives and how proud he was to serve the constituents of northwest Iowa. And I know that his constituents remember him and remember that he also exemplified what it means to take tough votes based upon your conscience and your convictions and sometimes having to pay the price for that. 
   So I was very, very honored to be asked to come tonight and to speak on behalf of Representative Mayne. He will be missed by his family, his friends and his many constituents that he served in the northwest Iowa Sixth  District with distinction during the 1960s and 1970s, and I'm very, very grateful to Congressman King for inviting me here to share those thoughts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the gentleman for yielding and also thank you for your outstanding leadership with this special time we get to share together here on the House floor. 
   My district in northeast Iowa, the First District of Iowa, is in some ways very similar to yours, my friend, Mr. Walz's. It's the rust belt of Iowa. It's got a lot of agricultural, manufacturing history, and I think it's a microcosm of what you've been talking about. 
   We have great manufacturers that I'm fortunate enough to have in my district, companies like John Deere that have been around for years and have stayed in the communities providing jobs and opportunity. But we've also had a tremendous impact on our economy in Iowa this year from our loss of our Maytag plant in Newton, one of those manufacturers that people know as a brand name that used to be on the game shows we used to watch as kids growing up. And then just recently, the Schaeffer Pen Company in Fort Madison closed after over 100 years of being one of those symbols of what American manufacturers can produce. 
   Those aren't just losses of jobs to people in those communities. The ripple effect throughout those communities in terms of people who move out and leave a void of volunteers who work in community service organizations, who work as mentors to the next generation of leaders that are going to be responsible for leading this country in a great new direction, those are the disturbing trends we never hear about from the President when he's talking about the rosy state of the economy. 
   And one of the things that brought all of us here to Congress is our sense that the middle class was increasingly being shut out of the American Dream, that the opportunity for our children and the next generation of children to follow them was being limited by economic policies that did not provide incentive for the middle-class entrepreneurs to make risks and create jobs and provide opportunities in their home communities. And what we want to do as a Congress is make sure that our fiscal policies are creating those types of opportunities in our own districts and throughout this country, because that's what's going to make us competitive in the 21st century. 
   So what I'd like to do at this time is let my friend Mr. Yarmuth, who comes from the great State of Kentucky and has probably a different perspective on what he sees in his home district, share with us some of the things he observes that are directly related to the state of the economy that brings us here tonight.

And I was shocked to visit Davenport, Iowa, the largest city in my district, and learn that Davenport leads the country per capita in the number of subprime mortgage foreclosures. And I know that all of you have constituents in your districts that are being impacted directly by the subprime crisis. And although our friend from Wisconsin certainly spent a lot of time talking about the Green Bay Packers, and I know that's heresy in the State of Minnesota, what I thought maybe we could do is share some of the personal stories we've heard from people who are directly impacted by these mortgage foreclosures by the need to convert their spending habits to credit rather than cash because they're being pinched in the middle, and put a human face on the problems we're talking about and why this economic stimulus package is so important. 
   With that, I will yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I have made this statement before, that my family wound up in Iowa because of one of the greatest Federal economic stimulus packages in history, something called the Homestead Act. One of my great great grandfathers, George Washington Braley, walked to Iowa from Northfield, Vermont, because of the Homestead Act. My other great great grandparents, John and Nancy, left Ireland during the potato famine and went there because of the Homestead Act. One of the first things they did was found a Presbyterian Church, which they named the Homestead Church because of the importance of that stimulus package in creating opportunity and hope for that generation of Americans. 
   So my question to you, my friend, is as you look at your State now and the people that you have the privilege of representing here in Congress, what type of real world benefits are they going to receive from this stimulus package we are talking about to give hope and opportunity to the next generation of people from the Green Mountain State?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am proud to be here today to bring to the floor of the House of Representatives, H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Enhancement Protection Act of 2007. A month ago today this important bill passed the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform unanimously by a vote of 28-0. I strongly support the bill, and I hope it will receive a similar level of bipartisan support on the floor of the House of Representatives today. We need to send a strong message that protecting the rights of whistleblowers is not a Democratic issue, it is not a Republican issue, it is an issue that impacts the lives and the safety of every American citizen. 
   Whistleblowers have long been instrumental in alerting the public and the Congress to wrongdoing in Federal agencies. In many cases, the brave actions of whistleblowers have led to positive changes that have resulted in more responsible, safe and ethical practices. In some instances, the actions of whistleblowers have even saved lives. 
   Unfortunately, despite the importance of whistleblowers in ensuring government accountability and integrity, court decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have undermined whistleblower protections and have unreasonably limited the scope of disclosures protected under current law. 
   The hearings that Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis have been holding in the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the 110th Congress have highlighted the need for expanded protections for workers who shed light on wrongdoing by government agencies and departments. Several hearings held by the committee have helped uncover waste and fraud in government contracting, both here in the United States, and in Iraq, waste and fraud which has led to the loss of billions of taxpayer dollars and has jeopardized the safety of Americans here at home and those serving abroad. 
   At another hearing, we learned that some officials in the Bush administration have sought to manipulate Federal climate science, compromising the health and safety of American families and the future of the planet solely for political gain. 
   Perhaps the starkest reminder of the need to protect those who remain silent in the face of government wrongdoing came at last week's hearing at Walter Reed, at which we learned about the terrible living conditions and bureaucratic hurdles that soldiers have endured there. 
   At the hearing, it became clear that nobody dared to complain about the squalid living conditions and inadequate care at what is supposed to be the best military facility in the world because of fear of retribution. 
   Because of this fear, it took an expose by a newspaper in order for action to be taken on these severe and systemic problems, and many of our Nation's heroes had to suffer there for far too long. 
   The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2007 makes important changes to existing law that will strengthen protections for government workers who speak out against illegal, wasteful and dangerous practices. 
   The bill protects all Federal whistleblowers by clarifying that any disclosure pertaining to waste, fraud or abuse, ``without restriction as to time, place, form, motive, context or prior disclosure,'' and including both formal and informal communications, is protected. 
   The bill also gives whistleblowers access to timely action on their claims, allowing them access to Federal district courts if the Merit Systems Protection Board does not take action on their claims within 180 days. 
   In addition, the bill clarifies that national security workers, employees of government contractors, and those who blow the whistle on actions that compromise the integrity of Federal science are all entitled to whistleblower protection. 
   As we continue to fight terrorism and other national security threats, this landmark legislation will give whistleblower protections to national security whistleblowers for the first time. It may be hard to believe, but currently employees at key government agencies in charge of protecting the United States, including the FBI, the CIA, and the Transportation Security Administration, are excluded from whistleblower protections. 
   These are the employees who work every day to keep our country safe and secure. These workers deserve to have the same protection as other Federal employees, and the American public deserves to know that workers who come forward with information that is essential to national security will not be punished for helping to keep us safe. 
   A good example is former FBI agent Coleen Rowley, Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2002. Special Agent Rowley graduated from Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa, which is located in my district. Like me, she received her law degree from the University of Iowa College of Law. She is married and has four children. 
   After the terrorist attacks on 9/11, Special Agent Rowley wrote a paper for the Director of the FBI, which laid out in detail how personnel at FBI headquarters failed to take action on concerns raised by the Minneapolis field office concerning its investigation of suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui. These failures, identified by Special Agent Rowley, could have left the United States vulnerable to September 11 attacks in 2001. Special Agent Rowley later testified before the Senate and the 9/11 Commission about these very same concerns. 
   Following those hearings, Iowa Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, a Republican  who has been a proponent of whistleblower protection, pushed for a major reorganization at the FBI, resulting in the creation of the Office of Intelligence, which significantly expanded FBI personnel with counterterrorism and foreign language skills. 
   Senator Grassley commended the actions of Rowley, saying on the floor of the Senate last June, ``in typical FBI fashion, the missteps from 9/11 would have been swept under the rug if it weren't for whistleblowers like Coleen Rowley ..... it looks to me like she's the only one who did anything to make sure the FBI was held responsible for its lack of responsiveness.'' 
   The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act also ensures that employees who work for companies that have government contracts are protected when they report waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. This provision is especially important, considering the use of private contractors by the United States Government has reached an all-time high, and that spending on Federal contracts has almost doubled since 2000, reaching $400 billion in 2006. 
   Private companies with government contracts are now performing some of the most important work of the government, including protecting civilian workers in Iraq and ensuring the safety of American citizens in the United States. This bill will help ensure that employees of government contractors, who report on the abuse of taxpayer dollars or other wrongdoing, do not have to fear the loss of their jobs or other retribution. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, this bill clarifies that employees who blow the whistle on political interference in Federal scientific research and reports are also entitled to whistleblower protections. It is essential that we have the best and most accurate scientific research and information that is possible. 
   Americans trust that their tax money is funding thorough and adequate scientific studies that are free from political interference or manipulation. As lawmakers, we also depend on accurate and unbiased scientific information to make policy decisions that will impact the lives and futures of American families. 
   Protecting government researchers who report actions or policies that compromise the accuracy and integrity of Federal science is critical to ensuring the public and the lawmakers are able to make wise and informed decisions that affect our lives now and will have repercussions far into the future. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis for their work on this bill in the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
   Again, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the passage of the Whistleblower Enhancement Protection Act today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I see some of my distinguished colleagues here today, specifically Ranking Member Davis, Congressman Shays. And to prepare for this debate today, Mr. Chairman, I watched a movie, ``The Insider,'' last night, because it was a classic example  of why we need whistleblower protection in this country. The sight of those seven tobacco company CEOs standing before the committee on which I am proud to serve, raising their hands and swearing that tobacco and nicotine is not addictive, and the compelling personal story of Jeffrey Weigand and the struggle he and his family went through are why we need to support this bill today. 
   One of the reasons why we are here today is because of the compelling stories of dozens of national security whistleblowers from multiple Federal agencies who have provided sobering and exhaustive stories about retaliation and retribution for speaking the truth.     
   These accounts have been well documented before the committees of this House. 
   Michael German was a highly regarded FBI agent working on domestic terrorism cases for 16 years before quitting in frustration in 2004. His whistleblowing concerned a case that, according to NBC's Dateline, ``involved a potential nightmare scenario: meetings between a home-grown militia-type terrorism organization and an Islamic fundamentalist group during which they discussed possible cooperation.'' 
   Mr. German alleges that the FBI fumbled the case and then, after he blew the whistle, falsified records in order to cover its mistakes. He reported his concerns to his superiors and reportedly faced retaliation for doing so, though a Department of Justice Inspector General report substantiated many of his claims. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues for the bipartisan spirit of support for this bill. 
   I want to just add a few more names to the record, in the remaining time that I have available, of courageous whistleblowers. These are not hypothetical situations we are talking about. 
   One of them, Richard Levernier, was employed at the Department of Energy for 22 years and was in charge of testing security at U.S. nuclear weapons facilities. Working through normal DOE channels, he tried for years to get his superiors to address security weaknesses that might allow terrorists to successfully assemble and detonate a nuclear device at one of the facilities. But his superiors declined to acknowledge that vulnerabilities existed. 
   When he faxed two unclassified Inspector General reports to the press, DOE suspended his security clearance. At the time he was 2 years away from retirement and eligible for a full pension. After he filed a lawsuit against DOE for unjust termination, the Office of Special Counsel conducted an investigation and concluded that the harassment against Levernier constituted a systematically illegal reprisal. The OSC also found a substantial likelihood that his underlying charges were correct. 
   Another brave individual, Russell Tice, a former intelligence agent at the National Security Agency, worked for 20 years in special access programs known as ``black world programs and operations.'' He had his security clearance revoked in May, 2005, after alerting his superiors of suspicious activity by a coworker. NSA later dismissed him after he raised questions about the legality of some NSA ``black world'' programs, including the eavesdropping by the Defense Department and the NSA on American citizens. Mr. Tice wanted to talk to Congress about what he feels are further abuses by the NSA, but has not been allowed to do so. 
   Specialist Samuel J. Provance's unit in Iraq was instructed to interrogate detainees in a way that he thought was immoral and inappropriate, and he told his superiors. Instead of investigating his claims, his superiors demoted him. 
   And, finally, Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer was demoted and his security clearance stripped after he made protected disclosures to the 9/11 Commission about Able Danger, a pre-9/11 operation for combating al Qaeda, and explained that there were DOD and DIA failures regarding 9/11. 
   This is not a hypothetical problem. Federal whistleblowers are being silenced, and instances of waste, fraud, and abuse are not being exposed. That is why I call on all my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Ross). The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Carney) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) each will control 10 minutes.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania and commend him for his work. This amendment will clarify the standard used to evaluate an employee's defense when a whistleblower claims that an employer acted in illegal retaliation. 
   When a whistleblower claims that an agency engaged in a retaliatory action, it is an affirmative defense for the agency if it can prove that it would have taken the same action even if the employee had not blown the whistle. This is, in fact, the same type of analysis that takes place in sex discrimination and sexual harassment claims, and yet nothing in this amendment would impose a different burden of proof in those cases because they are statutory-based claims and are not affected by the amendment. 
   Congress set the agency's burden of proof for this defense as ``clear and convincing evidence'' in the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Merit Systems Protection Board has ignored the intent of Congress and implemented its own test for evaluating whether or not an agency has shown clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action anyway. 
   This has made it almost impossible for employees to successfully challenge retaliatory personnel actions. 
   This amendment defines clear and convincing evidence as evidence indicating that the matter to be proved is highly probable or reasonably certain. 
   This is a commonsense fix that clarifies Congress' intent. 
   I support this amendment which will further strengthen protection for whistleblowers and urge all Members to vote ``yes'' in support of the amendment.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This amendment clarifies that Federal whistleblowers are protected regardless of where they are or when they blow the whistle. 
   A whistleblower who makes a disclosure that is considered a whistleblower disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8) gets the benefit of protections such as the right to challenge a retaliatory act by an employer. If the same whistleblower makes the same disclosure but does it while testifying as a plaintiff or as a witness in litigation, the whistleblower does not get the same protections. 
   We should protect Federal employees who expose government wrongdoing, no matter what the forum. This amendment appropriately extends Whistleblower Protection Act coverage to employees who make disclosures in litigation as described in 5 U.S.C. Section 2302(b)(9). 
   This amendment extends equal burdens of proof and individual rights of action to whistleblowers who serve as witnesses in Inspector General and Special Counsel investigations. This amendment also clarifies that these protections apply to Federal employees who face retaliation for refusing to violate the law. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which closes these senseless loopholes.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. For the past 6 years, there has been overwhelming political interference with science by the Bush administration. We have seen examples of government scientists barred from conducting or presenting research because it conflicts with administration policies. We have seen scientific findings manipulated or outright rejected when they don't bolster favored policies. And we have seen government agencies put out information about health that is entirely false, but politically advantageous. In one EPA report on the environment, the White House made so many edits to downplay the discussion of global warming that scientists at the agency said the draft no longer accurately represents scientific consensus on climate change. 
   The FDA delayed approval of plan B for over-the-counter use based on political, not scientific, reasons, causing senior FDA officials and scientific experts to resign in protest. 
   Numerous scientific and medical organizations have taken positions against this abuse of science. It has been condemned in the editorial pages of the most prominent scientific journals. The Journal of Science, for instance, said that this interference invades areas once immune to this kind of manipulation. 
   Mr. Chairman, 52 Nobel Laureates, 62 National Medal of Science winners, 194 members of the National Academies of Science and thousands of other American scientists have signed a statement speaking out against political interference in science. To prevent and remedy these kinds of problems, we have to know about them. That is why this legislation makes clear that employees who want to disclose these kinds of abuses are entitled to whistleblower protections. Our Federal scientists should not be punished at work for coming forward to report these abuses of science. 
   This legislation will have no effect at all on legitimate political or policy decisions related to scientific issues. All it does is prevent retaliation against employees who report abuses of science. The amendment we are debating now would strike this critical provision. 
   I strongly oppose the amendment and urge all Members to vote ``nay.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, which strikes section 13 of the underlying bill, is very simple; all it does is expand the term ``abuse of authority'' under existing law to include any action that compromises the validity or accuracy of federally funded research or analysis. And it is the federally funded component of that clause that makes this amendment bad for the American people. 
   American taxpayers should not have the risk of important scientific research being impacted by political influence from any political party. That is why it is important that this amendment be defeated. 
   There are those that say that politics and science will always intersect. That is absolutely true. Science doesn't give us all the answers. We have to make political and policy decisions about the right path to follow. 
   For example, an administration might decide not to support a certain type of research. We may not agree with that decision, but the administration has a right to make it as long as it is honest about the information and rationale behind it. What is not acceptable is when the government actually manipulates science to advance its decisions. 
   Hiding data, releasing misinformation, gagging scientists, all to justify a political course of action, is wrong. That is the type of action that we want Federal employees to feel safe in reporting. And that is why this bill makes crystal clear that disclosures related to manipulation and distortion of science are protected disclosures. That is why I again call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting against this amendment. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Tierney). 
   I commend Mr. Tierney for his work on this compromise. As a member of both the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, he has done a great job on expressing the concerns of both committees in a way that will allow us to move forward with this important legislation. 
   One particular change made by this amendment is the removal of language in the underlying bill that allows a national security whistleblower to always disclose information to a supervisor. This amendment acknowledges that there are certain circumstances where it may not be appropriate for a supervisor to receive a disclosure, such as when an employee is disclosing classified information to which the supervisor does not have access. This amendment also changes a provision in H.R. 985 regarding national security whistleblowers, to limit which Members of Congress can receive information from a national security whistleblower about an especially sensitive subject. 
   It is important that Federal workers who specialize in national security issues have the ability to disclose the information about government wrongdoing to Congress. These workers need to know that they have access to a safe harbor where information will be fully investigated and appropriately safeguarded. However, because of the sensitive nature of the information these whistleblowers may disclose, it is also important to ensure that appropriate Members of Congress receive these communications.     
   This amendment addresses concerns that have been raised about allowing national security whistleblowers to disclose sensitive classified information to Congress by ensuring that information will go to members of committees with expertise and procedures for handling such information. 
   I support this compromise amendment, and I urge all Members to vote ``yes.'

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend and my hero, Mark Smith, and to congratulate Mark on his retirement as President of the Iowa Federation of Labor. 
   Over the past 34 years, Mark has been a fierce advocate for Iowa's working families. He started as an instructor at the University of Iowa Labor Center in 1974; was elected Secretary-Treasurer of the Iowa Fed in 1979, and served in that position until he was elected President of the Iowa Federation of Labor in 1997. 
   Mark has dedicated his life to the cause of working men and women in Iowa. Protecting the rights of workers has been a long and difficult struggle, and no one has given more time and energy to the cause than Mark Smith. 
   Mark is living proof that one person can make an enormous difference in the lives of thousands of individuals. Many of the people he helped never knew what he did for them and never had a chance to thank him personally. I stand here today on their behalf, because I want Mark to know that nameless people here are honoring his lifetime of heroic efforts. His lifetime of service leaves a legacy that challenges future generations of labor leaders to continue his efforts to further the cause of working families. 
   Mark may have retired from office, but he will never retire from his real passion, speaking out against injustice and pushing people to do more to take care of each other.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Scott and the chairman of the committee, as well as Ranking Member Smith and my friend from California, for their support for this important bill. 
   I rise today because preventing torture of U.S. prisoners of war and citizens should be our highest priority as a Nation. This bill, H.R. 5167, is a bipartisan compromise that will finally, after 17 long years, provide justice for American POWs and civilian hostages who were tortured and terrorized by Saddam Hussein's regime. 
   And to put a human face on this, Mr. Speaker, these are some of the faces of tortured POWs that this bill is designed to address. 
   My friend Cliff Acree, a colonel in the United States Marine Corps, aviation, and Commander Jeffrey Zaun from the United States Navy were visible faces of the Gulf War invasion and what was happening to our troops in Iraq. 
   This photograph shows what happens when we put our young men and women in harm's way and subject them to brutal regimes like what we found when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, and the country of Iraq was labeled as a State sponsor of terrorism which is a necessary predicate to this claim in first place. 
   Immediately after these captured POWs started showing up on television, this Congress, including the House of Representatives which was under Republican control at that time, passed multiple resolutions condemning the brutal treatment of our prisoners of war, demanding that Iraq abide by the Third Geneva Convention concerning POWs and stated Congress' intention to hold Iraq accountable for tortured POWs. 
   Why is that important? Because the United States, along with Iraq, are part of the signatory nations to the Third Geneva Convention, and one of the most important articles for the purpose of this bill was article 131, which says no country--and this would include Iraq--shall be allowed to absolve itself or any other country of any liability related to the prohibited treatment of prisoners of war. 
   It wasn't just our POWs, though. There were civilian hostages taken by the Saddam Hussein regime, including famous CBS news reporter Bob Simon and his cameraman Roberto Alvarez who were kidnapped while on assignment in the Gulf War and were being held and tortured along with the POWs. 
   There were also numerous civilians who were captured by Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, including children, and were kept and held as human shields and subject to abusive treatment and torture along with our U.S. military forces. That is one of the reasons why this bill came about in the first place. 
   When these tortured POWs came home--and just so that we can put this into context, these POWs were subjected to cruel physical and mental torture. They were beaten, they were starved, they were hooked to electronic devices and shocked, and subjected to other horrendous acts. 
   Cliff Acree, the person whose picture is on this chart, had his nose broken on multiple occasions and his skull fractured in addition to being subjected to multiple other forms of abuse. 
   When these POWs came home, their Secretary of Defense, who was at that time DICK CHENEY, said your country is opening its arms to greet you. 
   And this body, Congress, acted promptly to address these crimes that were committed in violation of international law by passing amendments to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and, in 1996, provided that Americans tortured and terrorized in Iraq could seek compensation for their injuries from those terrorist countries, including Iraq.     
   Now, these Gulf War POWs have been through hell, and they waited a long  time for their opportunity to get justice. So in 2003, after the Government of Iraq repeatedly refused to negotiate these claims with them and refused to accept service, a judge awarded these 17 POWs a judgment for damages and stated in his ruling that deterring the torture of POWs should be of the highest priority of this government. 
   But shortly after that award was entered, this administration, which at that time was engaged in Operation Iraqi Freedom, decided that, even though one group of human shield plaintiffs had been compensated by the Government of Iraq, that they were going to seize the assets that were held in U.S. banks that could have been used to satisfy the payment to these tortured American POWs and instead applied them to the reconstruction of Iraq. And Scott McClellan, who was a White House spokesman, on November 6 said, ``The United States condemns, in the strongest terms, the brutal torture to which these Americans were subjected. However, no amount of money can truly compensate these brave men and women for the suffering they went through at the hands of Saddam Hussein's brutal regime, so that's why we're going to extinguish their claims.'' 
   There is a problem, and this problem was mentioned by my friend Mr. Scott, and also by Mr. Issa; that is, that this argument is hollow when you look at what our government has done to help Iraq resolve $20 billion of commercial debt that are outstanding to companies like Mitsubishi of Japan and Hyundai of Korea. And if you look at the fact that in this fiscal year the Government of Iraq will probably generate somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 billion in oil revenues, this small liability to these tortured American citizens clearly should be a higher priority than settling the commercial debts of Japanese and Korean corporations. 
   That's why the Justice for Victims of Torture and Terrorism Act requires the Government of Iraq to resolve the claims of American victims who are willing to give up all of their punitive damage award that they've already been awarded by the court and two-thirds of their compensatory damages to try to get this matter resolved and allow Iraq to move forward as a nation that belongs to the international community. And the waiver is only eliminated if Iraq does not pay the victims within the time period allotted. And this time period has been part of the Defense Authorization bill since the President's veto last December and since we came back with a new Defense Authorization bill that passed in early January. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, why does this matter? It matters because preventing the torture of current U.S. citizens and troops should be one of our highest priorities in this body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, is one of the most important and worthwhile programs in our government. It was created with broad bipartisan support by Congress in 1997, and provides critical health care benefits to children whose parents either cannot afford insurance, or hold jobs where health insurance benefits are not provided. Today, 6 million children and low-income families have health care because of this SCHIP program. 
   This week, Democrats in this body introduced legislation known as the CHAMP Act, which would reauthorize SCHIP, preventing it from expiring on September 30, leaving these 6 million children without access to health care. 
   The CHAMP Act would also extend SCHIP coverage to 5 million additional uninsured American kids, and ensure that States have the tools to reach children who are eligible for the program, but are not enrolled. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the CHAMP Act. By passing it, we will reauthorize SCHIP to protect health care benefits for up to 6 million children currently receiving them, and provide it to an additional 5 million who desperately need it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (HONORING THE 1ST BATTALION OF THE 133RD INFANTRY OF THE IOWA NATIONAL GUARD -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome the members of the 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard home to Iowa after a lengthy deployment in Iraq, and to honor and thank them for their service there. 
   Today was a momentous day in Iowa as the members of the 1-133rd, known as the ``Ironman Battalion,'' were reunited with their friends, family, and loved ones at a homecoming ceremony in Waterloo. This day of reunion and celebration has been anxiously awaited in Iowa since the battalion left for Iraq last year. An overflow crowd of thousands packed Riverfront Stadium to welcome the hundreds of men and women home. As they drove the final miles from Ft. McCoy in Wisconsin, Iowans lined the road to wave at the 1-133rd. 
   Sadly, today was also made bittersweet by the absence of two members, Sergeant 1st Class Scott Nisely and Sergeant Kampha Sourivong, who were tragically killed during combat operations in Iraq in September 2006. 
   It is impossible for those who have not served in Iraq to fully understand the experiences of the 1-133rd, or to comprehend the sacrifices that they and their families have made on behalf of our country. However, I am glad that the Memorial Day special edition of ``60 Minutes'' gave Americans a small glimpse of the challenges that members of the 1-133rd and their families have faced throughout their long deployment, and more importantly into their incredible perseverance. 
   Iowans who watched the ``60 Minutes'' special featuring the 1-133rd saw the story of their friends, neighbors and loved ones who chose to serve and sacrifice when their country called them. We saw the daily danger faced by the 1-133rd in Iraq as they helped deliver fuel to coalition forces. We saw their families missing them and adjusting back home. We saw the hardship and heartache that was experienced by the members and their families when they received the news that their tour of duty was to be extended from April until this summer. And we saw the lives of our fellow Iowans cut tragically short. 
   For me, the program also reinforced what I had already learned about the members of the 1-133rd from my frequent communications with their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Corell, that they are men and women of great strength and character who selflessly and bravely put their lives on the line every day for their country in Iraq. 
   The contributions of the 1-133rd have indeed been crucial to the U.S. mission in Iraq. Throughout their tour of duty in the al Anbar province, one of the most dangerous parts of the country, the 1-133rd detained over 60 insurgents. They completed over 500 missions providing security for convoys, and logged in over 4 million mission miles. They have delivered over one-third of the fuel needed to sustain coalition forces in Iraq. 
   I hope that it gives members and families of the 1-133rd pride to reflect upon their accomplishments and to know that they are part of the longest-serving Iowa military unit since World War II, and part of the Army National Guard unit which has served the longest continuous deployment of any National Guard unit in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. They have made me and so many others proud through their work and their sacrifices in Iraq, and I am incredibly privileged to represent them in the United States Congress. 
   I believe that the entire country should commend and thank these members and the families of the 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard for their contributions to the U.S. mission in Iraq. That is why today I introduced a resolution in the House to honor and thank them for their service and sacrifices there. The strong bipartisan support this resolution has from 70 original cosponsors, including the entire Iowa congressional delegation, demonstrates the pride and gratitude that Americans feel toward our men and women serving in uniform. 
   I look forward to the swift passage of this resolution in the House of Representatives, and I hope that it comes to serve as a genuine expression of thanks from a grateful State and a grateful Nation. 
   We will be forever indebted to the members and families of the 1-133rd for their service and sacrifice. Again, I would like to commend and thank this incredible battalion for their work, and join their families, friends and neighbors in welcoming them home.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to address this very important issue, and I want to congratulate and thank my colleague and friend, Congressman Boswell, for his persistence in seeing this bill to its conclusion and, again, thank the ranking member for the bipartisan support for this bill. 
   One of the most moving experiences I've had in this body is standing on the floor when we first spoke about this bill and heard overwhelming support and great personal testimony from people on both sides of the aisle. 
   I want to put a human face on the bill we are talking about. This is Joshua Omvig, and these are his parents, Randy and Ellen Omvig. I've known Randy and Ellen for almost 20 years. They're warm, caring, decent Iowans who loved their son and who are with us here in spirit as this bill makes its final journey through Congress on its way to the White House. 
   Joshua was a brave young man who served in a military police unit in Davenport, Iowa, which is in the First District that I happen to represent, and Joshua's face has become a national face for the issue and the crisis that brings us here today. 
   People who deal with post-traumatic stress disorder, especially PTSD involving veterans, will tell you this is the hidden combat wound. When these veterans return with PTSD, they can be walking on the streets of your city, your town, your community; and you will not know that they are suffering because of the nature of the disease. 
   What's even more significant is that people suffering from PTSD are frequently the last people to know they've got a problem, and that's why this bill is so important, so that people coming back and veterans who are suffering from PTSD get the resources, the early screening and the early prevention and intervention necessary to make a difference in their lives and to save the next Joshua Omvig who faces this struggle without the necessary resources and support. 
   I'm proud to be part of this overwhelming bipartisan effort in the House of Representatives to take care of our wounded veterans, our aging veterans, and our new veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. You've heard the statistics about the overwhelming nature of this problem among current combat veterans. That's why this bill is so important, and I ask my colleagues to join me today.  
   I rise to speak in support of H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this crucial legislation, introduced by my friend and colleague from Iowa, Congressman Boswell, and I am very pleased that the Senate has acted and that the House is again passing this bill today. 
   Named in honor of 22-year-old Joshua Omvig, an Army Reservist from Iowa who tragically took his own life after serving an 11-month tour of duty in Iraq, this legislation is an essential and overdue step in ensuring adequate mental health care for our troops who return home from serving in combat zones. The need for this legislation could not be more urgent, as more and more soldiers are returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from PTSD, TBI, and other combat-related mental health problems. 
   This bill is very near to my heart, as I know Joshua's parents, Randy and Ellen Omvig, very well. It is my hope that the passage of this bill in the House today means that the tragic death of their son will not be in vain. 
   I would like to thank Congressman Boswell for his leadership on this bill, and the Omvigs for their tremendous advocacy and commitment. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill today, and I urge President Bush to swiftly sign this bill into law so that we can give all of our returning veterans--who have sacrificed so much for our country--the mental health care and treatment that they deserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (NEW DIALOGUE NEEDED TO BRING TROOPS HOME -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, it is clear that President Bush has no intention of changing the course in Iraq in any way before he leaves office in January 2009. In fact, both the President and the Pentagon have recently said that they expect American combat troops to be in Iraq for another 10 years; and just yesterday the President requested an additional $196 billion to fund the war in Iraq for the upcoming year. 
   The Democratic Congress rejects the notion that our troops are needed in Iraq for the next decade. If the Iraqi Government knows that we are going to be there for 10 years, they have absolutely no reason to make any of the tough political compromises that they promised they would make when the troop escalation began earlier this year. Instead, we support a responsible redeployment out of Iraq so that the Iraqis can finally take control of their own fate and so that we are no longer sending more than $2 billion there every week. 
   Madam Speaker, House Democrats are committed to bringing our troops home, but we can't do it alone. I hope this outrageous funding request serves as a wake-up call to my Republican friends and starts a new dialogue to bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (STRONG SUPPORT FOR H.R. 6, CLEAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon to express my strong support for H.R. 6, the CLEAN  Energy Act of 2007. This bill will help move our country toward a goal shared by all Americans, a desire to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by shifting our energy emphasis from the Middle East to the Midwest. 
   According to the GAO, the United States has spent $130 billion in the past 32 years in government subsidies to the oil industry. The CLEAN Energy Act of 2007 represents a bold new direction in our energy policy by creating a strategic renewable energy reserve to invest in clean renewable energy resources like ethanol, biodiesel and wind energy. 
   As someone whose family has been farming in Iowa for the past 150 years, I am proud that Iowa has been at the epicenter of the renewable fuels explosion and alternative energy boom with over 55 ethanol and biodiesel refineries built or under construction. Iowa also ranks third in wind energy production and tenth in wind energy potential in the United States. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud to have had the privilege to have voted today for the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (DISASTER TORNADOES AND FLOODING IN IOWA -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to address a major tragedy that occurred earlier this year. 
   In May and June, Iowans suffered unprecedented tornadoes and flooding, which has directly impacted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iowans. The magnitude of this disaster places it in the top dozen or so all-time natural disasters, and the amount of damage in this State is unparalleled. 
   Along with my staff and other members of the Iowa delegation, I've worked tirelessly to provide assistance in every way possible to impacted Iowans, from helping to remove debris in Parkersburg, to filling sandbags in Waterloo, to working to pass a $2.65 billion supplemental disaster relief bill, to holding this administration accountable for its promises, to bringing Speaker Pelosi to the First District last week. 
   I want to thank the Speaker for visiting Iowa's First District, and I appreciate her strong words of support as we struggle to recover from these disasters. 
   While I'm proud of the efforts so far to pass the initial $2.65 billion in disaster relief, there is still much work to be done. Most notably, the Bush administration needs to release these congressionally passed funds as quickly as possible, and administration bureaucrats must stop dragging their feet while Iowans wait for needed assistance. 
   Secondly, this Congress must pass another round of disaster relief as the first round of $2.65 billion will fall far  short of meeting the needs of the Midwest following these multiple tragedies. 
   On June 13, while I was at the Cedar Rapids Airport during the peak flooding, White House Budget Director Jim Nussle told me that FEMA had nearly $5 billion for Federal disaster programs that would be available to meet the needs of Iowans. Since that meeting, Congress has passed another $897 million more in FEMA funding. Yet FEMA has only recently passed the $500 million in assistance to Iowa while at the same time denying many claims in Iowa for assistance. 
   It's time for our President to move Iowa's money out of the hands of bureaucrats and into the hands of needy Iowans. This is not the only piece of the $2.65 billion package that sits on the desks of Federal bureaucrats. There is $52 million in economic development administration funding of which Iowa is eligible that the administration is holding onto for another 2 months. 
   In addition, I've been urging HUD to release $300 million in Community Development Block Grants for months now, and that money still sits in the hands of administration bureaucrats. 
   In addition, I have personally invited President Bush to come to the First District, which, so far, he has refused to do. However, the President's physical absence from the First District is not his only neglect of the needs of Iowa citizens. We have yet to receive a budget request from the President to Congress outlining what he believes the funding legislation to meet these disaster needs in Iowa and in other Midwestern States should look like. 
   I have made my funding priorities clear. My Iowa and Midwestern colleagues have done the same. Where is the President's request? Actually, I can tell you the President's current budget request for Iowa disaster relief. Zero dollars. While I feel the administration has acted poorly in responding to Iowa disasters, I also do not let Congress off the hook. 
   The initial $2.65 billion package, while welcomed, is clearly not enough to meet the needs of Iowa residents and business owners. That's why I am committed to ensuring that Congress passes additional disaster relief for Iowa as soon as possible. I look forward to Congress passing additional disaster relief and to seeing this money reach Iowans in need. Only then can we achieve the victory of recovery. 
   I would like to thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi for spending last Monday in Iowa in the First District, in the Second District and in the Third District, witnessing firsthand the devastation that has occurred, meeting and talking to Iowans in need, and hearing their stories. I'm going to be sharing tonight some of those stories from residents and business owners in the First District of Iowa, showing the American public exactly what has been going on and why this need is so great and why it needs to be met. 
   There is no better time to have this discussion than in the wake of what has been going on down in the Gulf Coast, in the aftermaths of Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike, where the needs are also great. 
   I hope that my colleagues in the House and that people around the country who appreciate the needs of responding to emergency disasters like this will start to gain a deeper appreciation of why this funding is so necessary and why it's so urgent and will wake up Congress and the American people to the fact that more aid is needed to meet the needs of people in distress. 
   Iowa's needs are vast: from helping displaced residents find quality temporary and permanent housing, to repairing critical infrastructure--we'll see some examples of that--to things like roads, bridges and railroads, to helping small businesses, farmers and local economies get back on track, to rebuilding clinics, libraries and schools like the Aplington-Parkersburg High School and the Waverly-Shell Rock schools, to fixing wastewater treatment facilities in towns like Elkader, Evansdale, Anamosa, and Clermont, to helping towns like Buffalo, Davenport and Waterloo make sewer improvements and prepare for future flooding events. 
   Along with the other members of the Iowa delegation, I pledge to continue fighting to help Iowa recover until every home is rebuilt, until every school is reopened and until every small business has its shelves stocked. 
   To give you some idea of what type of double disaster we've been dealing with in the State of Iowa, I want to start by showing this wall cloud that contains an EF-5 tornado, the most powerful tornado that's classified under the system. 
   This tornado started on the west edge of Parkersburg, Iowa on May 25, the day before Memorial Day, a day that I will never forget because it happened to be the day of my son's high school graduation-open house. When that day started, our biggest concern was what we were going to do if it rained that day. As everybody was leaving our home and as they were heading back to their own homes and as we were getting everything picked up and put away, the news on television caught my attention as that day this disaster started to unfold in the fields of Butler County in the northwest corner of the First District of Iowa. 
   As this tornado gained momentum and started to enter the town of Parkersburg, it cut a path of devastation from Parkersburg to New Hartford to the town of Dunkerton and on to Hazleton before it went off and split into two separate tornadoes. The devastation in the wake of this tornado was almost impossible to comprehend if you didn't see it with your own eyes. 
   This overhead shot shows the south half of Parkersburg that was literally obliterated and wiped off the face of the Earth. You can see the high school track and the high school next to it, which was completely destroyed. 
   The people in Parkersburg are very proud of the fact that, along with their sister community of Aplington, their high school football team at Aplington-Parkersburg has four players who are starters in the National Football League from a town of less than 2,000 people. They're very proud of their community, and that pride was evident this year when they held their very first football game on this field with no high school while the students had been temporarily relocated to Aplington, to the middle school. This game and the significance of that game to this community was so great that the game with West Marshall and Aplington-Parkersburg was covered by ESPN, CBS, ABC, and it was the subject of intense national sports coverage. 
   You can see that the entire business corridor along the highway south of Parkersburg was wiped out. One of my neighbors, Dan Summerhayes, was on his way through Parkersburg on that highway while on his way to another graduation-open house in the town of Ackley, which is west of Parkersburg. As he saw this tornado approaching, he turned his pickup around and drove back to Parkersburg, to the Pizza Ranch which is out on the southwest corner of Parkersburg. 
   He parked his truck, and ran into the Pizza Ranch as other people were starting to seek shelter in the men's bathroom. As he pulled the door shut, he saw his pickup fly by outside in the tornado, and 13 people huddled inside that bathroom as another vehicle landed on the roof of the Pizza Ranch, and the whole structure collapsed on top of them. Miraculously, all 13 crawled through the rubble, and their lives were saved, but other residents in Parkersburg were not that fortunate. 
   Six people died in this tornado, and two more died near New Hartford. There were many other stories of heroic acts that took place and of people whose lives were saved. At one of the homes of the people we visited the day after the tornado, the person was standing right on top of the foundation of what was left of his home. 
   The owner of this house turned to me and to the Governor and to Senator Grassley and to Senator Harkin and said, ``I don't want to ever hear anybody complain about those warnings on TV, because they saved my life.'' 
   There was a bank that was completely obliterated along this same highway, and all that was left after the tornado was the vault where the bank had its valuables stored, and everything else was destroyed. 
   This shows you the extent of the devastation of so many of the homes near Parkersburg. The power of this tornado was so severe and the carriage of objects went so far that objects that were originally from homes in and around Parkersburg showed up in Prairie du  Chien, Wisconsin, which is over 100 miles to the east of where Parkersburg is located. 
   Many people came from all over the State and from all over the country to help out the citizens of Parkersburg. I took my chain saw up to help cut down some of the trees that had been destroyed in and around the homes. 
   This photograph shows you the extent of the devastation all throughout the community. This was a couple who had lost everything that they owned. As we picked up the debris in their basement, I kept holding up items and saying, ``Do you want to save this?'' They would look at me and say, ``This isn't ours.'' That was going on all over the city of Parkersburg. 
   In addition, the town of Lamont escaped the damage from the tornado, but it had 8 inches of rain in a short period of time on the front edge of these storms. You can see the terrible damage that occurred to bridges and to roads and to streets and to other public improvements in the town of Lamont, which also got 4 inches of rain that same week for a total of 12 inches, which had an enormous impact on the homes and businesses in the town of Lamont.     
   And if things weren't bad enough from the tornado, less than 10 days later Iowa had the historic flooding that was greater than any other in modern history. In between the Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers, which frame the east and west coasts of Iowa, are nine inland rivers, all of which were out of their banks at record levels during this peak flooding. 
   The town of New Hartford, which was hit by the tornado, was completely submerged in the wake of this flooding event. This photograph shows you some of the businesses downtown. 
   One of the tragedies of a disaster like this is the businesses that make a community a community, like the hardware store, the convenience store, have left the City of New Hartford and aren't planning to return, and those losses have an enormous impact on the quality of life in those communities and are one of the principal reasons why it is so important to get Federal disaster money released into these communities as soon as possible, to give them a chance to retain businesses and rebuild before they lose their population base and lose their tax base. 
   One of the most beautiful communities in my district is Elkader, along the Turkey River in Clayton County, and this photograph illustrates the enormous damage from the flood that occurred in June in Elkader. 
   One of the things you can see is the downtown area, the beautiful Catholic Church, the grain elevator. Elkader was devastated because the only grocery store that serves this town was completely wiped out in the flooding. One of the banks down here in the business community had water up over the top of the counters. And when you have your critical businesses lost in a community like this, there is no place else for residents to go to meet their basic needs. In addition, there was major damage to athletic facilities and high school facilities that provide all of the quality-of-life services to that community that will take years to recover. 
   The town of Waverly, which is north of Waterloo, where I live, also had record flooding along the Cedar River. You can see the devastation to the downtown, to the businesses that are still struggling to come back. Many residents were displaced from their homes. One of the grade schools still isn't open yet because of the widespread flooding damage. And this is just one example of many, many communities in the First District of Iowa that had similar flooding events of historic proportion. 
   This photograph in downtown Waverly is a good example of the impact on infrastructure that these flooding events had had. Here you see a collapsed asphalt road surface. The sidewalk is completely collapsed. There are damages to the businesses that will take many, many months, if not years, to restore. 
   Downstream on the Cedar River is the City of Cedar Falls, which is home to the University of Northern Iowa. This is a utility plant, Cedar Falls Utility, that provides most of the power to the City of Cedar Falls and has sustained millions of dollars of damages to its power plant, which serves the basic needs of the community and will take months and months to bounce back. 
   We were talking about infrastructure needs. This is a railroad bridge in downtown Waterloo. I spent one night back in Waterloo sandbagging in the downtown area to shore up levees that had been built in the mid-sixties during another record flood event. 
   Waterloo is fortunate in that much of the downtown was protected from massive flooding because the levees held, but because of the immense pressure on the storm sewer system, there was back flooding in the downtown area that caused major devastation to businesses downtown, including the Dan Gable International Wrestling Museum in downtown Waterloo, the Happy Chef next to Young Arena where the hockey teams play, and many, many other downtown businesses. These type of infrastructure needs are critical to the local economy. 
   One of the major employers in my district is Deere and Company, which has a number of factories in Waterloo and Cedar Falls and an industrial equipment factory in Dubuque and another operation in Davenport and its world headquarters in Moline on the opposite side of the Mississippi River from downtown Davenport. 
   Many of the products manufactured at the Waterloo tractor facility are shipped out across this rail line, so there are enormous added shipping expenses, not just to John Deere, but to many, many other businesses and farmers who utilize this railroad to ship their commerce across this country and around the world. That is why the needs are so great. 
   I want to share now some of the testimonials from citizens and constituents of mine who are going to put a human face on the extent of the devastation that I am talking about and hopefully give greater importance to the cause of coming to the floor next week and bringing a disaster bill that will address these acute needs. 
   This is from Lorrie Martin in New Hartford, Iowa, which had the double whammy of both the largest tornado to hit the country this year and record flooding. 
   ``We are the face of disaster. On May 25th, our home in new Hartford, Iowa, was damaged by an EF-5 tornado. I was in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester with my son, Zak, who is 21 and had just been diagnosed with cancer. We returned home on June 7th, and on the morning of June 8th the flood destroyed our home and all of our possessions. We walked out with a purse and cell phone for me and a hat and book for Zak. 
   ``For three months we have been staying in a gutted-out two room house in Dike, Iowa, sleeping on mattresses on the floor, with no kitchen or bath facilities. 4,200 hundred families raced to grab a few cheap rentals, while over 300 FEMA officials lived high on the hog in all available hotel rooms. There are two families living in an abandoned hardware store in Dike. 
   ``We thought our government would be our salvation, but in fact it has almost been the death of us. I have now been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease with precursors for cancer from stress. 
   ``FEMA has been a roadblock, making empty promises, placing us in harm's way and causing us to lose hope. They lost my paperwork twice and I had to fax my documents to them repeatedly. I called over and over again, and they finally admitted their scanning system was 2 weeks backlogged. 
   ``This is outrageous, and the system needs to be overhauled. We are suffering crushing depression, extreme anxiety and we can't sleep. If anyone tells you they don't contemplate suicide after a disaster like this, they are lying. 
   ``We have lost our dignity and have begged at charities, churches and the Red Cross. The Red Cross spent tens of thousands of dollars flying in representatives from other States. This money should have come to disaster victims directly. Everyone we talked to has gotten amounts from $80 to $800, with no logic to the amount. 
   ``There needs to be a central location for all the aid that stays in place until the last person is helped. Truckloads of supplies have come in earmarked for  New Hartford, but were rerouted. Federal, State, county and city government officials should sleep in the trenches with us until resolution. They can use their Blackberries and laptops to correspond with their offices and families. 
   ``I am but one person, living a life no longer worth living. I am bitter toward my elected officials. I hope they enjoyed their vacation while we fought to survive. I do not have faith that there will be change, but I have hope that you will listen.'' 
   This is from the Mayor of Green, Iowa, another community that lost its grocery store, its post office, and many of its key downtown businesses in record flooding. 
   ``The June 2008 flooding has had a huge impact on our small community. Luckily, we are in Butler County, the same county that had the devastating tornado that hit Parkersburg only 2 weeks earlier. This meant we could get immediate help from FEMA, as a disaster declaration was already in place. 
   ``That being said, one of our biggest problems that we will have is a huge impact in our community that FEMA will deduct from our claims anything that should have carried flood insurance. We did not realize that we were required to carry flood insurance on our properties. We have never filed a FEMA claim on any buildings before. We have employees that have worked here for 30 years, and no one was aware of this requirement. Needless to say, this will greatly decrease any claims we have, making it almost impossible for some of the repairs that are necessary. 
   ``We had equipment at a waste water lift station that was destroyed. If the equipment had been outside, it would have been uninsurable, making it eligible for a FEMA claim. But since we chose to put the equipment in a building, thinking we were making a reasonable choice, it was considered uninsurable and we are losing thousands of dollars on this claim just because we tried to take care of this equipment in the first place. We have never had a flood of this magnitude, and many situations are different than ever before. 
   ``Another big concern of ours is the availability of help for our local small business owners. Some of our business owners lost their homes and their businesses. We are a small community that is very independent, yet very dependent on our local businesses. We are still without our one and only grocery store, our Post Office, which fortunately just reopened this week, and a convenience store. The added expense to residents to get their mail and groceries out of town is a hardship to many senior citizens and families. 
   ``Some of our businesses just moved back into their original locations, but just as many are still operating out of other locations. How are these people supposed to recoup from such devastation without some sort of help from somewhere? If these were corporations, there would be funds available, tax breaks or some sort of assistance. More than likely, farmers would receive some sort of disaster payments. But our small businesses are ineligible for anything other than a loan. Most of these businesses are, for the most part, surviving day-to-day the way it is, without the added burdens of flood expenses and no relief of any kind from anywhere. 
   ``On a personal note, being one of the first communities that experienced flooding in our State, we really felt like we were ignored by some of our local officials. We hadn't been through anything quite so serious, and we appreciate the help that we received.'' 
   This is a letter from Tom Poe, who is the president of Crystal Distribution Services in Waterloo, Iowa, which had facilities in the old Rath Packing Company located right along the banks of the Cedar River in downtown Waterloo near the railroad bridge that collapsed that I showed you earlier. 
   ``During the week of June 9th, 2008, I, along with all 55 of my employees, watched anxiously as the Cedar River level rose due to the extremely harsh winter, coupled with massive rains in the spring. Crystal Distribution is located adjacent to the Cedar River on the former Rath Packing plant site. 
   ``When Rath closed, we made a substantial investment in renovating the former meat plant's buildings into our refrigerated warehouse operation in this Brownfield area of Waterloo. As the week began, it appeared that the flood levee would hold and we would be spared a colossal flooding disaster. Unfortunately, during the morning of June 11th and the morning of June 12th we received a major storm that dropped an additional 3 inches of rain onto an already swollen system and water table. 
   ``At this time, water began to back up into our lower level of our refrigerated warehouse. As we did everything possible to minimize the effects of the backup, we couldn't keep up with the intake of water, and before long were unable to mitigate further damage to the 100,000 square feet of refrigerated warehouse space. The entire lower level was full of retail ham, bacon and other boxed meat products. As the water level rose to over 4 feet, it was obvious that the vast majority, if not all of the product, would be unsalvageable. 
   ``We immediately contacted our USDA compliance agents and they were soon on the site. At that point, each affected customer, there were 10 in all, were contacted, and they all inspected their product and determined that, for food safety reasons, the meat needed to be taken to the landfill. The total loss amounted to over 3.5 million pounds of product. We immediately began the process of disposal and cleanup. Crystal paid up front for the landfill, trucking and building renovations to facilitate the disposal, along with many other costs, which were over $250,000 in direct expense to us. 
   ``Crystal immediately applied with FEMA and received an SBA loan application number. I worked with my accountant, attorney and banker to complete the rather lengthy application. After several weeks, I was told that the SBA may be able to offer a $279,000 3-year loan at 8 percent. We were hoping for something more favorable that would be able to help us replace the lost space, not to mention the loss of revenue to date since this event and the lost product value for our customers, some of which held no insurance coverage.     
   ``We are still in limbo between our customers, insurance company and local, State and Federal agencies, with no real input as to how this will all turn out. 
   ``Our first choice would be to rebuild and grow on this site, but we do not dare to do anything until we have direction as to what will happen to the existing storm sewer, river gates and city pumps in this area. I, along with most Iowans, are not accustomed to having to ask for help, and we certainly don't like to be in a position of having to do so. 
   ``However, due to this enormous, natural disaster, my livelihood and the livelihood of all my employees depends on our ability to bounce back quickly and to be able to put this event behind us. 
   ``My frustration lies with the fact that after 3 months we have not heard anything positive that we can move towards in rebuilding our business and to reestablish our customers' confidence to safely restore their goods in this area of Waterloo. 
   ``I realize there are many horror stories of people's houses being lost along with all of their belongings. Our situation at Crystal Distribution in Waterloo, Iowa is one of many. Unfortunately, I have yet to see or hear of much, if any, real help to those who have been devastated. It appears that the business community has fallen between the cracks of red tape and inaction. Hopefully I have given you a decent, general description of what happened to us back in Iowa. I can only pray that some form of help will become available to assist us in our recovery from this overwhelming disaster.'' 
   Next I am going to read from Marvin and Darlene Young in Littleton, Iowa. ``I would like to say that I, like many others, went through a devastating flood in the summer of 2004. My wife and I would like to just ask our U.S. Government to please take another look at trying to give us the help that we so desperately need. Not just us from 2004, but also help in allocating more funds for the buyout program and more funds for disaster relief to help recent victims. 
   ``It has been 4 long years of hell, and these people were devastated by flooding 4 years ago.  
   ``We were forced from our home via condemnation, and we were promised help would be coming. Yet we still have to pay property taxes and lot rent and had to incur debt by purchasing a new home. We have to keep telling people that we owe to please be patient and wait a little longer to be paid. We just feel that we have fell through the cracks, and no one cares, because the people who are in charge in Iowa and Buchanan counties can move on because it didn't happen to them. 
   ``We have been to every government agency that we were told about that could help us, and all we keep getting is there are no funds available to help. 
   ``What we cannot understand is how our government can be so apt to help out other countries around the world with money that they tell us our government does not have. We would like our Congress to please tell us where they keep getting this money to help them, but not us American people. 
   ``Our son can sign up to defend this country, and recently was and currently is deployed, to put his life on the line for a government that can't help his parents in a time of such devastation. We have nowhere left to go to ask for help. The disaster of 2004 has put us so far into debt, we don't know what to do. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if we weren't told to leave our home and told to leave our belongings because it wasn't safe. 
   ``However, the government agency, FEMA, which is running the operation, informed us not to worry because they were there to help. How were we to have faith in the systems that are set up to help the American people, when here we are, 4 years later, and in a bigger mess than we were due to the government agency running the operation. I hope you can put our concerns into serious consideration. I am sure that we are not the only ones out there.'' 
   The next letter is from Brenda Leonard, who is the emergency management coordinator in Jones County. When I was in Jones County during the peak of the flooding, I visited the communities of Stone City, Anamosa, the county seat, Monticello, Olin and Oxford Junction, all of which experienced record and overwhelming flooding. 
   ``My name is Brenda Leonard, and I am the Jones County Emergency Management Coordinator in eastern Iowa. During the flooding in June, the cities of Anamosa, Monticello, Olin and Oxford Junction saw record levels of flooding on our two rivers, which cover over 90 miles. In fact, the Maquoketa River has risen out of its banks almost a dozen times this spring and summer. 
   ``Our monitoring system for the river and creek levels involves one automated gauge and residents along the Wapsipinicon River. The Maquoketa River does not have a gauge in our county, so we have to rely on residents of the county to keep us updated as to the changing levels and rainfall amounts. We also rely on a network of volunteers and other counties upriver from us. Even with this information from the volunteers, there was no way we could have foreseen the amount of water we were inundated with. 
   ``These record levels have caused great damages to three city wastewater plants, over 350 homes, 20 businesses, and ranked our secondary roads department as second in the State for damages. This is tremendous devastation in a county with a population of 20,221. I would also like to say that our residents have portrayed the great Midwest spirit by helping their neighbors for preparing for, fighting, and recovering from this monumental of event.'' 
   To show you the kind of county Jones County is, approximately 15 percent of the residents of Jones County are veterans of our armed services who serve their country with great pride. 
   The next letter is from Sarah Powell, a resident of New Hartford, Iowa, who had the double whammy of both the most powerful tornado in the United States this year, and a record flood in the span of 10 days, Sarah Powell. 
   ``My biggest frustration with FEMA is that New Hartford was the first town to get hit by the flood and are now the last people to get taken care of. FEMA told me in the beginning, right after the disaster, that I would be put on an emergency housing list and asked if I was willing to travel. I told them `no,' that we needed to be placed in Butler, Grundy or Black Hawk counties. 
   ``FEMA told us we would be put on a waiting list. They have called numerous times and have told us that we were still on the list, but had no trailer for us at this time. They called and asked if we wanted to move to Cedar Rapids, Marion or Linn County.'' 
   Just parenthetically, Cedar Rapids has 400 square blocks of devastation from epic levels of flooding in that community, the second largest city in Iowa. 
   ``I told them `no,' we weren't able to travel that far. Why are there trailers and places to live in Cedar Rapids, but not available places here for the people that were affected by flooding first? It is now September, and I still do not have a place to live. I know that New Hartford is a small town and does not have as big of a population, but we were still affected by the disaster, and we are people in need of help and assistance. I am also frustrated that FEMA has denied us for most of help that I applied for because I had flood insurance. I have always been under the impression that FEMA is there to help people with their personal property because flood insurance does not cover personal property. 
   ``FEMA has told me that I have been denied for assistance because of insurance. I lost my house and everything that I owned. FEMA would only allow me $5,000 for all of my personal property. My insurance company assessed our damage to be almost $40,000, and FEMA assessed damages to be only $18,000. 
   ``How can there be that large of a difference between the two assessments? The people that had no flood insurance have been helped out more than the people that do have flood insurance. If FEMA is not going to be fair and willing to help those affected by the disasters, what are they for? 
   This letter is from Jackie Heins, who is a resident of Waverly and runs the Kinetic Energy School of Movement & Music, a small business, located in Waverly. 
   Jackie's business, Kinetic Energy School of Movement & Music, was hit hard by the recent flooding in Waverly. Her location is right off Bremer Avenue, less than a block from the river. 
   When the flooding hit, Jackie's storefront was inundated. Jackie sustained not only severe damage to her dance floor, but the heating, cooling system and her electricity were both taken out for almost a month. 
   Since the flood, Jackie has been working hard to get her business back and running. The dance floor had to be replaced, and some of her summer classes had to be cancelled. 
   On September 2, classes were restarted. However the back of her store is still torn up and, as she put it, we still have a ways to go yet. When asked what would have been more helpful to her, as a small business owner hit by this disaster, she replied that she would have liked to have been given much more clear information about what exactly her options were right after the flood hit. ``Everyone tells you call FEMA, but unless you have a very specific question in mind, or already know exactly what you are planning to do next, FEMA only gives you general guidance.'' 
   The next letter is from Lorista Ambrose of Cedar Falls, Iowa. ``We lost two homes to the flood-nado (this is what we call it) in New Hartford, Iowa. First, the tornado, then the flood after we moved into town and rented a house. So we had two disasters. Not one. 
   ``What we encountered with the FEMA process was inexcusable and way too complicated. I am going to walk you through our process, register for FEMA and get a number. I understand that. Let them know if we got insurance money and how much. 
   ``Then they sent me to register for SBA. I don't know why we would want a loan to pay ourselves back with interest. This was our tax money we paid in for things like this to help. But we did it. 
   ``Can't get help from FEMA unless you were turned down for a loan (can't understand why that should matter.) 
   ``Wait for inspections of tornado house by both agencies. SBA inspection was done right away. Eligible for a loan. 
   ``Turned down for FEMA before inspection. We have been told the denial is always sent out. Appeal. 
   ``FEMA inspector never came until after we went back into the FEMA office many times, still being told by  FEMA we were eligible for help. They knew we had insurance money and how much. 
   ``June 8--we were flooded out of the house we rented. We moved to a hotel.'' 
   This was after their house was destroyed in the tornado. 
   ``Told by FEMA to register again for more damages because now we were in two disasters. 
   ``Call FEMA to register again. The file is a complete mess now because FEMA process does not allow for two different addresses under one number, but we were made to do it that way anyway. Now every time we call, no one understands what we are talking about.'' 
   Because they were moved out by the tornado and then by the flood. 
   ``FEMA wants to inspect the tornado house now, even though they haven't already told us why we are not eligible. Why? 
   ``Still no money. 
   ``Not eligible. We have been in two disasters, lost everything twice, and can't get help. Now a month has gone by. 
   ``Rented house gets inspected and our address gets changed in our file. 
   ``Got a check for $13,000. We don't know what it is for, no address on the letter for what it's about. We were told we were not eligible. Go to a FEMA office, ask for help, and they don't know what this is for either. Sent e-mail for a confirmation of what this was for. No answer. 
   ``Call a FEMA office, and a supervisor was able to tell us they made a mistake and to send the check back. It was for the rented house. We did. 
   ``We give free help to other countries with no strings. Why aren't we doing this for our own people? Why can't we get a grant for the difference between what our insurance pays and the cost to rebuild the same house? Why a loan? We give grants for the mating habits of a bullfrog, but not for a disaster. Insurance does not cover the full cost on a 40 year-old house. Building costs went up so much in a year because of gas, and we could not have foreseen this. Now more disasters will make it go up even more as supplies are needed to rebuild. 
   ``From the American standpoint, FEMA is worthless. What in this process with FEMA is urgent or addresses an emergency? It took us 2 months, countless letters and many hours at a FEMA office for no results. This needs to change.'' 
   This letter is from Tony Mendez in Buffalo, Iowa, which is south of the City of Davenport, the southernmost town in the First District of Iowa. 
   ``My name is Tony Mendez. I am the proud owner of a local small business in Buffalo, Iowa, that has been a core institution of our town for decades. Clark's Landing Restaurant is our name, and providing a local gathering place for our community is our privilege. 
   ``Clark's Landing rests on a location of historical significance. In 1833, Captain Benjamin W. Clark, our restaurant's namesake, chose our site to erect a claim cabin to establish what is now known as Buffalo, Iowa. I have had the privilege of ownership since June 30, 1993. 
   ``Since that time, we have battled the rising waters of the mighty Mississippi four times. With the extraordinary efforts of our community, we have survived these trials time and time again. I am often asked, after the water has receded, the cleanup and repairs have been made, and we welcome back our families and friends to our humble establishment: `Don't you ever get tired of it and just want to give up?' 
   ``My answer is always an emphatic `no ..... ' I consider it a position of honor to be a guardian of what makes this country great. I will continue to protect one of our town's treasures and hope to pass on this time-honored position to my daughter, Mercedes, when she is ready.'' 
   This letter is from business owners Darin Beck, Aaron Schurman and Dale Folkers with Phantom EFX corporation in Cedar Falls Iowa. 
   ``We are writing this letter regarding the catastrophic flooding that occurred in Iowa this year. Before discussing the economic impact upon the community as a whole, and our firm in particular, allow me introduce us. 
   ``Genesis Communications, Inc., which does business as Phantom EFX, is an advanced technology company that develops, manufactures and markets video games in the family entertainment category. 
   ``We are located in Cedar Falls, Iowa, employing 40 people. We have been in business for over years. During those 10 years we have seen and weathered many changes in the national, State and local economies, as well as our particular industry.     
   No single event has been as devastating as the flood of 2008. As the floodwaters rose, families and businesses scrambled to save what they could and get out of harm's way. In the city of Cedar Falls, volunteers flocked to sandbag around the clock. These efforts saved our vibrant downtown business district, but many families and businesses were not so fortunate. In the part of town we were located in, the waters was unrestrained, resulting in massive losses of homes and business. 
   The loss to Phantom was over $1 million in inventory, furniture and fixtures. The real estate we occupied, valued at over $1.7 million was a total loss. The true loss due to business interruption is incalculable. 
   The Federal Government's response has been too little, too late, and nearly nonexistent. It is time for our government to step in to help, protect and defend its citizens. 
   Last Monday, as I mentioned earlier, I was pleased to have Speaker Pelosi visit Iowa to see firsthand the devastation caused by the floods and tornadoes. She visited Parkersburg, New Hartford, Sinclair, which had its grain elevator destroyed, Cedar Falls, and Waterloo in the 1st Congressional District. And you saw earlier the images of devastation in those communities. 
   Speaker Pelosi stressed her commitment to passing additional disaster relief, and I will keep working to ensure this funding is passed. 
   Speaker Pelosi also joined my calls for the President to decrease the Federal/State cost-share agreement for Iowa's disaster recovery efforts. And I am happy to report that after our collective urging last week, FEMA changed the Federal/State cost-sharing agreement to 90 percent Federal, 10 percent State funding. 
   Last week, I also joined the entire Iowa congressional delegation to urge President Bush to file a formal disaster request for funding for Iowa. I am continuing to push the administration and the FEMA bureaucracy to quickly release all of the funding that we have already secured for the State of Iowa, and I am hopeful that FEMA will release the first $85 million in the next week, and I want to continue to push HUD to release the other $200 million as soon as possible. 
   Hundreds of millions of dollar that Congress already passed for Iowa is being held up by the administration instead of being used to help rebuild Iowa. I am going to continue fighting to cut through the bureaucratic red tape and ensure that Iowa quickly receives the funding that Congress has already passed. Iowa needs more Federal help now, and I am going to continue working with Speaker Pelosi and the entire Iowa delegation to provide more disaster relief for Iowa. 
   In addition to the $2.65 billion flood relief package that has already been passed, we need to pass a second emergency flood relief bill. We have been working on that and need to get it out on the floor next week. 
   I have also worked with my colleague, Congressman Dave Loebsack from Iowa's 1st Congressional District, to help Iowa railroads repair and rebuild bridges that were destroyed, and that bill is called the Back on Track Act. You saw the photograph of the railroad bridge that collapsed in downtown Waterloo. And as I mentioned earlier, the economic impact of those collapsed bridges is enormous. 
   We also need to continue pushing for FEMA to take a greater share of disaster relief with the delegation pushing the President to have the Federal Government assume 100 percent of the cost of the disaster relief to lessen the burden on Iowans. 
   In the wake of the flooding disaster, I traveled to dozens of towns and inspected the flooding to check on the folks that I represent and see if they had their immediate needs met. In that  time I visited the communities of Waterloo, Cedar Falls, Evansdale, Gilbertville, La Porte City, New Hartford, Waverly, Greene, Shell Rock, Clarksville, Independence, Elkador, Anamosa, Olin, Oxford Junction, Stone City, Clermont, Davenport, Buffalo and more. 
   In addition, we met with the director of FEMA, the governor, both senators, the acting administrator of the Small Business Administration to address these needs, but acting in Congress will not get funds to the people who need it in Iowa unless administration officials do their jobs and start freeing up money that needs to get in the hands of the people who need it. 
   To give you some idea of what I am talking about, in FEMA alone as part of that $2.65 billion package we passed in June, $897 million in FEMA disaster relief funding was allocated. On July 1, 2008, FEMA's disaster relief fund had a total of almost $4 billion in undistributed funds. That's the most recent disaster relief report available from FEMA. 
   As of right now, FEMA has only given away a little over $500 million to Iowa and has in its possession billions of dollars of undistributed disaster relief funds which need to get to the people in need, in addition to the new people in crisis in the gulf coast. 
   Now let's talk about the Community Development Block Grant. Of that $2.65 billion package in June, $300 million was allocated for CDBG funding, and the importance of that is it gets it into the hands of local officials who can target and set up criteria to make the most direct impact in their communities. None of that $300 million in CDBG funding that we passed more than 2 months ago is currently in the hands of Iowans in crisis. 
   Then let's talk about the Economic Development Administration also known as the EDA. Of that $2.65 billion package, nearly $100 million was allocated for EDA funding, and none of that $100 million in funding passed 2 months ago is currently in the hands of Iowans in need. 
   In addition there may be additional delays with the distribution of other funds in that $2.6 billion package, including $606 million for the Army Corps of Engineers, $267 million for the Small Business Administration disaster loans, and $480 million for agricultural assistance. And until the crop harvest is completed and we know the true extent of the impact on agriculture in Iowa and other midwestern States, the extent of those damages is unknown. 
   But we do know this: the disaster season in the United States continues. And as we continue as a Federal Government to respond to the needs of U.S. citizens in crisis, it is incumbent upon every Member of Congress, no matter where they live, to recognize the fact that we are at our best when we respond to these needs with the heartfelt response that Americans expect in their time of crisis. That's why I call upon the Speaker, Minority Leader Boehner and every Member of this body to come together next week in the spirit of harmony and the spirit of goodwill to do what is necessary to address the needs of Iowans who have felt the brunt of this disaster in ways they have never felt before, the needs of other people in the midwest, the southeast, the southwest and the gulf coast, to respond to them and make sure that their needs are being addressed so they finally have faith that their Federal Government is there for them when they need it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (NO CHILD LEFT INSIDE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act. This legislation is vitally important to better prepare our students for the environmental, energy and natural resource challenges facing our country, and also for the career opportunities these challenges open up. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to represent Iowa's First Congressional District. Our district is noted for its rolling farmlands of corn, soybeans and other crops, our border on the Mississippi River, the largest river in North America, and for the businesses that have come to the Quad Cities, Dubuque, and the Cedar Valley. Our citizens have a deep appreciation and respect for our natural resources and recognize the important opportunities that are opening up in the fields of bio-energy and other agriculture-based, renewable energy resources. That's why I introduced the National Endowment for Workforce Education in Renewables and Agriculture Act to help our community colleges support the education and training of technicians in these areas. I was happy to see this bill included in the 2008 Farm Bill which was signed into Public Law. 
   I also recently toured the University of Dubuque's Environmental Science Education center, a great example of college level environmental education. This center provides college students with State, regional, and national benefit through educating undergraduate- and graduate-level students in the environmental sciences, and helping to create the next generation of science professionals. The Environmental Science Center allows the University to expand on its proven record of educating national scientific leaders. The Center specializes in hands-on, applied learning for current science teachers, environmental agency personnel, undergraduate environmental science majors, and education majors to teach the next generation of American scientists. 
   I'm proud to represent a University that has taken a leading role in educating the next generation of scientists and environmentalists, and I'm pleased to support this bill because schools like the University of Dubuque will benefit from the competitive grant program authorized in this legislation. These grants would be awarded to higher education institutions and would be used directly for the study of environmental education. The University of Dubuque could use this grant program to better improve their already succeeding Environmental Education Center. 
   In addition to higher education, we also need to ensure that our next-generation of leaders have a basic understanding of the environment and our natural resources, before they graduate from high school. These are the students currently in our elementary and secondary schools and the students who will be coming to our community colleges and universities in the coming years. This legislation will also provide learning opportunities for these students. 
   This bill authorizes much-needed resources to educate students at the K-12 levels about the environment, energy and natural resources and to help teachers, schools and school districts provide the best experiences and instruction for their students. It would begin to implement the recommendations of several reports by the National Science Foundation, the National Environmental Education Advisory Council, and the National Council for Science and the Environment to enhance environmental education in our schools. And it would help improve student achievement and enthusiasm for learning as several studies have demonstrated. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation that will improve environmental education for both K-12 students, and students in our Nation's colleges and universities. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5919, the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act. It is essential to reauthorize this program before it expires on October 1, 2008 and to implement the updates to this program included in the bill. As the Chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on Contracting and Technology, I understand the importance of this program to small businesses who want to turn their raw ideas into innovative solutions. 
   I want to thank Small Business Chairwoman NYDIA VEL&#193;ZQUEZ and Ranking Member CHABOT for their work on this legislation. I am continually impressed by the ability of the Small Business Committee to work in a bipartisan manner on legislation that benefits U.S. small businesses. Based on their track record, it is no surprise this bill passed the Small Business Full Committee by a vote of 22-0. 
   The SBIR Program provides grants to help small businesses through the critical initial stages of product development. The SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act will address national security priorities and economic development. It will also help in the development of life-saving medical technologies, therapies, and products. 
   Small Businesses are a primary source of innovation and they can keep us on the forefront of technological advances. I am pleased this bill includes language that will increase participation of small businesses from rural areas, and from minority- and women-owned businesses. 
   Increased participation will also increase competition. It is important to ensure that taxpayer money is being used to fund the best opportunities for advances in technology. Funding the research we're trying to create is a key objective of this program. 
   I am also pleased this bill increases the size of maximum awards for the SBIR Program. The current limits have not been raised in 16 years. The SBIR Program is a critical source of funding for early stage research and development and the awards need to be realistic for developments in science and technology. 
   The SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act will provide small businesses with the funding and guidance they need to succeed. These small businesses are a big part of the solution for helping us emerge from the difficult economic conditions we face today. 
   It will also ensure these businesses remain competitive in the global environment they must now compete in. We must give these businesses the support they need to grow. I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.  
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZAQUEZ. Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (DEMOCRATS ARE WORKING TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF OIL AT THE PUMP BUT FACE RESISTANCE FROM PRESIDENT BUSH -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, American families and businesses are paying a heavy price for the Bush administration's failure to enact a comprehensive energy strategy. Families are now paying an all-time record high of $3.50 for regular gasoline, and that's more than double the cost when President Bush took office in 2001. 
   Last year Democrats worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass the Energy Independence and Security Act, which is expected to save American families between $700 and $1,000 per year at the pump. But there's still much more that needs to be done. 
   Last month the House passed legislation that would take billions in taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil and instead give them to renewable energy companies who are investing in the energy solutions of the future. This makes sense. After all, the big five oil companies continue to reap record profits. Why do they need handouts from this government? 
   Mr. Speaker, if President Bush and my friends across the aisle are serious about providing some relief to the American consumer, they should reconsider their opposition to this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I thought it was important to come today and put a human face on the tragic story of Joshua Omvig. This handsome young man you see in this photograph is Joshua Omvig, and standing next to his headstone are his parents, Randy and Ellen. 
   It was Christmas in 2005 when I opened up the Waterloo Courier, my hometown newspaper, and saw the name Omvig, which jumped out at me right away because I have known Randy and Ellen for a long time. 
   Even though Grundy Center is just south of my district, I immediately was drawn to this tragic story. Joshua Omvig is not going to be reflected in any of the casualty totals from Iraq, but he and the other tragic stories you have heard today deserve to be included no less in the toll that has been taken on the lives of young men and women of this country. We owe them more. That is why I was so proud that my colleague from Iowa took the initiative to push this measure onto the House floor into committee so that it can finally receive the proper attention it deserved. 
   I came here with some prepared remarks, but I chose instead to speak from the heart today. Because when I was out at Walter Reed for the oversight hearings on the problems and the backlog of disability claims and the Surgeon General of the Army, Lieutenant General Kiley, tried to justify that backlog by saying that the science of post-traumatic stress disorder was still evolving in 2003 and that was preventing them from processing these claims, I had enough. Because I knew what people like Randy and Ellen Omvig have been going through, and I knew that this ability to prevent these tragedies from happening has been around for many years. And so I told General Kiley, with all due respect, that's hogwash. 
   It is important for this body to stand up and say that post-traumatic stress disorder is real, which is exactly what General Schoomaker said that day. That is why I urge you all to support this important bill and honor the memory of Joshua Omvig.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. This bill is named in honor of 22-year-old Joshua Omvig, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves 3398th MP Co. from Grundy Center, IA, who tragically took his own life in December of 2005 after serving an 11-month tour of duty in Iraq. 
   This legislation is an important step in ensuring adequate mental health care for our troops who return home from serving in combat zones and who, like Joshua, may be suffering from combat-related anxiety, depression, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This bill is a necessary and overdue step in reaching out to veterans of all ages, and their families, in order to prevent the tragic deaths of heroes like Joshua Omvig. 
   Nearly 1,000 veterans receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, commit suicide each year, a number which is startling and unacceptable. Army studies show that around 25 percent of the soldiers who have served in Iraq display symptoms of serious mental health problems, including depression, substance abuse, and PTSD. These figures are expected to rise, as PTSD an other mental health problems often do not surface for months after soldiers have returned home. These mental health problems put our service personnel at higher risk for suicide. 
   When Joshua returned home from Iraq with PTSD, his family knew that he was suffering, but they didn't realize how completely his illness would devastate him. They didn't realize he had PTSD, or that he was at risk for suicide. And they did not know how to help him, because they did not have the appropriate resources available to them. 
   The Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act will help prevent suicides like Joshua's by requiring the VA to develop and implement a comprehensive program to reduce the incidence of suicide among veterans.  This program includes educating VA staff about how to identify risk factors for suicide, and training staffers in the appropriate ways to respond to crisis situations and prevent suicide among veterans. The bill also requires the VA to provide mental health care to veterans 24 hours per day, and requires that a suicide prevention counselor be available at every VA facility. These counselors will provide direct assistance to veterans, and will also work with local emergency rooms, police departments, mental health organizations, and veterans' service organizations to provide outreach to veterans who may be at risk for suicide. 
   Additionally, the bill requires the VA to provide outreach and education for veterans and their families to give them the necessary skills to cope with mental illness, to reduce the stigma associated with seeking treatment for mental illness, and to know when and how to seek suicide prevention assistance. 
   It is my fervent hope that the passage of this bill in the House of Representatives today means that the tragic death of young Joshua Omvig will not be in vain. I would like to commend Joshua's parents for their advocacy on the behalf of their son and all veterans, and thank Congressman Leonard Boswell for his leadership on this issue. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, and I look forward to the passage of this critical legislation today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I would like to thank my friend. I would also like to thank my friend from New Hampshire, who mentioned earlier the great American patriot and trial lawyer, John Adams, my ancestor. 
   One of the real thrills of serving in this body is the ability to experience special events. We got that opportunity here tonight when out in Statuary Hall there was a reception and later a special viewing of an incredible new series on HBO dedicated to examining the life of John Adams and the enormous impact he had on this country. 
   I think it is very significant to take a moment and realize that 238 years ago today the Boston Massacre occurred, one of the pivotal events in our country's founding, and John Adams, a noted trial lawyer of his day, was given the dubious distinction of defending the British soldiers who made the first attack on those patriots, those brave patriots like Crispus Attucks. Like many trial lawyers, he was faced with the responsibility of doing his duty to perform an unpleasant task, and he did it because he knew that it was an important part of maintaining a system of laws, not of men. 
   I also think it is important to note that of those people like John Adams  who were present at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, 24 of them were lawyers who understood the importance of the very issues we are talking about today. 
   Why do I know that? Because if you read the Declaration of Independence, you will see the stated grievances against King George and that the amazing parallels in those grievances that they were discussing at the founding of our Nation and the same things we are talking about today is stark. 
   Let me remind you of what is in the Declaration. These are the grievances they identified against King George III. 
   For depriving us in many cases of the right to trial by jury, which is why the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights guarantees the trial by jury in all civil cases where the monetary value is in excess of $15. 
   Also the grievance for taking and abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our government. 
   Third, for suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves, the king, vested with the powers to legislate for us. 
   That is why these are fundamental civil rights that have been part of this country's history since its founding that we are talking about. 
   My friend from Colorado made a great point. What we are talking about with the setting up of the FISA courts was setting up retroactive warranties that gave the government the extraordinary ability to do wiretapping without a court order, which had never been before tolerated in this country, with the understanding that the terrorism risk justified that sacrifice, and setting up the FISA courts for an orderly form of due process to look backwards and guarantee that human rights were not being violated. So we are talking here about retroactive immunity, when we have already got retroactive warranties and a process in place to take care of these concerns. 
   One of the things that nobody has talked about on the floor during the debate over this issue is the fact that retroactive immunity only benefits wrongdoers. If you have done nothing wrong under the law or the Constitution, you don't need immunity. 
   My friends have been talking about the underlying basis for the violation of laws by the telecoms, and I think we need to state what that is. It goes back to 1934. The Federal Communications Act, Section 222, this Congress imposed on telecommunication carriers, such as all these companies we are talking about, the duty under law to protect sensitive personal customer information from disclosure. That is the basic statutory right that is at stake by allowing retroactive immunity to companies who violate that law. 
   So when people complain about us arguing the merits of standing up for defense of the Constitution and the laws passed by this Congress, I am at a loss to understand why we should be subject to all of this angst for simply doing our jobs and standing up for the oath we took when we were sworn in to uphold and defend the Constitution and the laws of this country. 
   With that, I yield back to my friend.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. That is the very essence of the authority given to these telecommunications carriers, to use that public trust of allowing them to monitor and handle communications through a system of phone lines, which is what we had back in 1934, and in exchange for that trust, imposing on them the duty to protect that sensitive information. That is why we have the Fourth Amendment. That is why we have a system in place to guarantee the privacy of those customers.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. If you would yield for another question, I am going to pose this to all of my friends here on the floor. 
   When somebody comes to me and asks me to ignore my duties to make sure that the laws and the Constitution are followed, which is what they are asking us to do by granting immunity to these phone companies, I think the average American citizen would expect at a minimum that I would be aware of what was in these documents that are at the subject of this request for immunity. 
   I don't know about the rest of you, but I haven't seen a single document that has been produced in order to supposedly justify a claim for immunity. I am just curious whether any of my friends have seen them in their capacity as a Member of Congress?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, while President Bush and congressional Republicans sit on the sideline demanding that this House rubber-stamp the Senate-passed FISA bill, House and Senate Democrats are doing exactly what's expected of us, working to iron out differences between different FISA bills passed earlier in the two Chambers. 
   Last November, the House passed the RESTORE Act that modernizes the FISA law by giving the intelligence community the tools it needs to track terrorists while protecting the constitutional rights of innocent Americans. 
   The Bush administration objects to our legislation because we oppose giving blanket immunity to telecommunications companies who turned over information about their customers. Today, our committees continue to review telecom documents so that we can ensure the companies' actions are thoroughly reviewed and they are held appropriately accountable. 
   Madam Speaker, despite the fear-mongering from the President, his own administration says the intelligence community still has access to all the information it did last month. We have time to get this critical legislation right, and that's exactly what we plan to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Here is a three syllable world I will throw out right now: Paradox. Right now it is planting season in Iowa, and farmers are going out and growing renewable energy, so that we can become energy independent, we can reduce our dependence on Mideast oil, we can promote national security, we can promote economic security, we can provide jobs, good paying jobs, to the people of this country. 
   Yet, at the same time, while those Iowa farmers are out there driving around in their pickup trucks, getting deliveries from their co-ops for their crop inputs, the cost of producing renewable fuels is directly impacted by what you see on that chart. Whether it is gasoline in the pickup truck, whether it is diesel fuel that is affected by periodic price influxes, one thing we know is that the cost of getting energy independence goes up. And is it any wonder when we look at who we are shifting our dependence from, people who create energy from fossil fuels, and look at who is going to benefit from these record oil company profits, that many of us campaigned on and made the case to the American people, give us a chance to have an impact. 
   That is why I was very proud to be a cosponsor of Representative Stupak's bill. This whole Congress has been about increased accountability, increased oversight, because that is what the American people demanded when they sent us to Congress. 
   Yet every day in these oversight hearings we are talking about important problems that the people demand solutions to. We take important votes on progressive bills that are going to change the direction of this country. And every day we get the same message from the White House: If you pass this bill that is good for the American people, I won't sign it. 
   A good example of that. The first bill I had to be voted on on the floor of the House of Representatives, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act. It sounds pretty good. It sounds consistent with the President's statement on the importance of creating fair contracting opportunities for small businesses in 2002. Overwhelming bipartisan support in committee. Everybody voted for it. Overwhelming bipartisan support here on the floor. 409 people voted for it. Yet the President said it was a bad bill.  
   That is a symptom of the greater problem we are talking about. It is an interrelated problem, whether you are talking about energy, whether you are talking about ethics. That is why we are here tonight, to start shedding some light on the important point of where the buck stops on the problems we are talking about. 
   I yield back on that to my distinguished friend from the great State of Florida, which, unfortunately, entered the Union right before the State of Iowa, Mr. Kline.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. All of us have our own natural disasters we deal with on an annual basis. This point was driven home with me in February when a huge ice storm hit my State. We had 350,000 people without power. The 133rd of the Iowa National Guard has been stationed in Iraq for over a year and had their deployment extended by another 120 days. They were struggling with people available to respond to this very significant demand for assistance. So that is when you understand in a very real way how foreign policy affects domestic policy in your district. 
   But as my friend from Vermont knows, when he was talking about the need to preserve the heritage of agriculture in this country and its importance to our economy, my great-great-grandfather, George Washington Braley, walked from Vermont in Mr. Welch's district to Iowa in 1855 looking for better farmland, Mr. Perlmutter, better rain. 
   My parents both grew up on farms in Iowa during the Depression, and the whole sense of stewardship and preserving the land for the next generation is something that is almost a spiritual quality about farming. I know there are very many people looking for ways to diversify their agricultural economy. 
   Mr. Klein, you raised a very good point about the multiplier effect of renewable energy. Right now Iowa ranks third in the production of wind power, which surprises people. They go to Palm Springs and see those huge wind farms, and they know there is also a lot generated in Texas, but Iowa ranks third. Part of the reason for that is windmills have been a way of life in my State for over 150 years. 
   But there is a very acute shortage of wind turbines in this country. People who want to convert to wind energy and want to have the ability to produce electricity from wind are facing significant shortages of turbines, specifically those manufactured in the United States. A lot of people, municipalities that are looking to convert to wind have to go to the European market because they are on long waiting lists from U.S. wind turbine manufacturers. 
   Recently there has been an incentive to factories that are creating new wind turbines. There is a new factory in Iowa that opened up recently. So when we are talking about how this has a ripple effect throughout our economy, it creates jobs and incentive for people to try new and innovative energy technologies, and we all benefit from that. That needs to be part of the overall discussion we are having about how we create incentives to move people to clean energy sources.

   One of the things that I talk to people a lot about coming from Iowa is how it just amazes me how other people really struggle with the sense of open and fair government because the State that I come from has probably the most fair reapportionment system of any State that I know of. In fact, there's been national news articles written about it.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Because there's a bipartisan commission every 10 years that is balanced by geography and that's required to come up with a plan that is fair and equitable, and the State legislature can only vote the plan up or down on the first two tries, and not until the third try can they tinker with the boundaries. And in all the years that plan has been in place, not once has the legislature ever gotten to the point of redrawing districts, and people accept it because it's done in a way that creates a sense of fairness, a sense of openness and a sense of accountability. 
   And I think that really gets to the heart of what we're trying to talk about in the need to make sure that people have confidence that this body that we are proud and privileged to serve in is that same type of open, honest and accountable place to do business. 
   So I'm very, very excited to be with my freshmen colleagues talking about why we ran on a platform of restoring ethics and accountability in Congress, and I'm very pleased that we are bringing together collective experiences from all over the country, the experience that you bring from your backgrounds of working in your own State legislatures, and knowing that people have a right to expect this type of accountability when they walk into the voting booth and put your name on their ballot.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I want to just follow up on your comment that I think is very prudent that we hear about that people don't talk about a lot, and that is the disappearing American middle class. And I'm here surrounded by distinguished colleagues, and I'm going to make you the economic physicians and make a diagnosis. 
   If you look at the symptoms of what we talked about, all of us, out on the campaign trail leading up to last November's election, you look at the fact that you've got 47 million Americans without health insurance, 37 million Americans living below the poverty line. That sets a floor of where your middle class starts, and when those numbers keep growing, we know, at least I think we should know, that we've got a problem, that we need to do more to drive those numbers into what we've traditionally associated with the middle class, which says that if you work hard, you play by the rules, and you get minimum opportunities to assist you to get up a rung on the economic ladder, you're going to do better, your family's going to do better, your children are going to do better and you're going to create a stable environment that contributes not just to this society but to the way that we think of ourselves as Americans.

   A member of the Iowa Legislature, Representative Ray Zirkelbach, has been serving and has missed two sessions of the Iowa Legislature because of the extension of their deployment. 
   I am very, very proud of the Ironman Battalion. I am in frequent contact with their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Correll, who is also from my district, Strawberry Point. I think it's significant that as we head into this Memorial Day weekend, people like me, my father served in the Marine Corps on Iwo Jima, that affected his entire life, my brother works at a VA hospital in Knoxville, Iowa; it's important that we pause and reflect on these sacrifices that we talk about every day in this Chamber, but also that we honor the brave men and women serving this country. 
   I think this program is going to do an excellent job of exposing everyday, middle-class Americans who picked up out of their very busy lives to serve this country in its time of need, and I think it will be a very informative and rewarding experience for everyone.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Jewish American Heritage Month to honor the life and memory of Rabbi Roland B. Gittelsohn, who was the first Jewish chaplain ever appointed by the Marine Corps. 
   Most Americans don't recognize the name of Rabbi Gittelsohn, but they should. Rabbi Gittelsohn delivered a stirring eulogy to the war dead on Iwo Jima that is second only to the Gettysburg Address of President Lincoln as a stirring ode to the principles of democracy that are the bedrock of this country and the young men and women who paid the ultimate price for our freedom. 
   During World War II, Rabbi Gittelsohn was assigned as a Jewish divisional chaplain of the 5th Marine Division. During the Battle of Iwo Jima, Rabbi Gittelsohn was right in the heart in the action, ministering to the needs of Marines of all faith, with the knowledge that his life was in grave danger. 
   After the fighting was over, Rabbi Gittelsohn was asked to give a sermon at an ecumenical memorial service dedicating the 5th Marine Division cemetery on Iwo Jima, but due to prejudice he only gave remarks at a small Jewish service. Here are his words. 
   ``Here before us lie the bodies of comrades and friends, men who until yesterday or last week laughed with us, joked with us, trained with us, men who fought with us and feared with us. Somewhere in this plot of ground there may lie the man who could have discovered the cure for cancer. Under one of these Christian crosses or beneath a Jewish Star of David, there may now rest a man who was destined to be a great prophet, to find the way perhaps for all to live in plenty, with poverty and hardship for none. Now they lie here silently in this sacred soil, and we gather to consecrate the earth in their memory. 
   ``It is not easy to do so. Some of us have buried our closest friends here. To speak in memory of such men as these is not easy. No, our poor power of speech can add nothing to what these men have already done. All that we can even hope to do is to follow their example, to show the same selfless courage in peace that they did in war; to swear that by the grace of God and the stubborn strength and power of the human will, their sons and ours will never suffer these pains again. These men have done their job well. They have paid the ghastly price of freedom. 
   ``We dedicate ourselves, first, to live together in peace the way they fought and are buried in this war. Here lie officers and men, Negroes and whites, rich men and poor, together. Here, no man prefers another because of his faith or despises him because of his color. Here, there are no quotas of how many from each group are admitted or allowed. Among these men there is no discrimination, no prejudices, no hatred. Theirs is the highest and purest democracy. 
   ``Any man among the living who fails to understand that will thereby betray those who lie here dead. Whoever of us lifts up his hand in hate against a brother or thinks himself superior to those who happen to be in the minority makes of this ceremony and the bloody sacrifice it commemorates an empty, hollow mockery. To this, then, as our solemn, sacred duty, do we the living now dedicate ourselves to the rights of Protestants, Catholics, and Jews, of white men and Negroes alike, to enjoy the democracy for which all of them have paid the price. 
   ``When the last shot has been fired, there will be those whose eyes are turned backward, not forward, who will be satisfied with wide extremes of poverty and wealth in which the seeds of another war can breed. We promise you, our departed comrades, this too we will not permit. This war has been fought by the common man. Its fruits of peace must be enjoyed by the common man. We promise, by all that is sacred and holy, that your sons, the sons of miners and millers, the sons of farmers and workers, the right to a living that is decent and secure. 
   ``When the final cross has been placed in the last cemetery, once again there will be those to whom profit will be more important than peace. To those who sleep here silent, we give our promise: We will not listen. We will not forget that some of you paid the ultimate price for men who profit at your expense. We will remember you as you looked when we placed you reverently, lovingly, in the ground. 
   Thus do we memorialize those who, having ceased living with us, now live within us again. Thus do we consecrate ourselves to the living to carry on the struggle they began. Too much blood has gone into this soil for us to let it lie barren. Too much pain and heartache have fertilized the earth on which we stand. We here solemnly swear, this shall not be in vain. Out of this, and from the suffering and sorrow of those who mourn this, will come, we promise, the birth of a new freedom for the sons of men everywhere.'' 
   My father served in the 5th Marine Division on Iwo Jima, and it is to his memory and the memory of Rabbi Gittelsohn that I offer these poignant words.

Competing for Princeton University, he lost just one dual meet match. Later, as a research student at the London School of Economics, he went on to compete in freestyle matches. In 1995, he was awarded the Outstanding American Award from the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. 
   His wrestler's spirit was evident in his public service, as he took a disciplined and hard working approach to his duties. For thirty years, Congressman Leach served his constituents, and he never lost touch of his Davenport roots. As an original cosponsor of HR 1505, I am proud to support the James A.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose the amendment by the gentleman from Texas, which would prohibit funding in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for the new Environmental Science Center at the University of Dubuque in Iowa. When opened, this Center will provide State, regional, and national benefit through educating undergraduate and graduate level students in the environmental sciences, and helping to create the next generation of science professionals. 
   The need for greater science education has received a lot of attention in recent years, and is an integral component of ensuring America's global competitiveness. As a Member of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Caucus, I believe strongly in the need for investment in science education, and I recognize the direct role that the Environmental Science Center plays in keeping America competitive. 
   The University of Dubuque has offered an interdisciplinary major in Environmental Science since 1980, with many graduates currently working in scientific fields. The environmental science program at the university is unique because of its hands-on focus and strict scientific training. In nearly every course, a field laboratory provides direct, applied experiences for all types of students. Furthermore, University of Dubuque's tri-state location affords students the opportunity to work with three State natural resource agencies--Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Even as an undergraduate, students are able to receive a regionally based scientific education. 
   The new Environmental Science Center will allow the university to expand on its proven record of educating national scientific leaders. The Center will specialize in hands-on, applied learning for current science teachers, environmental agency personnel, undergraduate environmental science majors, and education majors to teach the next generation of American scientists. A failure to fund the Environmental Science Center would be a step backward for America's scientific proficiency. 
   This funding is consistent with the President's goal to, ``encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our Nation's children a firm grounding in math and science.'' [President George W. Bush, State of the Union Address, February 1, 2006] America needs facilities like the University of Dubuque's Environmental Science Center to provide a grounding in science, and help move America forward. 
   I strongly oppose the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas, because it will set America back in terms of global competitiveness and will endanger programs that will educate the next generation and allow them to  compete with the likes of China, Europe, Japan, and Asia.

   John Deere has a long history in Iowa. Iowa farmers were using John Deere plows to break the prairie in 1837 before Iowa even became a State. In 1918, John Deere purchased the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company which transformed the company into a national leader for farm machine production. In fact, the ``Waterloo Boy'' tractor is displayed at the Smithsonian. In the 1940s, Deere expanded by building an industrial equipment factory in Dubuque. 
   John Deere is the world's leading manufacturer of agricultural and forestry equipment and today employs around 47,000 people worldwide, and nearly 10,000 of them are in my district. I'm proud to have such a John Deere presence in my district, and I'm pleased that the company scored high in the areas of climate change, human rights, and philanthropy.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 175, which helps children of fallen soldiers access military death benefits. I would like to express my deep appreciation to my friend, Congressman LATHAM, for taking the lead on this issue. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. 
   On June 5th, 2006, Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Jaime Jaenke was killed in Iraq when her Humvee was hit by a roadside bomb. Ms. Jaenke, from Iowa Falls, was the first female from Iowa to die in the Iraq conflict. 
   Jaenke left behind a daughter, Kayla, who is cared for by Jaenke's parents. She had designated her mother, Susan, as the beneficiary of a $100,000 death benefit intended to help survivors. However, under law, only spouses or children are allowed to receive the benefit, so it must be kept in a trust for Kayla until she turns 18. 
   But the Jaenkes need the money now. They incurred unanticipated expenses such as hiring a lawyer to get legal guardianship and obtaining health insurance for Kayla. They also had funeral costs and other expenses, even as their horse stable was losing money. 
   Congressman LATHAM's resolution would express the sense of Congress that courts should have the discretion to redistribute death benefits to caretakers if the service member left clear intent for the use of these funds. This would be a Godsend to the Jaenkes and the at least 143 identical cases where other families are affected by these same circumstances. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to act, and they need to act fast, to help the families of those who have given so much for their countries. These families already have to face the anguish of losing a son or a daughter. They should not have to worry about the financial strain of dealing with unexpected expenses. I urge all of my colleagues to send a strong message to our military families that we understand the need for flexibility in protecting these families from unintended consequences.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate an historic event that occurred in this Chamber 91 years ago during the middle of the Great War, the war to end all wars. 
   On January 10, 1918, this House passed a constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote by a vote of 274 to 136. Representative Jeanette Rankin from Montana, the first woman to serve in this body, whose statue appears in Statuary Hall and who became the first woman to serve in Congress in 1917, asked her male colleagues this important question in asking them to support that amendment: ``How shall we answer the challenge, gentlemen?'' 
   Her question is worth repeating today as President Bush prepares to escalate the war in Iraq. We need to repeat her question: How shall we answer this challenge?

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a simple, commonsense amendment that requires the President to submit a report to Congress on the long-term costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   On June 28 of this year, Chairman Murtha sent a Dear Colleague letter out talking about this very problem and the need to make sure that we are being given accurate information. We have now been engaged in the war in Afghanistan for almost 7 years and the war in Iraq for over 5 years, and the Bush administration has yet to submit a long-term estimate for the costs of the war. The administration has not submitted a cost estimate, despite a statutory reporting requirement for fiscal years 2006 through 2011 that was required in the fiscal year 2005 defense appropriation budget. 
   As someone who took great interest in the Iraq Study Group report and the massive commitment to the future of Iraq in both blood and treasure, I looked forward to the publication of the Independent Review Group report that was issued in the wake of the Walter Reed Building 18 fiasco. 
   One of the things that was recognized in that report was the fact that the Nation must recognize that there is a moral, human and budgetary cost of the war. When we engage in armed conflict, we must recognize those costs and be prepared to execute on those obligations. 
   The Independent Review Group's report, chaired by General Togo West, also identified the four signature wounds of this war: Traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, increased survival of severe burns, and traumatic amputations. 
   Mr. Chairman, despite the fact that the Bush administration has not provided the required cost reporting, Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has published a study talking about these exact costs, not just the long-term medical costs, but the cost of rebuilding our military in the book ``The $3 Trillion War.'' 
   One of the things we know is that young men who are severely injured, many of them age 19 or 20, are going to have permanent injuries from these signature wounds, many of them over a life expectancy that may stretch out 55 or 60 years. We also know that there are life-care plans used by medical economists and prosthetic needs analysis that are used to determine what those long-term costs are. The American people, the American taxpayers, deserve to know what these costs will be. 
   We have already spent $700 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the people of this country deserve to know from the Department of Defense what these long-term costs are going to be over the lifetime of these wounded warriors.     
   For that reason I have asked that this amendment be included as part of the defense authorization bill to address the long-term and hidden costs of the war. And those are reflected in the testimony of Lieutenant General Chip Rodman at the Independent Review Group hearing that we held in oversight who said, we recognize the cost is immense, and it is our moral obligation to address those issues. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for my friend and colleague from California, and I would just like to point out that this is already a subject that has been considered by the Department of Defense. 
   When we had the hearings in association with Walter Reed and the independent review group, top medical Army officers admitted that they have the capacity using the numbers that are available to make the types of projections that are being considered by this bill. 
   The two scenarios that we are talking about are based upon illustrative scenarios that the CBO has already used and estimated the long-term costs of this war. 
   The third estimate allows the administration to base their cost estimates on their own parameters, including the operational costs, the reconstruction costs, the costs to government contractors, private military security firms, and providing lifetime health care and disability benefits for veterans. We know this is done on a daily basis in the private sector, because these types of projections are made for people suffering these very same signature wounds who are injured in automobile collisions and then taken care of by Federal dollars. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Deere & Company on their 90th anniversary in Waterloo, Iowa. John Deere has been in Waterloo since March 14 of 1918, when it bought the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company, maker of the ``Waterloo Boy'' two-cylinder tractor, for $2.35 million. That model is still located at the Smithsonian Institution. 
   Today Deere's facilities in Waterloo include a foundry, the engine works, and the tractor assembly plant, making Deere & Company a multibillion-dollar corporation. 
   Over the past 90 years, John Deere has been an integral part of the Waterloo economy. The company employs thousands of Iowans and is currently the largest manufacturing employer in Waterloo. John Deere is in the midst of a fifth consecutive year of record earnings. If that continues, it would match the previous 5-year record run in the nineties and would have produced record earnings 10 times in the past 15 years. 
   That's quite a feat for a company that was down and out during the 1980s farm crisis, which saw mass layoffs at its facilities. A strong John Deere is fundamental to promoting a healthy and stable economy in the Cedar Valley. 
   Due to its successes, Deere has been able to give back to the community in a big way, and I congratulate them on their successes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3997, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act. I am especially pleased that this bill includes a crucial provision from H.R. 3736, the Combat Pay Tax Flexibility Act, which I recently introduced to permanently allow members of the Armed Forces to treat combat pay as earned income in calculating their Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). 
   Because income earned while serving in a combat zone is exempt from income taxes, many low-income military families recently faced the loss or reduction of their EITC, as deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan shifted their income to nontaxable combat pay. While Congress acted to fix this problem by providing troops the option of calculating combat  pay for the EITC, without further Congressional action this tax credit will expire at the end of the year. 
   I introduced the Combat Pay Tax Flexibility Act to ensure that this tax savings provision is always there for the military families that need it. Soldiers who serve in hostile places make a great sacrifice for our country, and the least we can do is help them make the most of the tax savings available to them. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Rangel for working with me to incorporate the Combat Pay Tax Flexibility Act into the legislation before us today, and for moving this legislation swiftly. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3997 today to ensure that our troops have the financial resources they need throughout the cycle of deployment.

   President Bush has, once again, called for drilling in ANWR even though his own Energy Department has said that opening up the Arctic would only save pennies per gallon 10 years from now. Now the President has suggested opening up the Outer Continental Shelf to drilling even though 80 percent of the oil available there is already open to leasing. 
   Why would we give Big Oil access to more of our land and waters if they refuse to drill on the 68 million acres they have now? If President Bush believes that drilling is the answer, why isn't he demanding that Big Oil use the land they already have? 
   Mr. Speaker, Republicans have repeated the same domestic drilling rhetoric for years. Tomorrow they have the chance to act on that rhetoric and to tell Big Oil to either use it or lose it by joining us in passing the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act of 2008.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my almamater, Iowa State University, for 150 years of service to Iowa and the Nation. Iowa State University was founded on March 22, 1858, as the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm. The college was one of the first land grant institutions in the country and was founded in response to the state of Iowa's strong desire to provide higher education opportunities to farm families and the working class in Iowa. 
   I'm proud to say that my alma mater has taken an active role in promoting social justice and racial equality throughout its 150 year history. Iowa State University was the first coeducational land grant university graduating 16 women in its first graduating class. George Washington Carver was the first African American to graduate from the college in 1880 and later served as a faculty member at Iowa State. Women suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt also graduated from Iowa State in 1880. Finally, Iowa State is home to the only division one football stadium to be named for an African American. Jack Trice stadium is named for Iowa State football player Jack Trice. Trice died due to injuries suffered during an Iowa State football game in 1923. 
   Some of the biggest technological advancements in the world of science were made at Iowa State University. In the late 1930's Professor John Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry invented the first electronic digital computer at Iowa State. In the 1920's hybrid seed corn was developed at Iowa State and in the 1930's Professor Orland Sweeny conducted pioneer work on ethanol production from corn. Finally, the school established the Nation's first engineering experiment station and domestic economy experimental kitchen, and one of the first agricultural experiment stations. 
   I'm proud to call Iowa State my alma mater and congratulate them for 150 years of academic excellence. I urge my colleagues to join with me in congratulating the Iowa Sate community for all they have done and will continue to do for Iowa and the nation

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time, and for her extraordinary leadership on this important measure. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today as the voice for 350,000 Iowans who lost power during an ice storm in February, to express my strong support for H.R. 1361, the RECOVER Act. This bill will develop a disaster plan so that the Small Business Administration can adequately assist small businesses in emergencies. 
   Just this February, Iowa was hit with a massive ice storm, one of the worst in its history, which caused millions of dollars worth of damage throughout the State and left hundreds of thousands of people without power. 
   Weather in Iowa, like in many parts of the country, can be unpredictable and dangerous, and this was no exception. I was personally affected by this ice storm when a 40-foot ice-coated branch struck my home in Waterloo. With the help of my neighbors and our chain saws, I was able to cope with some minor property damage and personal inconvenience; but my situation paled in comparison to the constituents I met while visiting emergency storm shelters in Iowa's First Congressional District. These Iowans were there seeking refuge after they had been displaced from their homes and businesses as a result of the ice storm. 
   On March 15, the Small Business Committee held a markup of the RECOVER Act. I introduced an amendment that day to expand the scope of Federal disaster assistance available to small businesses. Currently, the SBA has to wait for the President to make a formal disaster declaration before giving disaster loans to small businesses. 
   There are exceptions, however. These include severe situations such as ``floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, explosions, volcanoes, windstorms, landslides or mudslides, tidal waves'' and other civil disorders. 
   The amendment I proposed adds ``ice storms and blizzards'' to this list of exceptions. The language will benefit small business owners who are trying to get back on their feet following severe winter weather. 
   I was pleased that the amendment received overwhelming bipartisan support and was passed by the committee unanimously. I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of assisting small businesses in reopening following a disaster and ask them to support the RECOVER Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my concerns about the way taxpayer funds have recently been spent at the General Services Administration (GSA). Today, the House is expected to pass H.R. 2829, a bill which makes appropriations for financial services and general government for Fiscal Year 2008, and which provides funding for the GSA. 
   If any agency should be trusted to spend American taxpayers' money responsibly, it is the GSA, the federal government's premier acquisition agency. Unfortunately, reports that current GSA Administrator Lurita Doan used federal government property and resources to engage in partisan campaign activities with political appointees of the GSA provide evidence that the head of this agency has placed the interests of the Republican party over the interests of the American public. 
   On January 26, 2007 Ms. Doan attended a meeting at GSA at which J. Scott Jennings, the Special Assistant to the President and the Deputy Director of Political Affairs at the White House, gave a 28-page PowerPoint presentation which reviewed the 2006 election results and outlined the Republican party's top targets in upcoming elections. According to several witnesses who attended the meeting, after this presentation Ms. Doan asked the more than 30 political appointees in attendance how they could use GSA resources to help Republican candidates win future elections. This presentation and Ms. Doan's comments are not only blatant violations of the Hatch Act, which restricts the political activities of Executive Branch employees, but are also a gross abuse of taxpayers' money and trust. 
   Ms. Doan has appeared twice before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and claims that she cannot remember Mr. Jennings' presentation, or the comments she made. Despite the fact that the Office of Special Counsel found that Ms. Doan ``violated the Hatch Act's prohibition against using [her] official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election when [she] solicited over thirty subordinate employees to engage in political activity,'' she also claims that she cannot answer questions about the legality or appropriateness of the briefing. In light of Ms. Doan's lack of contrition and apparent confusion about what constitutes an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars, it is understandable that many of us in the Congress would be concerned about the way the funds we are appropriating today to GSA will be used. 
   While I support the passage of this bill, I believe that we must continue to work to ensure that appropriated GSA funds are spent on legal and legitimate purposes--like managing federal buildings, buying government equipment and supplies, and working with other agencies to purchase goods and services for the government. I hope and trust that the funds we are appropriating to GSA today will be spent legally and responsibly, and I look forward to continuing our Congressional oversight of the GSA.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 4881, the Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2008, is a very simple bill and a very timely bill. It prevents companies that don't pay their taxes from receiving contracts with the Federal Government. Today, people across the country are finishing up their tax returns to submit to the IRS by tomorrow. Nobody likes to pay taxes, but the vast majority of American families and companies obey the law and comply with their responsibilities as citizens and taxpayers.     
   Unfortunately, some people do not follow the law and have serious delinquencies in paying taxes to the IRS. 
   What is shocking to me and honest taxpayers across the country is that many companies that didn't pay their taxes were benefiting from Federal Government contracts. GAO studies over the past few years have identified more than 50,000 contractors owing nearly $8 billion in unpaid Federal taxes. This bill will put an end to that problem once and for all. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4881 establishes a process to prohibit companies with seriously delinquent Federal tax debt from receiving new Federal contracts and grants. It will reward responsible taxpaying contractors with more opportunities to continue serving the Federal Government for abiding by the law. And it should increase collections because companies will get current on their tax bills if they want to continue receiving Federal contracts. With a mounting Federal budget deficit and rising obligations, the Federal Government cannot afford to leave billions of dollars in tax revenue uncollected. 
   The sponsor of H.R. 4881, Mr. Ellsworth from Indiana, has put in a lot of work on this bill, and I want to thank him for his efforts. As a former sheriff, he wants to make sure people who break the law are not rewarded. 
   When we get into contracting and tax law, the law gets complicated. He has worked hard to make sure this law will not have unintended consequences. We also received guidance from our colleagues on the Ways and Means and Joint Tax Committees. I would like to thank my friend from New York (Mr. Rangel) and his staff for their assistance. 
   Chairman Waxman and Chairman Rangel exchanged letters regarding committee jurisdiction on this bill, and I ask that these letters be placed in the Record. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is of monumental importance to improving fairness and efficiency in Federal contracting. I fully support its passage and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, last September, I introduced H.R. 3548, the Plain Language in Government Communications Act, and I rise today to talk about the responsibility of this government to communicate effectively with its constituents. 
   I know that lawyers are often blamed for the legalese that makes government documents so difficult to read and understand. Some might find it unusual that this ``Plain Language'' bill was introduced by someone who practiced law for 23 years before being elected to Congress. They might be surprised to learn that the use of clear,  concise language in communications has been a passion of mine since I began practicing law in 1983, when the Iowa Supreme Court adopted plain language requirements for jury instructions. Since that time, I have been writing and speaking about the importance of using plain language to improve both written and spoken communications. 
   I was proud to introduce the Plain Language in Government Communications Act, a bill that requires the Federal Government to write documents such as letters from the Social Security Administration or a notice from the Department of Veterans Affairs in simple, easy-to-understand language. This bill has been endorsed by a broad array of organizations, including the AARP, National Federation of Independent Businesses, Disabled American Veterans, the Small Business Association, Women Impacting Policy, the American Nurses Association, and the American Library Association. 
   I want to thank the Information Policy Subcommittee Chairman William Lacy Clay and Ranking Member Michael Turner, as well as Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Henry Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis for their support of this important legislation. I am pleased that this bill has such strong bipartisan support and passed unanimously in both of these committees. 
   Anyone who has done their own taxes knows the headache of trying to understand pages and pages of confusing forms and instructions. There is no reason why the Federal Government can't write tax documents and other public documents in language we can all understand. 
   Writing government documents in plain language will increase government accountability and will save Americans time and money. Plain, straightforward language makes it easy for taxpayers to understand what the Federal Government is doing and what services it's offering. 
   Small businesses will also see substantial benefits by eliminating Federal gobbledygook. Small businesses often have limited resources and are forced to hire lawyers and outside consultants to navigate the maze of Federal paperwork and convoluted language. 
   The National Federation of Independent Businesses estimates that the average per hour cost of paperwork and record keeping for small businesses is $48.72 per hour. The use of clear, easy-to-understand language in government paperwork will substantially reduce burdens on small businesses. 
   The Plain Language in Government Communications Act will require the Federal Government to write new publications, forms and publicly distributed documents in a clear, concise, well organized manner that follows the best practices of plain language writing. 
   I have in my hand the Plain Language Handbook that's already being used by the Securities Exchange Commission, along with the Federal Plain Language guidelines which were adopted under another plain language initiative that began under President Clinton. These guidelines make it clear that the ultimate purpose of any communication from the Federal Government should be to reach the intended audience, the constituents and citizens of this country, in language they can understand and act upon. 
   Using complex language in government forms, letters, notices and instructions imposes unnecessary hardships on citizens. Replacing complex language with plain language will improve services to the public, save time agencies spend answering questions about what documents mean, and make it easier to hold government agencies accountable for their work. 
   This document to my right is a perfect example of what I'm talking about when I talk about the problem posed by using gobbledygook in Federal communications. This is a quote from a former Secretary of Defense, and it says, ``There are known knowns. These are things we know we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are some things we know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. These are things we don't know we don't know.''     
   That is the problem we are trying to address with this bill. 
   One other example is this language from a Federal contract requiring investigations of contracts to make sure that they are living up to the purpose that they were intended to perform. This is the original language that was contained in the contracting compliance document, and it covers almost an entire page. The plain language version of that same admonition says simply: ``We will take two steps to look at this matter. We will find out if it was an error or a fraud, and we will let you know the result.'' Clear, concise, and directed to the intended audience. 
   Finally, one of the best examples of the cost-savings potential is this Veterans Administration form that was used to respond to concerns raised by veterans seeking assistance with their benefits. An old letter that was not drafted in plain language generated an average of 91.4 calls per month, a total of 10,968 calls in a year. After that same form was drafted using these very basic plain language guidelines, they resulted in only 16 calls per month and a total of 1,900 calls for the entire year. You can imagine the enormous savings of time at the Veterans Administration responding to concerns from veterans seeking assistance when you reduce it by that much. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's important to clarify that nothing in this bill is intended to impact the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 13166, Department of Justice LEP Guidance, any agency LEP guidance, or any other statute, executive order, agency guidance, regulation, or court order regarding language access. 
   I hope this bill makes it easier for Americans and small businesses to work with and understand their government. I also hope that in some small way, this bill honors the memory of our former colleague, Maury Maverick, Sr., who served two terms in the House from 1935 to 1939. Congressman Maverick invented the term ``gobbledygook'' to describe bureaucratic language that was as hard to understand as the call of wild turkeys in his native South Texas. 
   I want to thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who join me today in standing up for plain language, in standing up for effective communications with our constituents, in standing up for small business owners, and in standing up for taxpayers, who will see significant cost savings when this bill is signed into law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, even after losing 3,200 American lives and spending billions of taxpayer dollars since declaring ``Mission Accomplished'' 4 years ago, the Bush administration continues to demand an open-ended commitment of American troops in Iraq.

   This Democratic Congress put forth a plan for a responsible end to the war consistent with our national security needs. 
   Even Secretary of Defense Gates himself reiterated last month that congressional debate was helpful. He delivered the message to the Iraqi Government that the clock is ticking on U.S. operations there. President Bush's veto yesterday lets the Iraqi Government off the hook and shows the President plans to keep our troops there indefinitely.

Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to remember that, in a time of widespread national disasters, it is important to remember those disasters that have already occurred this year and not forget the impact that they have had on people back in the great State of Iowa, which I am proud to represent in this body. 
   For most of us, May 25th was the day before Memorial Day.

But shortly after all of our guests left, I started following a news story that would have profound implications for me and the people I represent back in Iowa's First District. 
   This wall cloud that is visible on the easel to my right was a wall cloud that brought a devastating EF-5 tornado to the citizens of Parkersburg, New Hartford, Dunkerton and Hazleton, killing eight people, causing widespread destruction in those communities and serious flooding in other parts of my district. And that was what transformed the summer of 2008 for many Iowans.     
   This wall cloud contained this powerful tornado and went right by one of my constituents' farms, that was Senator Charles Grassley, who lives near New Hartford, Iowa. The effects of this powerful tornado can be seen in this photograph, this overhead shot of Parkersburg, Iowa, where nearly one-third of homes and businesses in the south side of Parkersburg were destroyed. 
   You can see here where the high school was destroyed. The folks in Parkersburg are very proud of the fact that four of the graduates of their high school, Aplington-Parkersburg, currently are starters in the National Football League, an extraordinary accomplishment for a town of less than 2,000 people. The widespread devastation as this EF-5 tornado went through Parkersburg will be felt for many years to come and illustrate the need for Federal emergency disaster assistance in times when people are at their most vulnerable. 
   To give you a better view of how individuals were impacted, this photograph shows the widespread destruction that leveled, literally, every home, office, business and building in the swath of the tornado pass through. You can see that the trees are completely denuded of any vegetation. Here you see people that are working hard to clean up an area where one of the homes was destroyed near where two people were killed. 
   I was very proud that when this disaster struck, my staff did a fantastic job of responding to the needs of every community wherever we could. This photograph shows me with my chain saw in front of one of the homes that was completely destroyed shortly after the tornado struck. 
   This is the basement of the home that I was working on and a family whose entire home contents were completely destroyed by the tornado. I kept holding up things that I found in their basement and asking them if they wanted to save it, and they said, well, that's not ours. This is common. 
   There were things that were found, that were taken out of Parkersburg during this tornado, in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, over 100 miles away. 
   On the front edge of the tornado, the town of Lamont had 8 inches of rain in a 24-hour period that flooded the community and caused widespread destruction to their infrastructure, including this bridge, all within the week of Memorial Day. 
   Then, as if that weren't enough, the week after Memorial Day, the town of New Hartford, which had been hit by this EF-5 tornado, was completely overwhelmed by flooding from Beaver Creek. The tragedy of these storms is that, as you can see in the background of downtown New Hartford, the hardware store has left town. The only convenience store, the Kwik Star, has left town and is no longer in business. The places where people went to get their basic necessities are being driven out by the implications of these storms. 
   The town of Elkader, Iowa, up in Clayton County, which is one of the most scenic parts of my district, had a flood predicted at 20 feet for a 12-foot flood stage. The river crested at 31 feet and overwhelmed the community, destroyed the grocery store, flooded businesses and caused widespread destruction to homes in Elkader. 
   Waverly, Iowa, in Bremer County, also suffered widespread damage due to the flooding. The same types of destruction can be seen in their downtown streets, which has enormous implications for infrastructure. Cedar Falls' utilities, completely overwhelmed by the flooding, and a railroad bridge in downtown Waterloo, where I live, will need to be replaced and has an enormous impact on the commerce at John Deere's Waterloo works. 
   The disaster response that this Congress made was immediate and swift, $2.65 billion, but much more is needed to address the needs in the First District and the Second District and other parts of Iowa. It's time for Congress to act and pass a supplemental disaster assistance bill for all of the midwestern flooding and tornado victims and also addresses serious problems from Hurricane Ike and Gustav in our gulf coast. 
   The response initially to this disaster from our Federal disaster agencies was very encouraging, but there has been a backlog in getting the funds that Congress has appropriated through the Federal agencies to the people in need in Iowa. The time to break that backlog is now. 
   We need to start freeing up the Community Development Block Grant money so that it can have an impact in these communities that I have been showing you here tonight. We need to free up other small business loans and other funding that should be getting to the people in need in Iowa, including the people of Cedar Rapids, who were devastated with the highest flood that they have ever seen and has 400 square blocks of downtown Cedar Rapids where homes and businesses were destroyed and need to be rebuilt. 
   That's why the crisis is now. The time to act is now. We need to take advantage of the widespread attention on people in need in this country and address their concerns.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, the crisis on Wall Street impacts Americans across the country. In the coming days, House Democrats will continue our efforts to revive the economy and end the free for all on Wall Street and restore confidence on Main Street. 
   Democrats have restored the kind of oversight that was missing under President Bush and the Republican Congress. The GOP decision to turn a blind eye to financial markets helped pave the way for the financial crisis that has brought down home values across the country and has significantly weakened our economy. Democrats have and will continue to do things differently. 
   This month, Democrats will work to enact a second economic recovery package that will help Americans who have lost their jobs or who are barely making ends meet, and they will create good-paying jobs. That's what we need in our flood-ravaged communities in Iowa. 
   Mr. Speaker, these Bush-McCain economic policies have put America in an economic hole. This month, Republicans will again have a clear choice. Stand with the Bush-McCain plan for more of the same or take action to aid families who are struggling.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is getting harder for American families to make ends meet, especially when it comes to the rising cost of health insurance. 
   New census data shows that the number of Americans without health insurance nationwide rose by nearly 2 million in 2006. In addition, the number of children without health insurance grew by 700,000 to nearly 8.7 million children. These new numbers mean that one in nine American kids don't have health insurance, including 22 percent of Hispanic children and 14 percent of African American children. 
   These numbers are appalling for a Nation as wealthy as ours. That is why the Democratic Congress passed the CHAMP Act; to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for 6 million children and to provide 5 million more children with health insurance, covering a total of 11 million children. But President Bush has threatened to veto this critical bill, despite strong bipartisan support among Congress and Governors. 
   Mr. Speaker, these new census numbers can't be ignored. It is time to stop playing politics with children's health insurance. It is time for the President to support and sign the CHAMP Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the passage of H. Res. 568, a bill honoring and expressing gratitude to the members and families of the 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard. My introduction of this bill last week coincided with the long-awaited homecoming of the 1-133rd, known as the ``Ironman Battalion,'' after a long and extended deployment in Iraq. I am glad that the House has moved swiftly to consider this important resolution, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it today in order to pay tribute to this incredible group of Iowans. 
   Last Wednesday was truly a momentous day in Iowa as the members of the 1-133rd were reunited with their friends, family, and loved ones at a homecoming ceremony in Waterloo after more than a year of service in Iraq. The members and families of the 1-133rd have been in Iowans' thoughts and prayers, and this day of reunion and celebration had been eagerly awaited, since the Battalion left for Iraq last spring. 
   Iowans' admiration and love for the members of the 1-133rd was palpable in Waterloo as an overflow crowd of an estimated 8,000 people packed Riverfront Stadium to welcome the hundreds of men and women of the Battalion home. As the Battalion drove the final miles from Ft. McCoy in Wisconsin, Iowans lined the road to wave at the 1-133rd and waved American flags from overpasses. Sadly, the day was also made bittersweet by the absence of 1-133rd members SGT 1st Class Scott Nisely and SGT Kampha Sourivong, who gave the ultimate sacrifice for their country when they were tragically killed during combat operations in Iraq on September 30, 2006. 
   Many of my colleagues here may already be familiar with the men and women of the 1-133rd if they saw the Memorial Day special 
   edition of ``60 Minutes'' that was dedicated to telling the story of the Battalion. While it is impossible for those who have not served in Iraq to fully understand the experiences of the 1-133rd there, or to comprehend the sacrifices that they and their families have made on behalf of our country, this program gave Americans a small glimpse of the challenges the members of the 1-133rd and their families faced throughout their long deployment, as well as into their incredible perseverance. 
   Iowans who watched the ``60 Minutes'' special featuring the 1-133rd saw the story of their friends, neighbors, and loved ones who chose to serve and sacrifice when their country called upon them. We saw the daily threats of roadside bombs, insurgents, and snipers faced by the members of the 1-133rd in Iraq as they helped deliver fuel to coalition forces. We saw families adjusting back home, and banding together to help one another. We saw the hardship and heartache that was experienced by the members and their families when they received the news that their tour of duty was to be extended from April until this summer. We saw children born while fathers were overseas, and we saw the lives of our fellow Iowans cut tragically short. For me, the program reinforced what I had already learned about the members of the 1-133rd from my frequent communications with their commanding officer, LTC Ben Corell: that they are men and women of great strength and character who selflessly and bravely put their lives on the line every day for their country in Iraq. 
   Throughout their long tour of duty in the al-Anbar province of Iraq, one of the most dangerous parts of the country, the 1-133rd detained over 60 insurgents. They completed over 500 missions providing security for convoys, and logged in over 4 million mission miles. In addition, they have delivered over one-third of the fuel needed to sustain coalition forces in Iraq. Their crucial service, and their extended deployment, are also reflective  of the critical and increasing role of the National Guard in our defense missions overseas. Their contributions to the U.S. mission in Iraq are indeed impressive and commendable, which is why I believe that the entire country should honor and thank the men and women of the 1-133rd for their service and their sacrifices there through the passage of this resolution. 
   The 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard is notable for other reasons as well. They are the longest-serving Iowa military unit since World War II. They are also part of the Army National Guard unit which has served the longest continuous deployment of any Army National Guard unit in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   The men and women of the 1-133rd have made me and so many other Iowans and Americans proud through their work and their sacrifices in Iraq, and I hope that it also gives them and their families pride to reflect upon their accomplishments. I feel incredibly honored and privileged to represent them in the U.S. Congress, and I am so pleased today that the entire House of Representatives will commend and thank them for their service through the passage of H. Res. 568. 
   I am proud to have introduced this bill with the support of 70 bipartisan original co-sponsors, including the entire Iowa Congressional Delegation. The strong support this resolution has on both sides of the aisle is reflective of the pride and gratitude that Americans feel towards our National Guard troops, and all of our men and women serving in uniform. 
   I would like to thank Armed Services Committee Chairman IKE SKELTON and his staff, and Majority Leader HOYER and his staff, for helping to facilitate the swift consideration of this bill by the full House. The United States will be forever indebted to the members and families of the 1-133rd for their service and their sacrifices in Iraq, and I hope that this resolution comes to serve as a genuine expression of thanks from a grateful state and a grateful nation. 
   Again, I would like to commend and thank this incredible Battalion for their work, and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H. Res. 568 today to honor and express gratitude to the men and women of the 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, today we will consider legislation that invests in the future of our Nation and puts us on the path to energy independence. The Energy Independence and Security Act is a significant legislative package that will strengthen our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil. The bill addresses skyrocketing gas prices with increased fuel economy standards that will save American families 700 to $1,000 a year at the pump. It also reduces oil consumption by 1.1 million gallons per day in 2020, one half of what we currently import from the Persian Gulf. And this legislation includes a historic commitment to American biofuels that will fuel our cars and trucks. This investment in hometown crops will create American jobs and protect the environment by reducing carbon emissions. 
   Madam Speaker, the Energy Independence and Security Act will help our Nation invest in resources in the Midwest to improve our environment, instead of relying on Mideastern countries for pollution-heavy fossil fuels. 
   I hope all my colleagues in the House and Senate will support this legislation and help reduce our dependence on foreign oil.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of African Americans in celebration of Black History Month. I find it quite fitting to address the House on this particular date when, in 1869, John Menard, the first African American elected to Congress, presented his case for being unfairly denied his seat as a Representative for the Second Congressional District of Louisiana. His testimony made him the first African American to address Congress on the House floor. 
   Now, almost 140 years later, we bear witness to the fruits of his labor by having 41 African American Members of the U.S. House and 1 African American Member of the United States Senate. That's why I'm so proud to represent the First District of Iowa where, in this great State, we have created a legacy of diversity and our own mark in history. 
   Iowa was home to Lulu Johnson, the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. It is also home to 12 of the Tuskegee Airmen. Iowa State University, my alma mater, educated George Washington Carver and also houses Jack Trice Stadium, the only division 1-A football stadium to be named in honor of an African American. Iowa State also educated the current highest ranking African American health policy adviser in the U.S. House of Representatives, Mr. Aranthan Jones. 
   It's these types of accomplishments that inspire me to continue to work and stand up for people of all backgrounds fighting for justice and working toward equality.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE AND SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, today the House considers legislation related to the burdens placed on everyday taxpayers--the Taxpayer Assistance & Simplification Act. This bill includes a number of good provisions, of which I am supportive. However, the bill also includes a provision which would cost Eastern Iowa hundreds of jobs. While there are various, well-thought-out taxpayer protections in this bill, they do not outweigh the negative impact this bill would have on jobs in the First District. For this reason, I intend to oppose H.R. 5719. 
   Currently, the Internal Revenue Service is allowed to contract with outside agencies for assistance in collecting overdue taxes. After a rigorous competitive bidding process for these contracts, an Eastern Iowa company was fortunate enough to receive one of the contracts, and has been hard at work ever since. While nobody likes to defend the tax man, the fact is, this company employs more than 625 people in Waterloo and another 200 in West Des Moines. 
   Unfortunately, the bill on the floor today includes a provision that would threaten these Waterloo and West Des Moines jobs. This provision would disallow any future contracts, which could directly result in the loss of hundreds of Iowa jobs. As the Representative of Iowa's First District, I cannot support the elimination of these jobs. 
   While I intend to vote against this bill due to this provision, I would like to stress my support for other provisions in this bill: 
   I am supportive of the provision in this bill that requires the IRS to notify taxpayers who may have had their identity stolen. It is unfortunate that the IRS does not already provide this notification, and I believe that protecting the identities of American taxpayers should be a primary goal of government. 
   I am supportive of the provisions in this bill that strengthen additional protections against identity theft, by increasing the penalties for those who mislead our citizens in order to steal private information. Identity theft is a very serious problem, and I am glad Congress is working to help protect Americans from this growing epidemic. 
   I am supportive of the provision in this bill that ensures elderly and disabled individuals receiving in-home care are not subject to employment tax provisions. This is a much-needed change that helps protect our senior citizens and disabled citizens. 
   I am supportive of the provision in this bill to establish a grant program to expand and improve income tax assistance programs to provide services to taxpayers. I am also glad to see that the bill allows IRS employees to refer taxpayers needing assistance with tax cases to taxpayer clinics. As an ardent supporter of tax simplification, this provision ensures help is available to those having trouble with the very complicated process of filing taxes. Just last night I passed H.R. 3548, the Plain Language in Government Communications Act, out of the House. This bill would greatly simplify income tax forms and documents, but until my bill becomes law, these taxpayer assistance clinics will continue to provide valuable services to taxpayers as tax day approaches. 
   I am supportive of the provision in this bill that requires the IRS to notify taxpayers if they are potentially eligible for the Earned 
   Income Tax Credit. This is a good tax credit that should be utilized by everyone who qualifies, and I believe the IRS should help make sure that those who are eligible receive the full benefit. 
   I am supportive of the provision in this bill that looks into the feasibility of providing tax refunds on debit cards. This could create a more convenient process of receiving tax refunds for many taxpayers. 
   I am supportive of the provision in this bill which delays the requirement that Federal, State, and local governments withhold 3 percent from many government payments for goods or services. This 3 percent withholding is bad for small businesses and creates a bureaucratic mess, and I believe this withholding should be eliminated. I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 1023, which would completely repeal the 3 percent withholding. 
   I am supportive of the provision in this bill that eliminates the requirement for individuals and small businesses to keep onerous records of calls made on cell phones to substantiate business use of such devices. I have heard from employers in Iowa's First District about the administrative burden that this creates, and I am glad Congress is reducing this burden. 
   I am supportive of closing the loophole that allows foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, performing services as American companies, to avoid paying taxes. This loophole results in a higher tax burden being placed on America's working families, so I am glad this bill takes this action. 
   Finally, I am supportive of the provision that helps protect against predatory lending by barring the IRS from providing certain services to companies that offer refund anticipation loans, if the IRS determines that the company charges predatory rates. 
   Again, I believe that many of the provision in the Taxpayer Assistance & Simplification Act will help protect American taxpayers and simplify the process of filing taxes. However, these good parts of the bill do not outweigh the direct, negative impact that the bill would have on jobs in Iowa's First District, which is why I oppose this legislation.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, last Thursday, the leadership of the House announced a new trade policy for America. And as this body considers future trade agreements, it would be well to look at the House Ways and Means Committee Web site where a one-page policy on a new trade policy for America is stated. That policy states that our new trade policy will ensure trade agreements raise the standard of living, including requiring companies to adopt, maintain and enforce international labor standards and their domestic laws and practices, thus promoting basic worker rights and acceptable working conditions. 
   We need to make sure that the maintenance and enforcement of those international labor standards are part of any trade agreement on the domestic side of those trade countries that we are negotiating with. 
   The Constitution of the Soviet Union had great statements about protecting the rights of workers and protecting the rights of individuals, and on paper that's what they said, but in reality they meant little. These trade agreements need to have enforcement on the other side to be effective.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule because of the flood relief provisions included in the supplemental funding bill. I'm pleased that this amendment includes $2.65 billion for flood relief in my State and others. And I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule because of this important funding. 
   Iowa is currently experiencing record flooding which is having a widespread and unprecedented impact on people, property and agriculture in the State. Governor Culver has issued an emergency proclamation for 83 of Iowa's 99 counties, all experiencing significant damage due to the combination of severe rainfall, tornadoes, high winds and flooding. Fifty-five Iowa counties have been declared Presidential disaster areas. Seventeen citizens have lost their lives, and many more have been injured. Over 38,000 Iowans have been displaced from their homes already, and thousands more have been disrupted because of the closure, through evacuation, of Iowa hospitals, nursing homes, businesses and schools. More than 18 shelters have been in operation in more than a dozen counties. And it is estimated that 20 percent of the State's cropland has been destroyed. And the flooding still continues. 
   This flooding has impacted everyone in Iowa. And the scope of damages to Iowans' homes, lives and livelihoods is almost beyond description. Some are calling this disaster ``the Katrina of the Midwest.'' If you were to travel around Iowa, you would understand what they are talking about. 
   This unprecedented destruction needs and deserves a swift and special response from Congress. That's why this $2.65 billion flood relief package is so important. Iowans and people across the Midwest impacted by this flooding need immediate help to restart their businesses, salvage their farms and rebuild their lives after this devastating flood. 
   When things get tough in Iowa, Iowans come together to help one another. I would look to thank the Appropriations Committee and the House leadership for coming together and working with me and my colleagues from Iowa to provide this urgently needed flood relief funding. This disaster relief funding is a crucial first step on the road to Iowa's full recovery. And I urge all of my colleagues to support it by voting for this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, the American people agree with the Democratic Congress: It is time to begin responsibly redeploying our troops from Iraq and investing much-needed funds here at home. Instead of beginning to spend less money in Iraq, the President is once again asking Congress to do more; a lot more. 
   Just last week, President Bush increased his request for additional Iraq funding to a total of $189 billion next year, bringing the total cost for the war so far to over $800 billion. Yet, the President has never proposed any way to offset this massive spending; instead, sinking our Nation deeper into debt. 
   This Democratic Congress and the American public have a different set of priorities. We believe in being fiscally responsible and implemented a pay-as-you-go system to stop piling debt on the backs of our Nation's children. That is why our children's health legislation, which helps 10 million children receive the health care coverage they deserve, is fully paid for. 
   Madam Speaker, the President's fiscal priorities are irresponsible and misplaced. He should be reducing the amount we are spending in Iraq so that we can again invest in domestic priorities, like children's health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I would like to take a moment to thank Small Business Committee Chairwoman Nydia Vel&#225;zquez and Ranking Member Steve Chabot for all the great work they have done in the Small Business Committee this year. 
   As Chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on Contracting and Technology and a cosponsor of this legislation, I applaud their efforts on the Small Business Contracting Improvements Act of 2007. This act proposes important improvements to the Small Business Administration's small and minority business procurement programs. 
   Today I am proud to introduce an amendment with Congressman Peter Welch on an issue that could have a potential impact in my district. This amendment requires the Small Business Administration to conduct a study on the effectiveness of the HUBZone program in reaching rural areas. Rural areas make up a big part of my District and I want to ensure that my constituents are not overlooked when it comes to federal contracting opportunities.  
   H.R. 3867 will help small businesses. In the Small Business Subcommittee on Contracting and Technology's first hearing, we heard witnesses representing women-owned businesses describe how the federal government was failing to keep its commitment to them. They talked not only about how the 5 percent goal for women-owned businesses was not being met, but also about how the Women's Procurement Program, which was enacted in 2000, has yet to be implemented by the SBA. This bill will ensure the Women's Procurement Act is finally implemented. 
   I am pleased this legislation also expands procurement opportunities for small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. Additionally, it strengthens community development through changes to the HUBZone program and makes important updates to the 8(a) program, which is one of the most important vehicles for minority business participation in federal contracting. 
   The SBA Office of Advocacy has found that although minorities make up 32% of the population in this country, they constitute only 18% of businesses. It is clear we must provide additional opportunities to these small minority businesses to close this gap. 
   By law, federal organizations are required to support small businesses. However, over the past 5 years, total government contracting has increased by 60% while small business contracts have decreased by 55%. This suggests that the SBA's procurement initiatives are not bringing work from the large business share to the small business share, but rather are forcing small businesses to compete for an increasingly smaller piece of the pie. 
   It is essential that small businesses have access to the over $400 billion per year federal marketplace. The Small Business Contracting Improvements Act nicely complements H.R. 1873, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act, a bill I introduced in April that later passed the House on May 10th by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 409-13. My bill will give small businesses more opportunities to compete for federal contracts, raising the small business federal contracting goal from 23% to 30%. This means that all of the programs included in the Small Business Contracting Improvements Act will have greater opportunities to compete for federal contracts. 
   Thank you once again, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all of my colleagues who join me today in standing up for the interests of small businesses.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, when hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money is being spent on a war overseas, it is important there be benchmarks and consequences if they are not met. 
   Last week the House approved an emergency war supplemental that will finally hold the Iraqi Government accountable by measuring its performance on standards that President Bush himself outlined earlier this year. 
   Under the plan passed here last week, the President must report to Congress this summer on the progress the Iraqi Government has made on these key benchmarks. If the Iraqi Government lives up to its promises, our troops will remain there until next year. If, however, they do not meet the President's own benchmarks by this summer, we will begin to redeploy our troops out of Iraq immediately. This accountability is particularly critical after the release of a Defense Department report showing that the Iraqi Government is not close to meeting any of these benchmarks. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time that the Iraqi Government realizes that the American troops are not going to be in Iraq indefinitely, and that they have to begin seriously taking responsibility for their own nation.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, as many of the new Members ran on a promise of bringing change to Washington, one of the key areas of that new direction was the responsibility of securing this Nation. In July of 2004, the bipartisan 9/11 Commission issued a comprehensive series of recommendations and urged this body and the leaders of this country to take prompt action to implement those recommendations and make us safer. 
   Today, in just the second week of our majority, the Democratic House of Representatives will pass legislation that will address the 9/11 recommendations and make the American people safer and more secure. 
   Just yesterday, the 9/11 Commission Vice Chair, Lee Hamilton, a former Member of this body, stated the bottom line is that if this bill, H.R. 1, is enacted, funded and implemented, then the American people will be safer because it carries out the recommendations of the commission. 
   I am proud to be part of this effort to implement those recommendations, and I am proud because that was a promise made to the Members of our constituents last fall. Action on this critical issue of securing our Nation is long past due. The citizens of our great Nation are calling for change. In the area of national security, the time for change has arrived.

Madam Speaker, I was sitting at home over the holiday recess spending time with my family when I became aware of the fact that the President had vetoed the Defense Authorization bill that we passed in this body shortly before we adjourned. And like most of my colleagues, I was surprised by that veto and I wanted to learn more about the basis, the reasoning behind the decision of the President to withhold pay increases to our men and women in uniform who are serving us in very heavily conflicted areas around the world, and why the President would veto a bill that would increase funding for Veterans' Administration health care benefits to our Nation's aging veterans and our most recent veterans who are in serious need of those medical services. And so I got a copy of the President's veto statement and I read it, and, quite frankly, I was shocked. I was shocked, Madam Speaker, because, as I saw the President's basis for the veto, I was taken back to a time several years ago when I was watching a 60 Minutes story about tortured U.S. prisoners of war from our first Gulf War. And when I learned that the basis for the President's veto was to keep U.S. POWs who had been brutally beaten and tortured by Saddam Hussein's thugs in the first Gulf War from receiving compensation for those injuries, I was ashamed for my country. 
   To give you some idea of what we're talking about, these were the words that Mike Wallace uttered on 60 Minutes at the beginning of the program on November 20, 2003: During the first Gulf War against Iraq in 1991, a number of American soldiers who were captured and became prisoners of war were brutally, brutally tortured by the Iraqis. Eventually, though, the POWs came home, put the pieces of their lives back together, and largely remained out of the public eye. But today, a different battle is being fought by some of those American POWs all these years after they returned. It was back in 1991 that the POWs came home from Iraq to a hero's welcome and were greeted by the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Collin Powell and then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney.     
   ``Your country is opening its arms to greet you,'' said Cheney. Many of the POWs had suffered wounds both physical and psychological. Some of them suffer to this day more than a decade after they were captured and appeared on Iraqi TV. 
   And, Madam Speaker, to put a human face on these tortured American POWs, I am going to put up a photograph of Commander Jeffrey Zaun, who was a tortured Gulf War POW, who had a very visible presence on TV because of the attempt by Saddam Hussein's government to use him as an example and try to convince the American people to give up the cause that was the purpose for defending the invasion of Kuwait from the aggression of the Iraqi army. Commander Jeffrey Zaun was one of those POWs who was brutally tortured by the Iraqis and was part of a group of POWs who took action to try to hold the Iraqi Government accountable and to serve as a deterrent to other nations like Iraq who would dare to use American hostages and American POWs as a way of exacting their political agenda through torture and abuse in violation of international law, in violation of international treaties. 
   So how did we get to this point? During the Gulf War against Iraq, these captured POWs that we've been talking about were subsequently tortured, beaten, starved, hooked up to electric shock devices, and subjected to other horrendous acts by Saddam Hussein's regime. At the time these acts occurred, the United States Department  of State had classified Iraq as a state sponsor of terrorism. Madam Speaker, during the Gulf War, this very Congress that I stand in today had passed two resolutions by unanimous consent, stating the intention of the Congress to hold Iraq accountable for the torture of American POWs. Yet when these same brave American POWs returned home after the Gulf War ended, what did our current Vice President and then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney tell them? ``Your country is opening its arms to greet you.'' 
   Well, where I come from in Iowa, opening your arms to take care of tortured and wounded people means doing a lot more than ignoring their needs. And yet that is exactly what happened to these unfortunate POWs. They have suffered long-term physical, emotional, and mental damages as a result of brutal state-sponsored torture. And in 1996 Congress, responding to their concerns, raised by these international law violations, passed an amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act so that torture victims like the American POWs we are talking about could seek compensation for their injuries from terrorist countries including Iraq. 
   On April 4 of 2002, 17 POWs and their families filed claims in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking compensation for damages related to their torture and abuse by the government of Iraq. These POWs included many decorated officers in this Nation's military, people like Colonel Clifford Acree, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Berryman, Sergeant Troy Dunlap, Colonel David Eberly, Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey D. Fox, Chief Warrant Officer Guy Hunter, Sergeant David Lockett, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Robert, Lieutenant Colonel Russell Sanborn, Major Joseph Small, Staff Sergeant Daniel Stamaris, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Dale Storr, Major Robert Sweet, Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Tice, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Wetzel, and, of course, Commander Jeffrey Zaun. 
   I am on the floor tonight with some of my colleagues in the freshmen class so that these names do not fade into history and the abuse that they were subjected to does not get lost in the politics of a Presidential veto. 
   In 2003, after the Government of Iraq repeatedly refused to participate in arbitration on these damage claims and after hearing evidence about how these POWs had been repeatedly tortured, a judge awarded them damages and indicated that the purpose of deterring torture of POWs should be one of the highest priorities of our government. 
   And, Madam Speaker, the reason why what we're talking about is so important is because the United States, like many countries, is a signatory to international treaties designed to protect the treatment of U.S. POWs and other prisoners of war and the most important treaty is the Third Geneva Convention that was entered into on August 12 of 1949. 
   One of the most important provisions that came out of the Third Geneva Convention is Article 131, and the reason that I am so outraged by the President's veto, Madam Speaker, is because Article 131 prohibits the very conduct that the President engaged in in vetoing this legislation because the Geneva Convention Article 131 provides no country shall be allowed to absolve itself or any other country of any liability related to prohibited treatment of prisoners of war. And there is no doubt, there is no question, that the abuse of American POWs by Saddam Hussein's regime constituted the type of torture prohibited by the Third Geneva Convention. 
   I am proud to welcome to this hour the president of our freshmen class, the majority makers, my good friend from the southern part of Minnesota who has been a terrific leader in our class, who has been a passionate spokesman on fighting for veterans, fighting for our men and women in uniform, and he brings a very personal perspective to that based on his longstanding service in the National Guard of this country. And without further ado, I am going to yield to my friend and colleague, Mr. Walz from Minnesota.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I think you have hit a very important point in talking about what this law was originally designed to accomplish. This law was not designed to open the floodgates for any potential claim arising from persons engaged in armed conflict around the world against the countries where that conflict occurred. In fact, this law that allowed these claims to be pursued in the first place set a very high bar before you could even begin to pursue them. 
   Number one, there had to be a declaration by the State Department that the nation involved in torture was a state sponsor of terrorism, which, as you know, that is an incredibly harsh accusation to make in the world community. So in order for the State Department to reach that conclusion, they would have to be presented with overwhelming evidence that a country was engaged in the state sponsor of terrorism. And when the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq invaded Kuwait, that is when the State Department acted to declare, based upon what was happening and what was outraging people all over the world, that indeed that government was a state sponsor of terror at that time. So that was the first threshold that these hostages and POWs had to meet. 
   The second was that they were tortured under the definitions of international law, which is much more egregious than simply being involved in a firefight and being wounded or having something that is expected to happen in the normal course of conflict, which is always an impossible arena to control. But we are talking about a deliberate decision to torture individual citizens in violation of all accepted principles of international law. 
   And then after you pass those two hurdles, these victims of torture also had to prove that the acts that they were being tortured for would be the type of claims that they could pursue in the courts of law of this country. 
   And the gentleman from Minnesota, Madam Speaker, made another excellent point, and that is this is consistent with the pattern of behavior we have seen from this administration for the past 7 years to take away the rights of individuals who have been harmed due to no fault of their own and to substitute the judgment of this body and State legislatures for what juries have been doing in this country since before it was formed. And what I like to remind my colleagues is there is something that we all take an oath to defend when we serve in this body. It is called the United States Constitution. And part of that Constitution is something we hold and cherish, which is the Bill of Rights. And it includes the freedom of speech that we all cherish every day on this floor. It includes the freedom of religion, the freedom to associate, the freedom of the press. It includes the right to bear arms. But it also includes the seventh amendment to the Constitution that guarantees that juries get to determine facts like what the issues are we are talking about here today, what is fair compensation for someone who has been subjected to torture. 
   Madam Speaker, one of the things that I think is most disturbing about the issues we are talking about on the floor tonight is that the President and his spokesperson don't like to talk about what happened to these POWs. It is unpleasant, and it brings to mind in the hearts of all Americans, how could we let this happen to people serving this country who have put up with so much and been through so much and then get them to the point where they can hold their offenders accountable, and who comes in and pulls the rug out from under them? Not the Iraqi Government, but the President of the United States who directed his Attorney General to intervene in these claims and see that the assets were not available to satisfy them. 
   Let's just take a moment, Madam Speaker, to talk about one of those victims that I mentioned earlier, Colonel Cliff Acree. Here is what he said in that 60 Minutes interview that I referred to earlier: They had broken my nose many times and I was just getting used, you just kind of get used to it. 
   Colonel Acree was shot down the second day of the war. The interrogations always began the same way, and these are his words: They would have these six or eight people just beat you for 10, 15, 20 minutes. Just no questions asked. Bring you into the room and beat you with fists, feet, clubs, whatever. 
   One of the other victims, Dale Storr, that I mentioned, who was serving in the National Guard at this time said: Hearing Cliff talk about it, we never really talk like this before in such detail. But it brings back memories. It is almost like I am back in my cell again. 
   Another victim, Jeff Tice, who was captured after his F-16 was hit by a  surface-to-air missile, and, Madam Speaker, he was tortured with a device called the ``talkman.'' And what they would do is they would wrap a wire around the ear of one of these prisoners, another wire underneath their chin, then wrap it around the other ear and hook it up to an electrical device. Then they would start to question him. And this is what Jeff Tice said: They would turn on the juice. And what it does is it creates a ball of lightning in your mind or in your head, drives all the muscles simultaneously together, and it drives your jaw and everything together, and of course I am chained to a chair. I can't move freely. So everything is jerking into a little ball, and your teeth are being forced together with such force, I am breaking pieces and parts off. 
   Jeff Tice's jaw was dislocated so many times that he was lucky, as he said, that they were able to put it back into place. 
   And now, I am going to yield to my colleague from Minnesota. After hearing some of these descriptions and having had the experience of having young students of yours that you taught in Minnesota join the Minnesota National Guard, which along with the 133rd of the Iowa National Guard has served the longest single deployment of any combat unit in the war in Iraq, what type of message does that send to those young men and women who you helped to train, you helped to educate, and who are going off to serve their country, knowing that if they get captured and held as a POW their Government is not going to be there for them?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Well, Madam Speaker, I think my friend from Minnesota has hit this one on the head, because one of the things you were talking about is the administration's interpretation of what our treaty obligations are under the Geneva Convention. And maybe it all boils down to this very simple question: When is torture torture? Because you brought up the fact that our own Government, our own Justice Department, seems to have a difficult time interpreting acts such as waterboarding, that I think every American who has seen the video illustrating what that is would conclude that it constitutes torture in violation of the third Geneva Convention. And yet it is hard for us as a people and as a government to try to say, we need to stand up to other countries who are torturing our POWs if we can't get it ourselves in terms of our obligations under the Geneva Convention. I think it gets to a much more fundamental question, which is, are we going to be the type of country that stands by our word when we enter in these international treaties? These treaties are designed not just to protect American prisoners of war but to make sure that the countries that we may be in conflict with have the same respect for human rights, human dignity and human decency for captured prisoners that we would expect our men and women in uniform to be subjected to. 
   To give you some idea of how this plays out in the real world, I would remind my friend from Minnesota of what happened to Lieutenant Colonel Berryman, one of the people I identified as the POWs that brought this claim.     
   This really gets to the heart of many of those constitutional protections I talked about earlier. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Berryman was inspected after he was captured to determine whether he was circumcised and was questioned about his religion. When he answered he was a Baptist, his captors called him a lying Jew. A guard then hit his left leg below the  knee that felt like a heavy club. Lieutenant Colonel Berryman immediately collapsed in excruciating pain because the blow had broken the fibula, one of the bones in his lower left leg. 
   Another guard used a similar club to attack his right leg, and the two guards continued beating him as he rolled on the floor to protect his leg. As he continued to resist answering questions, which is exactly what my friend mentioned, Lieutenant Colonel Berryman was told that if he did not answer their questions, they would break his other legs. Two guards pinned him to the wall and one kicked him in the left leg causing him to collapse to the ground in pain. The others began kicking and beating him. And one guard used a steel-towed boot to kick a piece of flesh out of Lieutenant Colonel Berryman's leg exposing the bone. 
   Then a lit cigarette was pressed several times against his forehead and then pressed against his nose and each ear and then was crushed out in an open wound on his neck. 
   What American listening to that testimony would not be overwhelmed with rage and with a sense of passion and compassion for the person that was subjected to that? 
   That's why, in my humble opinion, Madam Speaker, when we set policy on this floor about how we are going to stand up for the people who serve this country who may become prisoners of war or who may become hostages, it's important that we keep in mind that the rule of law will only be respected if we in this country stand up for it and say that the rule of law is what we are all about in the way we are going to take care of our citizens. 
   And with that, I would like to yield to my colleague from the great State of New Hampshire (Ms. Shea-Porter) and ask what your reaction is to some of the things we've been talking about tonight. What do you think the good people of New Hampshire would think if they knew their President and their government had done what we have done to deny the opportunity to compensate these victims of torture?

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. One of the things I would like to ask both of my friends to comment on is how the Bush administration has known about this problem dating clear back to 2003 when the CBS 60 Minutes story aired, and what has happened since that time and what the attitude of the administration is in trying to justify it, this veto. 
   One of the things that we know is that a number of Members of Congress and a number of influential Members of Congress in both parties were outraged because of the fact that some of these POWs were constituents of theirs, and when the White House moved to intervene and make sure that these judgements could not be collected, took very strong action and took and used very strong language to try to convince the administration not to do this. 
   One of those individuals is someone we all know who is the current majority leader of the Senate, Senator Harry Reid from Nevada. And when this story aired in November of 2003, Majority Leader Reid said, I hope George Bush, the President of the United States, doesn't know about this because if he knows about it, if he knows about it, it is a pox on his house, his White House. This is wrong. 
   Well, that was in 2003. And now we are 5 years later. There can be no doubt that this President knew what he was doing when he issued this veto, and yet when his press secretary has been questioned as to why the administration felt the need to take away the rights of victims of torture to full and fair compensation, they say the same thing over and over again which is, no amount of money could compensate these victims for their terrible injuries. 
   Well, when the judge who heard this case issued his decision awarding damages, he noted that, and yet that's not what this case is about. This case is about putting some measure of value on what these torture victims went through, what their families went through who were watching these shots on TV of their loved ones, who were hearing these tales of torture and fearing for the lives and safety of their loved ones. Why would our government, why would our President say that the value of the Iraqi people was greater than the value of these tortured Americans? That's what the fundamental question is we are here to talk about tonight. 
   And I would yield to my friend from Minnesota.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I want to thank you for sharing that story. It is not in my district. It is in Congressman Latham's district. It's the largest geographic county in Iowa, and it borders on your district. 
   And one of the things that's unique about the county seat of Kossuth County is that it was also a prisoner-of-war camp for German soldiers who were captured and transported to the United States during World War II. And to this day, the townspeople of Algona cherished the cre 2che that was built by German POWs that they used every year during their Christmas celebration as a symbol of exactly what my friend is talking about which is this: It is nothing more simple than the Golden Rule that you treat other people the way you would like to be treated. 
   And one of the things that has been missing from our foreign policy is an appreciation for the role that this country plays as the sole remaining superpower to set the standard, the gold standard, for how we live up to the responsibilities we willingly entered into as part of the a Nation and a community of nations that come together and enter into treaties for our mutual benefit.     
   I look forward to hearing from another friend of ours in the freshman class who will be talking to us in a few minutes who has a deep and abiding appreciation for the importance of these concepts in the real practical reality of dealing with this in a global world full of problems that need the might and the force of the U.S. military to be a pacifying presence. 
   I recognize my friend from New Hampshire, and I would like to ask her specifically, as someone who serves on the Armed Services Committee here on the House, and having heard through the past year the problems with our readiness standards for our men and women in uniform and the problems of torture that we have been talking about here tonight and what symbol we send to the rest of the world based upon our own conduct, what lessons have we learned as a country that you have become aware of during your service on the Armed Services Committee that have relevance to the topic we are talking about this evening.

As our class president has stated on many occasions, we are blessed in this freshman class with incredible people who have had incredible life experiences that they bring to this body. One of my friends and mentors on the issues that we are talking about here today is my friend from Pennsylvania who has more real-world knowledge about how these international treaties impact the role of our military around the world than anyone else that I personally know. 
   I would like to recognize my colleague from Pennsylvania, Joe Sestak, and ask him this question: When we are trying to teach the brave men and women who serve this country about their role in combat and about their role as potential POWs, what type of message do we send them when we have a President who has taken the action that this President has that goes against everything we believe and about the role of the rule of law and its strong force in preventing other states or nations from terrorizing and torturing our citizens?

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I thank my friend so much for those eloquent words. It's amazing how much we can learn from our former enemies, the words you shared. Why do you care so much for those you lost long ago? I am just going to close with two examples from my district. 
   While I was home over the holiday recess, the remains were brought back from North Korea of an Iowan from Buchanan County who had been lost long before I was born, and to see the touching way that his family and his friends placed those remains in the frozen Iowa soil is a poignant reminder of exactly why this country cares and won't forget. 
   The other example, which is an actual positive benefit from this defense authorization bill is that when I was a college student during the Iranian hostage crisis, one of the best-known hostages was a woman who grew up in my district in Bremer County, Kathryn Koob. For people like Kathryn Koob and other Iranian hostages, there will be an opportunity to get the compensation they deserve for what they went through that no American should have to put up with. 
   But it's also a reflection of this administration's foreign policy that we allow those claims to be pursued against a state-sponsored terrorism act that occurred in Iran, but we have taken away the rights of U.S. prisoners of war to recover compensation from state-sponsored terror in Iraq. Maybe that makes sense to some people, but it just doesn't pass the smell test in Iowa. 
   With that, I would like to thank all of my colleagues, and I would also like to recognize my friend and roommate from Colorado, who I wasn't aware was with us. Mr. Perlmutter, we would like to have you close us out for the remaining time with your thoughts on this topic.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute the people of Maquoketa, Iowa, for their extraordinary sense of civic duty during the course of a severe fire that destroyed a sizable part of the city's historic downtown early Saturday morning. I also want to recognize the efforts of firefighters from Maquoketa and 27 surrounding communities to extinguish the blaze and keep it from consuming other downtown buildings. 
   The fire was a blow to Maquoketa's historic downtown, completely destroying five buildings and causing severe damage to several businesses and homes. 
   While the fire left behind physical and emotional scars, it also demonstrated what makes Iowa such a great place. Firefighters battled tirelessly through subzero temperatures and wind chills of 20 below zero to get the blaze under control. Meanwhile, hundreds of Maquoketa residents open their homes and businesses to provide warm shelter, hot food, and emotional support for the firefighters and residents impacted by the fire. 
   Perhaps young Maquoketa resident Kalli Muhlhausen said it best: ``They have our hearts, and we have their backs.'' 
   Iowans dismiss such an outpouring of generosity as simply ``the right thing to do,'' but the people of Maquoketa deserve a special thank you.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, the price of gasoline is now averaging over $3.60 a gallon. House Democrats are working to provide some relief, but we face stiff opposition from the White House and congressional Republicans who have opposed every single energy bill that we have brought to the floor this year. When it comes to energy, the GOP doesn't want to work with us. They simply want to say ``no.'' 
   When Democrats voted to repeal unnecessary subsidies to big oil companies so we could instead invest in clean, renewable energy, Republicans overwhelmingly voted ``no.'' It didn't matter that the legislation would reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lower prices at the pump and create new, green jobs. They still preferred the status quo. 
   When Democrats passed the Energy Price Gouging Act to punish those who  take advantage of these record prices by increasing them even further, Republicans overwhelmingly voted ``no.'' 
   Madam Speaker, Democrats understand the hardship that families are facing every time they go to the gas station, and that is why we've passed six bills that would provide real relief to consumers. 
   It's time Republicans realized that ``no'' is not an energy strategy.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my serious concerns that inadequate oversight, deficient procedures, and ethical lapses at the Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) are costing the Federal Government millions of dollars each year. 
   The MMS is responsible for negotiating, implementing and overseeing all  Federal leases for resources removed by private companies from public lands, and it is supposed to be a guardian of our Nation's precious public resources. 
   Unfortunately, evidence suggests that the cozy relationships between MMS officials and oil and gas companies have allowed these companies to underreport the resources they remove from Federal lands and underpay the royalties they owe to the Federal Government. Evidence that MMS has failed to detect and pursue these violations by oil and gas companies is especially troubling as gas prices continue to rise, corporations make record profits, and average Americans are struggling to fill their gas tanks and make ends meet. 
   Most hard-working, taxpaying Americans would be outraged to know that these companies are cheating the Government out of these royalties which are a critical source of revenue for the U.S. Treasury and which would allow us to invest in other priorities.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, while the Iraq war has stretched our military thin and our troops continue to struggle with multiple deployments,  House Democrats are fighting to improve the lives of soldiers when they return home. 
   Last month we passed a new and improved GI Bill that restores the promise of a full 4-year college scholarship. The original GI Bill sparked economic growth and expansion in America after World War II. This new bill will be an integral part of rebuilding our failing economy. It will also make military service more attractive and improve the quality of recruits as we work to strengthen our military. The new GI Bill goes further than current law, which only covers a small portion of public and private college education. 
   Madam Speaker, the education of our Nation's veterans should be considered a cost of the war which they rightfully have earned after completing their military service. 
   Madam Speaker, the U.S. has never gone wrong when it properly invests in education and rewards our veterans. I would only hope that President Bush would reconsider his opposition to the new GI Bill. It is the right thing to do for both our military and our economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I'd like to thank my friend from Florida and also my friend from New York. We did have a very enlightening trip to Nogales, Arizona, and the Border Patrol and Customs agents that we spoke to were all, I think, doing a fantastic job of trying to deal with a very difficult situation. 
   But one of the things that trip emphasized to me is we often talk in this body about the cost of providing border security, the cost of providing national and international security. 
   And what we know is that the Pentagon traditionally publishes reports that provide this body that we serve in their estimate of the cost of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. And we've seen those figures. We've viewed some of those figures with skepticism. And we've talked about what the published costs of this war are. 
   But what we don't talk enough about is what we talked about in repeated hearings in the wake of the Walter Reed fiasco. And I was fortunate enough to be serving on the Government Oversight and Reform Committee, when we had that first hearing out at Walter Reed. We talked to the highest ranking Army and Department of Defense medical officers. We had a follow-up hearing after the independent review group chaired by General Togo West presented its recommendations for the wounded warriors project. And I repeatedly pressed the top ranking Army medical officers on that very question; what are the hidden costs of the war that the American people aren't hearing about? 
   And I'm glad my friend from New York brought this up, because there is so much going on beneath the surface that the American public doesn't hear about. 
   If you take the average life expectancy of a 19-year-old male, which is representative of who we're sending to Iraq right now, you will find that under the published U.S. life tables, those young men have a life expectancy of approximately 55 years. 
   Now, when they come back in unprecedented percentages with life-threatening injuries that we will be responsible for caring for the rest of their lives, there is an enormous economic cost that we aren't hearing about. And so I look forward to the opportunity to discuss with my colleagues tonight what some of those hidden costs are, and what the American people need to be thinking about as we look at the overall economic impact, not just throughout our economy, but on the long-term burden we're placing on our children and our grandchildren to provide these deserving veterans with the best possible medical care that we can. 
   Before I get to that though, I want to talk a little bit about what we're giving up right now, through the amount of funding that we are committing every year to the conflict in Iraq because, just for Fiscal Year 2007, we know that this war is costing, under the most conservative estimate, $137.6 billion. So the American people may wonder, well, what would that actually provide if it wasn't going to Iraq? 
   Well, for 40 million people in this country, that would provide comprehensive health care. Now, think about that. We know that right now there are nearly 47 million Americans without health insurance. So that cost alone would almost completely eliminate that gap. 
   We know that that cost that we're spending this year in Iraq would hire 2.2 million elementary school teachers, provide affordable housing for over a million different housing units, and provide 142 million homes in this country with renewable electricity. 
   And to break that down into a smaller level, I represent the First District of Iowa. The taxpayers I represent in the First District have paid, to date,  $770 million in one congressional district alone, as their share of the cost of this war. What would that mean back in the First District of Iowa? 
   Well, it would hire almost 19,000 public safety officers. It would hire almost 17,000 music and art teachers. It would provide 126,000 full tuition university scholarships at public universities, and build 86 brand new elementary schools. So when we talk about the actual financial burden that we are facing every day because of the rising cost of this war, it is enormous. 
   And Congressman Klein, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you've heard from the people you represent in a different part of the country, where there are different needs, but also very similar problems that taxpayers you represent are facing.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. One of the things that we face every year is something called an emergency supplemental, which is a request from the President for billions of dollars of additional funding to fund the ongoing war in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Now, I would just ask my colleagues, and I'll pose this first to you, Mr. Hall. Where I come from in Iowa, an emergency is something that is unexpected and unanticipated that you can't plan for. But I am at a loss to understand why, after being in Iraq longer than we were engaged in the Civil War, after being in Iraq longer than we were engaged in World War II, we continue to face emergency supplemental funding requests for these wars, when the Department of Defense and the Pentagon and the President have to know how much they anticipate when they send their budget down for us to consider.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Well, as our good friend and colleague from Arkansas Marion Berry would say, That dog don't hunt. This is a classic example of what we've seen over and over and over again from procurement decisions that are being made that have an adverse effect on American taxpayers. And I think if you go back to the beginning when they set up the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, that it was set up with the intent of using Iraqi assets to rebuild the country and to shift the dependency from the government or from the United States back to the Iraqi people through the oil revenues that we're talking about. 
   And we've seen in committee hearings here photographs of Ford trucks full of pallets that had $250 million in cash per pallet that were part of a $2.1 billion one-day transfer of cash to the Iraqi government, the largest single transfer of cash in U.S. history. And that was part of a transfer of cash that led to $9 billion of missing money that was supposed to be part of the initial reconstruction of Iraq. 
   Then the idea was to use those Iraqi oil revenues to pick up the responsibility and complete the work of rebuilding Iraq. And instead, we know that one of the big challenges the Iraqi government has faced is coming to some agreement on the division of oil revenues, and that's been a major obstacle to rebuilding the country and bringing about national reconciliation. And who is paying the tab for that? U.S. taxpayers. 
   That is why the issue we're talking about is so important. Because when U.S. taxpayers are bearing the burden of this war, it has an enormous ripple effect throughout our economy because one of the things we know is that when we have these ever-growing trade deficits with countries like China, which is our principal creditor, it makes it very difficult to keep the economy in this country rolling along providing the types of goods and services at a reasonable rate; and that has an enormous impact throughout the economy. And I'm sure as we get further into this, we will have some real examples of the enormous impact on various sectors of the U.S. economy from the burden that we are all responsible for. 
   But I have to tell you, the idea that you mentioned about shifting the burden in H. Res. 111, I can tell you this is an enormously popular bipartisan idea. In fact, last weekend in my home State of Iowa, the Des Moines Register interviewed every member of the Iowa congressional delegation, Republicans, Democrats, Senators, Representatives, and everyone was unanimous in their sentiment that is exactly the one you expressed in your resolution. 
   It is time for the Iraqis to pick up the tab for their own well-being and let the American taxpayers focus on the enormous economic problems we're dealing with at home: The bailout of Bear Stearns, the subprime mortgage crisis, all of the things that you work on every day in the Financial Services Committee. And because of that unique role that you play here in Congress, I think you have some special insights that probably would be very enlightening to the people watching tonight and the people of this country about what you're dealing with on a daily basis that's being impacted by this ongoing financial commitment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Sure. And I'm just going to pick up where Mr. Hall left off. We both have the pleasure of serving on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee here in Congress. And one of the things that we hear about every day is not just the benefits of having, oh, $137 billion to invest in infrastructure--let's just pull that number out of the air--but what happens if you don't address your critical infrastructure needs. Because we hear, for example, that for every 1 minute delay that UPS drivers have in congested urban areas in New York, in Florida, maybe lesser in Iowa, but unique, different types of delays, it imposes enormous economic costs in shipping those goods, which is then passed on to consumers all over this country. 
   So when I fly into the airport in Moline and I have to cross the I-74 bridge, which is one of the functionally obsolete, structurally deficient bridges in my district, and they've got a lane closed down either for repair work or because an accident is there, it may take you half an hour to drive from one side of the Mississippi River to the other side. And all that does is slow down commerce, it slows down people. And at a time of rising fuel costs, it adds enormously to the prices that we pay to get where we need to go. 
   And each of us has unique transportation delay issues. Mr. Klein comes from an urban area in Florida where traffic congestion in many ways is a way of life. And you're sitting there waiting to move, your engine is running, and you don't get very high fuel efficiency from that expensive fuel you've got. A lot of my constituents live in rural parts of Iowa, and for them to get basic goods and services they have to drive to a county seat town or to a larger urban area to get what they need. And they have larger fuel costs simply to get what they need to buy to take care of their basic needs. And when we ignore these infrastructure needs that we've been talking about, all it does is have very large ripple effects. 
   But one of the other things that we talked about here is our whole energy policy. I am very proud of the fact that my State is, I believe, pretty much in the epicenter of the renewable energy explosion. Whether it's ethanol, biodiesel, wind energy, one of the things we're trying to do is create an environment where we can reduce our dependency on foreign oil and not have to worry so much about the impact of what's going on with the Iraqi oil fields on our domestic fuel availability.  
   And so it's very exciting to see the potential, but one of the things that's disturbing is when we miss opportunities to do more. So if you look at wind energy capacity, most people would be shocked, I think, to realize that the State of North Dakota has the highest wind energy capacity of any State in the country. So they are a prime location for us to sell these wind turbines we're producing in Iowa and start to reduce that dependency on foreign oil. 
   But they've got a problem. It's the exact same problem Mr. Hall and I saw with the border patrol down in Arizona, and that is, it's one thing to say we need to secure our borders, but if you don't have infrastructure in place to access the border, you can't do your job. They've got a problem in North Dakota because they don't have a grid right now that can handle the energy capacity they would generate and put onto the grid and send out to people in Florida and New York, who have high demand and don't have the ability to meet their energy needs. 
   So when we're talking about how this war and the funding for the war is impacting Americans, I think that the ripple effect is enormous. And we're really only scratching the surface.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Well, I thank my friend for the opportunity, and also the opportunity to spend time with two of my good friends tonight talking about very, very important issues. 
   We've focused primarily on the impact of the war in Iraq and the cost of the war on the domestic economy here in the United States. But when I look at my friend from New York and I look at my friend from Florida, two States that really symbolize a growing connection between our domestic economy and the global economy, one of the things we know is a lot of the issues we've talked about tonight all come back to something we all are charged to do when we swore to represent this country, and that is to provide security.     
   Now that may be security from harm, from foreign interests. It may be economic security. But it all comes together. And we know that many developing countries, the addiction to energy needs is what keeps them suppressed in reaching greater levels of economic stability, and that's why oil and the pursuit of oil has played such an important role in the last 100 years in the world economy. 
   By exporting our knowledge about renewable energy, about new emerging economies that can be shared and applied in the global economy, I think we can give a great gift to the American people in the return of a safer world, a more secure world, and a world where we have the ability to be able to predict with greater certainty what the current economic trends are going to be and set economic policies, with the assistance of the administration and the Federal Reserve, to address these crises before they become the full-blown crises that we have been talking about on the floor tonight. 
   So I look forward to working with my friends and my other colleagues here on both sides of the aisle in trying to provide some guidance and direction as we get our hands on this very important subject.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I appreciate that and I thank the gentleman, and I think that the heading of the chart that you're standing next to summarizes what this really boils down to, because there's been a disconnect between what the President says about his commitment to children's health care and what his actions represent. 
   I'd like my colleagues who are here tonight to take a walk down memory lane with me, because many of us got our motivation to run for office as a result of the 2004 Presidential elections. And if you remember back with me to September 2, 2004, at the Republican National Convention, this is what our President George Bush said about his commitment to children's health care. 
   He said, America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible, but not signed up, for the government's health insurance programs, the very same programs we're talking about here tonight. 
   He begins again, We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need. That's what our President said as he stood on the brink of his second nomination. 
   Now, I want to take you back to what was one of the most memorable nights of my life, my first State of the Union address, which took place right in this Chamber, January 23, 2007. I sat in here with all of my new colleagues listening to the direction from our President on what he was going to do to lead us in a new direction on health care. 
   What did he say on this subject? When it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled and poor children. We will meet those responsibilities. 
   Well, his words don't mesh with his actions in vetoing this important legislation, and that is why it is important for us, on behalf of those children, America's kids, to stand up and speak out and say it's time to live up to the values that you have been talking about and deliver on the promises to insure America's uninsured children.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I want to thank you. One of the things that we rarely talk about is the human faces that Congressman Kagen was good enough to share with us from our district. And I want to share a personal experience from my own life, and I think it illustrates the importance of what we are talking about here today. 
   About 15 years ago when my wife and I had our three children, who were all young and in school, my wife and I got involved through our church in a mentoring program at a city center school in Waterloo, Iowa where we lived. As a result of that, I started mentoring a young fourth grade student named DeUndre, and then I got involved in Big Brothers, Big Sisters as an outreach of that program and spent a lot of time with him and his family. 
   When he was in sixth grade, DeUndre started complaining of pain in his abdominal area, and he ended up going to the hospital and they diagnosed him with acute large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. They did surgery to remove the tumor, and then he spent about 6 weeks undergoing chemotherapy in the pediatric oncology unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. And I was faced with a choice, because he had nobody in his family who could go with him and be there when he was going through that ordeal. And I made a decision after speaking to my wife that it was going to be me who was there for him. And I spent that time watching young children with IV drips in their arms receiving chemotherapy, no hair, going in and out of each other's room, taking care of each other and helping each other get through a very difficult time in their lives, knowing full well that many of those kids were not going to live to see their 15th birthday. 
   And one of the things that I learned from that is that people like DeUndre, who depended on Medicaid to provide for their health care, were lucky because they had the resources to get a diagnosis and treatment that saved their lives. Many of the kids we are talking about in these 10 million uninsured children are in that window between those who qualify for Medicaid benefits and those covered by private pay plans. And that is why it is so critical that we perform the role that we are talking about so that those children aren't stuck without the opportunity to get early intervention, early diagnosis, and early treatment of life-threatening illnesses and diseases. It does make a difference in the lives of these kids, and that is why we are here tonight talking about this important issue. 
   I yield back to my friend from Minnesota.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. One of the things we have been talking about is what this program would do that the President vetoed. But what we really haven't spent a lot of time talking about is what the President originally proposed, and what that would mean for existing children who are covered by SCHIP and would lose their benefit if the President's plan had been put in place. And when President Bush originally proposed his SCHIP proposal, it provided a $5 billion increase over a 5-year period, which wouldn't even be enough to maintain the current enrollment of kids under SCHIP. 
   I would just like my friend from Minnesota to comment about what we really haven't been talking about, and that is where the President stands when it comes to taking care of our kids.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Well, I wanted you to yield for a question, because I  think a lot of us remember those old Fram Oil commercials where you can pay me now or pay me later. And as a physician who's taken care of children, as a physician who got referrals from primary care physicians, one of the things we're always concerned about in this body is the long-term cost of health care as we move forward as a Nation and how we're going to be able to afford health care for every man, woman and child in this country. 
   But what I'd like you to talk about is what impact it has on our long-term health care costs when people like Cassidy don't get access to the primary care, they don't get early diagnoses, they don't get early treatment, they don't get early interventions that allow us to nip those problems early on before they turn into catastrophic illnesses where the cost is greatly escalated. 
   And because of your background, I would ask my friend from Wisconsin if you could enlighten us about what that means in a practical setting.

   In my district, the First District of Iowa, 7,000 children are covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program. In the State of Iowa, there are currently 37,000 children who benefit from this program. This bill will allow 26,400 additional children to have the benefits of health care. But if we don't act, 37,000 children could lose the opportunity in my State to have the type of coverage we're talking about. 
   And one thing we can't do is we can't turn our back on those kids. We can't collectively fail to have that smile from doing something right that we all believe in, taking care of the most vulnerable people in our society, making sure they have their basic needs met. That is a responsibility we all have as parents. That is a collective responsibility we have as a Nation to the children of this country. And when we come into this Chamber every day, that should be the foremost thing in our minds: providing basic needs and making sure that they are met and empowering people to meet those needs on their own.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, despite the continued lack of political progress in Iraq, we are still fighting and funding this war at a time when the country's economic future is at stake. General David Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq, admitted last month that ``no one in the U.S. and Iraqi governments feels that there has been sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation.'' And yet we continue to spend $14 million every hour in Iraq, while more Americans are looking for work, millions of Americans are on the verge of losing their homes, and gas prices have hit an all-time high. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no question that when we spend $14 million an hour in Iraq, we are neglecting real needs here in the United States. But we are also hurting our economy because we aren't able to properly invest in America. This war has diverted nearly $1 trillion away from American schools, roads, research and other areas that would have stimulated the economy in the short-term and produced stronger economic growth in the long run. 
   It is time to stop spending our money in Iraq and start focusing on helping our families here at home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. 
   Last month, I introduced H.R. 1873, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act. Today, I rise as a voice for small business owners everywhere who want a fighting chance to compete for Federal contracts. 
   I would like to take a moment to thank Chairwoman Nydia Vel&#225;zquez and Ranking Member Steve Chabot. I am pleased H.R. 1873 has such strong bipartisan support and is co-sponsored by nearly the entire Small Business Committee. 
   Additionally, I would like to thank Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Henry Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis for their prompt consideration of this bill. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Rules Committee Chairwoman Louise Slaughter and Ranking Member David Dreier for acting on this bill. It is clear to me that members of all these committees understand the important role small businesses play in our communities. 
   Over the past 5 years, government agencies have greatly increased the practice known as contract bundling, oftentimes combining work that small businesses could perform into giant packages that exceed small firms' ability to compete for this work. During this same time, total government contracting has increased by 60 percent, while the number of small business contracts has decreased by 55 percent. 
   This is unacceptable; and that is why it is so important that today we are considering the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act, sending a message to small businesses that this Congress is serious about leveling the playing field for them by improving their opportunities to compete for Federal contracts. 
   H.R. 1873 also increases competition in the contracting process, which can lead to lower prices for the government. 
   As we know, small businesses are the number one job creators in this country, and we must ensure that this engine remains not only healthy but also has the support it needs to grow. It is essential to remove the barriers blocking small businesses from entering the nearly $400 billion per year Federal marketplace. 
   Public support for this bill is broad and bipartisan. The Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act was co-sponsored by 29 Representatives, 17 Democrats and 12 Republicans. H.R. 1873 has been endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Business, the Associated General Contractors, the National Small Business Association, Women in Public Policy, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. 
   My State of Iowa ranks near the bottom in terms of government contracting dollars awarded to small businesses. Even though 477 small businesses in my district are registered with the Small Business Administration, the dollar value of contracts awarded to those businesses is a tiny fraction of the Federal contract pie. Everyone in this House understands the important role that small businesses play in each of our districts. Allowing them a fair opportunity to bid on Federal contracts will bring economic vitality to our towns and cities. 
   I thank all of my colleagues who join me today in standing up for the interests of small businesses in this country.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, this week the President unveiled his final budget proposal, and like previous budgets, it fails to properly address the needs and concerns that are central to the everyday lives of our constituents. 
   Perhaps most troubling is the fact that the Bush budget continues the President's legacy of fiscal irresponsibility and leaves behind a $407 billion deficit. The five largest deficits in American history have all occurred on the President's watch. When President Bush took office, the debt stood at $5.7 trillion, and it is projected to stand at $9.7 trillion by the time President Bush leaves office. This fiscal record ties the hands of the next generation, which faces growing obligations with increasingly limited resources. 
   The Bush budget also hurts Americans struggling to make ends meet by cutting Medicare and Medicaid, and the low income home energy assistance program. This budget also hurts our long-term efforts to prepare Americans for better jobs in the global marketplace by slashing important education and literacy programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people do not want more of the same. This Democratic Congress will propose a budget alternative that takes America in a new direction.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. We know from history that timber has always played an important role in the economy of your State. How has the timber industry been affected because of what is happening in the global marketplace for timber and lumber sources from other areas that don't have to comply with the same types of restrictions we talked about earlier?

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. One the things that we often don't talk about when we talk about the loss of jobs overseas is the direct impact it has on the communities where those jobs depart from. And one of the things that we know, in talking about the sad story of Maytag in Iowa, is that at the time Maytag still functioned with its corporate headquarters in Newton, Iowa. They contributed almost $1 million a year just in property taxes alone to the city of Newton and Jasper County. That is just one small component of the many intangibles that we don't talk about with these trade policies and how they impact the communities that we represent over the long term. 
   One of the other things we know is that a lot of people who work in those good-paying jobs take on leadership roles in their communities as volunteers, as coaches, as mentors; and when they have to leave because they don't have a place to work anymore, all of that intangible benefit that contributes to the quality of life in a community leaves with them. So I think that sometimes we focus too much on the pure economic costs of these jobs that go overseas, and not enough on the real human costs that goes along with them.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I think a good example of that was one of the first things I did after becoming a Member of Congress was look at caucuses I could join that were going to be beneficial to the constituents that I represent in my district. One of the caucuses I joined was the Steel Caucus because there is a steel plant that has a direct economic benefit to employees in my district. 
   And one of the things I was struck by at the meeting that I went to, a breakfast meeting of the Steel Caucus, was it was bipartisan. There were representatives of the steel industry, of labor, and everybody was there to talk about the same problem, and that was cheap steel from China flooding the U.S. and international markets. 
   And one of the things that came up during those discussions, again in a bipartisan sense, was the myth of the so-called level playing field, which is that U.S. manufacturers who play by the rules, provide good, high-paying jobs with decent benefits, comply with environmental regulations, treat their workers fairly, are not on a level playing field when it comes to competing with Chinese competition and other parts of the world economy because other countries do not play by the same rules. 
   So I think one of the things that we need to be talking about here is how we can work in a bipartisan spirit to develop those coalitions that have a direct benefit for American workers, American manufacturers, American employers and consumers of these products, because we all are literally in this together.

   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. I know the gentleman from Pennsylvania has a fondness for college football so I am going to root this question in that. One of the great football players at Iowa State University when I attended there in the mid-to-late 70s was a gentleman named Tom Perticone from Clareton, Pennsylvania. And while Tom was playing football at Iowa State, the movie ``Deer Hunter'' was very popular, which was filmed in and around Pittsburgh general area, and also near Clareton. And one of the things that film depicted so well was the whole culture of the community where a life's history has been devoted to a particular industry and how everything revolves around it. And we have seen that in my home community of Waterloo, Iowa, near the old Rath Packing Company, where a virtual community of businesses and services formed around the factory, and everyone's lives were tied up in that. 
   And I was hoping that you might be able to shed some light on the very real, personal toll on the culture of those communities in your district that have seen this dramatic shift, and how employment is available to the people who graduate from high school and don't have the same opportunities they did 15 years ago.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I grew up surrounded by heroes. My father, Byard Braley, got permission from his mother at the age of 17 to enlist in the Marine Corps, and 1 year later found himself landing on Iwo Jima, the same day the flags were raised on Mount Suribachi. Thirty thousand marines and Japanese soldiers lost their lives in 1 month on an island the same size as my hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa. 
   My father saw one of his best friends vaporized by a shell burst, and we did not learn that fact until 15 years after he died. 
   The same night that my father landed on Iwo Jima, another marine from my hometown of Brooklyn slept under those flags as Japanese bombs flew overhead. Harold Keller was the real deal. He was the second marine to reach the summit of Mount Suribachi, and he single-handedly fought off a Japanese counterattack and rescued the people you see depicted in Flags of Our Fathers. 
   When he came home to my hometown, he repaired milking equipment for area farmers. My uncle Gordon Braley served in the merchant marine, guarding allied shipping lanes in the North Atlantic.  
   My Uncle Bert Braley served in the Army Air Corps, and my Uncle Lyle Nesselroad served in the Navy. My cousin, Dick Braley, was a Marine Corps artillery officer at a firebase in Vietnam. 
   These ordinary men taught me that patriotism is not something you claim by putting down others who disagree with your viewpoints. It is something you earn by the way you live your life, the respect you have for the institutions that make the United States a great beacon of liberty, freedom and justice. 
   When I return to my hometown of Waterloo, Iowa, I am still surrounded by heroes. These heroes belong to the battalion of the Ironman Battalion of the Iowa National Guard. They are approximately 560 fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters from Waterloo, Dubuque, Oelwein and everywhere in between. 
   One of them, Ray Zirkelbach, is missing his second consecutive year in the Iowa House of Representatives, because their latest tour was recently extended. A flag is draped over his desk in the House chamber. 
   These heroes are the reason why I stand here today in opposition to the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq. On November 7, 2006, the voters of this country went to the polls and clearly stated that it is time for a new direction in Iraq. 
   Soon after, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group presented President Bush with a desperately needed blueprint for change. They recognized that the deteriorating crisis in Iraq couldn't be solved by military action. Instead, it required a political solution between warring factions for a stable democracy to evolve. 
   The Iraq Study Group recognized that ``stay the course'' was a failed strategy, and that three prior troop surges had done little to stem the growing violence. They knew that the Iraqis would never get serious about standing up for their own country until they were confronted with a timetable for redeploying our forces. 
   After I was sworn in as a Member of Congress on January 4, I hoped that President Bush would listen to the advice of this bipartisan group whose recommendations he welcomed. 
   I hoped that he would move to fulfill the promise of the Defense Authorization Act of 2006, when this Congress stated that 2006 would be a period of significant transition in Iraq, with the Iraqi Security Forces taking the lead for their own security, so we could begin a phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. Instead, the President ignored the recommendations of the study group and chose to escalate the war in Iraq without charting a new course. 
   To my friends on the other side of the aisle who disagree with the resolution we are debating today, by all means vote your conscience. I will be voting my conscience and joining well-known Republicans who agree that the escalation is a mistake: 
   People like Senator CHUCK HAGEL of my neighboring State of Nebraska, who called the President's escalation plan the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam, if it is carried out. 
   People like former Iowa Representative Jim Leach, who said that the President's policy in Iraq may go down as the greatest foreign policy blunder in U.S. history. 
   Well-respected military experts also oppose this escalation, including General Colin Powell, General George Casey and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   The President truly stands alone with a strategy that his own generals, key Republicans, and the American people oppose. The time is long overdue for the people's House to reassert its rightful place in our constitutional system of checks and balances. 
   We have a duty to send a message that it is time for real change in Iraq, change characterized by accountability and redeployment of our troops. There will be no more blank checks. There will be tough questions in oversight, and I will work hard to make sure that this happens. I ask everyone to support the resolution

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (CONGRATULATING TOM POWERS -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend, Tom Powers, on his retirement as lieutenant with the Waterloo Fire Department. Tom will be retiring after 28 years of service to the city of Waterloo. 
   Tom became a Waterloo fire rescue firefighter on November 5, 1979, after serving honorably in the United States Navy, specializing in hydraulic systems on fighter aircraft. Tom was promoted to lieutenant with the Waterloo Fire Department on April 3, 1989. He was a certified EMT and hazmat team member, and received the Mayor's Volunteer Award. He was also selected as the department's Firefighter of the Year in 1986. 
   Our firefighters represent the very best of our communities, and Tom is no exception. He has worked tirelessly for the safety of our residents, and we honor his bravery here today. Due to his unwavering dedication, he has served, he has helped, he has saved, and he has protected. 
   I am proud to represent Tom and the city of Waterloo in Congress, and I wish him the best in all of his future endeavors, and ask you to join me today in honoring one of our hometown heroes.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2638, CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the passage of $22.3 billion in domestic disaster relief. This is critical funding which will help my State of Iowa make a full recovery from the unprecedented natural disasters that hit our State this summer. 
   I have been working hard to secure this funding for months now, ever since my district was ravaged by record floods and tornadoes which destroyed farms and businesses and displaced thousands of Iowans. 
   I am especially pleased that this disaster relief package includes $6.5 billion in community development block grant funding which will provide devastated communities with the flexible grants they need to provide temporary housing, repair and replace damaged homes and public infrastructure, and fund critical economic development activities. 
   I am also pleased that the package includes $7.9 billion for FEMA disaster relief funds which will help ensure that FEMA can continue its work helping communities recover from recent disasters, and provide the resources necessary to respond to future disasters. 
   In addition to the damage to homes, schools, hospitals, businesses and cropland, Iowa also experienced serious infrastructure damages, including damage to numerous railroad bridges like the one here in downtown Waterloo that is pictured to my right. 
   I fought very hard to repair and replace this damaged rail infrastructure, so I am glad that my efforts have paid off in this bill with funding that includes $20 million to fund the repair and replacement of damaged bridges, tracks and other rail infrastructure in Iowa. 
   I pushed hard for funding for months, ever since the House put its initial deposit down of $2.65 billion in June. I am glad that the second disaster relief package is becoming a reality. 
   I also encourage the Bush administration to ensure that this disaster relief gets to Iowans and other affected individuals around the country as soon as possible. Only yesterday, after these tragedies occurred in May and June, did the initial installment of $85 million of community development block grant funding get released from the $300 million we approved in June. Three months is too long to wait when Iowans are struggling to recover as we speak. There are hundreds of millions of dollars remaining from our initial $2.65 billion package, and the House is on the verge of passing billions more. The administration needs to get this money to the people who need it. 
   The recovery process in Iowa has been very challenging. The infrastructure demands are great. Cities like Aplington-Parkersburg lost their high school, Waverly-Shell Rock lost elementary schools. Wastewater treatment facilities throughout my district and necessary improvements to infrastructure are not being met. 
   This funding will provide critical assistance to people in need all over this country. I pledge to fight and continue these efforts to rebuild Iowa and other areas of the country until we finally achieve the victory of recovery.

<DOCNO>Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. (PRESIDENT'S VETO OF STEM CELL RESEARCH -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, President Bush has once again used his veto pen to stifle scientific research. Yesterday, the President vetoed bipartisan legislation passed by this Congress that would have expanded potentially lifesaving stem cell research. 
   The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act would have authorized Federal funds to be used for research on embryonic s tem cell lines derived from embryos at in vitro fertilization clinics that would otherwise have been discarded. 
   An overwhelming number of Americans, including doctors, scientists, health organizations, and communities of faith have been vocal in their support for this critical research because of cures it might offer to those stricken with diabetes, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cancer, spinal cord injuries and countless other ailments. 
   President Bush's decision to once again veto an expansion of this research that could bring hope to millions with life-threatening and debilitating diseases is dangerous to those who are suffering. This Democratic House will continue to push for Federal funding of this ethical and critically necessary research.
