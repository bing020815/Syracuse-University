   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Minnesota, the chairman of the committee, and the gentleman from North Carolina, for their hard work, particularly the gentleman from Minnesota. He thought that, following the passage of the farm bill earlier this year, that he would have a lighter burden. And instead, we have devoted a substantial amount of time to this legislation. Six hearings were held, more than 30 witnesses were invited before the committee, and literally, dozens of meetings took place as well to reach the point we are at. And I want to commend him for that work. 
   And I think that he has done a very good job in fending off some very bad ideas that the committee heard about from other Members and from others who wanted the committee to do a whole lot more than we are doing in this legislation. 
   But I will tell you that I think, quite frankly, the whole process is one that is not complete. We really shouldn't be bringing this up the day before the Congress recesses for August. We should take it up in September, after this particular bill has been examined more closely by more people and has, perhaps even held a hearing on the legislation itself. 
   Nonetheless, I understand the constraints he is under. He has been advised that we have to take this legislation up now. And that is what is really troubling to me the most about the legislation. I am going to support it. I think it is a modest improvement in the oversight of our commodity markets. And certainly, if there is excessive speculation in the energy markets, we all favor curbing that abuse. 
   But quite frankly, what we really are not getting to do is what took place in the last vote we just cast, the decision to adjourn this Congress this week without anything on the calendar this week to deal with the problem that is most concerning the American people, and that is the fact that we do not have a program to increase the domestic supply of American energy. 
   And we, on the Republican side, just last week, introduced legislation that already has 120 cosponsors or more, the American Energy Act, that would do all of the above. It would increase production of oil and natural gas, which we badly need, given the price that we are facing at the pump. It would have incentives for the development and expansion of nuclear power, clean burning coal technology. It would have incentives for the development of exciting new prospects for new types of energy, it would promote solar and wind power and renewable fuels and hydrogen technology. It would promote conservation, which the American people are already being forced to do because of the high price of energy they are facing at the gas pump today. 
   And I talked to a woman just last week who informed me that to fill the tank at her home with kerosene that will heat her home next winter she has been told will cost her $2,400. 
   We need to be producing increased production, American production of energy. That is what we should be debating here today. That is what should be on the floor today. And I do not understand why the leadership on the other side of the aisle will not allow us to have a vote on this. 
   It is very clear that the overwhelming majority of the American people want to see us take action on this. It is very clear that the significant number of Members on the other side of the aisle would join with virtually all of the Republicans on this side of the aisle in supporting legislation to make America energy independent. But we are not getting that vote, and the reason we are not getting that vote is because the leadership on the other side will not allow it. 
   What do they have to be afraid of in an American democracy that we can't vote on the American Energy Act? 
   That is what this is really all about. They want to go home and say they have done something about energy, when, in point of fact, they have done nothing about the supply of energy in this country because they will not allow us to vote on increasing the supply. That is what this legislation should be addressing, but instead, we are going to address legislation that simply reforms what is being done in the commodity futures trading markets. Certainly, that is a good thing and an important thing for us to look at, but it does not get at the crux of the problem we are facing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, but I would urge my colleagues to point out that this is not what we need to be debating here today at the end of July just before we go home for the August recess. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comment of the gentleman from Georgia about the fact that he favors drilling. I favor drilling. Most of the people over here who have had the opportunity to speak favor drilling. 
   We favor doing a whole lot more than drilling, too. We would like to see increased incentives for nuclear production. We would like to see incentives for coal liquefaction and clean burning coal technology, coal sequestration technology. We would like to see legislation to encourage hydrogen fuel cell technology, solar technology, wind technology to be expanded to make America energy independent. 
   But instead, today we're voting on legislation--which I support, which does a good job of enhancing the ability of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to oversee futures trading, brings more transparency to that, and I support it. But it is not going to solve the problem that the American people face, with the high cost of gasoline going into their tanks, of fuel oil that they're going to have to purchase to heat their home this winter, the higher cost of electricity that they're facing because this Congress refuses to allow us to vote on the American Energy Act and other good pieces of legislation that have been offered here in this Congress to increase the domestic supply of energy. 
   That's what we should be spending our time doing, not voting to go home for the August recess and leaving that very, very serious problem--which is having a very significant impact on our economy--unaddressed. We should have a vote on the American Energy Act. 
   I think it is a very serious mistake for the Democratic leadership to deny this Congress and bipartisan Members on both sides of the aisle the opportunity to vote on what the American people want us to vote on. That's the problem that they see here in Washington. They don't understand it. And I don't understand why the Democratic leadership is afraid of allowing democracy to work and have the vote that we need to have here in the Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, but I urge them to continue to fight for the legislation we need to have on this floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this reckless energy policy, which will do absolutely nothing to make us energy independent, or lower energy costs. This bill sets us on a dangerous path and ties our hands in a regulatory mess to ensure that we cannot produce domestic energy. 
   Like my colleagues, I believe we should find solutions to address the growing demand for energy. The biggest concern facing the farmers and ranchers of this country are increased input costs from higher fuel prices and fertilizer. The U.S. fertilizer industry relies upon natural gas as the fundamental feedstock for the production of nitrogen fertilizer. The rest of the U.S. farm sector also depends on significant amounts of natural gas for food processing, irrigation, crop drying, heating farm buildings and homes, the production of crop protection chemicals, and, let's not forget, ethanol biofuel production. In addition to the farm sector, the forest products industry relies more on natural gas than any other fossil fuel and energy amounts to the third largest manufacturing cost for the industry. 
   Unbelievably, this legislation contains no new energy supplies in it and does nothing to relieve the burdens of increased costs on producers who provide the food and fiber for American consumers. It seems that the Majority's plan to move toward energy independence includes limiting domestic energy production and imposing new government mandates that will prove to be costly and burdensome to the American people. 
   This legislation would dramatically expand the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) by increasing it to 36 billion gallons by 2022. This initiative is extremely ambitious and could be achieved by tapping all sectors of agriculture including plant and wood waste, vegetable oil, and animal fat and waste which would result in the production of 21 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol. Strangely, the bill discourages the production of cellulosic fuels from forests, even though forests are the largest potential source of cellulosic feedstock. While I am in favor of finding new markets for agriculture products, what good is finding new markets for agriculture commodities when the cost of production is too much for our farmers and ranchers? 
   We should develop a policy that is technology neutral and allows the market to develop new sources of renewable energy. The RFS provisions create an unrealistic mandate for advanced biofuels technology that doesn't yet exist and creates hurdles for the development of second generation biofuels by placing restrictions on alternative fuels, renewable fuel plant production, and, most important, limits the harvesting of our homegrown feedstocks. These restrictions will undoubtedly lead to a consumer tax to help bridge the gap in production that will occur if this policy is put into place. 
   Even with the advancement of cellulosic ethanol, the expansion of the RFS would still require 15 billion gallons of renewable fuel to come from the only current commercially available option: grain ethanol 
   Last year, 20 percent of the U.S. corn crop was used for ethanol production and that amount is expected to rise significantly over the next few years. With feed stocks meeting most of our renewable fuel initiatives, the livestock sector is facing significantly higher feed costs. Corn and soybeans' most valuable market has always been, and will continue to be, the livestock producers. We must ensure that there are not unintended economic distortions to either grain or livestock producers as a result of these sectors prospering from other markets. 
   The benefits of reduced reliance on foreign energy sources, stable energy prices, and new markets for agricultural products should not be replaced with a risk of adding even more increased input costs for livestock producers and creating even higher food prices for consumers. 
   This energy policy, set in place by the Democrat Majority, exemplifies the Democrat motto through and through: tax and spend. This bill imposes $21 billion in tax increases. The other  side will tell you that these tax increases will not affect the average hardworking American, only the ``big, evil oil companies.'' Nothing could be farther from the truth. The taxes contained in this bill will impede new domestic oil and gas production, will discourage investment in new refinery capacity, and will make it more expensive for domestic energy companies to operate in the U.S. than their foreign competitors, making the price at the pump rise even higher. 
   Let's make no mistake: an increased tax doesn't just hurt energy companies, it hurts every American--individual, farm, or company--that consumes energy. Increased taxes on energy companies are passed to consumers. Every American will see these increased costs on their energy bill. This body shouldn't pass legislation that further raises energy prices for consumers. 
   What is even more disturbing is that these increased costs will be felt by some of our Nation's most poor. On average, the Nation's working poor spends approximately 13 to 30 percent of their yearly income on energy costs. This average is already too high, and sadly this legislation will only dramatically increase the amount of money these workers will have to spend on energy costs. I have heard those on the other side of the aisle say that we must all shoulder the cost to produce clean energy. Well, the costs of the clean energy in the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) alone, as estimated by just one of Virginia's many electric utilities, will increase $200 million for its retail customers. By shifting to renewable energy sources, that are not as available or as cost effective as traditional sources, we will see a rise in energy prices across the board and this will be hardest felt by working people who cannot afford to shoulder any more costs. 
   While this bill is said to be focused on new energy technologies, it fails to address some of our most promising domestic alternative and renewable energy supplies that could be 
   cost effective for American consumers. Coal is one of our Nation's most abundant resources, yet the development of Coal-to-Liquid technologies is ignored in this bill. Furthermore, this legislation does nothing to encourage the construction of new nuclear facilities. 
   Proponents of this legislation will tout how green this bill is; however, if my colleagues really want to promote green energy they should encourage the production of more nuclear sites which provide CO  
   2 emission-free energy. The rest of the world is far outpacing the U.S. in its commitment to clean nuclear energy. We generate only 20 percent of our energy from this clean energy, when other countries can generate about 80 percent of their electricity needs through nuclear. It is a travesty that in over 1,000 pages this legislation does not once mention or encourage the construction of clean and reliable nuclear plants. Nuclear energy is the most reliable and advanced of any renewable energy technology, and if we are serious about encouraging CO 
   2-free energy use, we must support nuclear energy. 
   This legislation does nothing to address the energy concerns of our country; and it does nothing to relieve agricultural producers of their increasing input costs. This legislation only makes the situation worse and it is the product of a flawed process that does not have bipartisan support! 
   This bill is a dangerous policy for our country. If we really want to make our country energy independent, this Congress must pass an energy bill that contains energy. This bill does not. I urge my colleagues to reject this awful bill, let's start over, and work to find real solutions to the energy needs of our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this misnamed bill, which should be called the Worker Intimidation Act. 
   Madam Chairman, the National Labor Relations Act gives the private sector workers the right to join or form a labor union and to bargain collectively over wages and hours. However, this bill would eviscerate the protections for workers choosing to join or not to join a union by eliminating the requirement of a secret ballot system and requiring employees to make their ballots public. This bill strikes a blow to the privacy rights of workers throughout the country and would create opportunities for intimidation and coercion by union organizers and employees. 
   Whom then does this bill benefit? Certainly not the American workforce, a large majority of which, as cited by the gentleman from Florida, overwhelmingly opposes this bill; nor the  American people. Maybe it is the Mexican workforce. The sponsor of this bill and 15 other Democrats, after all, seek to protect the privacy of Mexican workers in a letter that they sent where they said: ``We understand that the secret ballot is allowed for but not required by Mexican labor law. However, we feel that the secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose.'' 
   The words of those proposing to support and protect Mexican workers are not willing to do that for American workers. It is a crime. 
   Madam Chairman, it strikes me as extremely ironic that the sponsor of this bill prefers to uphold the fundamental privacy protections of the Mexican workforce at the same time that he strips American workers of their privacy protections in their jobs here at home. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote down this bill that amounts to a betrayal of American workers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 964, the SPY Act. 
   The continued growth of the Internet has brought tremendous enhancements to our quality of life--from advances in the delivery of health care, to the ability of consumers to instantaneously conduct transactions online. Increasingly, consumers want a fast connection to the Internet and want the delivery of online services to be seamless and online service providers have invested significant resources to develop software to make their services as safe, reliable and fast as possible. 
   However, as Congress considers legislation to combat spyware, I believe that four overarching principles should guide our efforts. First, we must punish the bad actors, while protecting legitimate online companies. Second, we must not over-regulate, but rather encourage innovative new services and the growth of the Internet. Third, we must not stifle the tree market interactions between consumers and service providers. Fourth, we must target the behavior, not the technology. It is my hope that any legislation Congress enacts to combat spyware will adhere to these core principles. 
   On May 23, 2005, the House of Representatives passed legislation, similar to H.R. 964, which sought to solve the spyware problem by targeting the technology, instead of the criminal behavior behind the technology. However, many developments have occurred during the intervening two years which have convinced me that this regulatory approach to combating spyware is even more unwise than previously thought. 
   For example, just last month, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adopted an amendment to H.R. 964 that would have had enormous consequences for the Internet and online innovation. This amendment would have, in part, regulated Internet ``cookies'' for the first time under the bill. Internet cookies are used by most websites to enhance consumers' experiences with the Internet and to make the Internet more seamless and navigable with fewer stoplights. To make every online company that uses cookies comply with the notice and consent regime under the bill would have significantly interfered with consumers' Internet experiences. By forcing consumers to click through even more pre-scripted alert messages, this change would have, ironically, exacerbated the likelihood that consumers would become desensitized to these notices and click ``accept'' without reading them. In addition, this desensitization is likely to also give nefarious software installers a false legitimacy since there would be no distinction between the notices they provide and the notices legitimate online companies provide. 
   Apparently, the Democratic Leadership saw the error in the regulation of cookies and stripped the bill of this language just before the bill came to the Floor today. However, this mistake by the committee highlights the difficulties with trying to impose one-size-fits-all regulations to solve problems involving ever-evolving technologies. 
   In addition, Chairman Majoras of the Federal Trade Commission testified in October of 2005 that a notice-and-choice approach was not recommended for combating spyware for many reasons. He noted the fact that consumers will be overwhelmed by the notices they will receive when using the Internet and will most likely ignore the notices and click through them. 
   Furthermore, in the past few years there have been major developments in technological solutions to help consumers combat spyware. Consumer packages are becoming more and more effective in screening out unwanted spyware from their computers and are offered by many Internet service providers, as well as independent software providers. 
   Finally, a broad cross-section of legitimate online businesses and trade associations has expressed opposition to the regulatory approach of H.R. 964. On June 5, 2007, a coalition of over 30 trade associations and companies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, the Financial Services Roundtable, and numerous technology-based entities, sent a letter to all Members of the House of Representatives detailing their concerns with H.R. 964. This letter specifically expresses opposition to regulating Internet cookies, as well as opposition to including web sites (where consumers willingly submit information online) within in the scope of the legislation. 
   The better approach to combating spyware would be to target the criminal behavior of those who actually use spyware, and to continue our policy of letting innovative online companies interact with consumers to develop the exciting new online services that consumers have come to enjoy and expect from the Internet. 
   I have introduced legislation, along with my colleague Zoe Lofgren of California, to combat spyware by going after the criminals using spyware, rather than trying to regulate all software regardless of whether it is harmful or helpful. This legislation, H.R. 1525, was passed by the House and now awaits further action in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to support this targeted approach.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (VIRGINIA RIDGE AND VALLEY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer an amendment which represents an agreement just referenced by my friend and colleague, Mr. Boucher, and myself regarding some of the concerns with regard to H.R. 1011, the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act. And I'd like to thank Congressman Boucher and congratulate him for his hard work on this legislation over a number of years, and thank him for working with me to address some of these important issues. 
   H.R. 1011, the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act, creates over 40,000 acres of wilderness, wilderness study, and potential wilderness and over 11,000 acres of national scenic areas in the Jefferson National Forest in southwest Virginia. 
   Mr. Boucher and I share the Jefferson National Forest between our districts. Although this bill affects only national forest land within Mr. Boucher's district, any change in how the forest is managed will impact my district. 
   My amendment addresses three areas. First, it modifies the boundary of the Brush Mountain East Wilderness Area, removing 26 acres containing a power line which is not consistent with wilderness qualities. 
   Second, the amendment changes the boundaries of the Seng Mountain National Scenic Area, removing 1,263 acres from the area to allow continued use of the Barton Gap Motorized Trail and to allow for wildlife habitat management. 
   Finally, the amendment changes the trail language for the Raccoon Branch Area, allowing the Forest Service more flexibility when building the trail. 
   While I'm pleased to offer this amendment, it does not resolve all the concerns I have with the bill. The fact still remains that this bill ignores the recommendations of the professional land managers working in the Jefferson National Forest by designating 15,000 additional wilderness acres not recommended in the forest plan. 
   When the House Agriculture Committee held a hearing on H.R. 1011 earlier this month, several witnesses highlighted serious concerns with these additional wilderness areas. These experts noted forest health and wildfire risks, increased recreation conflicts, lack of suitability as wilderness and wildlife management needs. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a reason why Congress mandated that each national forest create a forest plan. Forest plans help the land management agencies find a balance among all the conflicting interests in national forests and factor in the latest science and cite specific qualities unique to each forest. Professional land managers then use this information to chart a path for managing each forest for the coming years. 
   The Jefferson Forest Plan, finalized in 2004, was developed over a 12-year period and involved countless scientists, land managers, interest groups and interested citizens. Throughout the process, the Forest Service held over 100 technical meetings and received over 15,000 public comments. 
   This local approach is what Congress intended when it established the national forests. Instead of resisting this localized process, H.R. 1011 tells the professional land managers and the public participants that the forest plan is not important. It says that no matter how much discussion and compromise goes on at the local level, or how good the science is, Congress knows best how to manage the national forest. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not the best way to manage the Nation's public forests. And that's why I have worked with my colleague, Mr. Boucher, to try to rectify these concerns. Until this bill is more reflective of the local perspectives and expert opinions in the forest plan, I will continue to have concerns with H.R. 1011. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, however, because I do think that the gentleman has been very forthcoming in working with us and hearing our concerns. And I hope that that will continue as this process moves forward, and I would hope that the chairman of the Resources Committee would work with us as well to continue to address concerns that we have as the bill moves through the other body. 
   Again, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his hard work on this legislation, for his willingness to work with me in addressing these concerns. I wish more had been addressed, but I thank him for where he has come. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6. Like my colleagues, I believe we should find solutions to address the growing demand for energy, and I look forward to working with my colleague, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Peterson, to find new ways for American agriculture to provide increasing sources of domestic energy. 
   In the Republican-led Congress, I supported an energy bill that was signed into law that actually encouraged domestic energy production and lessened our dependence on foreign oil. Today's legislation, however, seems to dismantle any progress we have made in achieving energy independence. 
   The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, they don't agree with each other very often, they both condemn this legislation. The Wall Street Journal calls it the OPEC Energy Security Act: ``This bill is said to promote America's energy independence, but the biggest winner may be OPEC. Raise taxes on domestic oil producers,'' it said. ``Yes, raise the cost at the gas pump for American consumers. Raise the cost for American farmers who have to buy oil and natural gas to operate their farms. Every American farmer has to do that.'' 
   The Washington Post says: ``This heavy-handed attack on the stability of contracts would be welcomed in Russia, Bolivia or other countries that have been criticized for tearing up revenue-sharing agreements with private energy companies.'' The Wall Street Journal again says: ``So at the same time that the U.S. is trying to persuade Venezuela and other nations to honor property rights, Congress does its own Hugo Chavez imitation.'' 
   Many Members have discussed passionately how America needs to decrease its dependence on foreign oil. In fact, many campaigned on promises to decrease our independence. But here we are in the midst of the Democratic leadership's first 100 hours considering a bill to increase America's dependence on foreign oil. This is dangerous policy for our national and economic security. 
   This legislation increases fees for domestic energy production and repeals for energy companies only the manufacturing tax deduction which was put in place to encourage domestic manufacturing and jobs from domestic production of goods. The manufacturing tax deduction was extended to all manufacturing to fix the problematic FSC-ETI problem, and was in no way a giveaway to the oil companies. 
   By singling out one industry alone, we are not righting a wrong. We are persecuting an industry and the people employed in that industry domestically. This is not attacks on foreign production in Venezuela or Iran or Saudi Arabia. This is attacks on American production of energy. Repealing these incentives makes it less economical to produce domestic energy and will compel companies to seek cheaper options abroad. 
   While energy demands continue to rise, this bill would discourage domestic production, forcing the U.S. to import more foreign oil. While the proponents will tell you only oil companies will pay, the truth is every single one of us will pay the price. 
   So why are we increasing the price of energy as well as our dependence on foreign oil? Those on the other side think this will help spur research for alternative energy. It is estimated that this bill robs about $14 billion over the next decade from domestic energy production. That is quite a lot of money. But where is the plan outlining how that money will be used? Sadly, there isn't one, thanks to a closed rule, with no amendments offered whatsoever time after time during this process, in contrast with the Contract With America, where we allowed 154 Democratic amendments, 48 of which, by the way, passed and were included as a part of the Contract With America. In this process, that possibility of spelling that out is gone. There is no way to tell people how we can use this for more domestic production for renewable fuels, for example. Sadly, there isn't anything like that. 
   This bill creates a $14 billion piggy bank or slush fund that we have been told will be used for future alternative energy legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this very bad legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the day when we can work across the aisle to do what I have heard so many of the speakers here today talk about doing in terms of encouraging greater production of renewable energy here in the  United States. The committee will look forward to doing that, indeed. 
   But this legislation doesn't do it. Unfortunately, it doesn't do it because of the very closed rule that we pointed out throughout the Democrats' 100 hours; no openness whatsoever, in contrast to the Contract with America, when Democrats offered 154 amendments. In fact, 48 were adopted. 
   We could have spelled out in good legislation, if it had been through the committee process and we had held hearings and markups in each of the committees represented here today, to say what we were going to use this money for. 
   But, instead, what we are asked to do is vote for a tax increase on domestic production of energy, no tax increase on Venezuela and Hugo Chavez, no tax increase on Iran, no tax increase on any Middle Eastern country, no jobs lost over there, but jobs lost in the United States and American consumers paying for it at the gas pump and American farmers and ranchers paying for it with increased energy cost. 
   Oppose this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON H.R. 2419, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to instruct conferees to make clear that tax increases do not belong in a farm bill. While there are still some funding issues that need to be worked out and many policy decisions to be negotiated, these instructions are very clear in stating that tax increases cannot be used to fund the remaining elements of the farm bill. 
   Again I will read the actual language of the motion, which is that the managers on the part of the House at the conference on the disagreeing votes on the two Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 2419 be instructed within the scope of the conference to disagree to any provision which will result in an increase in taxes. 
   These instructions are very clear in stating that tax increases cannot be used to fund the remaining elements of the farm bill. Farm bills have long enjoyed bipartisan support in this body, and it would be devastating to American agriculture to add a divisive element such as tax increases to this bill. 
   This conference has been a long time coming, and we are ready to put together a reform-minded farm bill that addresses a variety of issues, including conservation, nutrition, energy, rural development, fruits and vegetables, and forestry, while maintaining a strong safety net for America's farmers and ranchers so that they can continue to meet the growing demand for their products in the global market.     
   This motion is very important. I expect that there will be strong bipartisan support for this motion, and it's important because we have been down this road of attempting to pass a farm bill for quite some time. 
   When the bill came out of the House Agriculture Committee last summer, many of the Members on this side of the aisle expected that the amount of money that was added outside of the committee's jurisdiction would not constitute tax increases. We are very disappointed to find that it did include tax increases, and that has definitely bogged down this process for the many, many, many months since. 
   We have now had some very good discussions with members of other committees that are involved in making sure that we have the ability to move forward and to pay for measures that exceed the amount of money within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee, and those do not include tax increases. 
   This is, I think, an important statement to be made here and in the other body that we can complete this work without tax increases. We do not need to repeat the mistakes that were made earlier in that regard. 
   I also think it's very clear that the President of the United States has been very strong in his statement that this bill would be vetoed if it included tax increases. While we continue to work with the administration on a number of other issues, we are making progress there as well. 
   Again, this would reaffirm, I think, the kind of bipartisan support that it takes to pass a farm bill and get it signed into law. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would just say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania that I very much appreciate his kind words. We have worked in a very bipartisan fashion. The chairman of the committee has been very dedicated to working with us, and we very much appreciate that, as have the other members of the committee. 
   We now look forward to going to conference and have the opportunity to work together as we work with the other body to try to work out what are still many, many hurdles. A lot of the people have been excited that we are going to conference, and we need to make sure they understand that we are not done with this, but we do have some good ideas that we are going to be able to move forward with. I think that's very encouraging. 
   I would also say to the gentleman from Wisconsin that I too share his desire for reform. This farm bill will contain a lot of reform, and it will result in substantial savings to the taxpayers of the country, because, in fact, that has already occurred. 
   The current farm bill, if it were to be perpetuated, which I do not support, but if it were to be perpetuated, would cost $58 billion less for the next 5 years than it cost for the last 5. So the fact of the matter is there is already substantial savings being achieved. 
   There are, nonetheless, additional reforms that I and many others support as we move to conference with this legislation, and I think the outcome will be one that maintains the safety net for America's farmers and ranchers, but makes a number of very important reforms in a number of different areas and enhances those new areas that I know the gentleman has championed and others, like conservation, which I very much join him in supporting and making sure that the nutritional needs of many in this country are met, and other purposes. We can do that without tax increases, and, as a result, I think this is a very appropriate motion to instruct to adopt today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   For the past few years, the Committee on Agriculture has taken a proactive approach to try to understand and monitor the issue of trading activity in the futures markets and conduct appropriate oversight. This was so we could make an informed decision about whether or not commodity markets need greater transparency and accountability. 
   Last week, CFTC Acting Chairman Walt Lukken presented a 6-month study of the futures market to the committee. Chairman Lukken and his staff spent a lot of hours and a great deal of work over the past 3 months to produce that report. We appreciated their efforts, especially for keeping an aggressive timetable. 
   The CFTC report was useful in providing a reference point in determining the relationship between index fund-related activity in the over-the-counter markets and commodity futures, and energy and agriculture prices in the United States. 
   However, as we move forward today with H.R. 6604, there are key factors for us to consider. 
   One, after hearing testimony from Mr. Lukken, and after examining the findings of this report, it is evident that our priority should be ensuring that the CFTC has the tools and resources it needs to protect and preserve the integrity of our futures markets. 
   The CFTC devoted more than 30 employees and 4,000 staff hours to produce this report. Those who have read the report all agree that these broad snapshots of the markets are necessary, but the CFTC does not have the staff to dedicate to similar projects. 
   This bill directs the CFTC to hire 100 additional employees. But because there has not been a single appropriations bill passed by both Chambers and presented to the President, I have no idea how the already underfunded agency will be able to do so. 
   The Democratic leadership is fond of pointing the finger of blame, but ultimately the Democratic leadership has one duty, to consider and pass the appropriations bills that fund the government. The Democratic leadership has refused to execute this duty and has failed the American taxpayer. 
   Second, this bill will not reduce the price of oil. It will not relieve the burden many Americans face at the gas pump. In order to achieve that very important goal, Congress must focus on creating a viable energy policy that goes beyond the measures passed thus far to increase the domestic supply of energy sources and promote energy independence. 
   Though I have concerns that some of the provisions in H.R. 6604 are too far-reaching, I will continue to support this bill to ensure that the CFTC has all the tools it needs to preserve and protect the integrity of our futures markets. 
   But I know, as I have worked closely with the chairman of the committee, who has worked in a very bipartisan fashion to fashion this legislation and address these concerns and make sure the CFTC has the necessary oversight authority and capability, that this bill would provide for it. 
   I also know that this is not what the American people want and need when it comes to energy. I know that there are many on the other side of the aisle who are hoping still to have an opportunity to vote, not on a hoax, not on a sham like we did 2 days ago, but on a real American energy bill that provides for real offshore drilling, not a bill that would shut off 80 to 90 percent of the known oil and natural gas reserves from access, not a bill that does nothing to promote nuclear power, not a bill that doesn't take up consideration of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, not a bill that shuts us off from tapping into the oil shale reserves that are in tremendous abundance in the Rocky Mountain States, not a bill that does nothing for coal-to-liquid and other clean coal technologies that would benefit the American people, since we have the largest coal reserves in the world, not a bill that imposes tax increases in order to get to the alternative forms of energy that the American people want to have, but, rather, the American Energy Act, something that we asked this Congress to bring up before we went into a 5-week August recess. 
   While the Speaker of the House ordered the microphones turned off, the C-SPAN cameras turned off, the lights turned down low, we stayed here day after day, week after week, calling for a vote on the American Energy Act. We didn't get it.  
   Instead, we got this sham hoax that won't produce a drop of new oil, won't produce a cubic foot of new natural gas, will do nothing for nuclear power, will do nothing for coal, will do nothing for alternative forms of energy. It is simply an effort to try to derail what the American people clearly wanted to see on the floor of this House. 
   We still haven't seen it. This bill doesn't do it. We need to have that vote, and that's what the debate should be about here today, not this legislation which is good, but does not do what the American people want. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As I say, I appreciate working with the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Minnesota on this legislation. 
   I think this legislation gives to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the necessary tools for appropriate oversight and enforcement. I think this is a light touch. I do not think that it interferes in the marketplace. 
   And I think that the evidence that was brought forth by the recent report submitted by the CFTC is very strong evidence that the marketplace is working very well, but it needs constant vigilance. We can see that with the difficulties that are being experienced around the country and around the world in other types of markets. 
   Certainly in the mortgage area and other financial areas, the risk of not giving the regulatory agencies the appropriate authority to do oversight and to act is certainly a grave concern. But I think we are doing that in this area. I think the CFTC is doing that in this area, and I think this legislation will help to enhance their ability to remain vigilant in making sure that this market operates properly; that there is not excessive speculation; that there is not manipulation of this marketplace. 
   Having said all of that, I will say, once again, that this is not the issue that we should be debating here today. I support this legislation. I will vote for it. But we deserve an opportunity to vote on what the American people want. And poll after poll have shown that they want to see a real energy act. They know that the problem with the high price of energy is the lack of supply. They know the problem with the disruption of our energy supply that just occurred due to Hurricane Ike is because we have not enough refinery capacity in this country, and that it is not distributed around the United States. 
   The American Energy Act provides for using abandoned U.S. military bases to build new refineries. We haven't built a new one in more than 30 years. And the bill that was brought to the floor of the House by the Democratic leadership earlier this week did absolutely nothing in that area.  
   We're now importing refined petroleum products, paying a higher price. We're seeing more and more billions of dollars going out of this country every week, costing America jobs, harming our economy because we are so dependent upon foreign oil, at the same time that we have huge resources, not just oil, but natural gas, coal, the potential of new nuclear power, as well as a whole array of alternative sources of energy like wind and solar and geothermal and biomass and hydrogen. All of these things are available to us if we will take the leadership here in this Congress and get the American Government out of the way of developing these new sources of energy. But, instead of doing that, we bring a no drill, no energy bill to the floor that was clearly a sham, a hoax on the American people. 
   We have abundant resources in oil. The estimates are that we could be producing 3 to 4 million barrels of oil from the Outer Continental Shelf. The bill that was brought forth on the floor of the House shuts off 80 to 90 percent of that oil from access to the marketplace because they don't allow drilling. 
   I introduced legislation, as have other people, to allow drilling off the coast of our respective States. I've introduced one for Virginia that has strong support in our delegation. And yet the legislation that was brought forward earlier this week does not provide any royalties for the States. So our Governor, Democratic Governor of the State has already indicated that if the State can't benefit from deriving royalties that can be used for developing better transportation systems, alternative forms of energy, public education and so on, if it can't be used for that, he's not interested in participating. So that bill was meaningless. It was a sham. 
   We need to bring forth real legislation like the American Energy Act that shares those royalties with the States so that they're able to do that. 
   It's estimated that we could have a million barrels of oil a day coming down the pipeline that already exists in Canada, if we would drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area the size of the State of South Carolina; and the area that would be utilized for drilling for oil is about 2,000 acres, like a postage stamp on a football field. That's how much of this land of this huge area would be utilized. The people of Alaska support it. The Governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, supports it. 
   Are we doing that? 
   No. Wouldn't even bring it up. Wouldn't bring up a bill that we could even offer an amendment to to allow for that to take place. 
   Meanwhile, the oil that comes from the Prudhoe Bay area is declining. It was 2.1 million barrels a day at its peak. It's now down to 700,000 barrels a day. We're told that when it gets down to 300,000 barrels a day, we'll have to close down the pipeline because it's not economically efficient to transport the oil. 
   At the same time we could be adding a million barrels of oil a day for an estimated 30 years, we're at risk of losing not just that million, but an additional 300,000 barrels of oil a day, about 6 percent of the consumption in this country every day for 30 years. 
   And then look at the oil shale available in the Rocky Mountain States. Here we have an estimated somewhere between 800 billion and 2 trillion barrels of oil that can be extracted from that oil shale, much like the Canadians are extracting oil from tar sands in Canada. So while they're doing that in Canada, this Congress last year passed legislation that prohibits the United States Government from buying that oil from Canada. 
   And then in terms of our own reserves which are huge, to just give you an idea, since the first oil well was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859, until today, the entire world has used about 1 trillion barrels of oil. And yet we're leaving untapped, because legislation was not brought forward to address it, untapped, 800 billion to 2 trillion barrels of oil available to us in that oil shale deposits in the Rocky Mountain States. It's a shame, Mr. Speaker, that we're not doing that today. 
   Coal reserves. We have more coal reserves than any other nation in the world. New technology exists to convert it to liquid that can be used for transportation purposes. We have new technology that is cleaner burning coal, and yet we're not doing anything in the legislation that was offered here earlier this week to tap into that. 
   Nuclear power. It's been correctly noted here today that while the United States still derives 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, France today gets close to 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. They continue to develop that technology. We haven't, for 30 years. We haven't for 30 years built a single new nuclear power plant. There are now some on the drawing boards, thanks to legislation that the Congress adopted 2 years ago to incentivize that. 
   But because of regulations that stand in the way, we will not have the opportunity to see a single kilowatt hour of electricity generated from those new nuclear power plants for at least 10 years. Why? 
   Because this Democratic leadership would not bring up legislation like the American Energy Act that enables that. 
   The same thing with the development of alternative fuels like wind and solar and geothermal and hydrogen and biomass. What do they do to incentivize? They increase taxes. That's the last thing we need right now when the American economy is in the condition that it's in, to have tax increases to pay for something that we could pay for with the royalties that would come from drilling offshore, from drilling in Alaska, from tapping into that oil shale, from drilling for natural gas where the largest deposit known in the world is in the Gulf of Mexico, and yet we can't have access to it. 
   There's natural gas all down the eastern coast of the United States. We can't have access to that. Why? Because they won't share the royalties with the States and it won't happen. And they've kept some of these areas off limits in their legislation as well. 
   This is a travesty, Mr. Speaker. We should be having the American Energy Act on the floor today. That's what the American people want. That's what will create millions of American jobs in creating this new energy, and in revitalizing our industry and revitalizing manufacturing and strengthening agricultural production in this country and strengthening all of American commerce, making us more competitive with the rest of the world if we would simply seek to be energy independent, which we could accomplish in 10 or 15 years if the leadership of this Congress would simply bring forward legislation that would enable us to empower America to have real energy independence and real American jobs and save this economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentleman from Minnesota is. 
   I would again thank the gentleman for his hard work on this legislation. This is not legislation that this committee has in any way taken lightly over the past several years. We've conducted oversight into the activities of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the futures markets. We've done it in a bipartisan way. We have watched closely to make sure that the commission has the resources it needs to do its job. 
   We found some areas where we think it could use some additional help in terms of personnel, in terms of the authority to gather information, and in a few instances in giving them additional authority to act if they find that there are indicators in the marketplace that it's not functioning properly, that there is excessive speculation and that there is manipulation; and this legislation does that, and I support that. Although I do have some reservations about the legislation, I think it is legislation that deserves to be passed into law. 
   However, I will say it once again that this is not the legislation that the American people want and expect to see us debating on the floor of the House today. They want real energy legislation, not the sham bill that was offered 2 days ago, but legislation that would allow for real drilling for American oil and natural gas and would allow for utilizing new clean-burning coal technologies, that would expand our nuclear power generation of electricity, that would expand our alternative forms of energy. 
   And as we move in that direction, utilizing the resources that are created by producing American energy to accomplish more in the areas of wind and solar and geothermal and hydrogen and biomass and tidal energy production and a whole array of others, that we are simply neglecting because this Congress, the Democratic leadership, refuses to bring to the floor for a vote the American Energy Act, which would command very, very overwhelming bipartisan support if it were brought to the floor for a vote. 
   But it's more than just what consumers are paying at the gas pump. It's more than what they're worried about having to pay to fill their tanks with oil or kerosene to heat their homes this winter or their natural gas bills or their electric bills that are going up and up. It's more than that. It's about the American economy, and it's about American jobs. 
   This legislation would create millions of American jobs, not only in energy production but also in manufacturing and agriculture, in a whole host of areas that would make America more confident, would make America more competitive with the rest of the world. We need this legislation. We need it badly. It will be a shame, Mr. Speaker, if we leave town without passing the American Energy Act. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would join him in supporting this motion to recommit because it would help to assure a great many Members on our side of the aisle that the concerns raised about the legislation that somehow  this might prove to be disruptive of the markets would indeed not occur. It would simply require that the CFTC examine that and certify that they do not believe that that would be the case, and then the legislation could proceed to be fully implemented, and I think this is a wise consideration. 
   The evidence that we have before us from the findings of a recent CFTC report is that these markets are functioning well. I think this legislation will enable them to continue to function well, but it does not, I think, in any way hurt and could, in fact, indeed enhance the operation of CFTC for them to require to make this investigation and make this certification that people, millions, tens of millions of Americans whose pension funds may include some investment in commodity futures markets will be unaffected by the legislation in terms of empowering the CFTC to conduct further oversight and to take further action as is allowed by the legislation. 
   Again, I would point out that the best thing we can do to secure the pension funds of Americans would be to create more energy in this country that would meet the supply demands that are necessary, would help to hold down the cost of oil and natural gas and electricity and everything else that drives this economy, both in terms of our transportation, our manufacturing, the heating of our homes. All of these things would be greater enhanced if we would have the American Energy Act brought before us. 
   Unfortunately, I believe the American Energy Act would not be a germane motion to recommit. Otherwise, we'd be offering it right now, but I believe the gentleman's alternative is a good one, and I support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my strong support for this resolution. 
   Four hundred years ago in 1607, 104 English settlers took a dangerous voyage. The voyage alone was perilous, but their future in their new land was no less daunting. These courageous voyagers landed on the shores of what is now the great Commonwealth of Virginia. They set sail on what many have considered America's founding river, the James River, and established the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown. 
   These brave settlers faced many hardships--sickness, war, hunger, and death. However, their faith and perseverance allowed this colony to flourish despite these seemingly insurmountable odds. These settlers established the foundation of this great Nation, and I am happy that we, in this House, are gathered here today to commemorate their sacrifice. 
   These early settlers were the first to celebrate what we have now come to 
   know as the American dream. Kathryn Lange said it best in her book, ``1607: A New Look At Jamestown,'' ``Jamestown was a place where the poor might become rich through hard work, where people could govern themselves and where cultures mixed to create a new, American way of life.'' 
   This profound, new way of life, was unlike anything else in the world at the time. The Jamestown Colony planted the seeds of the ideals of life and liberty, which sprouted into this great Nation. As a nation we have held fast to the ideals that flourished in this early colony, and we still celebrate those ideals today. 
   Today we gather to commemorate that early settlement at Jamestown, but we do not commemorate just one colony, we commemorate the birth of a nation that sprung from that small colony. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement, and the birth of our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today regarding H.R. 1294, the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2007. While I support granting these six Virginia tribes Federal recognition, I remain concerned about opening the door to casino-style gaming in the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
   The Virginia tribes have always contended that they have no interest in pursuing gaming. And I was encouraged when the Resources Committee adopted an amendment to limit the tribes' ability to pursue gaming. However, in recent days I have begun to hear murmurs that the language is not as strong as we have been led to believe, and the tribes are considering challenging the gaming limitation. I have always believed the tribes when they have said they do not wish to pursue gambling, so I hope that there is no truth to a challenge. 
   I believe it is the desire of this Congress that if challenged in court, this language would be upheld, just as similar language was upheld in Del Sur Pueblo v. The State of Texas, 69 Fed. App. 659. However, I urge the Senate to look closely at this bill to see if this language can be tightened and strengthened to further ensure that casino-style gambling doe not come to the Commonwealth. We must ensure that this bill, while well-intentioned, does not negatively affect Virginia. 
   The Commonwealth of Virginia and the Nation should honor and recognize these tribes. However, we must continue to look for a way to grant them this recognition, without leaving our beautiful Commonwealth open to the ill-effects of gambling.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the chairman of the committee, Mr. Peterson, for his work in this area. We held a hearing on this issue on Tuesday of this week. In the farm bill which the Congress just passed overwhelmingly several times, we overrode the President's veto, it includes legislative language that takes further steps to complete the closure of the Enron loophole. In that testimony we received on Tuesday, we received assurance that between the language that was in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed in the aftermath of the Enron scandal, and in the language that was included in the farm bill, the Enron loophole is now closed. 
   I have no reason to oppose this legislation and I therefore will support it. It simply tells the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to do what it already has the authority to do, and based upon the testimony that we received on Tuesday is already doing to ensure that there is not excessive speculation in the energy futures markets. I have every confidence that they will do so, that they will heed this additional voice of support for their doing their jobs. But, quite frankly, this legislation does not do what needs to be done by this Congress. 
   The Democratic leadership in this Congress is continuing a pattern that the American people are increasingly concerned about, and that is to do everything they can to try to blame everyone but themselves for the problem that we face in this country of having years of neglect of not having a domestic energy policy dedicated toward increasing the supply, increasing the supply of oil, increasing the supply of natural gas, increasing the supply of clean-burning coal, increasing the supply of nuclear power, increasing the supply of alternative fuels, increasing efforts to bring about new technologies. This is the all-of-the-above approach that this Congress should be taking that our conference has taken. In fact, we have worked very hard to see that this policy be brought to the floor of the House. 
   Yes, I will support this bill telling the CFTC to use its authority to curb excessive speculation, but I think it appalling that we aren't doing the job that needs to be done. It is being blocked by the party that controls the access to the floor of this House.  
   H.R. 2279, to expedite the construction of new refining capacity on closed military installations in the United States, and for other purposes, sponsored by Representative Pitts of Pennsylvania with 55 cosponsors. From the House Energy and Commerce and Armed Services Committees, last major action taken, a motion to discharge petition filed by Mr. English, petition 110-9. Why haven't we seen this bill brought to the floor of the House? 
   H.R. 3089, the No More Excuses Energy Act of 2007 sponsored by Representative Thornberry of Texas, 77 cosponsors, referred to the Committees on Natural Resources, House Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce. Last major action, June 10, motion to discharge petition filed by Mr. Walberg. A motion was filed to discharge the Natural Resources, Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce Committees of this action. No action taken. Why hasn't that bill been brought to the floor of the House? 
   We have this week another discharge petition on H.R. 5656 which repeals the requirement with respect to the procurement and acquisition of alternative fuels, a discharge petition filed this week by Representative Hensarling. Why hasn't this legislation been brought to the floor of this House? 
   There are scores of other bills sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats dedicated to relieving this energy crisis that have been bottled up by the Democratic majority. 
   When, Mr. Speaker, will we get the chance to vote on these very worthy bills? When will we get the chance to actually start offering relief from the outrageously high gas prices that American consumers are facing? 
   That's the problem we are confronting. That's the problem that the leadership in this Congress is not allowing us to address. That's what needs to be done, not telling the CFTC to do the job that they are already doing and already have the authority to do, but acting to make sure that we are increasing supply of all sources of energy, new sources of energy, traditional sources of energy, acting to make sure that the incentives are in place for Americans to conserve. My goodness, they are already doing that. We are seeing that reflected in their activities. This Congress could be helping them out. It is failing to do so. And that, Mr. Speaker, is why we are failing the American people when the leadership of this Congress does not allow us to have these votes. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in the Record a joint analysis prepared by the majority and minority staff of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the testimony of Michael Greenberger before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on June 3, 2008. It responds to a number of assertions made about what might happen to the market. And while I certainly would hope that something could be found to lower gas prices by as much as Mr. Greenberger suggested in his testimony, here are several pages of reasons why that may indeed not be the case. 
   Select Excerpts of the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations 
   8. STATEMENT: ``Overnight, [prohibiting the trading of energy commodities in Exempt Commercial Markets) will bring down the price of crude oil, I believe, by 25 percent.'' 
   RESPONSE: According to recent market data, there is little to no trading of crude oil contracts on exempt commercial markets in the United States. Prohibiting the trading of energy commodities in a market in which no trading is currently taking place is, thus, unlikely to have an effect on the price of crude oil. Moreover, although there have never been any Exempt Commercial Markets for agricultural commodities, many agricultural commodities have recently experienced substantial price spikes. There is no credible evidence that simply amending the CEA to regulate energy commodities as if they were agricultural commodities will lead to lower energy prices. 
   19. STATEMENT (p. 8): ``The Senate Permanent Investigating Subcommittee has now issued two reports, one in June 2006 and one in June 2007, that make a very strong (if not irrefutable) case that trading on ICE has been used to manipulate or excessively speculate in U.S. delivered crude oil and natural gas contracts. The June 2006 report cited economists who then concluded that when a barrel of crude was @ $77 in June 2006, $20 to $30 of that cost was due to excessive speculation and/or manipulation on unregulated exchanges.'' 
   RESPONSE: The 2006 and 2007 PSI reports focused on the role of excessive speculation in U.S. commodity markets; neither report contained any findings on whether traders manipulated crude oil or natural gas prices.

   I support this measure. Certainly, I expect the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to address any problems with excessive speculation in the energies markets and to use their emergency powers to do so, if appropriate. 
   But I will tell you that this is a problem that's been going on a lot longer than recent speculation in this market. It's been going on for years because of a lack of increase of supplies of oil and natural gas and other basic sources of energy in this country. 
   All we ask of the Democratic leadership is to put the bills on the floor that get what the American people want, and that is a vote to open up America to increase domestic supply of energy. The Speaker of the House doesn't have to support the legislation. The majority leader doesn't have to support the legislation. All they have to do is let this happen on a bipartisan basis, and we will have a bipartisan vote to do what the American people want. Let us have that vote. Let us have that debate on the floor of this House, and we will do what the American people want.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (FEDERAL LAND ASSISTANCE, MANAGEMENT AND ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment with the bill before us today, H.R. 5541, the Forest Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act or the FLAME Act. Mr. Speaker, I believe that the authors of this bill are well intentioned and truly want to solve the wildfire funding problem, but, sadly, the FLAME Act does not provide the comprehensive solution needed to adequately resolve this problem. 
   With the unhealthy conditions in our forests, extreme drought, and the increasing influx of people building in fire-prone areas, the size and severity of wildfires has dramatically increased. In the 1990s, an average of 3.2 million acres burned each year. Since 2000, that annual average has doubled to 7.1 million acres. The cost of fighting these wildfires has skyrocketed, from averages of $400 million annually in the 1990s to roughly $1.4 billion in 2007. This year an area roughly the size of Connecticut has already burned, at cost of over $665 million to date. 
   This is not just a western issue. In my home State of Virginia, more acres have burned already this year than in any single entire year since 1963 at a cost of millions of dollars. 
   As firefighting costs have increased, the overall USDA Forest Service and Department of the Interior budgets have not. So, the Forest Service and DOI are footing the bill for these large, unpredictable emergency wildfires within the confines of a flat budget. For the Forest Service, this has meant a 77 percent increase in fire expenditures, a 23 percent decrease in funds to manage the national forests, and a 38 percent decrease in funds to help States and private owners manage their forests. Whether you're a wilderness advocate, a hunter, a mountain biker, or a logger, everyone will be impacted if we don't solve this problem. 
   Wildfires are not only consuming more forestland, they are consuming the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior themselves. 
   The FLAME Act falls short of protecting the Agencies' budgets from this continued erosion. H.R. 5541 does not change the current budget practice of funding firefighting based on the average expenses over the previous decade. Without this change, we will continue to see more and more of the Agencies' budgets go toward fire and less towards taking care of our Nation's forests. 
   In addition to this shortfall, the FLAME Act lacks a comprehensive set of solutions to the problem. Fixes to the wildfire budgeting system must be accompanied by strong cost containment and accountability standards while also ensuring firefighter safety, incentives to encourage communities to step up to the plate and reduce wildfire risks, and more tools to prevent or minimize damage due to catastrophic wildfires, particularly in our Federal forests.  
   H.R. 5648, the Emergency Wildland Fire Response Act of 2008 which Chairman PETERSON and I introduced along with a bipartisan group of our colleagues, provides this comprehensive solution. Unfortunately, negotiations for a more comprehensive solution were cut short. 
   I'm pleased to see that the authors of the FLAME Act have incorporated aspects of H.R. 5648 that encourage communities to step up to the plate and become ``fire-ready'' and encourage the Agencies to contain costs in their firefighting efforts. 
   Unfortunately, even with these improvements, the FLAME Act ignores the underlying problem causing the increases in firefighting costs--the unhealthy condition of our Federal forests. We will continue to see skyrocketing firefighting costs and more damage to our forests, watersheds, and communities unless we take steps to reduce fire risk in our Federal forests. We must provide the Agencies additional tools to get our Federal forests in a healthy, more fire resilient condition. 
   My alternative bill, H.R. 5648 provides a new contracting tool for the Forest Service to partner with States to address these unhealthy conditions in Federal forests. This authority has been tested in Colorado and Utah where it's proven to be very effective. Unfortunately, H.R. 5541 contains no such tools. 
   Mr. Speaker, as California and other States are dealing with massive wildfires even as we speak, we shouldn't squander our time with legislation that is only half the solution. H.R. 5541 is akin to using the watering can to fight a wildfire: it might have some short-term benefit of slowing down the flames, but ultimately, it won't stop the fire. 
   That being said, I will vote for this bill because it does move the ball forward. I'm hopeful that we can improve it as we move forward and ask my colleagues to join me in this effort.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen from Virginia, Mr. Wolf and Mr. Scott, for leading this tribute to a great and courageous woman, Congresswoman JO ANN DAVIS. 
   I had the opportunity first to meet JO ANN DAVIS when she was a member of the Virginia General Assembly. She showed there the same courage, determination and hard work that she has shown here during her service in the United States Congress. Right through to her final week here, she was still working for the people of the First Congressional District of Virginia. She was very proud of her representation of those great people and often talked about her district as being America's First Congressional District because it contained Jamestown and Yorktown and Williamsburg, and worked very hard for the past year or more as we prepared for this year's celebration of the 400th anniversary of the settlement of Jamestown. 
   She also was a member of three very important committees here in the Congress, the Armed Services Committee, the International Relations Committee and the Intelligence Committee, all very much related to our Nation's national security and working with other countries around the world in our war against terror and was very, very dedicated to our Armed Services, the men and women who served there and our veterans. She stood up for them time and time again. 
   When I arrived at my office today, I found in my in-box a copy of a bill that she introduced just last Tuesday, October 2. It may well be the last bill that she introduced in the Congress, House Concurrent Resolution 222, cosponsored by myself and all the other Members on both sides of the aisle, commending the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Langley Research Center in her district, on the celebration of its 90th anniversary later this month. 
   I can think of no better tribute to Congresswoman Davis and to the men and women of the NASA Langley Research Center, the premier aeronautic space and research facility in the country. I would commend to the Speaker and to the chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology where this bill has been referred to pass it, not only in tribute to those great workers at that great facility, but also a tribute to a great Member of Congress, Congresswoman JO ANN DAVIS, who worked in this body in a very bipartisan spirit. 
   Every month the Virginia congressional delegation meets, both the Senators and the House Members, the Republicans and the Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion. We talk about the issues that we are dealing with here in the Congress, particularly those that have a great impact on the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
   She was an active and vocal participant in all of those discussions looking after the interests of Virginia and her congressional district. But she also loved to get away from here to her home in Gloucester, to her horses, to her family, her wonderful husband, Chuck, her children and grandchildren, where she was when she passed on at the end of last week. 
   We will all miss her. Our hearts go out to her family, to her constituents. It is my hope that we will all take heart from this brave and courageous woman to her last days serving the people of her district with distinction and courage and great honor and determination.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which will help protect our Nation's judges against those who may want to harm them, or who may threaten to harm them in efforts to influence outcomes of cases. 
   Until recently, when a judge or court official needed to submit a financial disclosure report, personal information about that individual could be redacted to prevent those who may intend harm from obtaining such information as the individual's home address. 
   Unfortunately, this redaction authority expired at the end of 2005. A recent incident in which a convicted felon requested the financial disclosure records of a judicial officer and those records contained such items as the work address of the officer's wife--highlights the need to reauthorize the authority to redact this type of personal information. 
   H.R. 1130, the judicial disclosure responsibility act, would amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to extend through 2009 the authority of the judicial conference to redact certain personal information from financial disclosure reports filed by judges. In addition, the bill would restrict disclosure of personal information about family members of judges when that disclosure might endanger them, in order to protect such information as the school location of a judge's children, the address of the workplace of a judge's spouse, and the like. 
   This narrowly tailored legislation will protect those that protect us--and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on the Judiciary Committee and on this legislation, and I also thank Chairman Conyers and Subcommittee Chairman Scott, my colleague from Virginia, for their work on this legislation, as well as Congressman Murphy and Congressman Forbes, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 740, the Preventing Harassment Through Outbound Number Enforcement, or PHONE, Act. 
   Consumer fraud and identity theft are serious problems facing our citizens today. While technology has provided access to vast amounts of information about products and services that were not even imaginable a few years ago, technology is also being used by criminals to commit new types of fraud and to steal personal information from unknowing consumers. 
   Like other technologies, caller ID devices have empowered consumers. These devices allow them to screen out calls they would prefer not to take. However, they also perform the important function of acting as an additional check to ensure that the individuals placing incoming calls are who they say they are. 
   Unfortunately, criminals have found a way to fake caller ID information in order to trick consumers about who is actually calling. Increasingly, thieves are using this tactic to extract personal information from unsuspecting consumers. For example, by faking the caller ID of a consumer's bank, a thief can lure a consumer into divulging bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, and other types of sensitive personal information which can then be used to commit identity theft and other criminal acts. 
   The PHONE Act will help stop this abusive practice. Specifically, this bill imposes criminal penalties on those that provide false caller ID information with the intent to defraud, as well as those that provide the caller ID information of an actual person without that person's consent, with the intent to defraud the recipient of the call. 
   The PHONE Act is an important tool in the fight against identity theft, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to H. Con. Res. 99, which has been  called the single biggest tax increase in American history. 
   However, I rise today to express my extreme disappointment that the majority decided to oppose debate on an amendment I offered to express the sense of Congress that the money the Federal Government spends is not the Government's, but rather the hard-earned dollars of the American taxpayer. My amendment also declares that Congress has a duty to guard against waste and excessive spending, that Congress should balance the Federal budget, and that Congress should expeditiously pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. 
   It is common sense to American families that they cannot spend more than they have-- yet far too frequently, this fundamental principle has been lost on a Federal Government that is too busy spending to pay attention to the bottom line. Unless Congress is forced to balance the Federal budget, it will always have the all-too-tempting option of shirking this responsibility. 
   On the first day of this Congress, I introduced H.J. Res. 1, a constitutional amendment requiring Congress to balance the budget, which has garnered 159 bipartisan cosponsors. I hereby renew my call on Congress to pass this crucial legislation, which also makes it harder to raise taxes. 
   However, in the meantime, my simple amendment to the budget resolution would have been the least we could do to show the American people that Congress is committed to the same fiscal principles that America's families face each day. It is very telling that the majority thought it best to sweep this debate under the rug. 
   Regarding the merits of the underlying Democrat resolution, it assumes the expiration of all the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and adds those revenues, some $392 billion, into the budget over time. At the same time, they have chosen to increase discretionary spending. In fact, under the Democrat budget, appropriated spending is projected to increase faster than the rate of projected inflation. By increasing taxes on the American people in order to fund their own priorities, the Democrats assume that they know how to better spend the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. 
   For America's farmers and ranchers already facing increased input costs, increased taxes would further add insult to injury. For many farmers and ranchers, this budget appears to hold the key to bolstering the budget for American agriculture. This bill purports to provide the Agriculture Committee with an extra $20 billion, seemingly tucked away in a ``reserve fund'' to be released at the discretion of the Budget Committee chairman. Although they've made it sound like there's an extra $20 billion just lying around waiting to be spent; this could not be further from the truth. 
   The $20 billon is only available if it can be offset by cuts in other spending or increased taxes. The Agriculture Committee, as well as every other Congressional committee, already has the authority to spend dollars created by offsets under existing rules. 
   This is either a poorly constructed hoax designed to create an illusion of increased funding, or it is part of a broader plan to continue to raise taxes to pay for increased program spending. In either case, there is nothing about the Democrat budget that does anything to relieve the budget crunch that farmers face in this farm bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to see this budget for what it is and vote ``no.''

   With approximately one in every four jobs in my congressional district being tied to trade, the expansion of trade means a healthy future for a number of local businesses, and in turn, new jobs for my district and the Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, during the month of August I was pleased to join over 130 of my Republican colleagues in Washington to represent the American people on the floor of this House. It is undeniable that the American people want us to develop our Nation's resources. This is demonstrated in poll after poll and exemplified with the meetings I have with my constituents. I always hear: Congressman, we must do something about energy costs! 
   When I heard that the Speaker had announced she would be bringing a bill to the floor to allow us to expand energy production, I felt that we had achieved success for the American people. Yes, the Speaker did hear the calls of the American people demanding increased energy production, but she isn't bringing a bill to the floor to expand energy production. Instead, she is bringing to the floor a sham piece of legislation that seeks to only give political cover to vulnerable Democrats who disagree with the will of the American people. 
   Some have cited how this bill opens up areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS. It may technically remove some of the barriers, but it does not include provisions to provide the traditional revenue sharing between the Federal Government and States for the income generated from these developments. What incentive do coastal States have to then develop their resources? I represent a coastal State, a State that has expressed strong interest in developing the resources on our OCS. I think the Commonwealth of Virginia should benefit from revenue sharing, just as Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama have. It is unfair for Virginia to be treated differently than these other States when sharing our resources. 
   Sadly, this isn't the only provision that will unfairly harm Virginia. This legislation also contains a one-size-fits-all Renewable Electric Standard. This legislation assumes that all States have the exact same amount of renewable resources and can develop them, and punishes them when they cannot with penalties. The costs of energy due to the Renewable Electric Standard, as estimated by just one of Virginia's many electric utilities, will increase $900 million for its retail customers. My constituents are already paying high prices for energy; we don't need to further increase these costs! The fact is Virginia does not have as many wind and solar resources as other states. In Virginia, we have a voluntary RPS but our RPS contains nuclear and waste-to-energy, two things not allowed if this legislation becomes law. 
   Proponents of this legislation will tout how green this bill is; however, if my colleagues really want to promote green energy they should encourage the production of more nuclear sites which provide CO  
   2 emission-free energy. The rest of the world is far outpacing the U.S. in its commitment to clean nuclear energy. We generate only 20 percent of our energy from this clean energy, when other countries can generate about 80 percent of their electricity needs through nuclear. It is a travesty that this legislation does not once mention or encourage the construction of clean and reliable nuclear plants. Nuclear energy is the most reliable and advanced of any renewable energy technology, and if we are serious about encouraging CO 
   2-free energy use, we must support nuclear energy. 
   Furthermore, this legislation does not even address some of our most promising domestic alternative and renewable energy supplies. There is not one thing in this bill that addresses clean coal technologies. Coal is one of our Nation's most abundant resources, yet the development of coal-to-liquid technologies is completely ignored by this bill.  
   What's even more troubling is the energy resources this bill continues to keep out of the hands of American consumers. The Democrats' legislation prohibits environmentally responsible exploration of American oil shale resources unless states ``opt-in'' to such a system and the bill does not allow local communities to share in the revenues generated from oil shale exploration. The Department of Energy estimates that 2 trillion barrels of oil shale exists within the United States, resources that the Majority does not seem to want to develop. 
   Furthermore, this legislation does not permit responsible exploration of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, known as ANWR, in Alaska. According to estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey, ANWR holds between 5.7 and 16 billion barrels of recoverable reserves, potentially producing nearly a million barrels of oil a day. Exploration and development in ANWR would open only 2,000 of the 19 million acres of the refuge, or the equivalent of an area one-fifth the size of Dulles Airport in an area the size of South Carolina. 
   This legislation does nothing to address the energy concerns of our country. This legislation only makes the situation worse and it is the product of a flawed process that does not have bipartisan support! If we really want to make our country energy independent, this Congress must pass an energy bill that allows and encourages the development of our Nation's resources. Americans are tired of Congress playing politics when they are in desperate need of relief from high energy costs. It is time for Congress to get serious and allow Americans increased access to their energy resources.

   I have introduced legislation, many others have, to allow the States to participate in drilling off their coasts. Their bill prohibits that. 
   We will see no drilling, we will see no oil production, no access to oil production in more than 90 percent of the areas where oil exists, and we should go after it. Nothing in this bill for nuclear power, nothing in this bill for coal-to-liquid technology, nothing in this bill for the American people, nothing in this bill for my constituents, nothing but a hoax on the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the leader for yielding and for all of the effort that he and virtually every Member of this House put into this legislation now. If some of us are experiencing a sense of deja vu, it is because we are considering the exact same bill that we passed with overwhelming bipartisan support last Wednesday. The Senate also passed the bill by a significant margin. 
   However, yesterday it was determined that somewhere between the House and Senate passage of the farm bill, while the bill was being enrolled, title III, the trade title, was accidentally omitted from the enrolled bill that was then sent to the President. To avoid future uncertainty or constitutional questions about the bill omitting the trade title, we are presenting the same farm bill that we passed last week to both chambers and running it back through the necessary procedures to ensure the whole bill becomes law. 
   While the substance and content of the bill is the exact same as we passed last week, three technical items have been added to reflect the technical corrections necessary. The technical changes to correct the clerical error include, one, a slight change to the long title in order to distinguish the bill from H.R. 2419; a provision that deems the conference report on H.R. 2419 to be the legislative history of this new bill; and a provision that prevents duplication of the identical sections on H.R. 2419 upon adoption. This would prevent double spending if the Senate overrides the veto and 14 titles are in law when this new bill is enacted. 
   Other than those technical corrections, we are simply redoing the farm bill to correct the error. 
   Let me say that while it was an unfortunate error, it also was an egregious error. This is a very serious problem that has been created, and we are seeing that reflected in the fact that we are taking several different approaches to try to make sure that the farm bill which had that strong bipartisan support is indeed enacted into law. So it is with some disappointment that I see the majority table the privileged resolution offered by the Republican leader and not look into this in greater detail. I think it certainly deserves that attention, and it would be my hope that the majority would reconsider that approach and bring that privileged resolution to a vote so we can get to the bottom of all the considerations that need to be made regarding this and how this can be avoided in the future, but also to find out exactly what indeed did happen in the past few days that led to the unfortunate situation we find ourselves in today of again finding it necessary to pass this legislation, which I urge my colleagues to again adopt, as they already have voted for it once and have subsequently voted to override the President's veto, so we can indeed do what America's farmers and ranchers seek, and that is to have a new farm bill that is forward looking and that does address the concerns that have been brought to the attention of the committees.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1433, the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act. 
   There is no doubt that citizens of the District of Columbia do not have a full voting representation in the House of Representatives. However, there are ways that these individuals can receive representation without trampling on the Constitution. Unfortunately, this bill is not one of them. 
   The Constitution does not mince words when it says that Members of Congress may only be elected from the States. Article I, section 2 states that the House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States. 
   The Constitution also does not mince words when it distinguishes the District of Columbia from a State. In describing the powers of the Congress, Article I, section 8 describes the seat of Federal Government as a district, not exceeding 10 miles square, as made by cessation of particular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of government of the United States. 
   Furthermore, the text of the 23rd amendment to the Constitution further illustrates that the District was never meant to have the same rights as States. Specifically, it grants D.C. the power to appoint a number of electors, a President and Vice President, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the district would be entitled if it were a State. 
   The plain language of the Constitution is clear, that D.C. is not a State and that it is not granted the same rights as States. However, the constitutional problems with this bill do not end here. The bill would also establish an at-large representative for Utah, which would allow the citizens of Utah to vote twice, once for their local representative and another time for an at-large representative. This would clearly violate the constitutional principle of one man-one vote by granting Utah citizens disproportionately large voting power. 
   Finally, the procedure for bringing this bill to the floor is appalling. Debate has been eliminated on a bill that affects the relative voting power of citizens in each of our congressional districts. Ranking Member Smith offered an amendment which would have provided for an expedited judicial review. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation which is clearly unconstitutional.

   For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this ill-crafted legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this irresponsible spending bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, we owe it to our brave service men and women who are fighting for freedom and democracy in Iraq to make sure that they are the best equipped and most successful troops in the world. While the Democrats would have you believe that this legislation does just that, it couldn't be further from the truth. 
   This supplemental is a prescription for defeat in Iraq by tying the hands of our military leaders and setting a date certain for withdrawing our troops. If we fail in Iraq, the resources now devoted by terrorist organizations and nations sponsoring terrorism there would be turned to spreading terror around the globe, including, again, on American soil. 
   It is through the hard work and sacrifice of our American troops that the ideals of freedom continue to be spread. We owe them the resources they need to complete their mission, but this bill does not meet that threshold. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am also alarmed that the Democrats are treating a wartime, let me repeat, wartime funding bill as a collection cup for pet projects. 
   Many Members have already mentioned the litany of pet projects in the bill, so I do not need to repeat these so-called domestic emergency spending provisions. I would like to mention, though, how ridiculous this bill must seem to troops and their families listening or watching us on C-SPAN. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how I will respond when asked by constituents why funding for some $15 billion in pet projects is necessary when attempting to fund the global war on terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt that some of these extraneous provisions may be worth examining, but how would we know? We did not hold oversight hearings on these issues and have, therefore, abdicated our responsibility to the taxpayer. If there is a problem, I am sure we can make the necessary fixes in regular order. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote down this legislation and fund our troops with a clean supplemental bill.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2745, the short-term farm bill extension that will extend some provisions of the 2002 farm bill until April 18. The other body passed the same provision this morning, and this body must pass this bill so both bodies can continue to work on conference negotiations.     
   Mr. Speaker, I would like nothing more than to stand before you today and report that we are on the brink of an agreement on the farm bill. However, progress on a new farm bill agreement has been painfully slow, and this process has become a source of frustration for me and my colleagues, and the chairman I know as well, as well as millions of rural Americans awaiting a new farm bill. 
   If we do not seek prompt and substantive action on the farm bill, I believe we must pursue a different course of action, because our farmers and ranchers have already waited too long. Interminable delays in implementing a new farm bill may not have real ramifications in Washington, but in rural America the effects are real, and they are substantial. 
   I appreciate the efforts of our committee chairman to try to keep this process moving. I know at times he has shared my frustrations. We all recognize the need for a new farm bill, and we continue to work toward completing a farm bill and getting it to the President for him to sign into law by April 18. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this farm bill extension to give us a little more time to try to overcome the budget obstacles that have been standing in the way of the farm bill finish line since last year. 
   We started this process together in a bipartisan fashion more than 2 years ago. We worked together in the committee to move a farm bill forward, but we have been hindered time and time again outside the committee by the fact that others in the Congress have failed to recognize the fact that this farm bill starts out $58 billion below the last farm bill in terms of what it will cost to continue the farm legislation forward. That is a great thing. That is a tremendous savings for the American taxpayer. But when we are trying to write a modern, forward-looking farm bill that encompasses changes in conservation, in nutrition, in energy, in specialty crops, and we are trying to reform the commodity title of the farm bill, we needed to have some additional resources. 
   The chairman and I went to the Budget Committee last year in a bipartisan fashion and asked for some money above the baseline, not $58 billion coming back to us, but $5 billion, $10 billion above that baseline, which still would have been a huge savings for the taxpayers and allowed us to write a farm bill inside the committee and bring it to the floor of the House without being dependent on another committee or another source. The same problem existed in the Senate. 
   The outcome has been that we have been spinning our wheels having to deal with other outside influences rather than getting the job done in the committee because of this funding not being available. We are going to have to look at some new alternatives if we don't get a breakthrough here in the next couple of days, because even this extension will expire very, very soon, and the time it takes to write a farm bill that encompasses a whole host of issues, from what goes on on the farm to all of our nutrition programs, to our environmental and conservation programs, to research programs for agriculture, to a whole host of other areas that are very, very important, not just to America's farmers and ranchers, not just to people living in rural America, but to every American consumer who depends upon our farm community to continue to provide the safest, most abundant, most affordable food supply in the world, and we will be working together. 
   I appreciate the chairman's working with me and with other Members on this side of the aisle to accomplish that goal. He has been tenacious in that effort. But we need to either move on, or we need to get the help that was promised a year ago to finally come to the committee so we can get the job done. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this bloated budget resolution. 
   Facing a slowing economy and an increased cost of living, Americans have to tighten their belts and carefully budget their hard-earned money. It's time the Federal Government did the same. 
   Instead, the budget proposed by the majority exceeds the President's spending levels by $276 billion over 5 years. This budget increases discretionary spending and fails to touch entitlement reform. 
   To pay for the massive spending increases, the bill passes the cost on to lower and middle class American taxpayers. This budget resolution calls for the largest tax increase in American history, $683 billion over the next 5 years, which means 116 million taxpayers will face an average tax hike of more than $1,800. Worst of all, it raises the debt by $646 billion.  
   Mr. Chairman, Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. This budget makes no attempt to rein in wasteful government spending or balance our Federal budget. I believe it should be the highest priority in this House to balance the budget, which is why, on the first day of this Congress, I introduced House Joint Resolution 1, a constitutional amendment to require that the Federal budget be balanced, with 160 bipartisan cosponsors. 
   When families across the country are preparing their budget, they know that they can't spend more than they take in. It's a simple concept but one that Congress has not adhered to for far too long. We must balance the budget and cut the national debt, not by raising taxes but by being good stewards of taxpayer money. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this fiscally irresponsible budget and rein in wasteful spending.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to this legislation, which will do nothing to make us energy independent. This bill sets us on a dangerous path and ensures that we cannot produce sufficient domestic energy. 
   I believe we should find solutions to address our energy needs. Unfortunately, this legislation will result in less domestic energy production. This bill increases America's dependence on foreign oil, a dangerous policy for our national and economic security. This is a tax and spend and mandate policy by the Democrats, imposing $15 billion in tax increases and myriad new government mandates. 
   They will say these taxes and mandates won't affect average Americans, only oil companies in other businesses. Nothing could be further from the truth. These taxes will impede domestic oil and gas production, discourage investment in refinery capacity, and make it more expensive for domestic energy companies to operate in America than their foreign competitors, making the price at the pump rise even higher. An increased tax doesn't just hurt energy companies, it hurts every American energy consumer. 
   This legislation does not even address some of our most promising domestic alternative and renewable energy supplies. There is nothing in this bill that addresses clean coal-to-liquid technologies or nuclear energy. Coal is one of our Nation's most abundant resources, yet the development of clean coal technologies is completely ignored. 
   Furthermore, this legislation doesn't encourage the construction of nuclear energy generation facilities. As the Congress works to promote green energy, we should encourage the production of more nuclear sites which provide energy without CO  
   2 emissions. 
   In one of the few programs that could lead to increased energy production, I am baffled that it contains Davis-Bacon labor provisions. Renewable energy plans financed through loan guarantees would be located in rural America, but artificially inflated construction costs caused by Davis-Bacon will negate the program in most rural areas. 
   This legislation does not address the energy concerns of our country. It makes the situation worse. If we want to make America energy independent, this Congress must pass a bill that contains energy. This bill does not. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and work to find real solutions to the energy needs facing our country.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this reckless energy policy, which will do absolutely nothing to make us energy independent, or lower energy costs. This bill sets us on a dangerous path and ties our hands in a regulatory mess to ensure that we cannot produce domestic energy. 
   Like my colleagues, I believe we should find solutions to address the growing demand for energy. Unfortunately, this legislation contains no energy in it. In the Republican-led Congress, I supported an Energy Bill that actually encouraged energy--domestic energy production--and lessened our dependence on foreign oil. Today's legislation, however, seeks to dismantle any progress we have made in achieving energy independence, and leaves us at the mercy of foreign energy sources. 
   Many Members have discussed passionately how America needs to decrease its dependence on foreign energy. In fact, many campaigned on promises to decrease our dependence. Sadly, this legislation falls drastically short on those promises. In fact it actually increases America's dependence on foreign oil. This is a dangerous policy for our national and economic security. 
   Many Americans don't know that the U.S. is the world's largest energy producer. Over the past 25 years we have pumped 67 billion barrels of oil, and strong reserves remain. The fact is the energy sources are there--in Alaska, the Rockies, and offshore--but political roadblocks keep it in the ground instead of in use in the economy. Sadly, this legislation restricts our access to our own energy sources even further. 
   This energy policy set in place by the Democrat majority lives the Democrat motto through and through--Tax and Spend. This policy imposes $15 billion in tax increases. The other side will tell you that these tax increases will not affect the average hardworking Americans, only the big evil oil companies. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The taxes contained in this bill will impede new domestic oil and gas production, will discourage investment in new refinery capacity, and will make it more expensive for domestic energy companies to operate in the U.S. than their foreign competitors, making the price at the pump rise even higher. 
   Let's make no mistake, an increased tax doesn't just hurt energy companies, it hurts every American--individual, farm, or company--that consumes energy. Increased taxes on energy companies are passed to consumers. Every American will see these increased costs on their energy bill. This body shouldn't pass legislation that further raises energy prices for consumers. 
   While this legislation increases taxes on traditional oil and gas, it does not even address some of our most promising domestic alternative and renewable energy supplies. There is not one thing in this bill that addressees clean Coal-to-Liquid technologies or nuclear energy. Coal is one of our Nation's most abundant resources, yet the development of Coal-to-Liquid technologies is completely ignored by this bill. Furthermore, this legislation does nothing to encourage the construction of new nuclear facilities. 
   Proponents of this legislation will tout how green this bill is; however, if my colleagues really want to promote green energy they should encourage the production of more nuclear sites which provide energy free of CO  
   2 emissions. The rest of the world is far outpacing the U.S. in its commitment to clean nuclear energy. We generate only 20 percent of our energy from this clean energy, when other countries can generate about 80 percent of their electricity needs through nuclear. It is a travesty that in over 700 pages this legislation does not once mention or encourage the construction of clean and reliable nuclear plants. Nuclear energy is the most reliable and advanced of any renewable energy technology, and if we are serious about encouraging CO 
   2 free energy use, we must support nuclear energy.
   One of the provisions I am most alarmed about in this bill allows for individuals to sue the Federal Government for $1.5 million for damages caused by global warming. I don't know what this has to do with energy production, but I think this is a dangerous precedent to set. This language gambles with the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people that could get lost in frivolous litigation. 
   I'm also concerned with the potential sweeping implications of the bill's National Policy on Wildlife and Global Warming. It is nearly impossible to accurately determine the effects that warming temperatures might have on wildlife, let alone take measures to mitigate these effects. The consequences of this section could be as far reaching as the Endangered Species Act or the National Environmental Policy Act and could have severe implications for Federal land management. This does not belong in a so-called energy bill. 
   I will concede that there are a few, very few, decent provisions in this bill. I am pleased that the Agriculture Energy programs build on the 2002 Farm Bill with more focus on cellulosic materials, including forest biomass and switchgrass. This will help farmers and forest owners by creating new markets and income opportunities to keep them on the land. At the same time, greater focus on cellulosic feedstocks can reduce our reliance on corn for renewable fuels. 
   With Americans paying close to $3 at the pump, we must diversify our energy supplies with alternative fuels, including renewable energy from our farms and forests. Renewable energy is a home-grown solution for reducing our reliance on foreign-oil, boosting jobs and economies in rural America, and improving our environment. 
   However, I am baffled that one of the few programs in this bill that would lead to increased energy production would contain Davis-Bacon provisions. Renewable energy plants financed through the loan guarantee program would be located in Rural America. 
   Rural America simply cannot afford to pay the artificially inflated wages caused by Davis-Bacon as urban America can. By including this unfair labor provision we are putting union interests ahead of efforts to become more energy independent. 
   Mr. Chairman, in addition to the lack of real incentives for energy production in the U.S., this bill is also bad for our Nation's public forests. The bill guts a program that provides incentives for renewable energy production from small-diameter materials removed from public forests to reduce wildfire and insect risk and improve the health of the forests. With over 5 million acres destroyed by fires and hundreds of millions of dollars spent fighting them so far this year, we cannot afford to take away forest management tools from the Nation's public land managers. 
   Unfortunately, the bill replaces this program with a Biomass Pilot Program, which would do everything but encourage use of low value forest material for energy. On top of this, the bill attaches the problematic Davis-Bacon provisions to this pilot program. 
   This legislation does nothing to address the energy concerns of our country; it only makes the situation worse. This bill is a dangerous policy for our country. If we really want to  make our country energy independent, this Congress must pass an energy bill that contains energy. This bill does not. I urge my colleagues to reject this awful bill; let's start over, and work to find real solutions to the energy needs facing our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the majority's plan to combine two unrelated appropriations bills, the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services and Department of Education and the funding for Veterans and Military Construction. 
   I oppose this combined approach because, in doing so, the Democrat majority is using political maneuvering to avoid tough spending choices in the controversial Labor-HHS and Education bill. 
   I hope we all agree that we need to keep our commitment to veterans by supporting veterans benefits and military construction provisions. But the majority should not use the popularity of veterans funding to build a legislative Christmas tree by including labor and health spending at $10 billion above the President's request. 
   No one is fooled by this craven manipulation of benefits for our Nation's veterans. Let's debate these bills individually, rather than holding funding for veterans military care and military facilities hostage with a controversial bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO STOP GENOCIDE AND VIOLENCE IN DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentlewoman, and I thank her for her leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year I had the opportunity to travel with Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Majority Leader Hoyer and other members of a bipartisan congressional delegation to the war-torn nation of Sudan and see firsthand one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent times. 
   As a Nation dedicated to freedom and the rights of the individual, the United States has a responsibility to speak out when those rights are violated. While in Darfur, we saw directly the atrocities in this besieged nation. We toured the Alsalam Internally Displaced Persons Camp, where 47,000 people seeking food, water and safety live in crowded, deplorable and often still unsafe conditions.     
   This is one of nearly 100 such camps which collectively have more than 2 million people. They live in small, makeshift twig huts, many only the size of a pup tent. On numerous occasions, the IDP camps themselves have been attacked. And this is just one of  many examples of the deplorable situation in Darfur. 
   There is no doubt that the ongoing crisis in Darfur has led to a major humanitarian disaster. We along with the rest of the world must band together to bring change to this horrible situation. Next year the world will join together to celebrate the Olympic Games. The Olympic spirit brings together nations and people from all over the world in a spirit of peace. The People's Republic of China as the Olympic host country has a profound responsibility to ensure that spirit of peace will be celebrated throughout the games. However, I am deeply worried that this spirit will be deeply compromised due to China's implicit acquiescence to the atrocities being committed in Darfur. 
   The People's Republic of China has a deep relationship with Sudan and has substantial economic investment there. China's connection to Sudan, a country that supports the genocide of its own people, is troubling and seriously undermines the spirit of the Olympic Games. 
   There is no question that China is in a position to help improve the situation in Darfur. As an economic partner to Sudan, China must use all means possible to help bring an end to this genocide. As they seek to host the world, they must show the true extent of their leadership and call for an end to this genocide. 
   House Resolution 422 rightfully calls on the People's Republic of China to end military and economic assistance to Sudan until Sudan ceases attacking civilians and promotes the humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts going on in Darfur in its own country. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and call on China to fully support the Olympic spirit by calling on Sudan to end the genocide in Darfur. 
   While I have never seen anything like what I saw in Darfur, the situation is not completely hopeless. The humanitarian assistance the United States is providing is helping millions of people in desperate circumstances. But we must continue to do more and we must urge the international community to join with us to bring an end to the genocide. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in a bipartisan spirit to bring an end to this international crisis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman. I thank the majority leader and the Speaker and the other Members of our delegation for their comments. 
   The tranquil campus of Virginia Tech and the town of Blacksburg has been shattered by the actions of a lone gunman. The horror that the Virginia Tech community has experienced this week is something that every parent, every American hopes they never have to learn has affected their families and friends. 
   I have a great appreciation for Virginia Tech, one of America's preeminent research institutions, having advanced from one of the original land grant universities. Thousands of people in my district which neighbors Blacksburg have gone to school there, have sent their children there, and are members of Hokie Nation. During my time in this body, I have had graduates and students of Virginia Tech work and intern for me. For years I have known what a special place it is, with its affiliated campuses and offices spread throughout the Sixth District and across the great Commonwealth of Virginia. Yet it is with great sadness that the rest of the world has come to know the compassion of Virginia Tech only through this tragedy. Although this horrendous and unspeakable violence showed the worst of mankind, it also showed what those of us who have been a part of the Tech community for years have always known--the students, the instructors, the administrators, and the citizens of Blacksburg care deeply for one another and take great pride in their community. Even in the worst circumstances, the Virginia Tech community showed great compassion for their fellow man and did what they could to help each other. Liviu  Librescu, a survivor of the Holocaust, blocked the doorway of his classroom so that his students could climb out the windows to safety. Ryan Clark, a resident adviser in the West Ambler Johnston Hall, rushed into the hallway to help his fellow students when the first attack came and became the second victim. And I was deeply saddened to learn that one of my constituents, Henry Lee, a graduate of William Fleming High School in Roanoke, was among those who died in the attack on Norris Hall. Two other of my constituents from Harrisonburg, Virginia, Heidi Miller, an undergraduate, and Guillermo Colman, a graduate student, were wounded and thankfully are okay. Now, following this brutal action, throughout the campus and community, students are relying on each other to cope with what has happened, but they will not let the sorrow and pain that has overtaken them this week be the lasting legacy to those whose lives were lost. Under the leadership of President Charles Steger, the Virginia Tech community will become stronger as a result of this. Their compassion will reach far beyond the town of Blacksburg, deep into what is affectionately known as Hokie Nation. Their vocal pride in their community will not be silenced by the actions of one misguided soul.     
   I was very moved as I witnessed the process begun yesterday at the convocation at Cassell Coliseum. Speaker after speaker, including the President, the Governor, and so many great leaders at Tech spoke of not only the grief, but of overcoming the grief and moving forward to a brighter and better future. 
   For the families who have lost sons and daughters, fathers and brothers, mothers and sisters, I grieve for you and your loved ones. You will forever remain in the prayers of this Nation, and I hope that in time you can come to find peace. 
   For the Virginia Tech community, although we grieve today, and what has happened will never leave our minds, I know that you will take this tragedy and use it to build a stronger campus and a more compassionate community for all.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on the committee and his strong opposition to this legislation. 
   I rise in strong opposition to the legislation as well. This bill would increase penalties for those who commit crimes against certain groups of citizens, but not others. For example, if a man walks down the street and punches another man because the victim is a transvestite, the aggressor would be punishable by up to 10 additional years in prison. However, if the same man walks down the street and punches another person because the victim is a pregnant woman, a senior citizen, a child under the age of 10, a veteran or the like, then the aggressor would not be punishable by the potential 10-year prison sentence. This is simply unfair. 
   While I strongly support efforts to rid our schools, neighborhoods and communities of violent crimes, I do not believe that new Federal laws specifically addressing hate crimes are necessary. 
   Today, there are few, if any, cases in which law enforcement has not prosecuted violent crimes to the fullest extent of the law, regardless of the background of the person. 
   In addition, this bill sets a dangerous and unconstitutional precedent of punishing citizens for their thoughts. When prosecutions occur under this bill, prosecutors will undoubtedly submit evidence of prior statements by individuals to prove that the aggressor was motivated by hate. This will have a chilling effect on citizens' willingness to speak freely as citizens will adapt to a new world where the Federal Government can cause any unpopular statements they make to be used against them in the future. 
   One of the great freedoms we have as Americans is our first amendment right to speak our minds, whether our thoughts are popular or unpopular, and this legislation undermines that right.     
   Again, I abhor acts of violence against any citizen. I abhor bigotry and believe that such crimes should be punished to the fullest extent of the law when aggressive violence occurs. However, this legislation gives special preferences to certain classes of citizens and would create a chilling effect on one of our most cherished constitutional rights. 
   For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. However, if my colleagues need to be reminded further, I would like to share with them the statement of the administration regarding this legislation, H.R. 1592: 
   ``The administration favors strong criminal penalties for violent crime, including crime based on personal characteristics such as race, color, religion, or national origin. However, the administration believes that H.R. 1592 is unnecessary and constitutionally questionable. If H.R. 1592 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. 
   ``State and local criminal laws already provide criminal penalties for the violence addressed by the new Federal crime defined in section 7 of H.R. 1592, and many of these laws carry stricter penalties (including mandatory minimums and the death penalty) than the proposed language in H.R. 1592. State and local law enforcement agencies and courts have the capability to enforce those penalties and are doing so effectively. 
   ``There has been no persuasive demonstration of any need to federalize such a potentially large range of violent crime enforcement, and doing so is inconsistent with the proper allocation of criminal enforcement responsibilities between the different levels of government. In addition, almost every State in the country can actively prosecute hate crimes under the State's own hate crimes law.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I include the balance of the statement of administration policy for the Record.  
   H.R. 1592 prohibits willfully causing or attempting to cause bodily injury to any person based upon the victim's race, color, religion, or national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. The Administration notes that the bill would leave other classes (such as the elderly, members of the military, police officers, and victims of prior crimes) without similar special status. The Administration believes that all violent crimes are unacceptable, regardless of the victims, and should be punished firmly. Moreover, the bill's proposed section 249(a)(1) of title 18 of the U.S. Code raises constitutional concerns. Federalization of criminal law concerning the violence prohibited by the bill would be constitutional only if done in the implementation of a power granted to the Federal government, such as the power to protect Federal personnel, to regulate interstate commerce, or to enforce equal protection of the laws. Section 249(a)(1) is not by its terms limited to the exercise of such a power, and it is not at all clear that sufficient factual or legal grounds exist to uphold this provision of H.R. 1592.  
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the administration and oppose this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4120, the Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act of 2007. 
   This bill responds to a recent decision by the 10th Circuit United States Court of Appeals in United States v. Schaefer, in which the court ruled that the transmission of child pornography on the Internet did not satisfy the interstate requirement in child pornography laws. 
   The proposed legislative fix will allow the government to satisfy the interstate requirement by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the material moved in or affected interstate foreign commerce, which would expand the jurisdiction to prosecute these crimes when the Internet is used. This is the broadest assertion of interstate commerce power that the Congress can make consistent with the Constitution. 
   Unfortunately, this bill, and the majority's package of bills, does not include a needed modification to existing law which would require a 2-year mandatory minimum for possession of child pornography. At an October 17, 2007, full committee hearing on the subject, the Justice Department witness outlined why such a measure was needed. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Laurence Rothenberg explained that child pornography fueled the victimization of children and led to sexual assaults against children. He also noted that Federal judges were routinely giving out lenient sentences to child pornographers below levels established by the Federal sentencing guidelines. 
   While the fix proposed today in H.R. 4120 is a good step forward, it is a limited step in comparison to other measures that are needed, including a mandatory minimum for child pornography crimes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

What is a small thing are the sentences that many judges unfortunately are imposing upon child pornographers much, much less than 2 years, and a mandatory minimum sentence would go a long way towards curing this problem and keeping more of these pornographers off of the Internet.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of H.R. 3013, the Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2007. H.R. 3013 bars Federal prosecutors from requiring corporations and individuals to waive their attorney-client privilege as a condition of cooperation or for avoiding criminal charges. H.R. 3013 would not prohibit a corporation from voluntarily waiving the attorney-client privilege. 
   This bill is designed to remedy overreaching by Federal prosecutors. It protects the attorney-client privilege, which is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence and the legal profession. The attorney-client privilege encourages frank and open communication between clients and their attorneys so that clients can receive effective advice and counsel. 
   In the corporate context, as we saw in the case of Arthur Andersen, the life of a corporation can turn on a prosecutor's discretionary decision to charge a corporation. That decision can have profound consequences on our economy, the employees and the community; and it should not turn on whether or not a company waives its attorney-client privilege. 
   Cooperation in the criminal justice system is an important engine of truth. However, prosecutors should not require privileged waivers as a routine matter. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the majority has decided to promote politics rather than fully protecting our Nation's children. In its last-minute rush to bring bills to the floor, the majority has selected five bills addressing the problem of sex offenders on the Internet and Internet safety for children. These bills were never considered by the Judiciary Committee, never subject to legislative hearings, and never brought through the markup process. 
   In addition, the majority failed to address concerns that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Justice Department expressed. To ignore the concerns of these major stakeholders is no way to legislate when it comes to the safety of our children. 
   Why did the majority avoid the Judiciary Committee process? For one reason, they knew the amendments we would offer at the committee would gain bipartisan support. Again, avoiding amendments that both parties would support is no way to protect our children. 
   Even on the substance, the majority's bills ignore the needs of law enforcement. At a full committee oversight hearing on October 17, 2007, the majority heard from law enforcement and the Justice Department about specific tools needed to protect children. The testimony at the hearing underscored the need to give law enforcement flexible tools necessary to protect children and apprehend sex offenders. 
   Instead of working to produce a strong bill that responds to law enforcement's requests, the majority has bypassed the normal committee process and brought an incomplete bill to the floor. 
   Last Congress we passed landmark child protection legislation, the Adam Walsh Act of 2006, which combined new tools, new authorities, additional programs, and important requirements on the registration and notification requirements for sex offenders. This legislation was developed through bipartisan cooperation, subject to full Judiciary Committee markup, extensive testimony on legislative proposals, and consultation with the NCMEC, and the Justice Department. In stark contrast, the majority has failed to meet these basic requirements in developing new child protection legislation. 
   H.R. 3845 is replete with problems. For example, the bill creates a super-bureaucratic special counsel in the Justice Department and charges that counsel with coordinating all child protection efforts across the Federal Government. 
   The special prosecutor duplicates existing offices within the Department of Justice with the expertise to prosecute child crimes cases and administer the ICAC grant program. 
   The innumerable responsibilities of this new special prosecutor require expertise across so many issues, prosecution, policy, and grant administration,  just to name a few, that no one person can fulfill this role. The bill in fact acknowledges this by directing the creation of an entirely new office within the office of the Deputy Attorney General, creating yet another layer of bureaucracy in Washington. This eats up precious resources, rather than sending them to our neighborhoods and communities. 
   Moreover, the bill places approval for all ICAC grants with the new special prosecutor, a role traditionally held by the Office of Justice Programs. Why? We don't know. We have been presented no evidence to suggest that the Department's performance in administering grants to existing ICAC task forces is somehow flawed. 
   It is sad to see that our children's safety is being sacrificed for the benefits of a quick press hit. While the bill has some good provisions, much more could have been done. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond briefly to the distinguished chairman, for whom I have great respect. And when bills do go through the process of the Judiciary Committee, the chairman has been most fair to us on our side of the aisle. And the previous chairman, Mr. Sensenbrenner on our side of the aisle, was also very dedicated to fulfilling that process. In fact, that indeed is what took place with regard to the Adam Walsh legislation, which was moved through the process of the committee. I only wish the same thing had been done here. It would have enabled us to have produced a much, much better piece of legislation that would more effectively protect our children.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, recently we were all shocked to learn that over 20,000 registered sex offenders were on commercial social networking sites. In response to press attention, the social networking sites removed the sex offenders from these sites. 
   H.R. 719, as introduced, included an important provision requiring that sex offenders update their registration information to include their electronic mail addresses, instant messaging addresses, and other similar Internet identifiers used by the sex offender. 
   In addition, H.R. 719 included a mechanism to permit social networking sites to check sex offender registries to prevent sex offenders from accessing the social networking site. 
   Finally, H.R. 719 included on introduction a new criminal prohibition on misrepresentation of age by a person designed to lure children into sexual activity. 
   Unfortunately, H.R. 719 has been stripped of all of these important provisions. It's my hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will work with us to address these important provisions in the future. The gap in our laws must be filled so that children on social networking sites do not have to fear sex predators joining their circle of so-called friends. 
   I wish to commend my colleagues for including in this legislation a critical provision to prohibit the financial facilitation of child pornography. Originally proposed by our ranking member, LAMAR SMITH, at the beginning of the year, this criminal penalty is vitally important for prosecuting an emerging tool used by child pornographers to prey on children anonymously: virtual money systems. Unlike credit card companies, which require merchants and customers to provide personal information such as name, address, and Social Security number, virtual money is essentially anonymous. Subscribers provide fictitious personal information, or no personal information, and no credit card or Social Security number is required, making them virtually untraceable. 
   The key to combating the commercial child pornography industry is to cut it off at its source: money. Virtual money is now the payment method of choice. It is imperative that our law enforcement tools keep pace with changing technologies. 
   H.R. 719 also includes a technical correction to the Adam Walsh Act to expand the eligibility for participation in a child safety grant program. And I want to particularly thank Congressman Forbes, the ranking member of the Crime Subcommittee, for introducing legislation that would have accomplished this technical correction. 
   I commend my colleague from North Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy) for his dedication to protecting children and for working with us on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4136, the Enhancing the Effective Prosecution of Child Pornography Act of 2007. This bill adds child pornography offenses as money laundering predicates and clarifies existing law to prohibit knowingly accessing child pornography with the intent to view it. Child pornography is a multibillion-dollar worldwide industry. It is despicable in its scope, and it is vicious in its victimization of children. Money is what fuels this horrific crime. 
   The majority's proposal in H.R. 4136 takes a limited step to prohibit money laundering offenses as part of a child pornography scheme. But much more is needed. Legislation proposed by our ranking member, LAMAR SMITH, and Mr. Chabot, a member of the Judiciary Committee, contains a host of proposals to increase penalties for child predators and pornographers and provides law enforcement tools for combating these heinous crimes in a virtual universe. Unfortunately, the majority chose to ignore the improvements proposed by many Republican members. 
   However, H.R. 4136 does enact Representative MARILYN MUSGRAVE'S proposals in H.R. 3148, which was introduced on July 24, 2007, the Child Pornography Elimination Act. I commend Mrs. Musgrave for her legislative efforts. This closes a loophole in the law that child pornographers use to avoid possession of child pornography by not downloading the material. This provision will prohibit accessing such material with the intent to view it and will not require an offender to actually download the material. 
   This provision is a good one, and we support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Puget Sound region is home to diverse natural resource dependent industries, including everything from fishing, tourism and recreation to agriculture and forest products. As an estuary, the Sound also houses diverse fish and wildlife species. The Sound itself consists of over 2500 miles of shoreline and is fed by over 10,000 streams and rivers that run throughout northwest Washington.  
   As the second largest container shipping port in the U.S., the Sound is extremely important to the State and Nation as a whole. 
   The watershed that feeds the Sound includes several large population centers, but is also home to significant agriculture production, including many specialty crops including raspberries, flower bulbs and vegetable seeds. Agriculture contributes $5.6 billion to Washington State's economy, establishing its rank in agriculture production as 12th in the Nation. 
   Unfortunately, the Puget Sound region is undergoing tremendous change as more people move into the region and water quality and soil concerns increase. The bill before us today helps address these environmental concerns by encouraging agricultural producers in the region to adopt voluntary conservation practices. 
   The bill also requires a comprehensive plan to encourage cooperation among the multiple agencies and landowners in the region. Many farms in the Puget Sound are adjacent to endangered salmon-bearing streams and bear the brunt of protection for these and other endangered species. 
   These regulatory requirements place significant burden on producers struggling to stay on the land. We must continue to encourage cooperation and proactive partnerships with producers in this region, as well as the other heavily agricultural regions in the country, helping to keep producers on the land and keep the Nation's agricultural economy healthy and diverse. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 3006 is a simple amendment to the act granting statehood to Idaho. The legislation will allow Idaho additional flexibility to invest and manage earnings from the land grant provided under the first Morrill Act. 
   The purpose of the Morrill Act of 1862 was to provide an amount of public land to be apportioned to each State, the proceeds of which were to be used to establish a college of agriculture. The Morrill Act is the foundation of our land grant college system and one we can continue to build upon with each farm bill. 
   The purpose of H.R. 3006 is to provide additional flexibility to Idaho in how it manages funds derived from the original land grant. Specifically, this legislation would waive statutory limitations related to facility procurement and maintenance. This, in turn, will allow Idaho to construct a research facility addressing environmental concerns facing the dairy industry. 
   As stated previously, this is simple legislation for which I know of no opposition. 
   I am told that any concerns the U.S. Department of Agriculture may have have been subsequently addressed. I, therefore, urge all Members to support this legislation

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this completely closed rule for the consideration of the Eightmile Wild and Scenic River Act. 
   This bill is a controversial one because of the chilling effect it will have on the private property rights of citizens located in the same area affected by the infamous Kelo decision. In Kelo v. City of New London, the Supreme Court gave State and local governments broad authority to seize private property and give it to another private entity under the guise of economic development. 
   When citizens believe that their land can be snatched up by the government for nearly any reason, then the principle of private property rights becomes meaningless. 
   The bill before us today will severely restrict the property rights of individuals who happen to live near the Eightmile River by tightening zoning restrictions on private land and prohibiting any physical alteration to private property. 
   Furthermore, and perhaps most troubling, the bill leaves the door wide open to actual condemnation proceedings against private land. 
   The majority already tried once to ram this controversial bill through the House without an opportunity for amendments. That attempt, fortunately, failed to garner the two-thirds vote necessary to pass on the suspension calendar. Now the majority is back at it again. 
   It's bad enough that the majority is bringing this bill back to the floor with no improvements to protect private property rights. However, it is worse that the majority has made the decision to suppress debate on this controversial bill and deny Members the opportunity to correct the land-grabbing provisions with constructive amendments. 
   Private ownership of property is vital to our freedom and our prosperity and is a basic principle embedded in our Constitution. No one should have to live in fear of the government snatching up their home, farm, church or business. 
   I introduced legislation earlier this year, the STOPP Act, along with Representative Herseth Sandlin to rein in State and local governments' abuses of their eminent domain powers. 
   Unfortunately, H.R. 986 goes in the opposite direction and sets a precedent for more land-grabbing by government entities. I urge the Members of this body to oppose both this rule, which bans debate on protecting private property rights, as well as the misguided underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (DARFUR ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIVESTMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I had the opportunity to travel as part of a bipartisan Congressional Delegation to the war-torn nation of Sudan and see first-hand one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent times. As a nation dedicated to freedom and the rights of the individual, the United States has a responsibility to speak out when those rights are violated, whether at home or abroad. 
   Last week I traveled with the same bipartisan delegation to the United Nations (U.N.) to press U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for immediate U.N. action in Darfur. It is apparent that the U.N. is not moving fast enough in ending this genocide. The entire world is watching the U.N. actions in Darfur. In the past, the U.N. has not adequately handled genocide in other countries, most recently in Rwanda, but this is an opportunity for the U.N. to aid millions of people and bring about a real and lasting change. 
   Many people share frustration with me that the U.N. is not more effectively working to end the genocide in Darfur. These people, who, like me, are deeply concerned and troubled by the deplorable situation in Darfur, want to know what we can do to make a change in Darfur. 
   This legislation gives us the tools to apply economic leverage against Sudan to encourage them to end the crisis in Darfur. H.R. 180, The Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act establishes a list of companies whose business in Sudan is deemed to directly or indirectly support the genocide. Furthermore this legislation bans federal contracts with such companies. This ensures that no federal dollars--hard earned tax dollars of American families--go to support one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history. 
   Private citizens can also look at the list of companies whose business supports the genocide, and use this list to make investment decisions in their private lives. These people can then be assured that none of their money, whether through tax dollars or personal investments, is being used to support the genocide in Darfur. 
   Many States, including Virginia, have also looked at legislation to divest from these companies. H.R. 180 allows States and localities to divest from these companies without fear of lawsuits charging that States are regulating foreign policy. This will protect several States that have already taken the lead in divesting in such companies, and States like mine that are still considering this option on a State level will know they can do so without fear of legal charges. 
   This legislation is fairly balanced and does not require individuals or States to take action, but protects them if they so choose. Furthermore this legislation would sunset these sanctions when the genocide ends. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. 
   While I have never seen anything like what I saw in Darfur, the situation is not completely hopeless. The humanitarian assistance the United States is providing is helping millions of people in desperate circumstances. But we must continue to do more, and we must urge the international community to join with us to bring an end to the genocide. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to bring an end to this international crisis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of the bill to amend S. 1716, which previously passed the other body and is now before the House. 
   In May, Congress passed and the President signed U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. This law included disaster assistance for crop and livestock producers for losses sustained between January 1, 2005 and February 28, 2007. 
   Producers were able to receive payments for losses sustained in only one of these years and were required to be in a county that was declared a disaster county in that same calendar year. This law also contained provisions found in section 9012 requiring that forage producers must have participated in a crop insurance pilot program or the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance program during the crop year for which compensation is received. 
   As a result of section 9012, very few livestock producers are eligible for the disaster relief passed by Congress because crop insurance is more widely used in crop production than in livestock production. The amendment before the House will strike section 9012 to broaden the eligibility requirements to allow more livestock producers that suffered loss to participate than were allowed under the previously passed disaster package. The amendment before the House will not change direct spending because this amendment reconfirms the assumptions made when the Congressional Budget Office scored the original bill. 
   I believe section 9012 establishes an appropriate incentive for producers to manage their risk using the available tools. However, it is not reasonable to put this policy in place without warning. To tell producers in 2007 that they should have bought crop insurance in 2005 to get assistance for losses incurred in 2005 is not fair. Livestock producers should know, however, that in the future, crop insurance or participation in similar risk-management programs will likely be required to qualify for future disaster assistance. 
   I commend the gentlewoman from South Dakota and others who have  worked for this legislation. I support the bill to amend S. 1716 and urge its adoption. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I wish to express strong support for H.R. 3454, which I've cosponsored with my colleague Mr. Boucher. H.R. 3454 would authorize the U.S. Forest Service to convey roughly 8 acres of the George Washington National Forest in Alleghany County, Virginia, to the Central Advent Christian Church. 
   These 8 acres contain a 6 acre cemetery and 2 acres between the cemetery and the adjoining interstate. The cemetery has been managed by the Church since 1941, under a special use permit, with no fees. 
   It's frustrating to me that limited federal dollars are being spent to manage this property that is clearly not in line with the mission of the Forest Service. That's why I've cosponsored this legislation. This bill will help relinquish the Forest Service of this responsibility so they can focus on the lands that our forefathers intended them to manage. 
   Several times, the Forest Service has attempted to sell this property but to no avail. The local community church lacks the resources to purchase the property. While I would of course prefer that we sell the land, I believe it is in the federal government's interest to convey the land to the Church rather than spending additional resources on it. 
   I urge adoption of this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this legislation. 
   Earlier this month, I had the invaluable opportunity to travel to the war torn country of Sudan as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation led by our distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer. We journeyed to the besieged African nation to meet with the government and humanitarian leaders to discuss issues related to the ongoing atrocities in Darfur. What I saw was horrendous, and I am pleased that we have once again joined together here in this Congress to call for an end to this genocide. 
   The ongoing crisis in Darfur and western Sudan has led to a major humanitarian disaster. At the core of the current conflict is a struggle for control of political power and resources, with an estimated 1.9 million people displaced, and more than 213,000 people forced into neighboring Chad. Observers estimate that up to 450,000 people have been killed over the course of this violence. 
   It is deplorable that any government would use the systematic dislocation of its own people and the disease and starvation that inevitably follow as a weapon, not to mention the outright violence that the Government of Sudan has helped foster in Darfur. The situation there is clearly one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent times. As a Nation dedicated to freedom and the rights of the individual, we have a responsibility to speak out when those rights are violated, whether at home or abroad. This House has already taken action condemning the situation in Sudan, but still more must be done to end this humanitarian crisis. That is why I am joining with my colleagues in supporting this resolution. 
   The resolution calls on the League of Arab States, Sudan's neighbors, to acknowledge the genocide in Darfur and step up their efforts to end this genocide. This crisis has cast an international spotlight on Darfur and the region, and we must urge the Arab League to step up their efforts and join with the world in ending genocide. 
   While I have never seen anything like what I saw in Darfur, the situation is not completely hopeless. The humanitarian assistance the United States is  providing is helping millions of people in desperate circumstances, but we must continue using international sanctions to force access for additional peacekeeping and humanitarian missions in order to stabilize this volatile place and prevent further genocide. 
   Madam Speaker, while I was in Darfur, we had the opportunity to visit the Alsalom Internally Displaced Persons Camp, where some 47,000 people live in the most humble of conditions, some in huts made of twigs barely the size of a pup tent, with perhaps a piece of cloth or plastic to provide some additional protection. This is one of a hundred such camps spread across Darfur containing nearly 2 million people. 
   While there, we had the opportunity to meet some very wonderful and very desperate people. We had the opportunity to look into the eyes of children, children who have the same hopes and expectations that all young children have, and yet, as I stood there, I realized how uncertain their future was. 
   As long as that condition exists, the United States must continue to be the leader in shining a spotlight on what is going on in Sudan and working together to bring an end to this atrocity, and to bring hope, real hope, to those children.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (25 BY 25 RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would first like to thank the gentleman from Minnesota, the chairman of the committee, for his leadership in bringing this resolution before the Congress again, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Holden, for his involvement in this as well. 
   The resolution, also known as 25x'25, recognizes the importance of agriculture in meeting our energy needs and sets a noble goal for American agriculture: to produce 25 percent of the total energy consumed in the United States from the renewable resources of our agriculture, forestry and working lands by the year 2025. 
   We have made significant progress in developing a robust industry using agricultural crops as well as animal waste to produce ethanol and biodiesel. In 2006 alone, the renewable fuels industry added more than 1.05 billion gallons of new ethanol to the marketplace. It is projected that without any new technological breakthroughs, the industry already has the potential to produce more than 11 billion gallons per year within the next decade. 
   While the domestic production of energy has been exciting, there are still many renewable energy sources yet to be explored and developed. There are a wide variety of agricultural products and by-products that can be converted to clean, renewable energy sources. In fact, there are sources of renewable energy in every one of our 50 States, including wind, solar, hydropower and biomass. The development of cellulosic technology has enormous potential to bolster the renewable fuel market inside the corn belt and well beyond. 
   I am particularly excited about the opportunity to use forest biomass as a component of our renewable energy supply. Forest biomass is plentiful and available in many States. Almost two-thirds of the Commonwealth of Virginia is forested, as is much of the southeastern United States. In fact, today we have roughly the same amount of forest land as we had 100 years ago. Trees are an abundant resource and are available for conversion into both wood products and biofuels year-round. 
   Every year we grow almost twice as much forest biomass as we harvest.  This wood and wood waste has the potential to produce enough electricity to power 43 million households, or enough ethanol to increase our domestic supply by almost 10-fold. As we find more ways to use forest biomass in our energy supply, we also have the opportunity to improve forest health, removing materials that fuel wildfires and insect and disease infestations. 
   Renewable energy development can create valuable markets for many of the waste materials which are currently a burden on America's farmers, such as animal waste, harvest by-products and damaged crops. Farmers continue to face steep environmental regulations in handling animal waste, and converting this waste into renewable fuels is a win-win for farmers and the environment. In fact, I would like to see the word ``waste'' taken out of American agriculture since almost everything produced on our farms can be used or reused for some other purpose. 
   The current tax credits and renewable fuels standard, along with the phaseout of MTBE, has helped fuel investment in new ethanol and biodiesel plants, and created more markets for agriculture products. It is obvious that current policies have successfully established a thriving, renewable fuels market. We should now focus on policy that will develop commercial cellulosic ethanol and allow new markets to drive production.     
   New proposed initiatives are extremely ambitious and can only be achieved with contributions from all areas of the agriculture sector, including grains, plants, trees and wood waste, vegetable oil, and animal fat and waste. 
   The 2002 farm bill included the first-ever energy title with programs to help renewable fuel producers purchase and expand operations and purchase feedstocks and also established programs to make grants and loans to farmers, ranchers and small businesses to purchase renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency improvements on farming operations. 
   The energy title of the House's 2007 farm bill builds on the 2002 bill by providing nearly $3 billion to promote the commercial production of cellulosic ethanol. These initiatives will help farmers and forest owners by creating new markets and income opportunities to keep them on the land and keep their land working. At the same time, greater focus on cellulosic feedstocks can reduce our reliance on corn for renewable fuels. 
   Increased development of renewable energy opens new markets for our Nation's producer; provides consumers with a safe, sustainable, environmentally friendly and renewable source of energy; and decreases our Nation's dependency on foreign oil. 
   25x'25 is a vision we can all get behind, as 600 groups already have, including agriculture and forestry groups, as well as business and environmental organizations. Over 20 of our Nation's Governors, along with 72 bipartisan cosponsors in the House, have recognized that this is a goal, though challenging, that is worth striving for. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join us in recognizing the important role American agriculture plays in domestic energy production and work with us to turn the goal of 25x'25 into a reality. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding, and I rise today to commend the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Langley Research Center on its 90th anniversary, and, in doing so, express my respect for the resolution's sponsor, Representative Jo Ann Davis.     
   Congresswoman Davis worked tirelessly to fight for the constituents of the First District of Virginia. This resolution was the last measure that she introduced in this body before she passed on just 10 days ago on October 6. I see it as only fitting that we pass it in a timely manner to honor this research center and our late colleague. 
   Since its inception as the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in 1917, the focus of research at this facility has significantly changed, yet this research center remains on the forefront of scientific advances. These advances not only benefit the larger scientific community but have also played a crucial role in our national security and daily lives. 
   The men and women of the Langley Research Center have made countless contributions to the scientific community and our aeronautic and space programs in particular. From its crucial role in advancing flight as early as the First World War to the training for operation of the lunar module of the Apollo program, which subsequently transported the first and only human life to the surface of the Moon, this facility has been responsible for numerous scientific breakthroughs for an astonishing 9 decades. 
   Aeronautics played a critical role in the First and Second World Wars, providing our military with a strategic advantage that contributed to our victories in these two major global struggles. Subsequent advances in this field and the field of aeronautics provided the United States with the ability to achieve superiority in space exploration. These efforts have been crucial to our national defense and continue to play a major role in combating terrorism. 
   The Langley Research Center is also responsible for sending the first orbiters and landers to the planet Mars through the Viking program, and is also currently engaged in development of the next generation of spacecraft essential to maintaining our leading role in space exploration. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in commending this facility's contributions to the scientific world and the security of our country, and in doing so, honor our late colleague, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis.

But, Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day when a majority of those, in fact, I think almost everybody, who come down here to speak on this issue are going to say, I also supported a permanent ban on access taxes to the Internet, and that is why it is sad that we are not able to bring this legislation forward under a rule under general order. 
   This is inappropriate to take the product of a committee when in the process, a majority of the members of that committee had cosponsored the alternative, a significant majority of the House had cosponsored the alternative of a permanent ban on taxes on the Internet, that if such a vote were brought here on the floor of the House I don't think there is any doubt on the part of anybody here that it would pass overwhelmingly. 
   In fact, that is exactly what has happened every other time this legislation has been brought to the floor of the House. We have voted for a permanent ban on access taxes on the Internet. That is the appropriate thing to do if we want to see the Internet continue to grow and to continue to reach out to more and more Americans, where instead we find ourselves falling further and further behind more and more other countries in terms of the numbers of Americans and the percentage of Americans who have high-speed broadband access to the Internet. 
   One of the reasons for that is that there needs to be greater investment in this technology to roll it out, to bring it to more people's homes, to make it  more affordable. As long as the potential for taxes on the Internet remains strong, as long as the potential for consumers to see on their Internet access bills the same kind of charges that they see today on their telephone bills and on their cable bills, where tax after tax after tax adds up to, in some instances, 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent of the cost of getting access to some of these technologies, obviously impacting lower income people. But, no, we weren't given the opportunity to do that. We weren't given the opportunity to have, on the floor of this House, what the vast majority of the Members of the House have indicated they want to have. 
   Sure, the time is running out. This bill should have been brought up months ago so that we would have adequate opportunity to work with the Senate on this legislation. In fact, every indication is that the Senate would agree to an extension greater than the 4 years provided in this legislation. But, no, instead of leaving the House with the same position we did the last time this came before the Congress in the 108th Congress when we passed a permanent extension, instead of having a strong vote showing that kind of support, we are back-pedaling. We are retrenching. We are coming forward with a much weaker position and not going in the right direction if we truly intend to see the kind of investment that needs to be made in making sure that families of all income levels have access to the Internet. 
   The Internet Tax Fairness Act of 1998 created the moratorium on Internet access taxes and discriminatory taxes on e-commerce. Seeing that the growth of the Internet was an important thing, we have maintained that moratorium on taxes, but also seeing at the same time the percentage of American families who are able to access high-speed Internet services, broadband services, declined, or not grow as fast as a host of other countries in many parts of the world, is a very discouraging thing. 
   That is why there has been a continued impetus for a permanent ban. The ban has been temporarily extended, but it will expire in just 2 weeks. This legislation that is before the House today will pass and will get that extension. But we will not be doing the things that we need to be doing to make sure that the Internet remains permanently free of access taxes and has that kind of encouragement to consumers and to investors to know that those investments will not be curtailed by a loss of interest in the growth of uptake of the Internet access by those who would like to impose taxes on it. 
   State and local governments have shown a great appetite for doing that. In fact, some had done it even before we put the original ban in place, and they have been grandfathered in under the legislation that moved forward. The proposal that we had would have phased out that grandfathering after 4 years. In fact, after the permanent ban was defeated in the committee, I offered an amendment that would have extended it for 8 years, but only a 4-year extension of the grandfather clauses, so that those States that were dependent upon these taxes could phase them out over 4 years and we would then have a longer period of time for which investors would see an opportunity to see greater investment opportunities in the rollout of high-speed broadband services to more Americans. 
   That actually passed in the committee the first time by a vote of 20-18. Then without any explanation for why a member would change their vote, nonetheless, a vote was changed and that was then defeated, and we wound up with what we have on the floor with us today. 
   The Congress, the will of this House, is clear. Over 240 bipartisan Members have cosponsored legislation to make the ban permanent. At every turn, the Democratic majority has worked unusually hard to suppress the clear will of the actual majority of Members of the House, including nearly 100 Members on their side of the aisle who have cosponsored legislation to make a permanent ban of Internet access charges. 
   Despite the clear will of the House, and despite the requests that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), our ranking member, referred to a letter requesting that this be brought up under regular order, the leadership of the House refused to bring a permanent extension to the floor. No Members were allowed to offer amendments on the floor. Why? Because clearly if anyone had been allowed to offer an amendment to make the ban permanent, it would have passed by an overwhelming margin. It would have supplanted the legislation that we are having here on the floor today. 
   So no subcommittee markup was held on this legislation. The House Judiciary Committee resorted to rare procedural maneuvers to reverse the vote to double the length of the tax moratorium which I offered, and party politics have trumped good policy in bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   Our Nation's low-income families and the technology sector deserve better, and they are big losers today. The permanent ban and the rationale for it is important for people to understand. The temporary fix before us does little to bridge the digital divide, the divide between those who can easily afford high-speed Internet access service and those who cannot. It is estimated that only 11 percent of U.S. households with incomes less than $30,000 a year have high-speed Internet service, as opposed to 61 percent of households with incomes over $100,000. Why is that? Well, in part, it is because there has not been sufficient buildout of Internet access in communities where there are lower incomes, and in part it is because of the concern that once this ban expires, this moratorium expires, significant taxes will be imposed that will discourage lower-income families from maintaining their service on the Internet or from acquiring it in the first place. 
   A permanent ban would guarantee that the price of Internet access will not be raised due to excessive taxation, and a permanent ban would create certainty for broadband providers and those who have to make the multibillion dollar capital investment to make sure that the United States not only catches up, but retakes its place as the world leader in technology, not just in developing the technology, but making sure that American businesses, large and small, and American families, rich and poor, have access to this technology. 
   It is a shame that we are not having an opportunity to cast that vote today, which is the clear will of the majority of this House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on this issue, as well as that of the two gentlewomen from California, Congresswoman Eshoo and Congresswoman Lofgren, who have been advocates of a permanent extension of this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the House leadership has now seen fit to schedule a vote on a bill to extend the Internet tax moratorium for longer than the mere 4-year extension contained in the House-passed bill. 
   However, I'm still extremely disappointed that the majority did not allow any amendments to H.R. 3678 when it was considered by the full House. The handling of that bill 2 weeks ago by the House leadership is unfortunately reflective of the stranglehold that leadership has placed on the will of the majority in this Congress. 
   I had introduced legislation, along with Representative Eshoo, to make the ban on Internet access taxes permanent, and that legislation had garnered nearly 240 bipartisan cosponsors before the House was forced to vote on the 4-year extension. These cosponsors represent a strong bipartisan majority of the Members of this body. However, with absolutely no explanation, the majority party cut off all opportunity for amendments to that legislation on the House floor, where I have no doubt an amendment to make the ban on access taxes on the Internet permanent would have passed with a very strong majority. 
   During committee consideration, the House Judiciary Committee even resorted to obscure procedural tactics to reverse a vote for an amendment in committee to extend the moratorium from 4 years to 8 years. Because all but one Democrat, Congresswoman Lofgren, on the committee voted against an amendment I offered there to extend the moratorium for 6 years, I assume that to be consistent they will vote against the 7-year extension before us today, but we shall see. 
   With regard to the merits of a 4-year extension, we heard arguments that the Senate would not accept anything longer than a 4-year extension. However, that has proven not to be the case. Now, House leadership has been forced to schedule a vote on a bill to extend the moratorium for 7 years because the current moratorium expires tomorrow. It's a shame they did not do this, and more, voluntarily when they had the chance. 
   Instead, the Senate, and I, too, join in commending Senator Wyden and Senator Sununu in the bipartisan effort that was made in the Senate, which passed a more reasonable bill with a longer term of protection for American taxpayers. 
   The bill before us today extends the moratorium for almost twice as long as  the House-passed bill, and while I would prefer a permanent ban, this is a vast improvement over current law. This bill will continue to help ensure that the digital divide does not grow between those who can and cannot afford broadband Internet access. 
   The bill will also help ensure that businesses have more certainty when making business decisions about whether to deploy broadband to areas they do not currently serve, such as rural areas across the country. 
   I urge the Members of this body to support this important legislation. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, at this time, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlelady from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren), a colleague of mine on the subcommittee and the Committee on the Judiciary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the farm bill, and the words before me say ``the very same farm bill passed by this body last week with an overwhelming bipartisan majority.'' Now we find that it is not quite the same farm bill because of an enrolling error or something in the transmission of the document. I certainly hope that we can find an amicable way to make sure that the trade title of this bill, which is an important title, is included in the final product, whether as a part of a joint resolution or by some other means of adopting that. 
   This bill was a collaborative effort, crafted by Members on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol, and is historic in the amount and degree of reform. It costs less than either the House or the Senate bills and ensures Americans will continue to enjoy access to a safe, affordable, and reliable food supply. 
   Last week, the 318 bipartisan votes in favor of the farm bill sent a clear message: This is a good bill and there is significant support for it. Despite what has been opined by editorial boards throughout the country, this bill contains significant reforms and is the most reform-minded farm bill this body has ever considered. Granted, everyone didn't get exactly what they wanted. We all gave a little and we all got a little. But such is the nature of compromise. Given the diverse nature of a farm bill, it is extremely difficult to manage the scope of needs within the farm bill, and even more difficult when you're not given the resources needed to do so. 
   This bill contains many of the ideas suggested in the administration's farm bill proposal. Like the administration, we utilized the adjusted gross income to reduce payments to the wealthiest farmers and ranchers. We eliminated the three-entity rule, created a revenue-base countercyclical program, modified and modernized the dairy program, modified planting flexibility rules, increased the efficiency of the crop insurance program, directed funding to the development of cellulosic ethanol, included programs for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, and created beneficial interest for the loan programs. 
   Variations of these measures were included in the administration's proposal. We may not have gone as far as the administration wanted, but these reforms help make this a better bill than the House or Senate farm bills. 
   It is important to point out that despite comments to the contrary, this bill is completely paid for, without any tax increases. While many throughout the world are feeling the effects of increased food prices, U.S. consumers have been largely insulated from spikes in food prices because many years ago we established a food production system that maintains an adequate supply in good times and in bad. Because it is produced domestically, we know it to be safe and affordable. 
   This bill ensures that Americans will continue to enjoy the access to a safe, affordable, and reliable food supply, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this farm bill, which moved substantially in the direction that the President asked for, but which did not meet all of his goals. I think we have increased the support for this bill substantially by almost 90 Members in the process, and I urge my colleagues to support this override vote.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to the gentleman from Arizona about the ACRE program. This is a program that was requested by the administration. It was modified by the House and modified by the Senate. Now we hear the administration doesn't like the way it is projected to work, but, quite frankly, it scores by the Congressional Budget Office as saving the taxpayers of our country $400 million. 
   Why? Because the fact of the matter is it is not expected to have a very high enrollment, and in order to have what the gentleman describe take place, we would have to have a dramatic drop in corn prices. But the administration just signed into law in December a bill that mandates ever-increasing costs of amounts of production for ethanol, and the fact of the matter is we are not going to see those conditions. It is a theoretical possibility, a practical unlikely condition. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany).

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, a lot has been said here today about the bipartisan nature of this legislation, but when it passed the House last week, a majority on both sides of the aisle voted for this farm bill, and three-quarters of all of the Members here did so. But we did so because there are provisions in this bill that are of interest to each side of the aisle, and sometimes there are very clear partisan differences. 
   But nonetheless, the Republican side of the aisle received a number of concessions in the final negotiations of this bill: a provision that would have prohibited all 50 State food stamp programs to be able to reach out to technology companies and others to modernize and improve their food stamp program, something they have done many times in the recent past. A prohibition on that was removed from the bill. A provision in the bill that would have rolled back the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and provided increased food stamps for able-bodied adults without dependent children was removed from the bill. Provisions related to the Davis-Bacon legislation that many Members on my side of the aisle, including myself, were concerned about were removed from the bill. 
   So this is a bipartisan bill because it was compromise and give-and-take on both sides of the aisle. 
   I have also heard Members complain that this bill is not fiscally responsible. It's less than the last farm bill. It is less than either the House-passed  version of the bill or the Senate-passed version of the bill: $4 billion less than the House, $5 billion less than the Senate version. I ask any Member here in the House, when was the last time they recall that a bill came back from a conference between the House and the Senate and spent less money than either the House or Senate spent? 
   And I would give you this overall picture. Americans spend about $1.2 trillion a year on food. The provisions in this bill related to the commodity title, the safety net for America's farmers and ranchers, is about $7 billion or slightly less than one-half of 1 percent of what Americans spend on food.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds. 
   Now for that one-half cent on every dollar, Americans get the stability and safety of their food supply and the assurance that they will not see in the United States what they're seeing in other countries around the world which do not have a good farm program for their farmers that assure their consumers that they will get an adequate, safe, and affordable supply of food. They do not see food riots in the United States. 
   They see, instead, those in the greatest need receiving appropriate food programs and the average American being able to spend less than 9 percent of their income on food. That is lower than any other country in the world today or any other country in the history of the world. 
   This farm bill helps to promote those good policies. I urge my colleagues to support the override.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote to override this veto, but I would like to close my remarks by commending the President of the United States and his administration for their involvement in this process. They have improved this farm bill considerably from the versions that were passed in the House and the Senate. In fact, I'm going to yield a portion of my time to the leader. 
   But I want to say that this includes more than 90 provisions that the President of the United States, the leaders in the Department of Agriculture and others, suggested to us to reform. And there are numerous reforms in this legislation that are very, very substantial, very, very significant. They would not have occurred without the President's active involvement and support for efforts to improve this farm bill. 
   This farm bill is dramatically reformed from previous farm bills, and as a result of his involvement, of involvement on both sides of the aisle, this farm bill is dramatically improved. As a result, the Republican Members on this side of the aisle went from 17 Members supporting the bill when it came out of the Agriculture Committee to 100 Members supporting it when we voted for it last week. 
   There is much to commend in this bill. The President has asked for additional reforms. I supported him in the efforts to obtain some of those reforms, but we could not achieve every single objective that he sought because this is a bipartisan bill that includes the considerations of a wide array of viewpoints. 
   But I will say that this side of the aisle was well represented in this process and thanks in part to the efforts of the administration. 
   Notwithstanding that, the bill is a good bill, and we would urge our colleagues to support it. 
   At this time, I yield the balance of my time to the Republican leader, the gentleman from Ohio.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (THE REVEREND JERRY FALWELL -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor the memory of my constituent and my friend, the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. 
   Last week, the city of Lynchburg, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the entire country lost one of our dearest sons in the passing of Rev. Falwell. Today Dr. Falwell was laid to rest. I am sad that business here in Washington kept many of us from being able to attend today's services, but since we were unable to attend, we have joined here tonight to pay homage to this great leader. 
   Dr. Falwell's legacy is one that will not soon be forgotten. He was a man whose strong faith and vision were unshakable. He lived his life trying to strengthen the moral fabric of our great Nation. 
   In his crusade to strengthen family values, he was a frequent visitor to Washington, DC, he led many people to the Nation's Capital to demand that leaders here strengthen our country's moral foundation. 
   Jerry lived his life guided by a strong set of values and an unshakable moral compass. He lived by example, embodying the Bible's greatest commandments. He followed the words of Matthew 22 in his daily life: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbors as yourself. 
   Anyone who ever met Jerry Falwell knew that he took this commandment seriously and chartered his life by it. 
   One thing is for sure. Whether one was viewed as a friend or foe of Jerry Falwell, he loved them all. This love for the neighbor extended to everyone, even those who wouldn't expect it. I had many times heard Rev. Falwell say, ``Love the sinner, hate the sin.'' This was more than just a catch phrase. It was a way of life. 
   Many people have heard of the infamous Supreme Court battle between Jerry Falwell and Larry Flynt. But what few people didn't realize is that Falwell and Flynt actually became friends. I know Jerry did not approve of Mr. Flynt's business, but he separated his thoughts about the man from Flynt's activities.     
   To most people, Jerry Falwell is a national figure. But I also know him as a local guy who was always giving back to his community. He was a local preacher who worked to serve his congregation and the community. He started his church over 50 years ago in an old bottling factory. That small congregation has grown from 35 to the over-22,000 current members of Thomas Road Baptist Church. 
   Dr. Falwell, through his church, set in place many ministries to aid the community. In 1959, he established the Elim Home to help men dealing with chemical addictions. This home has transformed the lives of hundreds of men and remains a place to free men of their addictions. 
   Additionally, Dr. Falwell helped found the Liberty Godparent Foundation. The foundation's mission is to improve the quality of life for unwed mothers and provide a hopeful future for unborn children. The foundation maintains Liberty Godparent Maternity Home, which offers a safe haven for unwed mothers, and Family Services Adoption Agency, which helps place unwanted children in safe and stable homes. The reach of the church has touched many thousands and extends past central Virginia and across the United States. 
   The list of Jerry Falwell's many ministries and accomplishments is nearly endless. However, many people asked him of what accomplishment he was most proud. Without hesitation he would say, Liberty University. This university, located in my congressional district in Lynchburg, started as a small Baptist college. Today it has grown exponentially and serves over 10,000 students. Washington, DC is filled with Liberty University alumni. I have been pleased to have many Liberty University alumni serve in my office as staff and interns. In fact, L.U. alumni are all over Capitol Hill. I have heard them talk fondly of the education they received at Liberty, and they refer to themselves warmly as ``Jerry's kids.'' 
   I have frequently been on the campus of Liberty, and they are, in fact, Jerry's kids. He loved those kids as his own. Rev. Falwell was very involved and engaged in university life. He always had time for the students. He was also a fixture at school events. Jerry was especially proud of L.U. athletics and he would, with the students, cheer the Flames on to victory. I have even heard stories of Jerry crowd surfing at basketball games. Students would transport him from the bottom of the stands to the top. 
   There is no doubt that Liberty and the alumni that it produces will live on as Jerry Falwell's lasting legacy. These alumni carry with them the strong values and morals that were reinforced through their education at Liberty. The university and its alumni will remain a living testimony of the work and vision of Jerry Falwell. 
   You cannot talk about Rev. Falwell without also talking about the town that he loved, the city of Lynchburg. Jerry, though a national figure, never left his home in central Virginia. He led his spiritual network out of his offices in Lynchburg. The city of Lynchburg greatly benefited from Rev. Falwell's work. As Falwell's ministries, and especially Liberty University flourished, so did the city. The impact that Jerry had on Lynchburg's economy and culture is undeniable. 
   When word of Jerry's death came, the city of Lynchburg seemed to take a collective gasp and was filled with shock and sorrow. The loss of Rev. Falwell was a huge loss for Lynchburg. And today I tell the citizens of Lynchburg that the Nation mourns with you. 
   When I heard of the passing of my good friend, Jerry Falwell, I was deeply saddened. My wife, Mary Ellen, and I had the pleasure of knowing Dr. Falwell for many years. He was a good man and made an undeniable impression on many lives. Two hours after his death was confirmed, an impromptu memorial service brought a standing room only crowd to Thomas Road Baptist Church, a church that holds 6,000 people. Since then, thousands have shown up to pay their respects, and thousands showed up today for his funeral. 
   While many people mourn the death of Rev. Falwell, no one experiences this loss harder than Jerry's family. Jerry was a devoted family man. He was dedicated to his bride and partner of 49 years, Macel. Together they raised three children. Jerry, Jr., Jonathan and Jeannie, who I have no doubt will build on the great legacy that their father leaves behind. Nothing can compare to the deep personal loss that they are experiencing, and our thoughts and prayers and hearts are with them. 
   After hearing the sad news of Jerry's death, I was able to call and offer my condolences to Macel. She shared with me how Jerry spent his last day. I don't think she would mind me sharing with you what happened, as I feel it fully embodies the man that Jerry was. 
   The night before he passed away, Macel and Jerry went out to dinner. As they talked to their waitress, Jerry found out that she attended the local community college. When he asked the young lady why she didn't go to Liberty University, she told him that she had applied and been accepted, but as a private school, it was too expensive. Jerry told her that he would find a way  for her to attend Liberty. The next morning, the morning he passed away, Rev. Falwell lived up to his word and found scholarship money for the young waitress. It was perhaps one of the last things he did before collapsing in his office. 
   This last act of charity and giving is a perfect example of the man that Jerry Falwell was. Right up till the end of his life, he was working to change lives. 
   There are many other stories like this one out there of how this extraordinary man touched and changed ordinary lives. Rev. Jerry Falwell was a loving and caring man. He led his life guided by strong convictions. He left an unquestionable impression on our country. 
   I will greatly miss my friend. I pray for his family and his congregation, and I join the Nation in mourning this great spiritual leader. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks).

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words. 
   We will be joined shortly by another speaker, but before we are, let me tell a little bit more about Dr. Falwell. 
   At the age of 22, having just graduated from college in June of 1956, Jerry Falwell returned to his hometown of Lynchburg, Virginia, and started Thomas Road Baptist Church with just 35 members. The offering that first Sunday totaled $135. Falwell often said about that first collection, ``We thought we had conquered the world.'' Today Thomas Road has over 22,000 members, and the total annual revenues of all of the Jerry Falwell ministries total over $200 million. 
   Within weeks of founding his new church in 1956, Falwell began the Old-Time Gospel Hour, a daily local radio ministry and a weekly local television ministry. Nearly five decades later, this Old-Time Gospel Hour is now seen and heard in every American home and on every continent except Antarctica. Through the years, over 3 million persons have communicated to the Falwell ministries that they have received Christ as Lord and Savior as a result of this radio and television ministry. 
   In 1967, Falwell implemented his vision to build a Christian educational system for evangelical youth. He began with the creation of Lynchburg Christian Academy, a Christ-centered, academically excellent, fully accredited Christian day school providing kindergarten, elementary, and high school. In 1971, Liberty University was founded. Today, over 21,500 students from 50 States and 80 nations attend this accredited liberal arts Christian university. Falwell's dream has become a reality. A preschool child can now enter the school system at age 3 and, 20 or more years later, leave the same campus with a Ph.D., without ever sitting in a classroom where the teacher was not a Christian. 
   Falwell is also publisher of the National Liberty Journal, a monthly newspaper which is read by over 200,000 pastors and Christian workers; and the Falwell Confidential, a weekly e-mail newsletter to over 500,000 pastors and Christian activists. 
   In June of 1979, Falwell organized the Moral Majority, a conservative political lobbying movement, which the press soon dubbed the ``Religious Right.'' During the first 2 years of its existence, the Moral Majority attracted over 100,000 pastors, priests, and rabbis and nearly 7 million religious conservatives who mobilized as a pro-life, pro-family, pro-Israel, and pro-strong-national-defense organization. The Moral Majority supported California Governor Ronald Reagan as their candidate for President in 1980, registered millions of new voters, and set about to inform and activate a sleeping giant: 80 million Americans committed to faith, family, and moral values. 
   With the impetus of the newly organized Moral 
   Majority, millions of people of faith voted for the first time in 1980 and helped Ronald Reagan be elected President, and many conservative Congressmen and Senators. 
   Since 1979, about 30 percent of the American electorate has been identified by media polls as the ``Religious Right.'' Most recent major media surveys have acknowledged that these ``faith and values'' voters reelected George W. Bush in November 2004. 
   Though perhaps better known outside Lynchburg for political activism, Jerry Falwell's personal schedule confirms his passion for being a pastor and a Christian educator. He often states that his heartbeat is for training young people for every walk of life. 
   Falwell and his wife of 49 years Macel have three grown children and eight grandchildren. 
   While we continue to await for our next speaker, let me read from a report in the Lynchburg News & Advance from last Tuesday: 
   ``Jerry Falwell was born in 1933 in Lynchburg and lived here all his life. He married Macel Pate of Lynchburg in 1958. They had three children: Jerry Falwell, Jr., an attorney who represents the Falwell ministries and is vice chancellor of Liberty University; Jeannie Falwell Savas, a Richmond surgeon; and Jonathan Falwell, the executive pastor at Thomas Road Baptist Church. 
   ``Falwell founded Thomas Road in 1956 in an old soft drink bottling plant after graduating from Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Missouri. That same year he started his weekly television broadcast, the Old-Time Gospel Hour. 
   ``The church moved into a 3,200-seat sanctuary on Thomas Road in the Fort Hill area in 1970, with services broadcast around the world. Falwell founded Liberty University, then known as Lynchburg Baptist College, in 1971. He always hoped the school would be one of his lasting legacies. 
   ``He started the Moral Majority, Incorporated, in 1979, conducting `I love America' rallies at 44 State capitals. 
   ``The rise of the Moral Majority coincided with the Reagan Presidency, and Falwell rose to national prominence as well.'' 
   Falwell and his ministries faced many challenges through the years. 
   ``In the late 1990s, Falwell reemerged on the national stage in a flurry of television appearances,'' a series of changes to his ministries, ``but Falwell gave up campaigning for politicians as he did for President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. `I don't plan ever to get back into the Moral Majority-type work,' he said in a 1998 interview. `What I did I did because I felt led to do it then, and I'm glad I did it ..... My thing now is a nonpartisan Biblical approach to moral and social issues.' '' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the Republican whip, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt). I am very pleased to have his presence as we commemorate the life of Reverend Jerry Falwell.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Well, I thank the whip for joining us in this special tribute to Reverend Jerry Falwell. 
   I must tell you that the mountain you refer to, which is Chandler Mountain in Lynchburg, was acquired by Liberty University. You can see the university growing up the sides of that mountain now. In fact, they now have a big ``LU'' planted in trees near the top of the mountain. 
   Jerry Falwell climbed many mountains, and he leaves behind a legacy not only of building an outstanding educational organization and an outstanding church, but more importantly, he leaves behind the people who make that church and that university strong and growing, led by his children, who will carry on his legacy and reach out to many, many more throughout our country and throughout the world. 
   I close this special order with a moment of silence, acknowledging the life and work of my constituent and my friend, the late Rev. Jerry Falwell.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (INTERNET SPYWARE (I-SPY) PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1525, the Internet Spyware or I-SPY Prevention Act. 
   I was pleased to join with my colleague from California, Representative Zoe Lofgren, to reintroduce this legislation. This bipartisan bill will impose tough criminal penalties on those that use software for nefarious purposes without imposing a broad regulatory regime on legitimate online businesses. I believe that this targeted approach is the best way to combat spyware. 
   Spyware is software that provides a tool for criminals to secretly crack into computers to conduct nefarious activities such as altering a user's security settings, collecting personal information to steal a user's identity or to commit other crimes. A recent study done by the National Cybersecurity Alliance revealed that over 90 percent of consumers had some form of spyware on their computers, and most consumers were not aware of it. 
   The I-SPY Prevention Act would impose criminal penalties on the most egregious behavior associated with spyware. Specifically, this legislation would impose up to a 5-year prison sentence on anyone who uses software to intentionally break into a computer and uses that spyware in furtherance of another Federal crime. 
   In addition, it would impose up to a 2-year prison sentence on anyone who uses spyware to intentionally break into a computer and either alter the computer's security settings or obtain personal information with the intent to defraud or injure a person, or with the intent to damage a computer. By imposing stiff penalties on these bad actors, this legislation will help deter the use of spyware and will thus help protect consumers from these aggressive attacks. 
   Enforcement is also crucial in combating spyware. The I-SPY Prevention Act authorizes $10 million for fiscal years 2008 through 2011 to be devoted to prosecutions involving spyware, phishing and pharming scams, and expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Justice should vigorously enforce the laws against these crimes. 
   Phishing scams occur when criminals send fake e-mail messages to consumers on behalf of famous companies and request account information that is later used to conduct criminal activities. 
   Pharming scams occur when hackers redirect Internet traffic to fake sites in  order to steal personal information such as credit card numbers, passwords and account information. 
   This form of online fraud is particularly egregious because it is not as easily discernible by consumers. With pharming scams, innocent Internet users simply type the domain name into their Web browsers and the signal is rerouted to the devious Web site. 
   The I-SPY Prevention Act is a targeted approach that protects consumers by imposing stiff penalties on the truly bad actors, while protecting the ability of legitimate companies to develop new and exciting products and services online for consumers. 
   The I-SPY Prevention Act also avoids excessive regulation and its repercussions, including the increased likelihood that an overly regulatory approach focusing on technology would have unintended consequences that could discourage consumer use of the Internet, as well as the creation of new technologies and services on the Internet. By encouraging innovation, the I-SPY Prevention Act will help ensure that consumers have access to cutting-edge products and services at lower prices. 
   In addition, the approach of the I-SPY Prevention Act does not interfere with the free market principle that a business should be free to react to consumer demand by providing consumers with easy access to the Internet's wealth of information and convenience. Increasingly, consumers want a seamless interaction with the Internet, and we must be careful to not interfere with businesses' ability to respond to this consumer demand with innovative services. The I-SPY Prevention Act will help ensure that consumers, not the Federal Government, define what their interaction with the Internet looks like.     
   Finally, by going after the criminal behavior associated with the use of spyware, the I-SPY Prevention Act recognizes that not all software is spyware and that the crime does not lie in the technology itself but rather in actually using the technology for criminal purposes. People commit crimes; software doesn't. 
   H.R. 1525 is an effective, targeted approach to combating spyware, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman, and I thank him for his leadership on the Judiciary Committee and for years of leadership on this legislation, along with Howard Berman, the chairman of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee, and their staffs for this legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, article I, section 8 of our Constitution lays the framework for our Nation's patent laws. It grants Congress the power to award inventors, for limited periods of time, exclusive rights to their inventions. The Framers had the incredible foresight to realize that this type of incentive was crucial to ensure that America would become the world's leader in innovation and creativity. 
   These incentives are just as important today as they were at the founding of our country. It is only right that as more and more inventions with increasing complexity emerge, we should examine our Nation's patent laws to  ensure that they still work efficiently and that they still encourage, and not discourage, innovation, so America will remain the world's leader in innovation. 
   The solution involves both ensuring that quality patents are issued in the first place and ensuring that we take a good hard look at patent litigation and enforcement laws to make sure that they do not contain loopholes for opportunists with invalid claims to exploit. H.R. 1908 addresses both of these concerns. 
   First, the bill helps ensure that quality patents are being issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The PTO, like any other large government agency, makes mistakes. H.R. 1908 creates a post-grant opposition procedure to allow the private sector to challenge a patent just after it is approved to provide an additional check on the issuance of bogus patents. Better quality patents mean more certainty and less litigation for patent holders and businesses. 
   In addition, H.R. 1908 contains important litigation reforms to rein in abusive lawsuits and forum shopping so that aggressive trial lawyers do not make patent litigation their next gold mine like they did for asbestos lawsuits, class action lawsuits and the like. Specifically, the bill tightens the venue provisions in the current patent law to prevent forum shopping. 
   H.R. 1908 also prohibits excessive damage awards. Believe it or not, there is no current requirement that damage awards in patent cases be limited to the value the patent added to the overall product. The courts have created a virtual free-for-all environment in this area. H.R. 1908 contains provisions to help ensure that damages are proportional to the value the invention added to the product, which will inject certainty into this area and allow businesses to devote their resources to R&D and innovating. 
   The bill also creates clearer standards for ``willful infringement'' by requiring greater specificity in notice letters alleging infringement of patent claims and requiring courts to include in the record more information about how they calculate damage awards. 
   Furthermore, the bill contains an important amendment that Congressman Boucher and I added during the Judiciary Committee markup to prevent individuals and companies from filing patents to protect tax strategies. Since 1998, when the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held that business methods were patentable, 51 tax strategy patents have been granted covering such topics as estate and gift tax strategies, pension plans, charitable giving and the like. Over 80 additional tax strategy patents are pending before the USPTO. 
   When one individual or business is given the exclusive right to a particular method of complying with the Tax Code, it increases the cost and complexity for every other citizen or tax preparer to comply with the Tax Code. No one should have to pay royalties to file their taxes. H.R. 1908 renders these tax strategy patents unpatentable so that citizens can be free to comply with the Tax Code in the most efficient manner without asking permission or paying a royalty. 
   Our patent laws were written over 50 years ago and did not contemplate our modern economy where many products involve hundreds and even thousands of patented inventions. H.R. 1908 provides a much-needed update to these laws, and I urge my colleagues to support this litigation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (PRESIDENTIAL HISTORICAL RECORDS PRESERVATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. I want to thank Ranking Member Davis, my colleague from Virginia, for not only yielding me time but also for his leadership in working so hard with Chairman Waxman, with Members of the Senate and others who have been involved in pushing this legislation forward, for helping to finally reach this day in which we have legislation that concurs with legislation in the Senate. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Presidential Historic Records Preservation Act of 2008. I introduced similar legislation a few weeks ago in the House, along with my colleagues in the Senate, Senators JOHN WARNER and JIM WEBB.  
   Mr. Speaker, the National Historical Publications and Records Commission is a statutory body affiliated with the National Archives and Records Administration. The NHPRC was established by Congress in 1934 to promote the preservation and use of America's documentary heritage essential to understanding our democracy, history, and culture. 
   Currently, the NHPRC is authorized to administer grants to promote preservation and use of America's documentary heritage. The NHPRC supports projects that preserve and make accessible records and archives, and research and develop means to preserve authentic electronic records. Unfortunately, the NHPRC does not preserve the documents of all Presidents. 
   The Presidential Historical Records Preservation Act of 2008 would allow NHPRC to make grants on a competitive basis to eligible entities to promote the historic preservation of, and public access to, historical records and documents relating to any President who does not have a Presidential archival depository currently managed and maintained by the Federal Government pursuant to the Presidential Libraries Act of 1955. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation, in order to be eligible to receive these grants, an entity must qualify as a 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or be a State or local government. In order to maintain the integrity of the grant program, the NHPRC may only approve grants to those entities that possess historical works and collections of historical sources that the commission considers appropriate for preserving, publishing, or otherwise recording at the public expense. The entity must also have appropriate facilities  and space for preservation of such historical works and ensure public access to these collections. 
   Finally, to maintain the fiscal integrity of this act, the receiving entity must have raised funds from non-Federal sources in support of the grant efforts. In addition, grants may not be used for the maintenance, operating costs, or construction of any facility to house the historical records of any President who does not have a Presidential archival depository currently managed by the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, as you can see, the focus of the bill is preservation and access to documents, not constructing new buildings or monuments. 
   I also commend my colleagues in the Senate for their improvements to this bill by allowing the Archivist to provide greater online access to historical documents of our Nation's Founding Fathers. With this provision, future generations will have greater access to the stories and journeys on the creation of our great country. 
   I want to thank my colleagues, Ranking Member Davis and Chairman Waxman, for their help with this legislation. I would also like to thank the staff at the Archives and Senators WARNER and WEBB for their assistance, as well as the Senate Committee on Government Affairs and Homeland Security in crafting this important bill. 
   Finally, I especially want to thank my constituents at the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library in Staunton, Virginia, for their assistance and guidance as this bill has taken on many forms over the past few years. The Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library has preserved several thousand documents, and it is my hope that these NHPRC grants will help organizations like this serve the American public.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I rise today in support of the farm bill conference report. I thank the chairman and all of the other members of the Agriculture Committee on both sides of the aisle for working in such a bipartisan spirit to produce good legislation. I also thank my staff and the majority staff for their hard and, I know to them, seemingly endless work on this legislation. 
   This farm bill contains solid reforms while addressing a variety of issues including forestry, rural development, renewable energy, nutrition, conservation, research, specialty crops, and livestock and still maintains the safety net necessary to ensure a safe, reliable and affordable domestic food supply. This farm bill is a good work product, and I am proud of the work we have done. 
   The bill contains more reforms than any previous farm bill, eliminating payments to millionaire farmers, eliminating the three-entity rule, and increasing the efficiency of the crop insurance program among numerous other reforms. 
   It's 100 percent PAYGO-compliant and is fiscally responsible, scoring $4  billion less than the House bill and $5 billion less than the Senate bill. I think you would be hard-pressed, Mr. Speaker, to find a conference report in the history of this body that came back scoring less than the House and Senate bills. That is a significant achievement, and I think it would be foolish to overlook the positive changes this farm bill has undergone. 
   When we talk about the farm bill, many believe that the Congress is voting on a $288 billion bill that goes directly to farmers. The truth is that only 17 percent of the farm bill spending is devoted to farm programs, while nearly 70 percent goes to the nutrition title alone. In fact, there is very little farm in a farm bill anymore. 
   In 2002, the farm program funding comprised just three-quarters of 1 percent of the Federal budget. Today, farm program funding accounts for just one-quarter of 1 percent of the Federal budget, a twofold reduction in just 5 years. 
   Agriculture policy is essential to the lives of every American, and it is important that the policy we formulate is responsible, effective and at a low cost to the taxpayer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, much has been said about whether or not there is reform in the legislation. 
   Let me point out that there is very substantial reform. We have caps on adjusted gross income limits on farmers and on nonfarmers. We require direct attribution of benefits. We reform the dairy and sugar support programs. We create revenue-based countercyclical programs. We address the beneficial interest problem. We reform the crop insurance program, and we eliminate the three-entity rule. 
   Those of you who are not in agriculture may wonder what some of those things are. They are all significant reforms resulting in this. For those who say we are not making cuts in the commodity programs, this orange bar represents payment for commodity programs under the last 3 years of the so-called Freedom to Farm Act, which some have touted as being more reform oriented in agriculture, $24.7 billion a year. 
   During the last farm bill, the 2002 to 2007 farm bill, it averages $12.1 billion per year. The projected average cost for the current farm bill that we are debating right now, $7.6 billion a year, less than one-third of what was spent per year under the Freedom to Farm program. This is real reform, these are real cuts in the commodity title for America's farmers and ranchers. 
   This gives you an illustration of what we are talking about, what we are debating about. This thing that looks like a pin, this little tiny slice of overall total Federal spending, is what goes to commodity programs, one-quarter of 1 percent of the Federal budget, down from three-fourths of 1 percent during the first year of the 2002 farm bill. 
   You might say we are dancing on the head of a pin when we have this much debate about reform for one-fourth of 1 percent of the farm programs. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this reform legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Speaker just mentioned the bipartisanship in this legislation, and that is very true. But this legislation is not bipartisan because many Republicans will be supporting a Democratic bill, this legislation is bipartisan because it was crafted by both Republicans and Democrats throughout the conference process, and this legislation is very, very different than the legislation that passed the House last summer which I voted against primarily because there were tax increases to pay for the legislation. There are no more tax increases paying for this legislation. In fact, this legislation is paid for by a means that is acceptable to both sides and acceptable to the administration. 
   But there are more reforms in this legislation that Republicans prevailed upon our Democratic colleagues on in the conference. The effort to prohibit States, most particularly the State of Indiana, from being able to seek outside help to reform their flawed food stamp program was removed from this bill, and so now not just Indiana but all 50 States will be able to continue to use appropriate means to modernize their food stamp programs. 
   Davis-Bacon provisions in the Northern Border Economic Development Commission, the Southeast Crescent, and the Southwest Border Regional Commissions, those Davis-Bacon provisions have been removed from this legislation. 
   An effort to undermine the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 by providing increased food stamp benefits to adults, able-bodied adults without dependents was removed from this legislation. 
   And anticompetition livestock provisions, which were very troubling to many Members on this side of the aisle and on the other side of the aisle as well, were removed. 
   So while there are certainly advocates for each of those provisions in this bill, this bill is bipartisan because we worked together to give on both sides to make sure that we came up with a good farm bill that could command strong bipartisan support.     
   This bill promotes energy independence by expanding investment in cellulosic biofuels and helping move away from corn-based ethanol. It cuts the ethanol subsidy by 12 percent. It's fiscally responsible because it contains no tax increases and is PAYGO compliant. It boosts conservation programs benefiting our environment. It aids food banks and nutrition in our schools in its nutrition programs. It preserves the farm safety net and assures that we continue to have the safest, most affordable, most abundant food supply in the world. This is real reform. This is a real farm bill for the 21st century. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. 
   I want to thank, again, the chairman of the committee, the chairmen of the subcommittees, the ranking members on my side of the aisle, but most importantly, the staff on both the majority and the minority side who worked many, many, many weekends over the last 2 1/2 years, but particularly in the last few months, to craft this legislation, to address all of the concerns that were raised, to go down blind alleys, find that something didn't work, come back up, find a different way to make it work, and to reach this point today, the staff has helped make that possible. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I just want to say to all of my colleagues that this has been, as the chairman described, a very long and arduous process that began more than 2 1/2 years ago by listening to farmers and ranchers and other people all across the country and holding a multitude of hearings there, and here in Washington as well. It began under my chairmanship. I have never seen anybody who has pursued the passage of legislation as tenaciously and with such dedication, but also listening to so many different people, as the chairman of the committee has done. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a result, this is not your father's farm bill, nor is it even the farm bill that passed out of this House last summer. This farm bill has more reform than any farm bill that the Congress has ever taken up. It imposes payment limitations on farmers and those who own land and have substantial nonfarm income alike and is well worth consideration in this body, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the temporary farm bill extension that will extend some provisions of the 2002 farm bill just a little while longer so that we may complete the work on this farm bill. I believe we've made good progress on coming to agreement on the funding which has been the biggest obstacle preventing any real movement on the completion of a farm bill to this point. While we're not there yet, I do believe we are getting close. 
   The House and Senate conferees have been meeting every day this week, and we intend to continue our work throughout the rest of the week. We are committed to putting together a reform-minded bill that we can bring before this body soon and earn the support of our Members here and in the other chamber, and then go on to the President for his approval. 
   We all recognize the need for a new farm bill. This process has already been delayed enough, and while it is a long time coming, we shouldn't halt the momentum that is finally getting this process moving to a positive direction. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this farm bill extension to give us a little more time to work out the rest of the funding issues and wrap up the policy differences so that we can produce a good farm bill. 
   I want to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Peterson, for his kind words, and say that there is no doubt that no one, in this body or the other, I'll take the chance of saying that, has worked harder or longer in order to try to get to this point than Chairman Peterson has. He has spoken to innumerable people in order to try to bring about the kind of consensus it takes to get here. He has been down many different avenues, and if one doesn't work, he comes back, starts over again and tries a different approach. And his persistence and his attention to the details in this farm bill and his knowledge of the wide range of issues that comprise the farm bill has enabled us to negotiate effectively with the Senate to negotiate effectively with Members in this body who have legitimate concerns that need to be addressed in the farm bill.  
   But with the limited resources and the differences of opinion that arise in any bill, particularly one of this complexity, he has done an outstanding job of listening to the concerns of many different people, and I am optimistic that we can move forward and reach a final farm bill to bring before this body and before the other body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of overriding the farm bill veto. Currently, 14 of the farm bill's 15 titles have been enacted into law, and the passage of the veto override will ensure that the whole bill, including the trade title, becomes law.     
   The content of the bill before us today is the exact same as it was when  317 of my colleagues joined me in May in support of the reform-minded farm bill the House and Senate Conference Committee produced. The only things that have changed are the bill number and the title, all else remains the same. 
   This farm bill has enjoyed significant bipartisan support in both Chambers. This bill was a collaborative effort crafted by Members on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol and is historic in the amount and degree of reform that it contains. 
   We brought this bill a long way with a long list of reforms that lower cost to the taxpayer and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the programs, yet retains the fundamental purpose for having farm programs to begin with, guaranteeing a stable, reliable, and affordable food supply for the American consumer. 
   Unlike the last farm bill, which was signed into law by the President of the United States, this farm bill is less expensive and contains many of the reforms that the President requested. So I urge my colleagues to support the farm bill override and ensure that the very same farm bill that has garnered significant bipartisan support in this Congress already can finally become law in its entirety.

   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 5 1/2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, it's a sad day for American agriculture when the Democratic leadership pits America's farmers and ranchers against America's working class. The tax increases included in this bill stand to jeopardize millions of American jobs by raising taxes on companies that do business in the U.S. Not only does this provision cunningly added by the Democrat leadership after the bill left the control of the Agriculture Committee jeopardize American jobs, it stands to violate treaties with other nations and lead to significant ramifications for U.S. companies with operations in other countries. Worst of all, we're not even considering a tax bill; we're considering a farm bill, a farm bill that has been twisted into a partisan pawn. 
   At the beginning of the week, I stood beside the chairman of the Agriculture Committee to voice my support for this bill that we had worked in a bipartisan fashion to bring to the floor. I had only one caveat, that the offsets not be in the form of tax increases. Not 24 hours before we were to consider this bill on the floor, we were made aware of a tax increase provision that had been added to this language behind closed doors. Unfortunately, all of the good things contained in this bill have been overshadowed by very partisan elements of what should be a bipartisan bill. Today we should be debating the merits of this bill, a bill that was carefully crafted to meet the calls for reform and expand programs such as nutrition and fruits and vegetable programs. But the leadership has decided to take American agriculture out of the debate on the farm bill. 
   Heading into the reauthorization of the farm bill, Agriculture Committee Republicans anticipated problems with the budget, given the collapse of the baseline projections for the commodity programs. The lack of funding for the nutrition interests further compounded the problem. As the number of nonfarm interests in farm bill funding has grown and the availability of funding dwindled, farm programs have become particularly vulnerable, and the Democratic leadership and the Budget Committee refused to address the needs of a forward-looking farm bill. 
   From the start, the Agriculture Committee Republicans have made our concerns about funding for this bill very clear. When the chairman announced his projected farm bill time line on May 17, I urged him not to rush the process and find the offsets before promising the money in the farm bill language. Again and again, I, along with my subcommittee ranking members, have implored the committee to slow down, to wait until the money is available before moving ahead. 
   At the Conservation, Credit, Energy and Rural Development Subcommittee markup on May 22, both subcommittee ranking member FRANK LUCAS and I urged caution in rushing the process. 
   On May 24, at the Livestock, Dairy and Poultry markup, the message was the same. The subsequent markups on June 6, 7, 15 and 19, the message to the leadership of this committee was the same; slow down and find the money. We were consistently told the money would be made available, and we were consistently denied any further information. 
   It would be disingenuous for my Agriculture Committee Democrat colleagues to claim our objections are at all new or recently conceived. We have worked in a bipartisan fashion throughout this process and had the opportunity to take a bipartisan product of the committee to the floor. But our work has been undermined by the addition of tax increases without consultation, review or due process to cover the extra costs of the bill. 
   Despite repeated assurances that the $4 billion in offsets would not come from tax increases, here we are, looking at tax increases as a funding mechanism of choice employed by the Democratic leadership. 
   Moreover, to insinuate that Democrats were made to do anything by the Republicans' opposition to revisions that would directly impact U.S. jobs is preposterous. The Democrats and the Democrats alone are solely responsible for any modifications made to this bill after it left the Agriculture Committee. 
   Because the Democrat leadership won't invest in American agriculture, they're calling for increased taxes to pick up the tab to fund our domestic priorities by increasing taxes on companies that provide millions of Americans with good jobs and stimulate economic growth. 
   I anticipate this tax increase will likely be the first of many needed to fund the priorities that bulge between the majority's budgets.  
   Rural America is served best when we work together in a bipartisan fashion. With passage of this rule, partisanship invades rural America and destroys bipartisan support for the underlying legislation. 
   I want to be clear, I support the farm bill. I do not support the nonagriculture, non-Agriculture Committee approved tax increase that has been shamefully attached to this legislation. 
   Prior to the announcement of this tax increase, it was clear that the administration, which has opposed this bipartisan effort, it was clear that a veto threat was headed our way. 
   A bipartisan farm bill without this tax increase would have produced a veto-proof majority and would have sent this farm bill soaring into the negotiations with the Senate. Now this farm bill will not be an effective product to move American agriculture forward. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I would just say, Madam Chairman, that we reach this point in a process that has been going on for about 2 years. It spanned both my chairmanship and the current chairman's chairmanship. It has encompassed a great deal of effort to write a bipartisan farm bill. We have listened to hundreds of farmers. We have received input from thousands of farmers and ranchers and others interested in this legislation. 
   We address the reform that has been requested in a farm bill. We have addressed the concerns about more funding for fruits and vegetables for nutrition and conservation and renewable fuels. And then to have this tax increase injected into this process after the bill has left the committee is why you have heard every single Member on this side of the aisle speak about how they feel betrayed by this process. It is unfortunate for us, but it is also unfortunate for this farm bill because what happens when it leaves the House, if it passes at all, will be very different than if it passed leaving this House with a veto-proof majority. That opportunity has been lost. 
   I would say to those on the other side of the aisle we can fix that if we would simply slow down and take a look at the appropriate way to pay for the additional funding that is due this committee because we took a $60 billion cut in the budget. The way to do that is to vote for the motion to recommit that we will offer later on that will say you can have this farm bill that we have all praised and send it back to the committee to look for an appropriate way to do this without pitting American agriculture against American industry by having a tax increase imposed to pay for the things that are in this bill. 
   That's the appropriate way to proceed here. That would restore the bipartisanship that is needed in this process, and that would restore a good future for this farm bill, which is very much endangered because of the injection of this partisan tax increase that has been laid at our doorstep, the most bipartisan committee in the House of Representatives that has worked so hard and so long. And to be faced with this at the end is wrong. I do not support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day for this Congress. Farm bills are written in a bipartisan fashion. And I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from California and others, the gentleman from Vermont, about the hard work that the House Agriculture Committee put into creating a bipartisan farm bill. There is a lot to like in it; there are things to dislike in it. 
   But this rule turns that bipartisan process on its head. It has poisoned the well in terms of bringing this to fruition. It has made this farm bill, no matter its fate here today, unlikely to have any future beyond this House of Representatives because of the tax increase that has been placed in this legislation, because of the fact that Members who are accustomed to seeing an open rule when dealing with the farm bill. 
   Historically no one can recall a farm bill process as closed as this one, Members denied the opportunity to deal with provisions brought into this legislation like labor provisions and so on, not allowed to offer an amendment to take out Davis-Bacon provisions that have no business being in farm bill legislation. And it is, in my opinion, very disappointing. 
   Now, some have said that this is not a tax increase, this is closing tax loopholes. Businesses all across America are speaking up and pointing out that this is sweeping tax reform that has received no hearing. Here we are with an Agriculture Committee bill dealing with something that should have been dealt with in the Ways and Means Committee, but was simply handed out and said, here, take this. Take this tax increase as the pay-for for a substantial cut in agricultural programs that the Budget Committee did not address properly. 
   We have been trying for months to get fair treatment on the promise that we would be given an appropriate offset. We reported the bill out of the committee, and now we find what we are going to do is put American jobs up against American farmers. What kind of an outrage is that? 
   This rule should be voted down. It is totally unfair to American farmers and ranchers to see a good, bipartisan farm bill put at risk over a tax increase that will have a dramatic impact not only on the businesses that are subsidiaries of foreign-owned corporations providing millions of jobs here in the United States, but also on the trustworthiness of investment in the United States when we begin violating 58 different treaties that we have negotiated with other countries, and then, the ultimate, when those countries start retaliating against us, saying, if you violate a treaty, we certainly can, too, and affecting American investment abroad. 
   This is a very bad tax increase. It is a tax increase, not a ``closing the loophole.'' It is a very, very harmful one and should be the basis for Members to oppose this bill and bring the bill back appropriately.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my opposition to this rule. Apparently, the Speaker and the Chairwoman of the Rules Committee have decided to dispense with the annoying procedures of the committee process and serious floor debate. The rule before the House begins by limiting amendments to a select few, denying Members the right to offer amendments. In living memory, there has never been a rule this restrictive on a farm bill which is traditionally considered under an open rule. 
   As a result, the provision requiring Davis-Bacon wage rates on the new loan guarantee program for the next generation ethanol plants that would effectively eliminate the program in many rural States will go unchallenged. Also immune from floor action, is a provision that prohibits States from contracting private concerns to help deliver food stamps or upgrade their delivery systems to provide better service for recipients. The result is that State employee unions will be protected at the expense of State taxpayers and those who need the program. These are only examples of issue after issue that Members will be denied the right to address. 
   But then we come to the self-enacting portions of this rule. There is a 75-page amendment from the chairman of the Agriculture Committee that moves hundreds of millions of dollars around, cuts programs passed by the committee without consultation and adds new programs from other jurisdictions that spend huge sums of money. If you 
   vote for this rule, that becomes a part of the bill without amendment. 
   Another self-enacting provision sweeps in billions of dollars in offsets by raising fees and royalties on off-shore oil production. Yet another spends nearly $1 billion for a mandatory international feeding program. Finally, a more than $7 billion tax increase is automatically made a part of the bill. This tax increase comes to the floor as if by magic. ``It was not considered in ways & means where it would have been noted that the provision violates up to 50 Senate-ratified international tax treaties that are the basis of international tax treatment for all trade. 
   In fact, this tax increase idea has been bumping around for over a decade without receiving any appreciable support. Now the  Democrats are trying to attach this bad idea to a popular bill in an unamendable form. Members should be very careful not to rush to accept this rule. The fate of thousands of companies in our districts and more than 5 million U.S. workers will be jeopardized if we thoughtlessly support this rule. 
   I have worked on the Agriculture Committee since I first came to Congress and I have enjoyed being part of a committee that always prided itself on a bipartisan legislative process. In all those years, I have never witnessed or experienced a situation that discarded the committee product to this extent or that precluded the members of the committee and the general Membership of the House from legislating on major portions of the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule puts in jeopardy every Member's right to legislate and every Member's ability to rely on the careful deliberations of the committee process to produce fully vetted legislation for floor consideration. When that process is violated, we end up with a rule like this one that was cobbled together in the dead of night and contains tax increases that put at risk millions of American jobs. There is only one response possible to a rule like this and that is to join me in voting this rule down.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, I'll say one good thing about this amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin and the gentleman from Arizona: It doesn't raise taxes. But I'll say nothing else good about it because it rips the safety net out from under America's farmers and ranchers. 
   The House Agriculture Committee bill is the result of careful consideration. The committee reviewed many options and took the testimony of countless witnesses at hearings in Washington and in multiple States. The committee chose to maintain a safety net that has proven very effective since 2002, but it's done so with reform. 
   The committee included in the safety net the option for producers to choose a priority of the administration, a revenue-based, countercyclical program. 
   The committee also drastically modified rules related to payment limits and income levels for participation. No one with a 3-year average gross adjusted income over $1 million may participate in the commodity program. That is down from $2.5 million for producers with AGI between $500,000 and $1 million; 66 2/3 percent of their income must come from agriculture. These are major changes from the 2002 farm bill. 
   Additionally, the committee has done away with the three-entity rule. Now producers can receive payments on only one business entity. 
   The committee made significant reforms. By cutting $16 billion over 5  years, a 40 percent cut, this amendment shatters the farm safety net. This amendment cuts the safety net provided by direct payments by about $11 billion over 5 years, or 42 percent. 
   The amendment cuts the most basic level of support for farmers and ranchers, the marketing assistance loan, by $2 billion over 5 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   The committee was able to make significant increases in conservation, nutrition, rural development, research, fruits and vegetables, and in other areas without ripping out the safety net from America's farmers and ranchers, but the Kind-Flake-Ryan-Blumenauer amendment makes increases in those areas at the expense of American farmers. 
   The committee's commitment to conservation is unquestionable. The committee-passed bill increases conservation spending by over $4 billion over the next 5 years. We added over $1.9 billion to environmental quality incentive programs, which helps farmers and ranchers comply with State, Federal and local environmental laws. 
   We also continued our commitment to highly erodible land, wetlands, grasslands and wildlife habitat by funding the Conservation Reserve Program, the Wetland Reserve Program, the Grasslands Reserve Program, and the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program. 
   The committee increased the commitment to preserving working farms by increasing funding to the Farmland Ranchland Protection Program by almost 300 percent. 
   The committee also focused efforts to help producers such as specialty crop and livestock producers who do not participate in traditional commodity programs. 
   We took an unprecedented step of committing $150 million over the next 5 years to help clean up the rivers of the Chesapeake Bay. 
   We do not need this amendment. Oppose it.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Just to reiterate the point made by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, the Farm Credit System is a very important thing for rural America. It provides credit to America's farmers and ranchers and is a necessary and serious challenge to get that credit sometimes. There have been times when business has been bad in rural America, and the Farm Credit System has been there to stand up in good times and bad. 
   I appreciate the concerns raised by my friends in the banking community. We want to make sure that there is fair treatment, given that these are two different types of systems that operate, and we have listened to them very carefully. We have held hearings. And as the gentleman from Pennsylvania says, we worked very hard to come up with something we thought was fair. 
   We did basically three things: One related to housing, one related to lending in the energy area, and one dealing with cooperatives. All of these things are simply looking to modernize the Farm Credit System to deal with the fact that rural America and farming have changed substantially from the last time there was any major address of this issue back in the 1970s. 
   The rural population limit for home mortgages, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania pointed out, is 2,500 population. It has not been updated since 1971, and since then, over 700 communities have grown to the point where they are not considered rural under the farm credit definition, where you could get a farm credit loan in the past and now, because of the increased population, you can't. So people who have been doing business with farm credit sometimes for generations are no longer able to do that. The law does not change the limitation on moderately priced homes, owner-occupied, single-family homes. 
   We are simply trying to extend this to recognize that the population of the country is growing, and, therefore, there ought to be recognition of that. They asked for a very substantial increase, and we thought that was well beyond what was contemplated by being able to lend in rural areas. 
   Secondly, with regard to energy, there is no doubt that when times are good, there are financial resources available, credit from a wide array of sources. But as the ethanol boom started in this country, there was not money available from some sources; so farm credit stepped up to the plate. 
   In order for them to step up to the plate when the risk is higher, they need to be able to have a viable system throughout, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor James Madison University and ask my colleagues to support House Resolution 1051. I want to thank my colleague from North Carolina and my colleague from Maryland for managing this legislation on the floor, and the chairman and ranking member of the committee for their support of this resolution, which recognizes an outstanding institution of higher education which I am proud to represent in the Sixth Congressional District of Virginia. 
   This resolution celebrates James Madison University on the occasion of its 100th anniversary, which held a week-long celebration culminating with the centennial celebration on March 14, 2008. The entire JMU community celebrated with galas, portrait unveilings of JMU dignitaries, statue presentations, and a photograph of nearly 3,000 students, faculty, staff and alumni forming a ``human 100'' to celebrate the centennial. 
   James Madison University, located in my congressional district in Harrisonburg, Virginia, is surrounded by the beautiful Shenandoah Valley and has proved to be a catalyst in Western Virginia, building on the agricultural base of the region to create a center for higher education and innovation. 
   James Madison University has grown from its establishment as the Normal and Industrial School for Women in 1908 to its renaming to Madison College in 1938 and eventually to James Madison University, where it presently enrolls nearly 17,000 students and employs 3,000 full-time and part-time faculty and staff. 
   Since its establishment, James Madison University has been led by Presidents Julian Ashby Burress, Dr. Samuel Page Duke, the namesake of JMU's mascot, the ``Duke Dog,'' Dr. G. Tyler Miller, Dr. Ronald Carrier, and the current President, Dr. Linwood H. Rose. 
   In my service of representing the Sixth District of Virginia and JMU, it has been a true pleasure to work with former President Dr. Ron Carrier and current President Dr. Linwood Rose as they have skillfully guided James Madison University into the 21st century. 
   Madam Speaker, from its inception, James Madison University has been at the forefront of education. Originally a teachers college, today JMU provides groundbreaking research in information technology, security and alternative fuel sources, and offers more than 100 degree programs, including 68 undergraduate, 30 masters, two educational specialists and six doctor programs. In its 100 yearlings of existence, James Madison University has conferred more than 98,000 degrees. 
   Based on this outstanding curriculum, in 2007 U.S. News and World Report, for the 17th time, ranked JMU as the top public, masters-level university in the South, and JMU's graduation rate, 80 percent, was the highest among all public and private schools in the South. 
   Madam Speaker, James Madison University's alumni have impacted the Commonwealth of Virginia, the United States and the entire world. Madison graduates travel to the farthest corners of the Earth to perform groundbreaking research and provide leadership in corporate boardrooms, athletic fields, State legislatures, and even here on Capitol Hill. 
   I am pleased to have introduced this resolution, cosponsored by the entire Virginia delegation and more than 50 Members of Congress, that recognizes the rich history and accomplishments of this remarkable institution on the occasion of its 100th anniversary. 
   I urge all the Members of this body to join us in congratulating James Madison University on its 100th anniversary and to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   I rise in opposition to H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act. There is no doubt that citizens of the District of Columbia have no full voting representation in the House of Representatives. However, there are ways that these individuals can receive representation without trampling on the Constitution. Unfortunately, this bill is not one of them. 
   The Constitution does not mince words when it says that Members of Congress may only be elected from the States. Article I, section 2 states that the House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States. 
   The Constitution also does not mince words when it distinguishes the District of Columbia from a State. In describing the powers of the Congress, article I, section 8 describes the seat of Federal Government as a district, not exceeding 10 miles square, as made by cessation of particular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of government of the United States. 
   Furthermore, the text of the 23rd amendment to the Constitution further illustrates that the District was never meant to have the same rights as States. Specifically, it grants D.C. the power to appoint a number of electors of President and Vice President, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State. 
   We amended the United States Constitution for that purpose. If the advocates of this seek to do the same for representation in the House, they need to amend the United States Constitution. 
   The plain language of the Constitution is clear, that D.C. is not a State and that it is not granted the same rights as States. 
   However, the constitutional problems with this bill do not end here. The bill would also establish an at-large Representative for Utah, which would allow the citizens of Utah to vote twice, once for their Representative from their district, and once for another Representative at large. This would clearly violate the constitutional principle of one-man, one-vote by granting Utah citizens disproportionately large voting power. 
   Adding insult to injury, this new bill we have before us today does not include the language from the previous bill, H.R. 1433, to eliminate the position of D.C. Delegate. Under this new  bill, it appears that the District of Columbia would not only unconstitutionally be granted the same voting rights that State residents enjoy, but it would give D.C. greater representation than any State currently enjoys. The D.C. Delegate would continue to be eligible to vote in committee, and in the Committee of the Whole; and in addition, the new D.C. Representative would also be eligible to vote in committee and on the floor.     
   While every other district would get one vote in committee and on the floor, the District of Columbia would get two votes in committee and two votes on the floor under this new language. 
   Finally, the procedure for bringing this bill to the floor is, again, appalling. Debate has been blocked on a bill that affects the relative voting power of citizens in each of our congressional districts. The majority has once again denied us even the opportunity to discuss amendments, including an amendment by Ranking Member Smith to simply provide for an expedited judicial review of the bill after it is enacted in order to determine its constitutionality. 
   Furthermore, it is very telling and disappointing that the majority has decided that it would rather violate its own PAYGO rules than allow an open and fair discussion on the underlying bill. 
   For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this very poorly crafted legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The second amendment to the Constitution refers to the ``State.'' When the Constitution refers to the ``States,'' meaning today 50 States, then 13 States, it is referring to them in the plural. The ``State'' in the second amendment refers to the country collectively. 
   And to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for whom I have great respect but also great disagreement on this issue, I hope that given the fact that we do acknowledge a difference of opinion on what the Constitution says means that he will join with us in seeking for expedited judicial review if, as I hope is not the case, this should be passed and sent to the courts for their review.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes, and I would like to pose a couple of questions to the distinguished majority leader. 
   I have listened to his historical discourse. As the gentleman knows, Alexander Hamilton, one of our Founding Fathers, offered an amendment during the writing of our Constitution that would have provided voting rights to the citizens of the District of Columbia. It was defeated and not included in our Constitution. At that time, both portions of Maryland and portions of Virginia were included in a 100-square-mile area, and in 1846, the portion that had come from Virginia was ceded back to Virginia. 
   I wonder if the gentleman, having posed the question about the constitutional amendment, would respond to the question, if this is ruled unconstitutional, as many of us think it is, would the gentleman bring to the floor legislation that would do something similar for the portions of the District of Columbia, excepting key government buildings, so that the citizens would have the opportunity to vote with the citizens of his State, Maryland, for whom he can speak with some regard?

I take the gentleman's statement as his word that he is going to oppose it for valid reasons, but I frankly see no valid reasons why we should not have expedited review of this legislation.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time and simply say that I think this has been an excellent debate. I think there is good faith on both sides. But I do believe very, very strongly, as do I think many, many other people, that this is the wrong way to go about correcting the lack of a vote for residents of the District of Columbia, which the other side has clearly pointed out should be corrected. But there are correct ways to do it. An amendment to the United  States Constitution, what Virginia did with recession of the land to Maryland and allowing the citizens to vote in Maryland are both good solutions. 
   We should defeat this ill-conceived and unconstitutional legislation because the plain meaning of the Constitution, the words of the Constitution, cannot be altered by this House. And if we start doing that, we are indeed betraying our oaths. Defeat this legislation and do it right.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 264, which recognizes National Correctional Officers and Employees Week, and honors the service of correctional officers and employees. 
   Few jobs are more dangerous and difficult than serving as a correctional officer. There are over 200,000 correctional officers in the United States who guard us from nearly 2 million criminals and maintain the safety of the Nation's correctional facilities. It is a job with high risk and often little recognition or reward. This resolution recognizes the important role that correctional officers play in maintaining public safety. 
   Correctional officers carry a heavy burden each day. They are surrounded by dangerous criminals and work in a stressful environment. We hear about but don't often stop to recognize the hundreds of correctional officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Last year in Maryland, two correctional officers were killed. On January 27, 2006, Correctional Officer Jeffrey Alan Wroten II was brutally shot and killed; and on July 25, 2006, Officer David Warren McGuinn was killed. What happened to these two Maryland officers unfortunately has happened to hundreds of other correctional officers in past years. Correctional Officer Jeffrey Alan Wroten left behind a wife and five children, the oldest, age 15, and the youngest, 5 years of age. This makes his loss and the loss of others like him even more heartbreaking.  
   So, it is appropriate that we take a moment this week to honor the contribution of all correctional officers, pray for their continued safety and dedicate ourselves to helping them carry out their mission. 
   We thank each and every correctional officer, their families and loved ones, and honor them for their valuable role in protecting the public. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, our current tax system has spiraled out of control. Today's tax code is unfair, discourages savings and investment, and is impossibly complex. There is no part of the tax code that demonstrates this more than the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The AMT is a nefarious policy enacted to prevent a small number of wealthy taxpayers from using legitimate deductions to reduce their taxes, and thus taxing them at a higher rate. However, the AMT was never indexed to inflation, and without reform, it threatens to ensnarl middle class taxpayers. 
   When the AMT was first created, it affected fewer than 20,000 taxpayers. Today it affects 4.2 million, and this number could rise. Without action by Congress, 20 million more taxpayers would be forced to pay on average $3,000 more in taxes, this year alone. In my district this egregious tax would engulf more than 55,000 taxpayers. 
   Congress must find a permanent solution to this offensive tax; in fact, a solution is long overdue. However, what we are presented with today is not a permanent solution or even a solution. This ill-conceived legislation puts in place permanent tax increases, on some of the driving forces of our economy, to pay for a temporary patch to the AMT. 
   It is wrong for AMT relief to be subject to Pay-Go rules. The AMT was never intended to affect this many people and is working as a massive tax increase each year. The $50.6 billion that could be paid, without relief, because of the ever encroaching AMT was never intended to be collected. Yet, this bill seeks to collect this $50.6 billion in new taxes, and it collects it by raising taxes on investors in our economy. For Democrats the AMT simply serves their purpose of bait and switch on the American taxpayer. 
   The permanent tax increases in this bill include job-killing tax hikes on entrepreneurs and risk-takers who invest and create jobs for working families. While these tax increases were written in a way to seemingly affect only wealthy hedge fund executives, much like the ill-conceived AMT, these tax increases would reach much further. The taxes would affect real estate, venture capital, private equity, and retail. Penalizing these industries with higher taxes will dampen investment, constrict money needed for small-business ventures, and cost American jobs. While these taxes are egregious on their own, they are even more egregious in that they would be permanent while the relief they provide is temporary.  
   It was a mistake on the part of Congress to not index the original AMT to inflation. It is a mistake that Congress must fix in order to prevent the AMT from engulfing millions of more taxpayers. We must work to find a permanent solution to this nefarious tax. I urge my colleagues to reject this ill-conceived plan, and let's work together to find a real solution for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3058, the Public Land Communities Transition Act of 2008. Mr. Speaker, this bill had the opportunity to provide rural schools with  the much-needed funding that allows them to keep their doors open and serve sparsely-populated areas. Unfortunately, the majority decided to offset this bill with provisions that will increase the cost of gas to the American public. Already paying $4 a gallon at the pumps, Americans should not be forced to bear further increases, especially those living in rural areas that, on average, already drive greater distances. 
   The fee increases on oil and gas leases would place further confines on domestic energy production at a time when we need to be expanding production and building our Nation's energy independence. 
   This provision was included in the farm bill that was brought to the House floor a year ago, and was one of several tax increasing provisions that drew criticism from House Members, as well as the Senate and the White House. It would be disingenuous to sing praises of this bill when the cost of providing support to rural schools would be borne by the very rural constituents we are trying to help. 
   There is a proposed compromise that was introduced in the 109th Congress and enjoyed broad bipartisan support. It would solve the problems created by the oil and gas lease provisions in H.R. 3058 by increasing domestic energy exploration and production, thereby helping to reduce the gas prices for the American consumer. At the same time, this alternative would provide the necessary funding for rural school districts. That alternative would be something I could stand behind but, unfortunately, that is not the bill we are considering today. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' I urge them to vote against the policy that will raise gas prices for Americans when they have the opportunity to do it right and create increased domestic energy production and solve this problem for our rural schools.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment streamlines and adopts one set of terms and conditions for easements for the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Grasslands Reserve Program, the Farmland and Ranchland Protection Program, and the Healthy Forest Reserve Program. This greatly simplifies the process for the Department to purchase easements, while leaving functions of the programs intact. It allows for one set of rules on titleholders, establishment of easements, type of deeds, acceptance of contributions, title transfer and reversionary interest. 
   This amendment not only helps the Department to reduce inefficiencies which result in administrative costs, but will help producers by simplifying the process of obtaining easements for these programs. 
   This amendment does not consolidate any program. This simply sets up one set of rules and regulations for easements. Each program has its own application process, sign-up period, and administrative requirements. Countless hours are wasted on administrative work because each easement has its own set of rules. 
   This amendment makes an effort at streamlining these complex rules and regulations into one set of rules with flexibility that is simple and makes common sense. 
   Each of these individual programs retains their own mission. These easement programs are implemented through landowners who voluntarily agree to a deed restriction and some landscape and resource restoration. Making the sign-up process for producers easier will allow NRCS to focus on their true mission, which should be to provide technical assistance to producers wanting to implement voluntary conservation methods. 
   We have taken popular components of the Farmland and Ranchland Protection Program, including the ability of third-party entities to hold easements, and implemented them in a manner that all producers interested in easements will be able to enjoy. 
   This amendment keeps the funding and missions of each easement program intact. The amendment even keeps the appraisal method of each program intact. 
   This is a commonsense amendment, a good government amendment, and a producer-friendly amendment. And I ask for your support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the chairman for his comments. He and I have had discussions about this, and I think we are in agreement that there needs to be significant reform of these programs. 
   As I've shared with the gentleman and others, there are farmers in my district and elsewhere around the country who are very frustrated with signing up for these programs. And, quite frankly, it is counterproductive to have programs that are so complex, that require so much paperwork, that require you to apply in several different places. One farmer, a woman in my district, has done a fantastic job of attempting to utilize these programs, but the frustration, the cost, the amount of time involved discouraged her, as it has discouraged others from even initiating the process to participate. And therefore, I think it's in the interest of the stakeholders, the groups who want to see more of these easements taken up, to make it an easier process. And that includes not only streamlining the definition of easements in this amendment, but looking  at whether some of these programs can be made to work together better. 
   I appreciate the gentleman's seriousness about undertaking this. 
   I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.

And we really do need to make sure that this function of the Department is operating in the fashion that it was operating when it was under the control of the Department of Agriculture, that we're not losing people with the kind of expertise that's necessary to be able to detect and keep these pests out of the country. And I hope that this dialogue will lead to an effort to enhance that effort.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I join him in opposition to this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentleman from Illinois' concerns, but with regard to the conservation programs, we have a finite amount of money. The commodity programs work under a baseline that assumes market conditions. 
   The money rises and falls, and every farmer who meets those conditions can qualify for them. But with the conservation programs, there is a finite amount of money. Without the payment limitations, many farmers will not receive any help whatsoever in complying with different environmental regulations unless we have these payment limitations, which allows the payment to be spread across a wider area. This is a new reform-minded payment limitation. While some may think it's too stringent, payment limitations need to be applied uniformly across both title I and title II. 
   Easement programs such as the wetlands reserve are exempted from this so we can protect some of the most environmentally sensitive land through easements. But the committee must be consistent in our views of all payments to producers, not just commodity payments. 
   I join the gentleman in reluctantly opposing the gentleman from Illinois' amendment.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the Speaker for coming down to the floor and discussing the bipartisan nature of the farm bill that was produced by the House Committee on Agriculture. It was, indeed, a bipartisan product. There are things in the bill that I don't like, things in the bill that I do like, things in the bill the chairman does not like, things in the bill that he does like. But it was a bipartisan product. But it was written under very difficult circumstances, which we identified at the outset, because of the fact that there is a $60 billion cut in the baseline for the commodity program, a 58 percent cut. That meant we needed to have money to accomplish the goals that the Speaker outlined for reform, some of which I share with the Speaker for increased payments for conservation, for nutrition, for fruits and vegetables, for renewable energy. So we went to the Budget Committee in a bipartisan fashion and pointed out that you couldn't have a $60 billion cut, achieve these new reforms, which all entail new spending, without having the ability to also have some additional resources. Well, the Budget Committee ignored that request and instead gave us a reserved fund. And their budget is papered over with reserve funds; no money in them, no way for the Agriculture Committee to find new funds without going outside of the committee. 
   We were assured inside the committee repeatedly that there would not be a tax increase. But nonetheless, in the closing hours of this debate, a tax increase, indeed, was what was put forth outside of this committee, without hearings in the Ways and Means Committee, without a markup in the Ways and Means Committee, without any input from this side of the aisle. And that is what caused the loss of the bipartisanship coming to the floor, because this is precedent setting. This is the first of many of these reserve funds that we're going to have to deal with, and it is readily apparent what the purpose is: to raise taxes in order to accomplish something that should have been paid for in a budget that had funds available, 9 percent increase in appropriations. It should have been made available to us so we could write a bipartisan farm bill all the way through this House going to the floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, the committee bill makes significant reforms to the Crop Insurance Program. The bill reduced the statutory loss ratio to an actuarially sound 1.0. By doing this, we were able to include a provision by Mr. Neugebauer that makes additional crop insurance available, which has to be paid for, which will lessen need for disaster assistance. 
   Mr. Neugebauer's provision is similar in many respects to the administration's crop insurance plan. The committee bill increases premiums for the catastrophic level of coverage. 
   We authorize the USDA to renegotiate the standard reinsurance agreement every 5 years. The committee bill specifically authorizes data mining to ensure compliance with rules of the program. The committee bill also reduces the reimbursement rate by 2 percentage points. These are significant changes that make the program more actuarially sound and make the program more responsible with taxpayer dollars. 
   Additionally, the committee-passed bill authorized an additional 1 million acres in the GRP land to protect sensitive grasslands in this country. While we all would like more money for many programs, this is a carefully balanced approach. I think we have done a good job of balancing the needs of both commodity producers and those that would like to preserve native grasslands. 
   I strongly oppose this amendment.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Reclaiming my time, this motion to recommit is very straightforward. It takes out the tax increases in this bill, sends it back to the Agriculture Committee. And we would be delighted to work with the leadership that did not work with us before to find a pay-for that works for this. 
   We went to the Budget Committee at the start of this process in a bipartisan fashion and pointed out that the reforms in this bill cost money, and asked for that money to be forthcoming. It was not. 
   Now, based upon previous experience, I would not be at all surprised to see a cameo appearance in a moment from the majority leader saying that, because this bill is sent back to committee to report back promptly, that we're killing the bill. We are doing no such time thing. We are doing what is necessary to make sure that this bill is treated in a bipartisan fashion and that the bill is paid for in a way that adjusts our budget fairly to make sure that agriculture and America's farmers and rangers got treated the way they should have been treated at the outset of this process when $60 billion was lost because of the baseline in agriculture. 
   And then we're asked to make reforms, many of which I support, but this, mark my words, is a tax increase that is not fair to the American people. It puts pressure on companies investing in this country. It will increase taxes on those workers. It will also call into question the credibility of the United States for future investment in this country if we violate treaties, 58 treaties that we have negotiated. And finally, it will cause retaliation against American investment overseas as well. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion to recommit. Send it back. Do the right thing. Do not put America's workers against America's farmers and ranchers. Support this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, in my time remaining, I would point out that this is a tax increase because the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, when he came to the floor last night, said it was a tax increase. The tax experts I've spoken to say it's a tax increase. Not withstanding what anybody says, it's a tax increase. Don't support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the nonbinding resolution being offered by the majority which, despite the rhetoric, amounts to nothing more than a vote to maintain the status quo in Iraq. 
   This resolution offers no change from the recent course of events in Iraq. It does not take into consideration the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. It does not require the Iraqi people and their elected leaders to step up and take responsibility for their own future. It certainly does not set any benchmark that must be met by the Iraqis. Most importantly, passage of this nonbinding resolution does not protect the funding of our troops in Iraq and, according to many Democrats, it is likely the first step in cutting off that funding altogether. 
   Madam Speaker, we have spent 3 days debating a resolution that does nothing more than serve as a vote of no confidence in the brave men and women who are fighting for freedom and democracy in Iraq. Not only is this resolution discouraging to our commanders and forces, it will fuel the efforts of our enemies who are determined to spread terror and suppress freedom. 
   Despite numerous attacks by terrorists on U.S. military and diplomatic targets throughout the 1990s, Americans on September 11, 2001 awoke to the painful realization that we are engaged in a long-term global war with terrorists, an international campaign to combat an ideology that spreads hate and destruction. 
   Iraq is now the central front in this global war. Success in bringing about a stable and democratic Iraq in the heart of the Middle East is a goal that I believe we all share. 
   While the difficulties cannot be minimized, neither can the consequences of failure and withdrawal. If we fail, the resources now devoted by terrorist organizations and nations sponsoring terrorism in Iraq will be turned to spreading terror around the globe including, again, on American soil. Do not embolden them with this resolution. 
   The United States and our allies, in fact, all freedom-loving peoples, need to support the popularly elected Iraqi Government in establishing control over their country and providing a stable environment for the Iraqi people and our troops as they assist in this process. Together, we have made significant progress, despite numerous obstacles. 
   Iraqis made history when they turned out in record numbers, despite increased violence, to vote in the first free elections in over 50 years. Millions of Iraqis waved their purple-tipped fingers with pride as they came out of the voting stations, a message to the world that they chose freedom. 
   The President is the Commander in Chief and has the authority to make decisions about the best way to accomplish our goals in Iraq. He has initiated changes to our course in Iraq. 
   However, today we will not be voting for change. We will not be voting for a comprehensive review of our strategy in Iraq. It is too bad that when we all have concerns about how best to achieve success in Iraq, the Democratic leadership has brought this polarizing and political resolution to the floor to divide us, rather than unite us, on the most serious question facing the country today. 
   For this reason, I urge my colleagues to vote against this nonbinding resolution, which lacks any substance. I remind my colleagues that a ``no'' vote on this resolution is certainly not a rubber stamp for the President's troop surge. 
   While I continue to support the mission in Iraq, I think it is clear that the administration's efforts to achieve the mission have not been flawless. But a vote against this resolution is a clear vote to support our commanders and troops and all those who have lost their lives spreading freedom to the people of Iraq. 
   I believe that more should be done to press the now established Iraqi Government and U.S.-trained Iraqi military to take the lead. I believe more can be done on the diplomatic front to engage the countries of the Middle East to help. 
   But unfortunately, no such resolution offering concrete evidence has been allowed, and this hollow process has resulted in a hollow resolution. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, the deplorable situation in Darfur has united the world in outrage over the atrocities being committed there. Through the efforts of motivated individuals and advocacy groups, the situation in Darfur has been brought to the forefront of public consciousness. 
   These people have worked tirelessly in raising awareness about the situation in Darfur and calling for an end to the genocide. Around the country, throughout Virginia and across the 6th District of Virginia, I have seen first hand the dedication and commitment of these individuals in calling on leaders, from around the world, to speak out against the horrendous events in Darfur. In fact, it was often their humanitarianism and commitment to peace in Darfur that encouraged nations to speak out against what was happening in Sudan and take action. 
   It is no surprise to me that the citizens of the United States have taken such an active role in condemning the actions taking place in Sudan. After all as a Nation dedicated to freedom and the rights of the individual, the United States and its citizens have a responsibility to speak out when those rights are violated, whether at home or abroad. The work of these groups is a true testament to the values of our country. 
   The goodwill of these individuals and groups in raising global awareness is instrumental in helping to end the genocide in Darfur. I am glad that we in Congress have risen today to commend these groups and thank them for their service. We thank all the various local schools, communities, faith-based, human rights, humanitarian, and youth-led advocacy organizations that have dedicated their time and energy to help end the genocide in Darfur, to promote peace there, and to defend human rights. We must continue to work together and do more to bring an end to the genocide in Darfur.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I had the opportunity to travel as part of a bipartisan Congressional Delegation to the war-torn nation of Sudan and see first-hand one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent times. 
   The entire world is currently watching in horror the atrocities being committed in Darfur. Many people have been called to action to try to stop this genocide. This includes hordes of humanitarian workers and peacekeeping forces. The most prominent peacekeeping mission in Sudan has been the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), which is carried out by African Union (AU) forces. 
   Since July of 2004, AU forces have been on the ground in Sudan working as peacekeepers. Sadly, their peacekeeping mission has made these AU personnel targets for attack by rebel forces. The worst of these attacks occurred in Haskanita, Darfur, Sudan, on September 29, 2007. This attack on the AU base left 10 brutally murdered and 50 soldiers missing. In the aftermath of the attacks Haskanita has been burned to the ground, displacing 15,000 citizens. This horrendous situation is made only worse by the government of Sudan's silence in not speaking out and condemning these attacks. 
   There is no doubt that this was an atrocious attack, and today we in Congress join together to condemn all these attacks. These attacks show just how horrid the situation in Darfur is, when those trying to bring peace and stability are themselves victims of violence. We in Congress express our deepest sympathy to the families of individuals killed or missing in these cowardly attacks. 
   It is my deepest hope that the Darfur peace negotiations currently underway in Libya bring about a meaningful and lasting peace agreement for Darfur. The United States and the international community must work together to stabilize the situation in Darfur and prevent further genocide. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to bring an end to this international crisis.

It is reported today that gasoline prices reached a new all time high of $112 a barrel. Yet, we have let another week here pass without doing anything to confront this challenge. 
   Not a week goes by when I am not asked about rising energy prices. These increased costs affect everyone in our society. But none are more affected by these increased costs than some of our nation's most poor. On average, the nation's working poor spends approximately 13 to 30 percent of their yearly income on energy costs, and as prices rise so will the amount of their income spent on energy. 
   A large number of factors combine to put pressure on energy and gasoline prices, including peaked U.S. oil production, increased world demand for crude oil, and U.S. refinery capacity that is inadequate to supply gasoline to a recovering national economy. These are serious problems that will not go away with time, and they require real solutions that will restore American energy independence and help ease the pain of record price fill-ups. However, the majority in Congress has failed to do anything that would address any of these factors contributing to high prices. 
   When many are citing U.S. production numbers and refinery capacity as a reason for increased gas prices, the Majority has proposed additional taxes on these domestic energy suppliers. We have voted on several bills that would impose up to $15 billion in tax increases on domestic energy suppliers. These taxes will impede domestic oil and gas production, discourage investment in refinery capacity, and make it more expensive for domestic energy companies to operate in America than their foreign competitors, actually increasing America's dependence on foreign oil. 
   Let's make no mistake, an increased tax doesn't just hurt energy companies, it hurts every American--individual, farm, or company--that consumes energy. Increased taxes on energy companies are passed on to consumers. Every American will see these increased costs on their energy bill. This body shouldn't pass legislation that further raises energy prices for consumers. I have voted against these attempts to raise taxes, and luckily none of these bills have become law. 
   Unfortunately, too often in the 110th Congress, the majority's solution has been to place restrictions on the marketplace. Policies that increase supply, not those that place restrictions on the marketplace, are the solutions to today's energy concerns. For example the dramatic expansion of the Renewable Fuels Standard to require 36 billion is an artificially created government mandate. While I am supportive of renewable energy, we should develop a policy that is technology neutral and allows the market to develop new sources of renewable energy. The RFS provisions create an unrealistic mandate for advanced biofuels technology that doesn't yet exist and creates hurdles for the development of second generation biofuels. These restrictions will undoubtedly lead to a consumer tax to help bridge the gap in production. 
   However, there are many things we could actually do here in Congress that would help ease the prices at the pump. Many Americans don't know that the U.S. is the world's largest energy producer. Over the past 25 years we have pumped 67 billion barrels of oil, and strong reserves remain. The fact is the energy sources are there--in Alaska, the Rockies, and offshore--but political roadblocks keep it in the ground instead of in use in the economy. 
   We should also be focusing on the development of clean Coal-to-Liquid technologies. This is one of the most promising advancements in coal research and produces liquid transportation fuels synthesized from coal. Even using conservative estimates, our country has enough coal to last over 200 years. Coal is one of our nation's most abundant resources, yet the development of Coal-to-Liquid technologies has been completely ignored by this Congress. Producing liquid transportation fuels from coal will be a major catalyst in helping our country become energy independent. 
   Energy costs are affecting the daily life of all of our constituents. We must change the direction this Congress has been headed in addressing this issue. We must reject the politics that put restrictions on the marketplace and keep energy in the ground instead of in our gas tanks. Instead, we must develop a long-term strategy that allows us to access our traditional energy sources, while developing alternative and renewable energy sources that seek to increase energy supplies and encourage cleaner, more efficient energy use.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this irresponsible rule. The Colombia trade agreement was negotiated under trade promotion authority, which clearly specifies that once transmitted to Congress this body must take up the agreement within 90 days. The Government of Colombia negotiated this agreement with us in good faith, that we would keep our word. Unfortunately the majority now wants to change the rules of the game. This is damaging to our relationship with Colombia and damages our reputation in the world. It shows the world that Congress does not keep its word, and this will make any other country reluctant to enter into agreements with our nation. This is simply bad foreign policy. 
   I believe in the benefits of free and fair trade. I support efforts to remove tariffs and barriers to trade whenever possible and feel that such efforts will lead to increased economic growth for the nation as a whole. With tens of thousands of jobs in my congressional district being tied to trade, the expansion of trade means a healthy future for a number of local businesses, and in turn new jobs for my district, and the Nation. 
   However, I believe that all trade must be fair trade. The Colombian agreement would be fair trade. Already, the vast majority of Colombian products pay zero tariffs to enter the U.S. market. In fact 365 members of this House, many of whom now stand opposed to this fair trade bill, voted to allow Colombia this open access to our markets. It is not defensible to keep U.S. producers from the same access to Colombia, that Colombia already has to our market. Since 1991, U.S. workers and businesses have paid over a billion dollars in tariffs to sell their wares in the Colombian market. Every day we delay enactment of the Colombia FTA we hurt U.S. workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs who will benefit from opening the Colombian market. 
   It is disappointing that the Democratic majority has not embraced this trade agreement, as it would mean new jobs for citizens across the nation. New jobs that are very much needed in our tightening economy. Mr. Speaker, I remain committed to the benefits of free and fair trade. I urge my colleagues to reject this rule which would be detrimental to our relationship with Colombia and is more importantly reckless foreign policy.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (MOVE FORWARD ON THE ECONOMIC AND ENERGY CRISES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, last night the Democratic leadership announced under considerable pressure that the continuing resolution to keep our government operating will not include an extension of the moratorium on drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, the moratorium on drilling in Alaska, the moratorium on extracting oil from the oil shale in the Rocky Mountain States. That's good news. That's a step in the right direction, but it's only the first step. 
   The American people at this time, as the Congress addresses concerns about the financial crisis facing the country, need to know that the Congress is also going to stop the hemorrhage of money out of this country, at the rate of $700 billion a year, buying foreign oil. We need to have the American Energy Act that the Republican leadership and the vast majority of Republican Members have offered, the all-of-the-above energy act, energy that will increase drilling on our Outer Continental Shelf in Alaska and in the Rocky Mountain States, increase natural gas production, clean-burning coal, nuclear power, and alternative forms of energy like solar, wind, hydrogen, geothermal, and biomass. 
   We need all of the above, and we need it now before we go home.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (TREATMENT OF FARMS WITH LIMITED BASE ACRES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I support H.R. 6849 which voids the payment prohibition to farmers who have fewer than 10 acres of working farmland for the 2008 and 2009 crop years.     
   This measure protects farmers who would be denied benefits because it addresses a specific provision in the farm bill that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has misinterpreted. The intent of that original provision was to stop gardeners in New York City from getting program payments. It was never intended to prevent bonafide farmers from participating in commodity programs. 
   The farm bill provision and the accompanying report encourage the Secretary of Agriculture to allow farmers to aggregate base acres from multiple working farms to qualify for those program benefits. 
   However, the USDA has decided to interpret the language of that provision differently and prohibit aggregation. It is unfortunate that we are forced to pass further legislation to make sure this intent cannot be misconstrued. However, if we do not take action, the result will be damaging to thousands of farmers who depend on program payments. 
   I believe it is necessary that we pass this bill in order to protect those thousands of farmers who are being adversely affected by the USDA's interpretation of a specific provision in the farm bill. This is a growing concern throughout the country. Specifically, in my State of Virginia, the Virginia Farm Bureau contacted me directly because it was worried about the negative impact this interpretation would have on the livelihood of its producers. 
   I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota for yielding and for her leadership in bringing forth this amendment, which corrects a grievous problem with our immigration system. 
   This visa lottery program is clearly unfair to lawful immigrant applicants who are abiding by our rules and going through the process. It pushes 50,000 people chosen totally at random ahead of hundreds of thousands of law-abiding immigrants waiting to be reunified with their families. 
   The program is wrought with fraud. The State Department inspector general has said that the visa lottery program is subject to widespread abuse, and that identity fraud is endemic, and fraudulent documents are commonplace. 
   A simple click on the State Department's visa lottery Web site is very revealing. The first thing you will notice on that Web site is a warning in bold red font about fraudulent websites and individuals. Indeed, a cottage industry has sprung up of individuals using the visa lottery program to take advantage of foreign nationals. 
   No skills are necessary to enter the lottery. As we look around the country for programs that help meet needs of reunifying families or job skills for which there is a shortage in the United States, we have a program that gives 50,000 visas based on pure luck, and the applicants must only have the equivalent of a high school diploma. But the State Department has indicated they often have very few resources to make even this determination in countries that do not have systems similar to the United States. 
   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is a national security threat. This program of selection purely at random makes it possible for visa lottery participants to be people who are from countries that are known to be state sponsors of terror. Nothing would prevent terrorist organizations from submitting numerous names for the lottery, and, as long as they don't have criminal backgrounds, they can receive not just a temporary visa like the 9/11 hijackers had, but a permanent-resident visa to be permanently in the United States. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1199, the Drug Endangered Children Act of 2007, and commend my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Scott) for his leadership on this issue. 
   This legislation extends the existing authorization for grants to State and local governments and Indian tribes to protect and help drug-endangered children. It is a sad consequence of our Nation's drug problem that drug traffickers have such a devastating impact on innocent children who live and play  in areas used to facilitate the production and distribution of illegal drugs. 
   We owe it to our Nation's children to do all that we can to protect them and provide them the services needed to allow them to grow and develop in a healthy and loving home. 
   It is often said that you can judge the health of a society by the way in which it treats the innocent and vulnerable, our children. Too often we hear from law enforcement about children being used or abused by drug traffickers. The consequences to our children are devastating. We must do whatever we can to protect our children from the evils of drug dealing and provide them with a safe environment in which to live. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume and rise in support of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us represents the efforts of several constituent organizations working with the administration and the Congress to reach consensus. 
   Among the organizations who worked to produce this proposal were the Natural Resources Defense Council, Crop Life America and the Consumer Specialty Products Association. I appreciate their hard work and their willingness to set aside past differences to develop a fair and balanced funding mechanism for the EPA pesticide registration program that satisfies the needs of government, industry and the environment. 
   As Chairman Cardoza pointed out, this legislation renews the successful program established in 2004 to fund the pesticide registration program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
   The original legislation had many successes including providing stable funding for the EPA, predictable timelines for industry, new products for consumers, and the necessary funding for the EPA to complete the tolerance reassessment process mandated by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. While the 2004 legislation doesn't expire until next year, the realities of Federal budgetary pressure and the resulting uncertainty regarding the adequacy of appropriations make immediate action on this reauthorization legislation critical.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (WOODROW WILSON PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois and the gentlewoman from Illinois for their assistance with this legislation, as well as Mr. Waxman, the chairman of the Government Reform Committee, and my colleague from Virginia, Congressman Tom Davis, all of whom have been a great help in moving this legislation forward. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1664, the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library Authorization Act, which will authorize grants from the National Archives for the establishment of a Presidential library to provide educational and interpretive service to honor the life of Woodrow Wilson. 
   As a statesman, scholar and President, Woodrow Wilson faced economic crisis, democratic decay and a world war. Presidential historians agree that World War I and President Wilson's leadership radically altered the role of diplomacy as a tool of foreign policy, a policy that established a new path for America's role in promoting democracies throughout the world. So, too, did Wilson's high-minded ideals craft a legacy that shaped the powers and responsibilities of the executive branch in times of war. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a professor and president of Princeton University, Wilson created a more selective and accountable system for higher education. By instituting curriculum reform, Wilson revolutionized the roles of teachers and students and quickly made Princeton one of the most renowned universities in the world. Due to Wilson's legacy at Princeton, I am pleased to have the support of current Princeton President Shirley Tilghman as we establish this library. 
   H.R. 1664 gives the National Archives the authority to make pass-through grants for the establishment of the Presidential library in Stanton, Virginia, Woodrow Wilson's birthplace, and does not create a new program. In addition, to ensure that this is a public-private partnership, this legislation mandates that no grant shall be available for the establishment of this library until a private entity has raised at least twice the amount to be allocated by the Archives. Quite frankly, more Federal public-private programs should operate in this manner. 
   Finally, and to ensure that the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library is not part of the Presidential Library System, this legislation states that the Federal Government shall have no role or responsibility for the operation of the library. 
   I am also pleased to have the support of several other presidential sites throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia, known as the birthplace of Presidents, including Monticello, Poplar Forest, Montpelier, Ash Lawn, and Mount Vernon. 
   Mr. Speaker, in order to increase the awareness and understanding of the life, principles and accomplishments of the 28th President of the United States, I ask that you join me in supporting this legislation. I want to thank House leadership for scheduling this bill today. The cosponsors include the entire Virginia delegation. I am also grateful to the staff of the Government Reform Committee and the Office of Legislative Counsel for their assistance in crafting this bill. 
   As a reminder to my colleagues, this legislation is identical to a bill the House passed by a voice vote in the 109th Congress but was not considered in the Senate. At this time, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 668, commemorating the Little Rock Nine, the African American students who enrolled in Little Rock Central High School in 1957 and were initially prevented from entering that segregated school. I want to commend Chairman Conyers for  bringing this legislation forward and our ranking member, Congressman Smith, for his support of it as well. 
   President Dwight Eisenhower, following the landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, sent Federal troops to enforce integration and protect the Little Rock Nine. On September 24, 1957, the President ordered the Army to Little Rock, and the nine students entered the school the next day. Thereafter, each of the students was given an individual escort inside Central High School to prevent them from harassment by other students. 
   It was surely a sad day when the Federal Government had to use the most powerful military in the world to integrate one high school in Little Rock, Arkansas. But it was also a proud day as well, as it demonstrated how our Constitution and each branch of government had, since the Civil War, finally had been honed and fitted to fulfill the promise of racial equality in America. 
   Chairman Conyers has already listed the Little Rock Nine, but the efforts of which they themselves and their families must be most proud are deserving of mentioning them again: Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals. With each step they took through the schoolhouse doors, they paved a path forward for countless other African Americans. And when the school bell rang that day, it marked not only the start of the school day; it rang for liberty and equality as well. 
   The Little Rock Nine were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal on November 9, 1999. This resolution renews our commemoration of their courageous actions of the 50th anniversary of their historic first steps into history. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOODLATTE. (RECOGNIZING ESTABLISHMENT OF HUNTERS FOR THE HUNGRY PROGRAMS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of H. Res. 79 and applaud this body for recognizing the collaborative efforts of hunters, sportsmen's associations, meat processors, State meat inspectors and hunger relief associations to establish Hunters for the Hungry programs across the U.S. 
   When a hunter donates a deer, it is processed by professional meat cutters at inspected facilities. The meat is then packaged, frozen and distributed to food banks, soup kitchens, church food pantries, the Salvation Army and other nonprofit organizations serving the States' hungry. Funds are raised to cover the cost of processing, distribution and the overhead expenses of operation so that the meat can be provided to these agencies at no cost. Through the program, food banks and soup kitchens are provided with a low-fat, high-protein meat that may not otherwise be available. 
   In my own State of Virginia, the Virginia Hunters for the Hungry program has distributed over 2.3 million pounds of venison since its establishment in 1991. In the first year, roughly 33,000 pounds of venison was donated, processed and distributed through the program. Now, the average exceeds 300,000 pounds a year, and this program is a reflection of the generosity of the American spirit. 
   I commend the generosity of Virginia hunters and all who participate in the Hunters for the Hungry program, whose contributions are a step in the right direction in the fight against hunger. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say on a personal note that I have had the pleasure of supporting this organization for several years now, and just recently, a few weeks ago, attended a Hunters for the Hungry banquet, at which the spirit of not just hunters but people who are generous and want to take care of the needs of those who can use additional sustenance and I think in a very efficient way have participated in this program and showed that generosity once more. 
   So I commend all those, not just in Virginia but across the country, who participate in this, and I particularly commend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) who has fostered this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
