<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Madam Chairman, today there are powerful forces in America that want to take us backward, not forward. In the name of global competition, there are some who say that in order to be competitive in the world market that we must give away our standard of living and our high working standards. To those people, I say ``no.'' 
   We have to ask ourselves, as a nation and as a people, what kind of nation do we want to be? Are we really free and successful, if too many of our citizens are harassed and intimidated on the job when they are trying to form a union to protect their rights? 
   People living in a democracy should not have to work in an atmosphere of fear and oppression. And they should be able to exercise their rights to organize. There are many corporations in Atlanta, like UPS, Coke and others, that are profitable international institutions who do not sacrifice the dignity and the integrity of their employees. 
   We have to ask ourselves whether we can be truly comfortable, if somewhere in America somebody is working hard, struggling to make ends meet, but they fear the retaliation of their employer if they try to protect their dignity and worth on the job? How long can we live in comfort before this injustice comes knocking at our door? 
   I have always been a strong supporter of labor and working Americans, and why I am an original co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act. It is our duty as members of Congress to protect our workers and to encourage citizens and corporate citizens to implement these values of respect in our society. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS OF Georgia. (EMMETT TILL UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIME ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS OF Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, (Mr. Conyers) for those kind words. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act is being considered today before the full House of Representatives. 
   I would like to thank the lead cosponsor of this bill, my good friend, Representative Kenny Hulshof from Missouri, and my good friends in the United States Senate, Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, and Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont for their distinguished support in this effort. 
   Again, I must thank Chairman Conyers for all of his help and for all of his support in bringing this bill before us today. Also, Subcommittee Chairs Scott and Nadler for coordinating a powerful hearing on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the time has come for the sake of history, for the sake of justice, for the sake of closure, the 110th Congress must pass this legislation. 
   On August 28, 1955, almost 52 years ago, a 14-year-old boy from Chicago, a young African American boy, was visiting his uncle in Money, Mississippi. He was pulled from his bed in the darkness of night. He was beaten until he could hardly be recognized. He was shot in the head, and his body was dumped in the Tallahatchie River, all because somebody said he had been fresh with a white woman. 
   Several years later, an intelligent and dignified NACP leader named Medgar Evers was gunned down in front of his home in Mississippi in June of 1963. Some historians said it was the injustice of these unsolved two murders that began the mass movement in the American South that we call the modern-day civil rights movement. 
   Who can forget the NAACP leader and his wife, Harry and Harriette Moore, who were killed by a bomb on Christmas night as they celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary in 1951 in Florida? Who can forget the two black couples lynched about 60 miles east of Atlanta in 1946, or the death of Lemuel Penn, a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Reserve from Washington, D.C., who was a veteran trying to get home from Fort Benning, Georgia for a little rest. He was killed in 1964 as members of the KKK drove by him on a highway. 
   Who can forget Viola Liuzzo, shot down in Alabama in 1965, from the hometown of our chairman, Chairman Conyers from Detroit, trying to bring nonviolent activists back to their home after the Selma-to-Montgomery march? 
   There are hundreds, maybe even thousands, of these crimes that were never brought to justice. There are murderers who have walked free for decades while the families of victims cry out for justice. Passing this bill is the least we can do. And we must do something to right these wrongs. 
   I will never forget the three civil rights workers, three young men I knew, Andy Goodman, James Chaney and Mickey Schwerner. They came to Mississippi with a simple mission, to register as many black voters as possible. They were stopped, arrested, taken to jail. Later that night, June 21, 1964, they were taken from jail by the sheriff and his deputy, turned over to the Klan, where they were beaten, shot and killed. They didn't die in Vietnam. They didn't die in Eastern Europe. They died right here in the United States. They died in Philadelphia, Mississippi. 
   Viola Liuzzo didn't die on a road or some street in Baghdad, she died right there in Alabama on Highway 80. Lemuel Penn, Medgar Evers, Emmett Till and countless others didn't die in the Middle East; they died right here in our own country fighting for simple justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation, we have a mission, we have a mandate. The blood of hundreds of innocent men and women is calling out to us. Then, no one came to their aid. But today we can help make it right. Let us move to close this dark chapter in our history. Let us try to wash away the stains on our democracy. So I call on all of my colleagues to pass this legislation and pass it today.  
   Mr. Speaker, I submit the following letters of support for H.R. 923, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Act.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. McDermott for yielding and for bringing this necessary piece of legislation to us today. 
   It is basic, it is common sense, it is the right thing to do. People are calling out. They're crying out for help. 
   They ask, where is the Federal Government? Where is Congress? Which side is the government on? What are you doing to help the unemployed, people who lost their jobs? It's not their fault. What are you doing to help those in need, those who need a helping hand? What are you doing and doing now? 
   Mr. Speaker, some of us may not remember this, or maybe we never had to do it, but just a few short years ago, many people in this country washed their clothes at night and hung them up to a heater or to the fireplace so they could dry and wear them to work the next morning. I wonder if we're headed back to that reality. People need help and they need it now.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (IRAQ IN CIVIL WAR -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep concern that on this very day 4 years ago, our Nation inaugurated a conflict, an unnecessary war, a war of choice, not a necessity.  
   The most comprehensive intelligence we have, the National Intelligence Estimate and the latest Pentagon report, tells us that Iraq had descended into a state of civil war. Over 3,000 Americans have died, and hundreds of thousands, some even say up to 1 million citizens of Iraq, have lost their lives in this unnecessary conflict. 
   And while we are telling our veterans of this war, the elderly, the poor, and the sick that there is no room in the budget for them, the American people have spent over $400 billion on a failed policy. We cannot do more of the same. Mr. Speaker, violence begets violence. It does not lead to peace. 
   President John F. Kennedy once said, ``Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.'' My greatest fear is that the young people of Iraq and of the Middle East will never forget this war. My greatest fear is they will grow up hating our children and our children's children for what we have done. Mr. Speaker, the Bible is right. Even a great nation can reap what it sows. 
   Nothing troubles me more than to see the young faces of these soldiers who have been led to their death.     
   Some are only 18, 19, 21, 22, 23. It is painful; it is so painful to watch. Sometimes I feel like crying and crying out loud at what we are doing as a Nation and what this administration is doing in our name. Our children do not deserve to die as pawns in a civil war. 
   They do not deserve to pay with their lives for the mistakes of this administration. They never had a chance. 
   When I was their age, when I was 23 years old, I was leading the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, soon to speak in Washington on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, but then we were involved in a nonviolent revolution to transform the soul of America, to create a beloved community. 
   Forty years ago, I was there in New York City in Riverside Church when Martin Luther King, Jr., gave one of the most powerful speeches he ever made against the war in Vietnam. If he could speak today, he would say this Nation needs a revolution of values that exposes the truth that war does not work. If he could speak today, he would say that war is obsolete as a tool of our foreign policy. 
   He would say there is nothing keeping us from changing our national priority so that the pursuit of peace can take precedence over the pursuit of war. 
   He would say we must remove the causes of chaos, injustice, poverty and insecurity that are breeding grounds for terrorism. This is the way towards peace. 
   As a Nation, can we hear the words of Gandhi, so simple, so true, that it is either nonviolence or nonexistence? Can we hear the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., saying that we must learn to live together as brothers and sisters or perish as fools? 
   Tonight I must make it plain and clear that as a human being, as a citizen of the world, as a citizen of America, as a Member of Congress, as an individual committed to a world at peace with itself, I will not and I cannot in good conscience vote for another dollar or another dime to support this war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. McDermott, the gentleman from Washington, for yielding me this time and bringing this piece of legislation to us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act. More than ever, we need to get our priorities straight. We need to stop helping big oil companies and start helping American families. We need to stop dancing while Rome burns and reverse the damage we have done to our environment. 
   Oil companies are making record profits. They do not need our help. They are not begging for our help. They made more than $96 billion in profit in 2006. It is time to end the massive giveaway to the big oil companies. It is time to end corporate welfare. It is time to take taxpayer dollars back from the oil companies and use them to solve our energy problems. 
   It is our moral duty to use other forms of energy, and H.R. 6 starts us on this process. Global warming can no longer be ignored. 2006 was one of the hottest years on record. The weather in Washington during the last 2 weeks has felt more like the warm weather I am used to in my home State of Georgia. We need to act now. H.R. 6 will start to address global warming and turn back the damage we are doing to our environment. 
   We also need to reduce our reliance on Middle Eastern oil. It is our duty to help inspire the next generation of energy technology: hydrogen, ethanol, wind and other sources of energy that will not harm our little planet, our little spaceship we call Earth. 
   The American people need relief from energy costs. By improving our energy efficiency, we can all spend less to light and heat our homes and fuel our cars with gas. 
   Do the oil companies really deserve tax breaks while they earn billions of dollars in profits? It is time to end this waste. It is not right. It is time to start improving our quality of life. The people have a right to know what is in the air we breathe and what is in the water we drink. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6.

   Long before JULIA CARSON came here, she was a fighter, someone who stood up and spoke out for those that have been left out and left behind. She was a champion of ordinary people, a champion for justice, for civil rights, for human dignity. I want to thank her friend and our former colleague, Andy Jacob, whom I served with, for doing all he could do to have JULIA CARSON come to this place. 
   In this body, we are like a family, one family. We become like sisters and brothers. And I feel with the loss and passing of JULIA CARSON, we have lost a member of our family. The chain, the circle, has been broken. 
   I will never forget when I was much younger, on April, 4, 1968, almost 40 years ago, I was in her district. She was not representing the district then, but we were in the City of Indianapolis with Robert Kennedy when he announced to the crowd that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., had been assassinated. When JULIA came here, she always said to me, JOHN, you must come back to Indianapolis and visit. And I have gone back there. 
   We will miss her. She has gone on to a better place. And we will never, ever see her likeness again.

   Mr. Speaker, people are suffering, people are barely getting by. Some people are using their retirement savings today to pay their credit card bills or to avoid foreclosure on their home. This is a choice people should not have to make. Today, we offer just a little bit of help. 
   Mr. Speaker, after a lifetime of hard work, people need to know that they can retire and their pensions will be there for them. This bill will help thousands of Delta employees who live and work in my district, thousands of pilots and airline workers, whose retirement savings slipped away when the airline went bankrupt. 
   The payments they are receiving through the bankruptcy agreement are not going to make up for that loss. This bill will allow these workers to take their bankruptcy payment and put their money into a retirement account. Pilots and airline workers are asking for this help so they can help put their money back where it belongs, growing into a nest egg for retirement. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rangel and the great staff of the Ways and Means Committee and my own staff who worked with me to help pilots and airline workers in this bill today. We must do more to help people earn enough money and save enough money so they can live well when they retire. We must protect the hopes and dreams of America's workers.

   Call it what you may, to discriminate against someone because they are gay is wrong. It is wrong; it is not right. There is not any room in our society for discrimination. Today, we must take this important step after more than 30 long years and pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. It is the right thing to do. It is the moral thing to do.     
   Let us do it, not just for this generation, but for generations yet unborn. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to bring down those signs. Now is the time to do what is right, what is fair, what is just. The time is always right to do right. Let us pass this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee. The chairman has been a long-time advocate in improving safety standards in our Nation's transportation system. I appreciate his willingness to include report language regarding occupant ejection and motor coach and school bus standards in this legislation. 
   In March, a horrific accident occurred in my district when a bus carrying the Bluffton University men's baseball team crashed on Interstate 75 in Atlanta, Georgia, en route to a tournament in Florida. Six people were killed and 29 others were injured. 
   That week, Dr. Jeffrey Solomone from Grady Hospital's trauma center, where most of the victims were treated in Atlanta, called my office outraged. He knew that their deaths could have been prevented if they were simply wearing seat belts. Imagine working to save young lives when you knew their injuries were caused not from impact but from being thrown from the vehicle. 
   Last year, two teenage girls were killed in a similar accident in Beaumont, Texas. Advocates and family members accurately highlighted that the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration develop a safety standard in 1999. 
   In 2005, the SAFETEA-LU legislation reiterated this request and called for a national standard to be developed no later than October 1, 2009. I applaud the committee for demanding a status report on these standards. Simply said, it should not take 10 years to figure out a way to save lives. How much longer must we wait until a simple regulation is developed?

   As the co-Chair of the House COPD Caucus, I want to speak about one item that falls under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee, and that is the implementation of the 1986 Air Carrier Access Act.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   While the legislation has done a reasonably good job of protecting most passengers with disabilities, it has had limited success in influencing air carriers to accommodate the needs of disabled individuals who require supplemental oxygen. 
   Currently, as an example, air carriers have the authority to allow or disallow the use of portable oxygen systems aboard their planes even when the Department of Transportation and the FAA find that the systems are safe. This leaves the use of oxygen systems supplied by the carrier. Potential layovers and delays between flights are an additional health risk and barrier to access to air flight. 
   In September 2005, the Department of Transportation recognized this problem and issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to clarify this situation to assist the flying public who are in need of assisted breathing devices. 
   Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor to commend the Department of Transportation for recognizing the problem and for issuing this proposed rule. The final rule will provide uniform standards that will allow passengers to carry  their FAA-approved devices onboard. I ask the chairman to work with me to encourage the FAA to issue a rule expeditiously.

   Today, we win a battle in the ongoing struggle against discrimination. Discrimination against mental illness and addiction is wrong. It is dead wrong. Today, we end that discrimination in health insurance. I believe that health care is a right and not a privilege. Until we can provide real and meaningful health coverage to all Americans, we must take each step as it comes to expand coverage. So, today we take an important step, a necessary step in that direction by requiring parity in insurance coverage. 
   I have fought long and hard to end discrimination in this Nation, and we have made some real progress. But people suffering from mental illness and addiction have been left out and left behind, and it's time for us to do what is right when they are told that their illness is not covered by their insurance. That discrimination must end, and it must end now.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to ask my colleagues to support House Resolution 1208. This  resolution is very simple. It recognizes the many problems that face young people who spend time in foster care, and it thanks the many others who work to ease their transition from foster care to adulthood and independence. 
   In Georgia, there are thousands of children in foster care. Living in foster care is not a choice. These young people of all races, ages, and backgrounds were victims of neglect and abuse. Child welfare services share a common goal of finding safe, stable, and loving homes for these young people. Unfortunately, this dream is not always realized. 
   I have the privilege to serve on the Ways and Means Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee chaired by my good friend and colleague, Mr. McDermott of Washington. 
   Last year, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) invited two young people from our congressional district to testify about what it is like to transition from foster care to adulthood. Anthony Reeves and Shalita O'Neal both aged out of the Georgia foster care system. They shared with us how difficult it is to find housing, health care, education, liveable wages, jobs, security, and stability. 
   At a young age, when most are still relying on financial and emotional support from their parents and family, these young people have no one to fall back on. Mr. Speaker, these are the stories that break your heart. 
   Today, we honor those like Anthony and Shalita, and Kevin Brown, a recent graduate of Clark Atlanta University, who are determined to find their way despite so many problems before them. 
   We also pay tribute to the mentors, volunteers, parents, organizations, and many others who fill in the gaps in Federal and State coverage to help these young people during the most difficult times of their young lives. 
   Most important, this resolution sends a message to the half million young people currently in the foster care system. Congress tells them: You are not alone. We love you. We support you. You are not forgotten. There is hope. You will survive. And you will succeed. 
   Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I urge all of my colleagues to support this very simple resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill passed the House on July 23, 2008, with bipartisan support by a vote of 387 yeas to 37 nays. The Department of Transportation has asked that this legislation be effective immediately. The Senate amended the House-passed bill to change the effective date and respond to the administration's request. 
   The trust fund is broke, out of money. Our State and local governments, drivers, construction workers and many others will suffer when highway projects are delayed. We took $8 billion out of the trust fund in 1998, and now is the time to put that $8 billion back. 
   I urge all of my colleagues again to support this important bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3920, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007. 
   Under this administration, we have adopted a record eight free trade agreements. In trade and globalization, there are winners and there are losers. 
   Mr. Speaker, increasing the funding and efficiency of the trade assistance program is the very least we can do as a Congress. 
   In my home State of Georgia, we have used more than 125 percent of our allotment. Why? Because agriculture and textile jobs are disappearing. They're leaving the State of Georgia. 
   These families are struggling just to make ends meet. They want to work. They need to work. How can we oppose, how can we be against investing in our greatest asset, the American workforce? 
   We can spend hundreds, thousands, millions and billions of dollars on war. Can we spend just a few dollars on the workers of America? 
   To oppose this bill is heartless, it makes no sense, and it is irresponsible. 
   So I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007. 
   The recent Supreme Court ruling in the Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire case turns the clock back on decades of progress. As a result of this ruling it is now even more difficult for employees to exercise their rights for equal pay and equal treatment as determined under the law. 
   This decision was based on a questionable technicality, not on the fact that Ms. Ledbetter was paid 20 percent less than even the least qualified of her male counterparts. Ms. Ledbetter did nothing wrong throughout the process. She toiled for 19 years and deserved equal pay and treatment by her employers. 
   For centuries, women, minorities, and many others have fought for equal rights and consideration under the law. Congress is being forced to invoke its constitutional powers to restore balance and justice for the sake of equality. Today we send a strong message that discrimination and injustice on the basis of gender is intolerable. 
   Simply said Madam Speaker, H.R. 2831 is not about turning back the clock on civil rights law; this legislation protects these hard-fought and hard-earned guarantees. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, women who work full time, earn, on average, only 77 cents for every dollar men earn. The figures are even worse for women of color. Clearly, discrimination is not a relic of the past. 
   I know that many, many Members of Congress recognize the importance of this legislation. I ask all of my colleagues to vote yes. I  hope that the President will stand for equality and justice by signing this important bill.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill and against the amendment. 
   Members of Congress, you are not the mayor of Washington, D.C., you do not sit on the City Council, you have not been ordained to stand in judgment. I dare you to act as judge and jury and sentence the people of the District of Columbia to unfettered access to guns. 
   Some of my friends have fought tooth and nail against too much government intervention. So how could you suggest tonight that Congress circumvent, disregard, and disrespect the rights and freedom of the citizens of this city? 
   D.C. residents have made it crystal clear they want to limit the proliferation of guns in Washington to protect all of its citizens, including Members of Congress, staffers, even the President of the United States, who all live and work in this city. 
   The amendment would nullify the will of hundreds of thousands of voting Americans like they don't even exist. They are citizens of America. They are human beings. 
   We all heard the news of a few weeks ago: 11 people were shot, wounded, some even died on the streets of Washington in one night. How many more people will die? How many more victims will be robbed when they stare down the barrel of a gun? 
   As Members of Congress, you may believe what you will. Maybe you truly think that when everyone bears arms, the city will really be safer. You have a right to your opinion, but we are here tonight to say the people of the District of Columbia do not agree. And they should not have your way of life, your viewpoint, your amendment forced down their throat. That is not right. That is not fair. That is not just. 
   And I think even you would agree that that is not the American way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1677 and am pleased to be a lead co-sponsor of this bill with Chairman Rangel. 
   Today is the due date for Americans to file their tax returns. On this day, it is wise for the House to consider a bill to increase taxpayer protection and expand outreach efforts to millions of Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill; this is a timely bill. The Taxpayer Protection Act is a result of a hearing held by the Oversight Subcommittee that I chair. H.R. 1677 is an important first step in standing up, really standing up for the American taxpayer. It is a shame that people use fraudulent tax schemes to steal Social Security numbers and financial information from Americans. 
   This legislation protects taxpayers from misleading Web sites and identity theft. H.R. 1677 provides higher penalties for persons who use either Web site names that may be confused with the official IRS Web site or mass e-mails that appear to be from the IRS. This bill requires the IRS to notify you if your identity is stolen in a tax scam. 
   You should not become more vulnerable for being a responsible citizen. The Taxpayer Protection Act prohibits the IRS from providing certain information to businesses that the IRS believes make predatory loans based on tax refunds. These short-term loans often charge interest rates sometimes above 100 percent that victimize low-income workers. 
   H.R. 1677 will also assist with efforts to reach millions of working Americans who are eligible to claim the earned income tax credit. These taxpayers often do not take advantage of the EITC. They have a right to know of all benefits available to them. Under this bill, the IRS will expand its current outreach program to help more low-income Americans receive this tax credit, a credit which lifts millions of families out of poverty each year. 
   This bipartisan legislation moves us in the right direction to make tax issues simpler and clearer for the average person. We must fight poverty, fight fraud, and provide these basic protections for all Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I fully support the Taxpayer Protection Act, and I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for H.R. 1677. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I also want to thank my colleague, my friend, the ranking member, Mr. Ramstad, for all of his help in bringing this piece of legislation, as I stated before, before us today. 
   Madam Speaker, I fully support H.R. 1677, the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007. We must do more for Americans. We must protect taxpayers from being victims of fraudulent tax schemes, misleading Web sites and predatory refund loans. 
   H.R. 1677 does this. It provides higher penalties for deceptive Web sites and mass e-mails. It requires the IRS to notify you if your identity is stolen in a tax scam. It reduces predatory refund loans. 
   H.R. 1677 expands IRS outreach programs to millions of taxpayers eligible for the earned income tax credit who have not claimed it. This credit lifts millions of working Americans out of poverty each year. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. This is an important bill. This is a necessary bill. On this tax day we must do more for taxpayers. I urge my colleagues, all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for H.R. 1677.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSASSINATION OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, Chairman Conyers, for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is fitting and appropriate that we pause, as a Nation and as a people, to remember the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a man who changed America forever. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4, 1968. He had emerged as a leader, not just for a people, but for a Nation. His leadership and commitment to a truly interracial democracy played a key role in ending legal segregation in America. He led the first major nonviolent campaign in modern America when he emerged as the leader of the Montgomery bus boycott that lasted 381 days. 
   He inspired thousands and thousands of people to follow the way of nonviolence. In doing so, he inspired other movements and had an effect on so many young people and some not so young. 
   Just think, a few short years ago, in America, there were signs that said, ``White women, Colored women,'' ``White men, Colored men,'' ``White waiting, Colored waiting.'' There was segregation in public accommodations and transportation. Men and women of color could not even register to vote. 
   Dr. King created a climate, created an environment that the power of the courts, the power of Congress, and the President of the United States couldn't look the other way; they couldn't say no. 
   In his short life, he led the American people on a journey that is ongoing even today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will never forget coming to Washington with him in early June, 1963. We met with President Kennedy and other leaders in his administration. Dr. King informed the President that there was a crisis in our country and that he had to act. 
   Later, Dr. King came back to Washington to speak and to march on Washington. This time he was able to bring 250,000 Americans, Black and White, and people of all faiths and backgrounds. On that day, he transformed the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to a modern-day pulpit. On that day, he shared his dream of the Beloved Community, a truly interracial democracy. 
   I can still hear him saying, ``I have a dream today, a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, today we encourage all citizens, especially our young people, to take time to reflect on the teachings and the leadership of Martin Luther King, Jr. Our Nation is a better place, and we are a better people because of him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friends and my two colleagues for those kind words. 
   I'm honored to stand here today as the chief sponsor of this legislation to recognize the brave and courageous men and women who paved the way for the historic, and necessary, set of laws we call the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   We would not be standing here today with this bill being considered on the floor, with 313 cosponsors, without the help of my good friend and colleague, Representative Vic Snyder. Representative Snyder was a champion of this bill. I appreciate his support of this bill and the ideas behind it. 
   I would also like to acknowledge Congresswoman Deborah Pryce for her willingness to cosponsor this bill with me. 
   On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks' brave act of defiance, refusing to give up her seat to a white person on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, galvanized the modern-day civil rights movement. I remember as a young child, 15 years old, listening to the radio and hearing about Rosa Parks and the voice of Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   Their work inspired me and so many others to take up the cause of equality and join the movement. We must never forget the sacrifices that so many made. 
   I am proud, very proud, to be the lead sponsor of this legislation, which celebrates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and to remember those who fought for its passage. 
   In 2014, the 50th anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, commemorative coins will be minted with the images of the brave men and women who fought, and even died, for these laws. These coins will serve as educational tools for our children and their children, so that the struggle that so many took part in will never, ever be forgotten. 
   The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was necessary, and it was right to pass. It greatly expanded civil rights protections. It outlawed segregation and racial discrimination in public places, places of public accommodation, the workplace, and even in federally funded programs. It also pushed to end segregation in our Nation's schools. 
   It is only right then that we are working with the United Negro College Fund to commemorate the 50th anniversary of this historic milestone. Discrimination in our education system was real. For many African Americans, their only hope for a college education was through a UNCF school. UNCF institutions were founded to provide an education for African Americans who were banned by law or by custom from seeking a college education in the all-white public and private universities of the South. 
   Today, UNCF continues their important mission of opening the doors to a college education. Over 60 percent of UNCF-supported students are the first in their families to attend college. By helping to fund the UNCF, these coins will put in reach a college education for first-generation students while also helping to ensure these important institutions of higher education remain open for future and unborn generations. 
   I'm proud to stand here today as we pay tribute to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and to remember those who made it possible. There is still much work to be done, and we must continue to fight today, tomorrow, and into the future. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Miller for yielding, and I want to thank him for bringing this piece of legislation before us. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is unacceptable that we have waited 10 years to address this problem. Unacceptable. We have waited far too long. Millions of our American citizens, our brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, are working long hours to receive a minimum wage and are still living in poverty. In 2007, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We can do better. We can do much better as a Nation and as a people.     
   American workers are suffering. They are struggling to fill their cars  with gas, to put good food on the table. They are working hard, and they are still living in poverty. That is not right. It is not fair, and it is not just. All American workers deserve good pay for hard work. This is a matter of fairness. This is a matter of human decency. This is a matter of human dignity. 
   Nearly 20 States have increased their minimum wage above the Federal level. It is time for us in Congress to do the same. 
   In my district, the basic cost of living for a family of three is $27,000. Even with the increase we are considering today, it is still $12,000 short. 
   This is just the first step today, and we must do more for working families in the fight against poverty. President Roosevelt said it best when he said that the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, we must pass the minimum wage. It is time that Congress's actions reflect the will of the American people.

They will be more than grateful to you forever for bringing this legislation to the floor, and I want to thank you, Chairman MILLER. 
   Madam Speaker, for too long the doors to our colleges and universities have been closed to too many of our young people. Too many of our best and brightest cannot afford to go to college, and those who do are buried under a mountain of debt when they graduate. Today we can ease that burden. Today we can make colleges and  universities more affordable by passing H.R. 5. The best and brightest American minds, rich and poor, all of our children, must have access to higher education. Our young people will be competing with young people from around the world, not just on this little piece of real estate we call America, but from around the world, and they must have every opportunity to succeed. I am the first person in my family to finish high school, to go to college.     
   I worked in a kitchen washing dishes, pots and pans, serving food, working as a janitor. That is how I made it through school. But today, hundreds of thousands of our young people cannot make it because of the debt, because of the high cost of student loans. American students should never, never be turned away from college because they cannot afford it. 
   It is unacceptable, it is a shame, it is a disgrace that our country is willing to spend millions and billions of dollars to fight a war in Iraq that we know is a mistake, while the doors to our colleges and universities are closed to too many of our young people. 
   Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5, vote for America's future. Vote for our young people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, my colleague, the chairman, for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, it is only fitting and appropriate that we salute and commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as we celebrate his 78th birthday. 
   Martin Luther King, Jr., was a man of peace, a man of love, a man of nonviolence. He must be considered one of the founding fathers of the new America. 
   Because of his dedication to the cause of injustice and his fight for human dignity, he wrestled with the very soul of this Nation and pushed it to reach for its greater destiny. 
   Dr. King had the ability to produce light in dark places; the ability to bring the dirt and the filth out from under the American rug, out of the cracks and the corner into the open light in order for us to deal with it. 
   He injected a new meaning into the very veins of our society and gave his life to make our democracy real. What he did and what he said and what he sacrificed inspired an entire generation and his power still rings today throughout the Nation and around the world. 
   We are a different country. We are a better people today. Martin Luther King, Jr., believed in the power of love over hate, the power of nonviolence over violence, the power of peace over war. He liberated all of us, black and white, Hispanic, Asian American and Native American. 
   If Dr. King could speak to us today, right now, he would say we must stop the madness of the war and bring our young people home. He would say that war is an ineffective tool of our foreign policy. 
   We must struggle against injustice and stand up for our goals. If peace is our goal, then peaceful ends must take peaceful means. 
   Dr. King would say, means and ends are inseparable. He would say we must  find a way to live together as brothers and sisters or we will perish as fools. 
   39 years later, we must rededicate ourselves to the struggle that was his struggle, and continue to see the goals that were his goals. 
   We know that his dream has not been fulfilled. It must be our task, our obligation, our mission, our mandate to renew our commitment to his dream.

I read an article recently about the residents of Gudda, a small village in India, who are harnessing the Sun's power to bring light into their homes when the Sun sets. This tiny village has nothing; no power lines to bring electricity, no real roads for vehicles to bring food and supplies, water is scarce, and yet this village has easily succeeded to make use of alternative energy. Gudda has shown that being green is easy and can be done by anyone! 
   The time has come for America to lead the world in the fight against climate change and in protecting our environment. We must not delay as we move toward energy independence. 
   Alternative energy means new jobs for Americans, lower energy costs and more technology that we can export to other countries. This legislation does more than fight global warming and protect our environment, it will strengthen our economy and make the United States the leader in providing alternative energy.

   During the 1950s and the 1960s, as a participant in the Civil Rights Movement, I tasted the bitter fruits of hate, and I didn't like it. I saw some of my friends beaten, shot and killed because of hate. Hate is too heavy a burden to bear. It also was the Great Teacher who said, ``Love you one another.''

   Oral history is such an important way to capture and share our nation's story. 
   These are stories that need to be told, and preserved. These are the stories of the civil rights movement; eye witness accounts of the struggle for civil rights. 
   These are recollections of real people who marched, and even spilled a little blood in the cause of civil rights and civil liberties, and in the cause of voting rights. 
   These stories will be collected and preserved by the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Library of Congress. Future generations will be able to hear the voices of people who were there during the civil rights movement, and hear them tell their stories in their own words. 
   We have lost too many of those voices in the last few years--Mrs. Coretta Scott King and Mrs. Rosa Parks, and we will continue to lose more courageous Civil Rights pioneers. We must begin this wonderful Oral History Project today, before we lose parts of the story. I strongly support this bill and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6893, the Fostering Connections to Success Act and Increasing Adoptions Act. 
   I applaud the Gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) and the Gentleman from Illinois (Mr. WELLER) for working with our Senate colleagues in crafting this legislation. I am proud to serve on the Ways and Means Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee under their leadership. 
   Today, more than half a million children are living in foster care. H.R. 6893 addresses many of the key problems that plague the foster care system. This bill includes much needed educational stability requirements and new oversight for children's health care. H.R. 6893 also includes key adoption incentives that help create permanent, safe, loving families for all children. Of particular importance to my constituents in Georgia are the improvements to kinship guardian care and to services for youth aging out of foster care included in this bill. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation; it is an important step in the right direction. We must pass H.R. 6893 in both the House and Senate before the end of this Congress. Then we must collaborate on more comprehensive improvements to the child welfare system in the 111th Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, in my home state, there are thousands of young people in foster care. Young people in foster care have not chosen this life. For a variety of reasons beyond their control, foster care children are uprooted from all that they know and rely on us for help. We must answer their call. As Members of Congress, citizens, and as parents, we must open our hearts and offer our hands and resources to serve these young people. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in doing so by supporting H.R. 6893. We would do no less for our own children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Deal and members of the delegation for bringing this resolution before us as a tribute to our fallen colleague, Mr. Norwood. 
   More than anything else, Congressman Norwood was a warrior. He fought for his beliefs with passion and conviction, and he fought for the people of his district and for the people of Georgia who loved him. 
   He was awarded two Bronze Stars for his bravery on behalf of our Nation during the Vietnam war, and he fought courageously for patient rights right here on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   In fact, his last official act was to reintroduce the Patients' Bill of Rights on Monday, a bill he coauthored with John Dingell. Charlie Norwood, this good man, this son of Georgia, fought a good fight. He was a warrior to the end. 
   The thoughts and prayers of all of the Members of Congress, and especially the members of the Georgia delegation, are with his wife Gloria and his two sons, Charles and Carlton, their family and his many grandchildren. I hope they will find comfort in knowing that Congressman Charlie Norwood made a lasting contribution not just to the State of Georgia, but to the Nation and to all of us as Members of this body. We are more than lucky, we are very blessed to have known him as a friend and as a colleague. He will be deeply missed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the untimely death of Republican STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES gives us pause. There was a great writer who once said that the death of one of us diminishes us all. As Stephanie's friends and colleagues in the U.S. Congress, we all feel a little lost and a little less because one of our most fearless champions is gone. 
   Those who are voiceless in America today, who have been left out and left behind, have lost a warrior, a fighter, a crusader who did what she could to defend the dignity of human kind. There was not anything shy about Stephanie. 
   She had the courage, the ability, and the desire to speak up and speak out, to fight for  what she believed was right, what was fair and just. 
   As a fellow member of the Ways and Means Committee, she was very concerned about using the tax code to help lift the burdens of the least among us. I always enjoyed it when she made a statement or questioned a witness. She was a brilliant judge and prosecutor, and that helped make her a gifted member of Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3056, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act, a bill to eliminate the IRS's private debt collection program. 
   The private debt collection program is an insult to the American taxpayer and our Federal tax system. The collection of taxes is a core government function. It is the mission of the IRS. 
   The Ways and Means Committee held a hearing on this program, and we found that it has no business, no place in the collection of taxes. This program violates the public trust. 
   Taxpayers trust the IRS with their personal information. When taxpayers put information on their tax returns, they expect that the IRS will see that information, and only the IRS. Taxpayers do not expect their personal information could be given to private debt collectors. It should never ever happen. 
   Taxpayers have been harassed under this program. Thousands of innocent taxpayers are being called on the phone and asked for their Social Security numbers. They are afraid that their identity will be stolen. In some cases, the calls are never-ending. We found that one elderly couple was called 150 times over 30 days. That's not right. That's not fair. 
   This program targets low-income taxpayers, and these private debt collectors have even gone after nursing  home residents and military personnel serving in Iraq.     
   That is unbelievable. Use of private debt collectors erodes the Federal tax system, the public trust and the Treasury. 
   I say, Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. We must stand with the taxpayers, and we must stand up for the IRS employees. Pass this bill and end this program.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep concern that this President has chosen to escalate the war in Iraq instead of charting a course towards peace. 
   Today, I am reminded of the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., when he spoke out against the war in Vietnam on April 4, 1967. He said, ``The world now demands a maturity of this Nation that we may not be able to achieve. It demands that we admit that we have been wrong from the beginning of our adventure in Vietnam,'' we could substitute Iraq, ``and that our actions have been detrimental to the people of that Nation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, war is messy. War is bloody. It tends not just to hide the truth but to sacrifice the truth. And the truth is that this was a war of choice and not a war of necessity. It was ill-fated from its inception at the highest levels of Government, and persisting in error will not fix a policy that was fundamentally flawed from the very beginning. 
   Thousands of our sons and daughters have been left dead on the battlefield, and tens of thousands are changed forever, wounded physically and spiritually by the brutality of war. Our soldiers are the best men and women in the world, willing to sacrifice all they have at a moment's notice to protect our freedom. They do not deserve to pay with their lives for the errors of this administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, we will never find the answer to the problem we have created in Iraq down the barrel of a gun. The lasting solution to this crisis will rise from skillful diplomacy, not military might. The Good Book said, ``Come let us reason together.'' 
   We must never, ever be afraid to talk. What harm comes from sitting down with Syria, Iran and our allies in the Middle East to help bring the warring parties together? John F. Kennedy once said, ``Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.'' 
   My greatest fear here is that the young people growing up in the Middle East will never forget this American invasion. My greatest fear is that they will grow up to hate our children, our grandchildren and generations yet unborn, because of what we are doing today in Iraq. 
   Yes, we must maintain a strong national defense. We must defend our borders. We must bring an end to terrorism. But not at the expense of our democracy, not at the expense of the very principles this Nation was founded upon. 
   I want to close by asking a question of old, Mr. Speaker. What does it profit a great Nation to gain the whole world and lose its soul? Gandhi once said, ``It is either nonviolence or nonexistence.'' 
   Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, ``We must learn to live together as brothers and sister or perish as fools.'' 
   It is better to heal than to kill. It is better to reconcile than to divide. It is better to love than to hate. That is why we must vote for this resolution. We must do more. 
   We must not place more of our young people in harm's way. We must not continue to make our soldiers sitting ducks in a civil war. As Members of Congress, we must continue to stand up, speak up and speak out. It is our duty, it is our right, it is our moral obligation. We must find a way to get in the way until we bring our young men and women home, and not to continue to escalate this war. 
   Vote for this resolution. It is the right thing to do. We must send a powerful and strong message to this administration to stop this madness.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2007. I commend my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for working in a bipartisan way to reach an agreement on provisions that will not only help small businesses grow and thrive, but will provide small businesses with incentives to hire disadvantaged workers. Not only that, it will not pass any costs onto our children. 
   The most important thing that will come out of passing this piece of legislation today, is that it will ensure that we finally pass a minimum wage increase. As I have said before, we have waited far too long--10 long years--to give our working poor a pay raise. We should be ashamed of that delay, but I am proud that we are taking that important step to restoring dignity and fairness for our minimum wage earners. This minimum wage increase will help millions of our brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers. 
   My fight in Congress is the fight against poverty. We must do more for working families, for families who are playing by the rules and still cannot get ahead. I just don't understand how people survive under these circumstances. We cannot stand by and watch millions of people continue to fall into poverty. This minimum wage increase is not the end, but the beginning of our fight against poverty in this nation. 
   Passing this legislation today will smooth the path to the passage of the minimum wage increase. This bill is also a symbol of how much we can accomplish to help hard working families when we work together, across the aisle--Democrats and Republicans. And I look forward to continued progress in the fight against poverty in the 110th Congress.

   Madam Speaker, on Tax Day, it is so important that we bring H.R. 5719 to the floor of the House. Taxpayers must be treated fairly, and they deserve all the help we can give them. 
   This bill draws, in part, on legislation authored by myself and many members of the Ways and Means Committee. Most of the pieces of this bill enjoy bipartisan support. 
   This bill will assist victims of identity theft and prevent the misuse of the IRS name in schemes that defraud the public. 
   The bill helps low-income taxpayers by allowing IRS employees to refer them to low-income taxpayer clinics, expanding earned income tax credit outreach, and authorizing funding for low-income taxpayer programs. 
   It would, once and for all, repeal the authority of the IRS to enter into private debt collection contracts. This program violates the public trust and must end. 
   The bill also protects elderly and disabled persons from tax liability on workers provided to them under government programs. 
   H.R. 5719 enhances the fairness of our tax code and deserves this House's total support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, yesterday this Nation lost one of its most gifted journalists and authors in a car accident in California, David Halberstam. 
   As a reporter for The New York Times, his coverage of the Vietnam War earned him a Pulitzer Prize and the enduring respect of his colleagues. This man embodied the spirit of a thoughtful, free, and independent press. 
   President Kennedy was so frustrated by the truth of his reporting on Vietnam that he once called The New York Times and demanded David be fired. The New York Times did not back down, and neither did David. He was labeled unpatriotic because the stories he wrote did not flatter the administration. But he reported what he saw, regardless of the consequences. Now we see the value of his great insight in the history of that conflict. 
   I have often said that without the members of the press, the civil rights movement would have been like a bird without wings. In David's reporting at the Nashville Tennessean and later in his book on the Nashville student movement, called ``The Children,'' he delivered the message of injustice in the South. 
   We trusted David. We knew that he was determined to report the truth. We trusted that he would get the story right, and we believed he would be fair. He was deeply moved and affected by the dizzy dint, the commitment and the dedication of the young people in the Nashville student movement because they were prepared to face violence with non-violence and peace. 
   I feel that we have lost one of the greatest minds in America, who understood the deepest ramification of violence and war. I only wish that he were here today for Members of this body to consult as we try to find answers in Iraq. 
   David was a sympathetic referee in the cause of civil rights and social justice. He helped convince the Nation that the price of segregation and racial discrimination was too high. He used his pad and his pen to answer the calling of his conscience. He stood up for what he believed to be right. 
   This Nation will always be indebted to him and people like him, who are  willing to speak the truth regardless of the consequences. 
   I have known David for almost 50 years. In him the Nation has lost one of its prolific writers, but I feel like I have lost a very good friend. I feel like I have lost a companion in the struggle for civil rights and social justice in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (CHAIRWOMAN JUANITA MILLENDER-<b>MCDONALD </b> -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, we are here today to honor one of our colleagues, Representative Juanita McDonald of the 37th District of California. 
   Representative McDonald was an extraordinary woman. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama at a time of racial violence and overt displays of the most open and systematic forms of racism. But she did not let that hold her down or hold her back. She went to college in California, she became a teacher in the Los Angeles school system, and throughout her career she used education as an instrument for change. 
   She was a great teacher, and she used the power of knowledge and her commitment to human understanding to break down institutional barriers and to reach across the aisle. 
   I think that is why she made so many strides as a Member of Congress. She knew gaining mutual understanding was the only way to build coalitions and lay all differences aside. 
   That's why her creativity and skillful leadership became legendary. She was the first Democrat to chair the Congressional Caucus For Women's Issues and she used that power to build a coalition between the women of the Supreme Court and the women of Congress. She knew the differences in their roles as public servants didn't matter. She believed all women in government shared a common bond. 
   She took concerned women of Congress to meet delegates to the United Nations to unify the global struggle against the exploitation of women and girls. 
   She developed the first National Teen Dating Violence Week as a platform for all women to speak out against a common problem--violence against teen girls. And she was the first Member to bring the head of the CIA to the city of Watts to address longstanding, widespread allegations of drug dumping in that community. 
   And, of course, she was the first African American to chair a full committee, the Committee on House Administration. This committee oversees some of the great educational institutions of our Nation--the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the Government Printing Office, and the Capitol Fine Arts Board. 
   We can only dream about what this great teacher would have done in this capacity. I know she would have used the power of knowledge and education as an instrument of change. 
   But beyond that, Juanita McDonald was an elegant lady. She may have moved to California, but she never lost her southern charm. She was always a lady--as tough as steel but as sweet as honey. She was more than a colleague. She was our sister, our friend. Juanita was a sharp dresser, and sometimes she would dress to kill. She was beautiful on the outside and on the inside. She had a sweet, sweet spirit, and she will be deeply missed. 
   Sometimes when she would see me, she would call me Mr. Civil Rights. And sometimes when she would see Sanford Bishop, David Scott and me together, she would say, ``What are you Georgia boys doing? What are you up to?'' 
   And when she was planning programs in her district, she would stop by to see members of the Georgia delegation and tell us she needed a box of peanuts. And we would all ante up and make those peanuts available to her. 
   It is so unreal. It is so unbelievable that we will not see her on the floor of this Chamber again. Life is short, too short. We are here today, and we're gone tomorrow, but her spirit and her memory will live on in all of us. 
   With the passing of Congresswoman McDonald, it seems the world is a little darker. It seems that a light has gone out. Maybe here in this Chamber and on this Earth a light has gone out. But in another part of the universe Juanita is shining brighter than ever before.

   Mr. Speaker, on March 13, 2007, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight held a hearing on housing tax issues related to the rebuilding of communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. These hurricanes created and caused more damage than any other natural disaster and left over 700,000 residents in the Gulf Coast without housing. 
   The Congress has provided $15 billion in tax relief to victims of the hurricanes, but it is clear that we must do more and we can do more. The Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act of 2007 will help families affected by the hurricane to return home. This bill will extend incentives for low-income rental housing. It will also expand existing incentives so they can be used to refinance homes that need to be rebuilt from scratch.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to add my voice to others who are calling for an end to the war in Iraq. We must end this war, and we must end it now. We cannot wait and we must not wait. 
   Every month, every week, every hour, every minute, every second, every moment another young man is killed, another young woman is killed, another young American is killed, their innocent blood is on all of our hands. We have a moral obligation to bring this madness to an end. 
   Nothing, but nothing good can come out of this war. It is destroying Iraq, and it is destroying the very soul of our Nation. 
   As Members of Congress, we must find a way to stop it and stop it now.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for bringing House bill 7082, the Inmate Tax Fraud Prevention Act of 2008, to the House. 
   Mr. Ramstad has served at my side on the Oversight Subcommittee for years. He has been a wonderful friend, a good friend. We call ourselves brothers. He will be missed when he retires this year. He has worked to make our taxes fair and to protect taxpayers. This bill is a great and shining example of his good effort. 
   Jim, I want to thank you again for all of your great work, for working so hard, for hanging in there, for never giving up, and for never giving in. Thank you so much. 
   The Oversight Subcommittee found that thousands of false returns were being filed by prisoners. However, the Internal Revenue Service could not disclose the information to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. This bill was developed to correct this problem. This bill will stop the abuse of our tax system. 
   I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of House bill 7082. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (CHARITY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7083, the Charity Enhancement Act of 2008. 
   This bill responds to hundreds of pages of written comments that were submitted by charities to the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. This bill contains a number of important provisions to help charities continue their good work. 
   Charities play such an important role in our country. Charities and foundations make up the very fabric of our communities. They know the deepest human needs of our friends and neighbors, and they know the solutions that work. Often, at critical times, charities and foundations are the leaders that show government the way to care for our citizens. Their services touch every corner of life in our communities--education, the arts, and medical research. 
   They also serve those who need our help the most by feeding the hungry, caring for the sick and lifting up those who live in poverty. This bill fixes some of the unintended effects of new charitable laws that keep them from doing their good and necessary work. 
   First, the bill will promote scholarships by relaxing the rules imposed on certain scholarship funds. 
   Second, the bill would improve disclosure to the public by increasing the electronic filing of tax returns filed by charities and foundations. 
   Third, the bill will provide relief to certain longstanding supporting organizations created before 1970. Notably, these are charities where the donors are deceased, so there is no concern about misusing the charity for personal gain. 
   Historically, these charities have distributed significant amounts to their communities over the past 38 years. Their contributions have been used to fund scholarship and support charitable, scientific, and educational activities. 
   Finally, this bill will allow charities to reimburse reasonable and necessary expenses of volunteer board members. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support our charities and foundations and vote ``yes'' for H.R. 7083. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleagues and friends, PETER WELCH of Vermont and JERRY WELLER from Illinois, for joining me in offering this important amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, hospitals need more than just 2 months to change their coding system. It's too much too soon. CMS needs to give them the time they need. In addition, we must not allow CMS to implement this behavior offset. 
   I've talked to hospitals in my district. They're doing everything right when it comes to coding and charging Medicare. This cut will punish the hospital before they've done anything wrong. 269 Members of the House feel the same way. 
   Mr. Weller and I sent a letter to CMS on June 12, along with 267 of our colleagues and 63 Senators urging CMS not to make this $24 billion cut. Hospitals do not deserve a $24 billion cut. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and help our hospitals.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (COMMEMORATING THE 44TH ANNIVERSARY OF FREEDOM SUMMER -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Conyers, the chairman of the full committee, for his leadership and for his dedication to the issue and the cause of civil rights, and for bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the courage and conviction of three young men, Andy Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner. On June 21, 1964, they gave their lives in a struggle for voting rights in America. 
   There was a time, just 44 years ago, when it was almost impossible in the American south for people of color to register and vote. Then, I was 24 years old and the chair of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, better known as SNCC. I traveled around the country encouraging young people to come to Mississippi to get involved with the Freedom Summer. It was the summer of 1964. 
   At that time, the State of Mississippi had a black population of voting age of more than 450,000, but only about 18,000 blacks were registered to vote. It was dangerous, very dangerous, for those of us who believed that everyone should have the right to vote. But in spite of the risks, there were people--young and old, black and white, rich and poor--people like Andy Goodman, James Chaney and Mickey Schwerner, who put aside the comfort of their own lives to make sure that every citizen had free and fair access to the ballot, not only in Mississippi, but throughout America. 
   Mickey Schwerner was a 24-year-old white man from Brooklyn, New York, who was already a participant in the movement. Andy Goodman was also white, a 21-year-old student at Queens College in New York. James Chaney was a 21-year-old African American man from Meridian, Mississippi, who decided to take a stand for justice in his own community, in his own State. 
   On the morning of June 21, 1964, these three young men drove to Longdale, Mississippi to investigate the burning of an African American church. On their way back, they were arrested, at least stopped and detained by the sheriff and taken to jail in Philadelphia, Mississippi. That same evening they were released from the jail by the sheriff and turned over to the Klan. They were beaten, shot and killed. Their burnt blue Ford station wagon was pulled from a creek just 2 days later. I joined in the search for them that night with a very heavy heart. Their bodies were found a few weeks later, about 6 weeks later, on August 4, 1964, buried under a mound of dirt. 
   Madam Speaker, I share this story today so that Members of Congress will realize that the struggle for civil rights has been a long, hard road littered by the battered and broken bodies of countless men and women who paid the ultimate price for a precious right, the right to vote, the right to participate in a democratic process. 
   Andy Goodman, James Chaney and Mickey Schwerner did not die in Europe; they did not die in Asia or in Africa; they did not die in Central America or in the Middle East. They died right here in America, in the American south. I knew these three young men. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this resolution to pay tribute to these three young men and so many others who died in the struggle for voting rights in America. We must never forget their sacrifices, their suffering, their pain, and their death. 
   As Members of the United States House of Representatives, it is our duty, our mission, our mandate to make sure that these three young men did not die in vain.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1906. No one, but no one will pay more taxes under the bill. It merely ensures that multi-millionaires don't add to our tax gap. 
   The bill changes in a very minor way estimated tax payments made by wealthy individuals with incomes of more than $5 million a year. It makes a technical timing change to tax payments made by these individuals. They do not pay more taxes. H.R. 1906 is critical to the pay-as-you-go pledge of this Congress. 
   I am pleased to have supported H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007. For 207 years, Washington, D.C. residents have paid Federal taxes, and for 207 years they have had not a voting representative in the United States Congress. 
   The right to vote is precious. It is sacred. It is the cornerstone of our democracy. 
   Americans sacrificed everything for this right. They were harassed, beaten, jailed and even killed for the right to vote. 
   Not so long ago, many of my friends, many of my colleagues lost their lives. There are many more faceless, nameless heroes who suffered and sacrificed for this basic right. 
   How can we preach this principle around the world and not practice it here in our Nation's Capital? It is the foundation of our democracy. 
   So I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1906. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is an historic day. This is a wonderful day for the people of the District of Columbia. 
   I first came to Washington, Mr. Speaker, in May of 1961 to go on something called the Freedom Rides. It was impossible for blacks and whites to board a Greyhound bus or Trailways bus here in the District of Columbia, and travel together through Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, into Mississippi and to New Orleans. 
   I came back here in 1963 at the age of 23 with Eleanor Holmes Norton, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, to participate in the March on Washington. To be here and see Jack Kemp, an old friend, former colleague, on this day is a great day. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1906. And I want to make it plain and crystal clear that no one, but no one, will pay more taxes under this bill. It changes in a very minor way estimated tax payments made by wealthy individuals. This bill does not increase their taxes. It would affect only 4,000 multimillionaires. It is only a tiny change. 
   Yes, I am going to say it again: I am pleased to have supported H.R. 1905. Today is the day for Washington, D.C. residents to realize the dream that so many take for granted. The 200-year wait is over. The 200-year wait is over. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for H.R. 1906.

   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the Health Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, our seniors are still paying too much for lifesaving prescription drugs, and today we must ease that burden. 
   Seniors should not have to choose between paying for their medicines and paying to heat their homes or putting food on their table, and that is still a decision that too many of our seniors have to make. Seniors saw their premiums go up and their drug prices go up. People living on fixed incomes cannot afford these increases. 
   The big drug companies are the big winners under the prescription drug plan. They are getting a great deal, but the seniors are getting a bad deal, a raw deal. The drug companies' profits increased over $8 billion in the first 6 months of the prescription drug plan, $8 billion, while our seniors and taxpayers pay the bill. It is wrong and it is unnecessary; and today it is our duty, our obligation and a mandate to change that and bring down drug prices. 
   It is common sense to negotiate with drug companies to get lower drug prices. It is very simple. It is not that difficult. The VA does it and HHS has already done it too. 
   It is our duty to our seniors and to the taxpayers to lower drug prices. To do anything less is unfair to our seniors and a waste of money and a gift to the drug companies.

   We cannot wait. We cannot be patient. The American people want an end to this war and end it now.

Volunteers in our National Service Corps are doing the hard work of building what I like to call the Beloved Community--a community at peace with itself based on justice and human dignity. 
   We all live in one house, the American house, and people are suffering. We need so many more Americans to volunteer, to share their talents, their time and their love. That is how we form the Beloved Community. 
   So many Americans are giving of themselves through Americorps/VISTA, Summer of Service, and our Senior Volunteer Corps. Many more want to give and volunteer, but they can't find the time. They are stuck at work trying to make ends meet. They sit in traffic. They are helping their kids with homework. Businesses and governments need to encourage and allow people to volunteer. 
   Young people have been behind all of the great social movements in this Nation. We must tap into the idealism and the talents of our young people, and the young at heart, who can build bridges and ease suffering. 
   Something is happening in America. In Atlanta, we are embracing the merger between the Points of Light Foundation and the ``Hands On'' Network. I want to mention their good work and their leadership in recruiting and training volunteers. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to find more ways, like competitive grants for nonprofits, to expand our volunteer infrastructure, to push our national service agenda forward.

   Where is the humanity, Mr. Speaker? Where are our souls? How can we stand by when hundreds and thousands are suffering every day at the hands of their own government? 
   Today, on the front page of the Washington Post there is an article entitled ``U.S. Promises on Darfur Don't Match Actions''. It highlights our Government's inaction during one of the most horrific human rights disasters of our generation. 
   Every single one of us has a duty to pressure our Government, the United Nations, the world--to act. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan resolution is not about politics. It is not about pushing an agenda forward. 
   We have a moral obligation to stand up for the women and children in Darfur against systematic and unchecked abuse. 
   They have no voice, no government, nobody to stand with them, nobody to stand for them.

   This bill should fully fund the highway trust fund through 2009, but we still need a long-term bipartisan solution. I want to be clear, no money, but no money is spent under this bill. That process is left up to the appropriators. This legislation simply amends the Internal Revenue Code provision only.

   Today I rise to honor and celebrate the 20th anniversary of the National Black Arts Festival. This wonderful festival is taking place right now in my district--the 5th Congressional District of Georgia. 
   Each year, Atlanta welcomes thousands of visitors, artists, and performers who come from across the country and all over the World to take part in the National Black Arts Festival. 
   The two week festival is an incredible showcase of the arts and cultures of the African Diaspora. 
   The National Black Arts Festival has become a leader in arts-education in Atlanta, and across the country organizing special art events for students, including the African American History Quiz Bowl, professional development courses for teachers, and international trips to experience foreign art first hand. 
   The year-long education programs of the National Black Arts Festival help open the eyes of our young people to sculpture, and painting, to music and writing. It opens windows to the world. 
   We must reach more students, and more teachers, from around the country and around the world. 
   I am proud of what the National Black Arts Festival has accomplished over the last 20 years. The sky is the limit for this wonderful organization, led by its talented Executive Producer Stephanie Hughley. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me today to celebrate the National Black Arts Festival, and the rich artistic history and diversity of the African Diaspora throughout the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. (DISASTER TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I support this Disaster Tax Relief Act, and I want to thank my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee, Congressman Kind and Chairman Rangel, for working to bring this bill to the floor today. 
   The Disaster Tax Relief Act addresses deep concerns I had after tornadoes struck Atlanta. Tornadoes touched down right in the heart of Atlanta. They blew the windows out of my very own office. They destroyed sections of neighborhoods and damaged businesses in our city and across Georgia. 
   The damage caused by these tornadoes and storms was no different than the damage caused anywhere else in America this year. If you lose your home or business, a loss is a loss and damage is damage. Yes, some disasters are more severe than others. But when it comes to rebuilding homes and businesses, when it comes to recovery, the tax code should be fair. 
   Some think when floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes strike it means States deserve special treatment based on old politics. Some can overlook natural disasters that have occurred all over our country and try to provide specific disaster tax recovery assistance for just one State and just one tragedy. This is wrong. It is not right. It is not just. 
   This Disaster Tax Relief Act provides fair tax relief and recognizes all disasters, like those in Atlanta, Iowa, Wisconsin, Florida, Kansas, and other places. It also recognizes the role of volunteers performing charity work every day but often in the wake of a disaster. 
   On September 10th I introduced with my good friend and colleague, Jim Ramstad, H.R. 6854, the Fair Deal for Volunteers Act of 2008. Among other things, this bill will increase the standard mileage rate tax deduction from 14 cents a mile to an amount determined by the Secretary of Treasury that is not less than the standard rate used for medical purposes. It is currently 27 cents a mile. 
   With the cost of gas and the precious need for volunteers to keep delivering meals and blankets and supplies, this is the very least we can do. I am proud that so many members of the House and Senate have pushed for this kind of change. I hope we can push harder and pass the entire Fair Deal for Volunteers Act. 
   I thank the staff on the Ways and Means Committee and the Oversight Subcommittee for their good work on this measure.
