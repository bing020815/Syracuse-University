<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. I can only say that I have never heard people who have just won whine so loudly about the fact that they won. They didn't do it when they won the baseball game. I guess if I had a trophy for them, they might be happier. 
   But you are right. My friend, Mr. McCrery, and my friend, Mr. Ryan, are both right. We did solve, in 6331, all of the Rules Committee Democrats, the Republicans voted for it. The majority of the Ways and Means Republicans voted for it. The majority of the Energy and Commerce Republicans voted for it. We solved it. 
   They may be unhappy with the fact that we solved it because most Republicans would like to see Medicare privatized, and this was a plan that did not get enough votes out of the commission to be recommended. A couple of wild hares on the commission suggested it, but they couldn't get enough votes to make it a recommendation. So it has never been. 
   If you wanted to have a trigger for the Defense Department, and you wouldn't, I might support it. But you don't. 
   This is just, the trigger was just a method to try and privatize Medicare and let it wither on the vine. So you won. We have met the requirements in terms of the funds saved in 6331, the Republican speakers have attested to that. 
   So I would say, let's go home. We do have problems in Medicare. We are vastly overpaying Medicare Advantage and getting nothing for it. We are vastly overpaying for the drug benefit because the Republicans wouldn't allow the Secretary to bargain for better prices. The Republicans have frustrated every attempt to save money in Medicare and make it a more efficient system. So I am willing to have that debate any time. And I think we will have to come back and do it. 
   But for now we have satisfied the requirements of the trigger. We were unable to get it done in a timely fashion.

And I think that it is time that we recognize that we, by a vast bipartisan majority, solved the issue, temporarily though it may be, and we will have to revisit it next year to make Medicare a more effective system.

   Mr. STARK. I thank my friend from Florida for yielding, and I just wanted to make a point. It's been suggested several times by my friends across the aisle that over 75 years, the unfunded cost of Medicare, as they calculate it, is $36 trillion. You know what? They're right. 
   But what they don't tell you is by the same calculation, the unfunded cost of the McCain-Bush tax cuts is more than $100 trillion. So if you weren't giving away all of this money to the rich people and all of the Republicans who inherited money from their parents and never had a real job in their lives, maybe we could solve it. It would just take a third of the Bush-McCain tax cuts to solve the unfunded liability for the next 75 years for Medicare. 
   So when you talk about these things, folks, let's include all the other goodies that you're giving away.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, this stimulus package is a small dose of medicinal venom for an economy that has been bitten by the short-sighted, regressive policies pursued by the Bush Administration. While the administration pushed tax cuts for the rich and war without end through a rubber-stamp Congress, the President gutted and stifled the executive agencies that should have been reining in predatory lenders and regulating what became a financial house of cards. 
   I support this package because we must do something to help American families. I am disappointed, however, at the failure to adopt the common sense initiatives that all agree would have the most effect. 
   At this time of economic uncertainty, in which those at the bottom feel pinched the hardest, economists tell us that we must implement relief in the form of stimulus that is timely, targeted, and temporary. For a moment, it appeared that Republicans and Democrats, progressives and conservatives, economists and activists, could actually join in agreement that the best way to help all of us is to help the least of us. We were told that the most ``bang for the buck'' could be accomplished by increasing food stamps, expanding unemployment insurance, and providing additional Medicaid funding for States squeezed by the economic downturn. Somehow though, here we are a week or so later, and none of that is in this package. 
   Never let it be said that the President, or his Republican allies, was derailed from what he wanted to do by common sense, economic sense, or a sense of compassion. The Republicans have a way of seeing every bill that comes before them as a vehicle for gifts to their industry friends, and this stimulus is no different. So instead of more unemployment assistance for those who lost their jobs as a result of this mismanaged economy, we get bonus depreciation for industrial equipment. Instead of more food stamps for families facing record high energy and food costs, we raise the Section 179 Expensing cap. If you don't know what that is, believe me, it's not going to help you. 
   The refundable tax rebate will help average families, and that is why I support this bill. I commend the Speaker for making sure that this rebate includes some of those who did not make enough to pay taxes last year. After all, these people will do what we are asking them to do with these rebates--spend the money to stimulate the economy. 
   Unfortunately, one important group was left out of this rebate. Millions of seniors receive their only income from Social Security. They do not have enough ``earned income'' to receive the refund check, yet they are among our most vulnerable. At a time when we are reaching out to accomplish the dual goals of stimulating the economy and providing relief for those most adversely affected, this omission is glaring. 
   I join my colleagues who call for a second package going forward that would address unemployment, food stamps, Medicaid relief to States, and would help our most vulnerable senior citizens.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, tobacco use is the Nation's leading cause of preventable death, and, without aggressive help from Congress, will continue to be in the foreseeable future. That is why I rise today in strong support of the family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, a bill that will give the FDA extensive new authority to regulate tobacco products. 
   I am alarmed by CDC reports that state that 8.6 million Americans have a serious illness caused by smoking, and that close to 440,000 people in the United States die prematurely from either smoking or contact with secondhand smoke. However, I am particularly shocked by statistics that demonstrate that smoking rates among high school students stayed the same from 2003-2007. With all the awareness campaigns targeted toward youth, this rate should have dropped. These statistics are unacceptable, and it is clear that Congress needs to step in. 
   The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act allows the FDA, among other things, to restrict tobacco advertising and promotions to children, force manufacturers to obtain approval before making reduced-risk product claims, form standards to reduce or eliminate toxic chemicals within tobacco products, and recall unreasonably harmful tobacco products. This piece of legislation is a long sought after bipartisan compromise. 
   I trust that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill. Tobacco does not just affect individuals who smoke; it affects our children's futures and the economic prospects of our Nation. Each year because of tobacco use we lose more than $96 billion in medical costs and $97 billion as a consequence of lost productivity. It's time for us to stamp out this burning cigarette, and voting for the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act will be the first step.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (MICHELLE'S LAW -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of Michelle's Law. This is a small, but important piece of legislation that will give many college students the sense of security that they deserve regarding continuity of their health insurance. 
   One of the most frightening moments in a parent's life is sending his or her child off to college. Yet, as parents, we feel comforted by the unspoken assumption that while at college our children will receive continuous access to health insurance based on their dependent status on our family policies. You can imagine the surprise and distress that AnnMarie Morse felt, then, when she learned that her daughter,  Michelle Morse, after falling ill from colon cancer, would only be covered by health insurance if she maintained a full-time class schedule while undergoing exhausting chemotherapy treatment. Michelle shouldn't have been forced to maintain that schedule--and risk her very recovery--because of her need to maintain her health insurance. 
   Michelle's Law provides needed protections and will help students who are enrolled in college and who only qualify as dependents under their parents' health insurance plans because of their student status. If these students get seriously ill and need to take a physician-certified leave of absence from college for up to a year, they will be able to maintain their coverage under their parent's health insurance. If they graduate before that time is up, their coverage will expire when it normally would have anyway. This is common sense--and will ensure that student-based dependent coverage lives up to its stated goal. No student should be forced to stay in college--and risk ruining their academic standing--because of inability to simultaneously battle their serious illness or injury and maintain their grades. 
   Although this bill is too late to help Michelle, we can still help other children who might one day have to make the choice between forcing themselves to go to school while severely ill or leaving school and trying to pay insurmountable fees. I'm advised that even the health insurance industry supports this bill. Let's stop debating and quickly pass this important piece of legislation. We owe it to our children to ensure that their health coverage is there when they need it most.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to a resolution that does nothing to end the war in Iraq. 
   Does H.R. 3087 call for our troops to immediately be brought home? No, it does not. 
   Does it at least call for redeployment over several months, or even years? 
   No, it does not. 
   Or at the very minimum, does it demand that the Pentagon actually develop and outline to a Congress a strategy on how redeployment might occur? No, it does not. As introduced, the bill would have done so. But in committee, this weak bill became even weaker. 
   There's no there there, if there ever was. 
   All the bill does is require the Department of Defense to report to Congress on the status of planning for redeployment. 
   Let's not kid ourselves about what the result of today's resolution will be. Every 3 months, President Bush's Secretary of Defense would tell Congress that the administration has not and will not develop a plan for the withdrawal of all our brave men and women in uniform. 
   That much I already know. I don't need a Bush lackey to repeat the bad news on a quarterly basis.  
   The only plan President Bush has is to keep our troops in harm's way for years if not decades. He wants to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars abroad while domestic needs go unmet at home. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote against H.R. 3087 and instead support an immediate end to the war in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of clean energy and a clean environment. 
   The Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act, H.R. 6, provides long overdue increases in our fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, CAFE, significant investments in energy efficiency, ending needless tax breaks for giant oil companies, and mandating production of electricity from clean and renewable sources. Although this bill represents real progress, much more must be done in order to avoid the catastrophic consequences of global warming. I urge all of my colleagues to take up this cause and support aggressive efforts to end our dangerous addiction to fossil fuels through a carbon tax. 
   We have not increased CAFE standards since 1975. During the intervening years the price of oil has reached nearly $100 a barrel, our reliance on foreign oil has led to deadly wars and propped up corrupt regimes, and the threat of global warming has become real. The bill before us would increase CAFE standards to 35 mpg by 2020. Although I believe we can and should get there faster, this provision alone will save 1.1 million barrels of oil per day by 2020. That is real progress. 
   With this legislation we also have the opportunity to greatly reduce our use of polluting fuels like coal by mandating that 15 percent of our Nation's electricity be generated from renewable and clean sources such as wind, biomass, and geothermal. Such a change will have the equivalent of removing 20 million cars from our roadways. In addition, this bill will reduce our energy use and save families money by setting strong, new efficiency standards for appliances and promoting carbon-neutral green buildings. These two steps will prevent as much as 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. 
   I am troubled that we are continuing to subsidize and ratchet up corn-based ethanol production. A simple shift from gasoline to ethanol will do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emmissions, but it will eat up open space and continue to drive up food prices. Fortunately, this bill includes some environmental safeguards and directs future production toward advanced biofuels. I urge my colleagues to pay close attention to the effect of ethanol on food prices here and abroad and move quickly to protect families who are squeezed by rapidly rising prices.  
   This bill begins to address the energy and environmental crises caused by the unbridled use of fossil fuels. I urge all of my colleagues to support final passage. We must realize, however, that more fundamental changes, ideally a carbon tax, are needed if we are serious about stopping global warming and becoming truly energy independent.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of this seminal workers' rights legislation is long overdue. 
   During the past decade, union busting efforts have reached new heights. Greedy corporations hire high-priced lawyers and consultants to thwart organization drives and force existing unions out of the workplace. Employees are chastised, threatened and in the worst cases fired for exercising the freedom to form unions and bargain. 
   Business Week called the recent wave of union busting ``one of the most successful anti-union wars ever.'' Their statement is borne out by the fact that only 7.9 percent of the private workforce is unionized, the lowest level since the 1920s. 
   Estimates suggest that 75 percent of all union organizing drives confront hired anti-union consultants. Here's the guarantee offered on one consultant Web site:   
   You don't win, you don't pay. Here is bottom-line proof of our confidence in the persuasiveness of the NLRB Election Campaign Program. If your organization purchases an LRI Guaranteed Winner Package and the union becomes certified, Labor Relation Institute will refund the full cost of the package.   
   Why is collective bargaining so important? Wages for union employees are nearly 30 percent higher than for non-union workers. This wage difference often brings employees into the middle class, ending their struggle to stay above the poverty line. This is especially the case in construction and service jobs where employees in unions have 52 percent and 68 percent higher wages than their non-union counterparts. Unionized workers also enjoy better health care, pension and disability benefits. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act will level the playing field for workers who want to organize, but can't overcome corporate anti-union efforts. This bill provides a majority sign up process to authorize union representation, giving employees the confidence to choose representation without fear of reprisal. The bill also strengthens penalties against employers who engage in union busting activities. 
   While the days of union busting by physical violence may be behind us, the corporate greed that drives union avoidance is clearly alive and well. Our workers deserve better. I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting yes on the Employee Free Choice Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, as my distinguished chairman has suggested, this is a modest proposal, with all due respect to Mr. Swift. I am not proud of the bill or the process. I would say to my distinguished ranking member from the Ways and Means Committee that they were accorded every opportunity at every point to participate in this bill, and they know it. They were not excluded until they decided they did not want to help us pass the CHAMP bill, which was a far better bill. 
   At this point, I have to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have helped us pass a bill that would have added a million additional children. It was a far better bill for children. It would have expanded coverage to legal immigrant children. It was better also for senior citizens. But I also have to thank our leadership and the commitment of Speaker Pelosi to suggest that when we come back, after, as we expect this bill will be vetoed, we will remember that there were a tremendous number of proposals in here which would have helped not only children, but seniors, financial help for low-income seniors, mental health parity for Medicare, improved Medicare benefits and health benefits, preventive care, rural health parity, consumer protections in part D, improved dialysis procedures, protection of Medicare from privatization, and the preservation of the Medicare system by doing away with the excessive spending in Medicare Advantage. 
   The allegiance of groups like AARP, the AMA, Families USA, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the National Committee to Preserve Medicare and Social Security, the AHA, all of whom helped us pass CHAMP, all have been ignored in the bill before us today. 
   I want to make it perfectly clear, I had no part in backing away from not only my commitments, the commitments of many of my colleagues, to these groups or to America's seniors. I know the Speaker will help us return to that commitment and pass those procedures in the future.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 976, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. 
   As many of my colleagues have made clear, this bill is far better than what President Bush prefers. It will provide $35 billion in new funds for the CHIP program, which will enable 6.6 million children to keep their health care at the end of the month and provide coverage to nearly 4 million currently uninsured children. 
   President Bush proclaims to want a ``clean extension'' of the CHIP program, but don't believe him on this any more than you did on weapons of mass destruction, ``mission accomplished'' or take your pick of lies he's told. He knows full well that his proposal would mean taking health care away from needy children. 
   The CHIP program is a block grant so it provides a capped amount of funding to States each year. The existing program is broken. We've already had to pass legislation this year to provide additional funds to keep more than 13 States from dropping children from their CHIP roles. If the President has his way, those States will soon have to take away their health coverage anyway. 
   That's why I'll vote for this bill today. It is better than the status quo--and far better than the direction President Bush wants to take us all with regard to health coverage. 
   But, I am not proud of this bill or this process. 
   On August 1st, we passed a far better bill through the House of Representatives. 
   First, the Children's Health Insurance and Medicare Protection Act, CHAMP, was better for children. It invested $50 billion into the program and covered more than a million children. CHAMP also allowed States to use Federal funds to appropriately expand coverage to legal immigrant children and corrected a misguided regulation issued by the Bush administration on citizenship documentation that forced thousands of American children to lose their health coverage through Medicaid. 
   However, not only was the CHAMP Act better for children, it also provided overdue and much needed improvements to senior citizens and people with disabilities on Medicare. In the House, we combined children with seniors and created a bill that improved the health of our youngest and most needy and our oldest. 
   Unfortunately, Senate Republicans refused to allow our bills to go to conference. They refused to even consider attaching any Medicare provisions to the CHIP reauthorization. As a result, we are here today with a reduced CHIP package that cedes most of the House CHIP reauthorization bill to the Senate's preferred language. 
   I'm also not certain about whether we will really take up Medicare later this year and adopt the important Medicare improvements we passed in the House. 
   All of the following provisions from the CHAMP Act are now at risk: financial help for low-income seniors, Medicare mental health parity, improved Medicare preventive health benefits, prevention of the pending physician payment cuts, rural health parity, consumer protections in Part D, improved dialysis procedures, protection of Medicare from privatization through massive overpayments to private plans, and preservation of the Medicare system. 
   In my opinion, the allegiance of groups like AARP, the AMA, Families USA, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the National Committee to Preserve Medicare, and Social Security and the AHA--which helped us pass CHAMP--have been ignored in the bill before us today. 
   I want to close by making it perfectly clear that I had no part in backing away from my commitments to any Members of Congress, these groups, or to America's seniors in requesting your support for our broader CHAMP Act. I will do everything I can to see all sections of CHAMP become law. I urge my colleagues in the House and advocates across the country to urge leaders in both the House and the Senate to do the same.

Gravely ill Americans are asking their government for help, but President Bush's so-called ``moral'' reservations could again stand in the way of advances in medical science and deny people potentially life-saving cures. 
   I find it ludicrous that the same administration that has submerged the country in a nonsensical and deadly war professes that to make use of stem cells to develop cures is ``morally troubling.'' The President's backwards approach to what he considers progress would be laughable were the consequences of his decisions not so spectacularly detrimental to our country's welfare. 
   What is morally troubling is that Americans who are suffering from Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer, and other deadly diseases cannot place hope in what is becoming an increasingly important field of research. It is morally troubling that friends and family who have suffered the loss of loved ones to painful and drawn-out illnesses cannot depend on our country's leaders to pursue what could be an effective form of disease prevention. 
   Instead of throwing away some 400,000 frozen embryos left over from in vitro fertilization procedures, we should use stem cells from these embryos to better the lives of countless individuals. 
   I urge my colleagues to soundly reject this phony ``culture of life'' and instead support H.R. 3 which promotes and prolongs life. I hope the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act passes with enough support to overcome a likely presidential veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation (CLEAN) Act. This bill eliminates $7.7 billion in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil and gas industry, and raises another $6.3 billion for the Federal Treasury from new royalties on oil and gas removed from Federal waters. This $14 billion is a good down payment on future energy policies that can help eliminate our oil addiction and stop global warming. 
   This bill is a good first step, but I will work with my colleagues to eliminate many of the other unnecessary tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry. Oil companies are enjoying record profits. Every time the price of gas increases, the value of existing tax subsidies increases and they make even more money. At a time of record gas prices and record profits we should not provide tax incentives for exploring, extracting or refining oil and gas. 
   The best ways to eliminate our dependence on oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to lower demand and reduce emissions from power plants and vehicles. For example, fuel economy standards for passenger cars have not been raised since 1985, and even lower ``light truck'' standards encourage manufacturers to produce gas-guzzling SUVs. I support raising fuel economy standards to at least 33 miles per gallon, which would save 1.1 million barrels of oil a day by 2015 and 2.6 million barrels by 2025. Those who say that we can't do any better than 20-year-old technology might also like to trade their DVDs for VHS tapes, cell phones for pay phones, ipods for boomboxes, and then see just how advanced 1980s technology seems today. 
   Eliminating tax subsidies will increase revenues, but we must spend those revenues wisely in our quest for clean renewable energy sources. Incentives for clean coal, ethanol and nuclear are not the answer. We must focus our efforts on promoting advancements in wind, hydrogen, solar and thermal power. These renewable sources can provide significant energy output with minimal environmental impact. 
   I support H.R. 6 and urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for a cleaner America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of increasing fuel efficiency and taking the first steps toward ending our costly addiction to fossil fuels. 
   The Energy Independence and Security Act, H.R. 6, will provide much needed increases in energy efficiency and investments in clean energy and green buildings. Most importantly, for the first time in a generation, this bill will raise the fuel economy, CAFE, standards for new cars and trucks. By increasing CAFE to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 this bill will reduce oil consumption by 1.1 million barrels a day in 2020. This is the equivalent of taking 28 million vehicles off the road. Although I believe we can and should get to 35 mpg faster, this bill represents real progress in our efforts to combat global warming and achieve energy independence. 
   It is no secret that our addiction to oil and coal is having increasingly dire consequences for our Nation and the planet. The price of oil hovers near $100 a barrel. An endless war continues to rage in Iraq while the President continues his saber rattling in the direction of Iran. The specter of catastrophic global warming becomes more real each day. The time to take action is now and this legislation is a good starting point, but we must do more. I agree with the numerous economists and environmentalists who think an aggressive carbon tax is the only sure way to make the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are needed to reduce global warming. A carbon tax must be part of the conversation as we move forward with comprehensive global warming legislation. 
   This bill is not perfect. Republican obstructionists in the Senate have stripped provisions to mandate production of electricity from renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass. They also demanded that giant oil companies maintain their preferential tax status. I am also troubled that we are continuing to subsidize and ratchet up production of corn-  based ethanol, which will do little to ease global warming, but drives up food prices and contributes to water pollution. I hope that the environmental safeguards contained in the Renewable Fuel Standard--which mandates production of 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022--will quickly push production away from corn ethanol and toward advanced cellulosic fuels. In the meantime, we have a responsibility to protect families hit by rising food prices. 
   Despite these shortcomings, this legislation represents real progress for both consumers and the environment. I urge all of my colleagues to embrace this new direction in energy policy and vote ``yes.'' We must realize that this bill is only the beginning and that more fundamental changes are needed if we are serious about addressing global warming and energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of equal rights for all people. No job applicant should be discriminated against because of his or her race, religion, gender, ethnicity, age, disability, political affiliation--or sexual orientation or gender identity. 
   The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA, H.R. 3685) simply modernizes existing non-discrimination law to prohibit discriminatory employment practices on the basis of sexual orientation. 
   Everyone knows that employment discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation occurs daily in our country. Many of us know people who have been the victims of such discrimination. It is wrong and it should be against the law. I'm only sorry it has taken us so long to bring this bill forward. 
   This legislation succeeds in advancing civil rights. However, it still falls short of what  needs to be accomplished. By no means is this bill as inclusive as it should be. It fails to include gender identity as a protected class. I commend Congresswoman BALDWIN for her efforts to include the transgender community in today's legislation. Had her amendment reached a vote on the House floor, I would have proudly supported it. 
   Our Declaration of Independence states that Americans have an inalienable right to liberty and happiness, neither of which can be achieved if equal rights are granted to some and not others. Today's bill continues to leave transgender individuals without equal protection from discrimination. 
   I support this bill because it brings the country one step closer to a prejudice-free workplace, but I implore my colleagues to work toward legislation that guarantees fair employment practices to all people. 
   Most of us look back on America's history and bemoan that women and non-whites had to struggle for rights that should have automatically been granted to them. If we as a Congress cannot stand against discrimination for a group of citizens who simply demand the right to be treated fairly in the workplace, we are no better than past legislators who opposed a woman's right to vote or the right of African Americans to sit in the same section of a bus or restaurant as whites. I urge my colleagues to do what is right and support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to a Peru Free Trade Agreement that is neither free nor fair. Much like the North American and Central American Free Trade Agreements, this agreement will hurt both working families and the environment. 
   Building on the Bush Administration's framework for CAFTA, it promotes the offshoring of high-wage American manufacturing jobs by removing many of the risks firms face when relocating to Peru in pursuit of cheap labor. 
   Much like NAFTA, it enables foreign companies to challenge--in foreign courts--American laws that protect occupational health, safety, and the environment. Already, NAFTA signatories have paid more than $35 million to corporations that have through this provision attacked bans on the use of toxic chemicals, limits on tobacco production and marketing, and regulations on deforestation. 
   In one case that hit particularly close to home, a foreign firm challenged 
   California's ban on the use of polluting gasoline additive MTBE. As a result, American taxpayers were forced to pay more than $3 million in legal fees before the case was eventually dismissed on technical grounds. 
   This agreement also undercuts Congress' authority to ensure American tax dollars are spent to create jobs in America by enabling President Bush to waive existing `Buy America' policies. And it enables foreign firms to challenge American procurement policies designed to promote recycling and renewable energy. 
   That's why numerous American labor, environmental, consumer, faith, family farm, and development groups oppose this agreement. Both of Peru's labor federations, its major indigenous people's organization, and a prominent Archbishop in the country oppose this agreement as well. 
   To be fair, this agreement does significantly improve upon the flawed framework provided of the North American and Central American Free Trade Agreements. For new labor and environmental protections that were absent from prior trade deals, I want to thank and recognize the hard work of my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee. 
   Making measured alterations to the rules of the same old game, however, is the wrong approach. Rather than improve on President Bush's trade agreements at the margins, Democrats can and should set the terms of the President's negotiating authority in a way that honors our commitment to America's workers and the environment. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and unfortunately, I have to urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill. 
   Somebody in the press not so long ago earlier this week said eight out of 10 of my colleagues know nothing about economics or banking, and this bill shows that he was quite right. 
   This bill does nothing but bail out Wall Street and large corporate America. It spends $800 billion that the taxpayers will end up having to pay for, and it does nothing for middle Americans. 
   Is there a crisis in this country? Yes, there is, but there is not a crisis for those people who have been working, trying to pay their bills. There's not a crisis for your average community bank who has no problem with liquidity. There is not a crisis for your credit cards being unable to work. 
   That's Paulson's way to scare us, as Colin Powell tried to scare us some years ago by saying if we didn't vote for an ill-conceived war we'd see terrorists on the streets. 
   We're getting the same kind of misinformation now, the same kind of rush to judgment to tell you that a crisis will occur. It won't. Vote ``no.'' Come back and help work on a bill that will help all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of providing much needed assistance to the millions of workers struggling to make ends meet. 
   Unlike the Wall Street bailout we just passed, extending unemployment benefits will actually help to keep people in their homes. Unlike giving a $700 billion blank check to Henry Paulson, extending unemployment benefits will stimulate the economy and will bring money into local communities. 
   Last month the economy lost 160,000 jobs--the ninth month in a row of job loss. Without congressional action, 800,000 workers are expected to lose their unemployment benefits in October. In my State of California, the unemployment rate is 7.7 percent and climbing. Many of these workers are exhausting their benefits and are unable to find work. This legislation will provide immediate relief to these workers. 
   Today we heard a lot of bluster about Main Street. Make no mistake, people are struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table. Wall Street has already gotten their share; I urge all of my colleagues to make sure that we take this small step to help millions of workers get their share.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   It's an important day, and we've been working to achieve mental health parity for decades. We finally have a bill before us to achieve that goal for more than 160 million Americans. And as my colleagues know, this bill is named for one of its chief proponents, the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, a true champion for all people, especially those suffering from mental illness and addiction disorders. 
   I would like to recognize the efforts of Paul's son, David Wellstone, who has been commuting from California to lobby Members of Congress to help get this bill enacted. His dad would be proud. Wellstone Action is one of the hundreds of groups supporting this legislation. 
   Here in the House, our colleague from Minnesota, Jim Ramstad, and our colleague from Rhode Island, Patrick Kennedy, have been lead advocates. They've done a stunning job getting 273 cosponsors, including 41 Republicans, a real bipartisan feat in this day and age. 
   Enough of the accolades. The real reason we're bringing forth this bill is to end discrimination in health insurance for people with mental illnesses and addiction disorders. It's not a new concept. We took a baby step back in '96, but it wasn't enough. 
   This bill does for our constituents what we already receive through the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. We also passed the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act last summer which would extend mental health parity to Medicare beneficiaries. That bill is still pending in the Senate. 
   Last year, this legislation went through multiple hearings, five markups in three major committees, and the issues are straightforward. Those who oppose true parity may engage in scare tactics or offer red herrings to distract from the underlying issues, but one thing is clear, the bill is better for patients than the Senate bill, yet the cost is almost exactly the same. 
   The passage of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act simply finishes the work we have begun. I look forward to negotiating with the Senate so we can get a bill to the President's desk soon. Tens of millions of Americans are counting on us. 
   I urge support for this overdue legislation.

   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time just to suggest that while costs have been an issue, basically the Senate bill, as I understand it, would be the preferred vehicle for the opposition to this bill, and I would like to just remind my colleagues that the Senate bill and the House bill cost the taxpayers the same amount of money. There is no cost difference between the Senate bill and the House bill. 
   We are talking about a cost to employers, if they pay the entire cost of insurance, of 2 cents out of every $10, hardly a phenomenal cost when you think that the savings in productivity, human lives, and the billions of dollars that we would save in lost time and additional costs from the results of addiction and mental illness would be a bonus for which we don't get scored under our scoring procedures. 
   This is a bill that was first introduced in the Ways and Means Committee, as I recall, almost 20 years ago. I wasn't able to do much with it in 20 years, but my distinguished friends PATRICK KENNEDY and JIM RAMSTAD have been able to do it, and I just want to repeat how proud I am of their tireless work. 
   I hope that we will end the day today for the under-65 population of this country with mental health parity, and that we could come back again later this year or next year to finish this for us older guys in Medicare, so that we can also extend parity for the rest of the Americans. 
   I want to thank all the staffs who have worked so hard, my colleagues on the Health Subcommittee of Ways and Means, my colleagues on Energy and Commerce, my colleagues on Education and Labor. This went through three committees, a feat in itself in this Congress. I think it is a bill that the time has come. We can set aside what minor differences there are, go and negotiate with the Senate for the final bill, and I look forward to its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment. The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) and I are offering this jointly. Very quickly, it makes it mandatory for FEMA to send a first-class mail notification to affected property owners under the flood insurance sections. 
   The notification that they send must include an explanation of the appeal process and contact information for responsible officials with whom they should deal.     
   It's needed because ordinary citizens don't read the Federal Register, and often the announcements are printed in the legal page of newspapers. The first that my constituents have heard about this is from the mortgage lender who tells them they have got 45 days to buy insurance, and they are then precluded from an appeals process, which if they find out at least 90 days beforehand, they have a right to utilize a community appeals process which is far less cumbersome and expensive. 
   I can only suggest in support of the amendment that my good friend Chairman Frank at one point stated when BURTON and STARK get together, you may not like the amendment, but you should save one of the puppies. It is a bill that I think will help make this process simpler for all of our constituents, and I urge the adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 3997, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. 
   President Bush tells us that we face unparalleled financial doom if this $700 billion bailout is not approved today. He and his Treasury Secretary--a former Wall Street fat cat--tell us that we have reached the point of ``crisis.'' That is a familiar line from this President. It sounds like the disastrous rush to war in Iraq and the subsequent stampede to enact the Patriot Act. As I opposed the Iraq War and the Patriot Act, I stand in opposition to his latest rush to judgment. 
   We are not in a sudden crisis. It has been building over the past 8 years of the Bush Administration. Lax oversight of the financial industry ballooned into a house of cards. 
   Homeowners throughout the country have seen property values decline as their mortgage rates adjusted upward. As a result, millions of people across our country have already lost their homes to foreclosure and many more are on the way. 
   It is easy to blame consumers for purchasing homes they couldn't afford. However, these consumers weren't informed of the extreme risk they were assuming. Creative financiers invented a market for these risky mortgages and preyed upon consumers by peddling the American dream of homeownership to make that market flourish. 
   While those were poor choices by consumers, they pale in comparison to the irresponsible bets made on Wall Street. These mortgages and their declining collateral values are the root of this financial crisis. 
   We now face a choice. President Bush tells us we must inject $700 billion into this market to avoid a total meltdown. He and Secretary Paulson say it is the only answer. Many economists--who don't have a financial stake in Wall Street or an 8-year record of bad decisions--tell us it isn't the only choice. An option would be to assist homeowners with their mortgage payments. By making sure these mortgages remain viable, the market should stabilize. 
   The bill before us today is basically the same three-page Wall Street give away first put forth by President Bush. The fig leaf adjustments are not enough to outweigh the fact that, no one knows if this bill is what's needed. I'm not willing to make a $700 billion gamble that President Bush is right after 8 years of seeing all that he's done wrong.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Foster Care Month. Our child welfare system faces severe challenges and this month provides Congress with the opportunity to make needed reforms. 
   Our society has an obligation to ensure that all children are raised in safe and loving environments. For the 500,000 children in foster care, the State is responsible for providing a stable home, through reunification with their families, permanent placements, or adoption. Tragically, we are not doing a very good job. Half of all foster children have been in care for more than a year. A quarter have been in the system for more than 3 years. For foster children that remain in the system and ``age out'' with no family supports, the future is not very bright. For those children, the odds are that they will end up in jail, homeless, or reliant on public assistance. 
   The problems that plague our child welfare system are largely the result of poor Federal and State policy decisions. Luckily, we have the power to reform those policies and directly affect the lives of the hundreds of thousands of children who are counting on us to do the right thing. 
   There are very concrete steps we can take to improve the foster care system. Congress should reform the financing system to make sure that we provide support for every foster child. Currently, the Federal Government supports less than 50 percent of children in care. We can also take steps to improve the child welfare workforce and reduce the number of cases those workers have to handle. A Federal ceiling for the number of cases a worker can handle should be established so that children get the attention needed to keep them safe. In addition, we have to provide better services to the estimated 25,000 children who leave care each year when they turn 18. All of these children should maintain Medicaid eligibility until they are 21 and we should invest further in training, education, and housing assistance for these children.  
   The resolution before us (H. Res. 263) can serve as a stepping stone for real action to protect our children and help them flourish. I am proud to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support a comprehensive energy bill, H.R. 6899, that will help to end our addiction to foreign oil and will move our Nation toward a clean energy economy. 
   For nearly 8 years, we have seen the consequences of policies made by an administration that was literally ``in bed'' with the oil companies, as evidenced by the recent scandal at the Mineral Management Service, MMS. Profits for Exxon-Mobil and others are setting records, while family budgets are stretched to the breaking point by high energy prices. Rather than putting forth real solutions, the President and his congressional Republican enablers have offered a regressive plan and a slick political slogan that amounts to more giveaways to oil companies with nothing that will lower prices in the short-term or move our Nation away from fossil fuel dependence in the long-term. 
   The Democratic Congress, in contrast, has already passed legislation, H.R. 6, to raise fuel economy standards to 35 mpg by 2020--the first increase in a generation. Reaching the 35 mpg threshold will save 1.1 million barrels of oil per day, more than 10 times the amount of oil that offshore drilling will be producing in 2020. By 2030, we will be saving 2.5 million barrels a day, or the same amount that we import from the Persian Gulf. That is a real solution. 
   I agree with the Department of Energy's assessment that expanded drilling will only reduce prices at the pump by 3 or 4 cents and not for another 10 years in the future. However, I support the legislation before us today because it represents a commonsense compromise on drilling that protects the environment and allows individual States to decide whether drilling off their coasts is appropriate. 
   But this legislation is about much more than drilling. It is a comprehensive plan that takes steps to lower gas prices in the near term by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and fully funding energy assistance programs so families can heat and cool their homes. It reigns in the excesses of oil companies and ensures that they pay their fair share back to the taxpayer when they drill on public lands. Accountability will be restored to the scandal plagued MMS by enacting tough new laws with criminal penalties for MMS employees who engage in unethical behavior with the very oil companies they are charged with regulating. 
   Finally, this bill ends our dangerous reliance on fossil fuels and confronts global warming. This legislation establishes a Renewable Portfolio Standard that will mandate 15 percent of electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2020, lowering the demand for coal and other dirty fuels. It makes an $850 million yearly investment in public transportation so that cities and States can expand services. In addition, the legislation will provide incentives for the production of renewable energy and will modernize energy efficiency codes for buildings. 
   The Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act is a real solution to America's energy needs. It may not satisfy the ``drill, baby, drill'' crowd, but after suffering through their failed policies for the last 8 years their slogans are little more than hot air. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in adamant opposition to the National Capital Security & Safety Act as amended. I commend my colleagues Delegate HOLMES-NORTON and Representative Waxman on the work they have done to ensure that the DC City Council remains the leader in enacting the laws necessary to comply with the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. Unfortunately, Mr. Childers' amendment ruins the intent of this legislation and has dire consequences for the Nation's capital. 
   I don't agree with the Supreme Court's decision. Regardless, I do believe that the DC City Council is in the best position to decide what regulations are appropriate for their community. Congress has trampled on the District's autonomy for long enough. The last thing DC needs is Congressional Members to repeatedly and unnecessarily intervene in issues specific to the District of Columbia. 
   Equally problematic and more disturbing are the repercussions of Mr. Childers' amendment. His amendment throws out the DC City Council's emergency handgun regulations and replaces them with so-called regulations that in fact endanger their communities' public safety. His amendment allows for the stockpiling of semiautomatic assault weapons, fully loaded firearms in homes, and discourages the passage of common-sense legislation addressing safe storage requirements or age limits for the possession of assault rifles. 
   The supporters of this amendment are not representing the people of DC, they are representing the gun lobby. The nationwide statistics on deaths caused by intentional and accidental gunfire are extreme to begin with, but Washington DC is rated as the thirteenth most dangerous city in the country, where the homicide rate is almost double the national average. Are the supporters of this amendment representing the families in the District who have lost their loved ones to gun violence? Or  the policemen and women who experience up close the misuse of guns by both kids and adults every day? No. Supporters of this amendment are only supporting the National Rifle Association. 
   We're not living in the 1700s, when governmental police forces were nonexistent and state militias were a constant threat to central government. Supporters of Mr. Childers' amendment need to pull their heads out of the past and face the present: gun violence is an ugly reality, and we're not doing the people of the District of Columbia any favors by considering legislation that will endanger lives under the disguise of protecting constitutional rights. The people who make up this country are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and they certainly can't claim their right to the last two if they lose their lives. That's what guns do--they kill people. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to stand with me in opposing this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of making quality education and health care available to our children. The last 6 years of Republican budgets created numerous human deficits--in health care, education, child care, and social services. This bill takes America in a new direction, beginning to fill those deficits with long overdue investments in Pell Grants, Head Start, public and special education programs and community health centers. 
   President Bush has threatened to veto this bill because he claims it is fiscally irresponsible. Only in an absurd parallel universe, where Iraq really had weapons of mass destruction, would increasing the amount of Pell Grants so that low-income students can afford college be considered irresponsible. Only in a fictional world, where abstinence-only education actually works, could increasing funding for childcare and Head Start be irresponsible. 
   In the real world, these investments will generate valuable returns for--our children and our country. Passage of this bill is essential to repairing the safety net and providing our children with the world class education they need to become engaged and productive citizens. 
   It is critical for the future of public education that the federal government provide states with the support they need to meet the laudable, but difficult goals set by President Bush's own No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB. Unfortunately, the President has negligently underfunded his own law by $50 million. This bill provides a $2 billion increase in K-12 education funding, rejects the President's proposed cuts for special education programs for the 6.9 million students with disabilities, and expands the Child Care Block Grant by $75 million. 
   Today's legislation also takes a small step toward improving our broken health care system, in which tens of millions of people are uninsured or underinsured. It expands access to health care for 1.2 million people by funding community health centers and state health access grants. This bill also makes overdue investments in the National Institutes of Health  by providing funds for 545 new research grants. Such grants fund breakthrough discoveries that can dramatically decrease suffering and disease. 
   I hope my colleagues recognize that this bill paves the way for a healthier, better educated, and more compassionate society and urge them to join me in voting yes.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (SSI EXTENSION FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of assisting immigrants who Congress invited to live in the United States because they were being persecuted in their home countries. 
   Refugees arrive in this country with little more than the clothes on their backs. They often have no family in the United States. For those immigrants who are elderly or have disabilities and cannot work, their sole source of income is often the meager benefits--typically around $600 per month--provided by the SSI program. 
   Under draconian provisions of 1996's so-called ``Welfare Reform'' law, refugess and asylees can only receive SSI benefits for a maximum of 7 years. To date, this law has caused more than 12,000 elderly and disabled humanitarian immigrants to lose their benefits and face hunger and homelessness. The Social Security Administration has estimated that an additional 40,000 individuals will be terminated from assistance in the next 10 years if the law is not changed. Leaving immigrants, who have suffered so much and come to the United States in search of protection, destitute with no means of support is unconscienable. 
   Current law assumes that refugees and asylees can complete the lengthy and expensive citizenship process within 7 years and continue receiving benefits. For most refugees there is a mandatory 5-year waiting period before they can even apply for citizenship. With application backlogs that regularly near 1 million, becoming naturalized within 7 years is a longshot at best. Acquiring the skills needed to pass the citizenship test, such as English language proficiency, may be impossible for immigrants with severe disabilities. 
   The SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act (H.R. 2608) takes the common sense and compassionate approach of temporarily extending the time limit by 2 years. This will provide relief to thousands of individuals facing the loss of their sole source of support. 
   While this bill is the best we can do given the present fiscal environment, we should move toward completely removing the time limits. Doing so would bring us into compliance with International Conventions requiring nations to accord lawful refugees the same access to public benefits that they allow their own citizens. In addition, it would build on our Nation's tradition of opening our borders to immigrants escaping persecution and suffering.  
   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, but I hope everyone recognizes that this bill only represents a partial fix.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This bill provides the largest single investment in higher education since the  Montgomery GI Bill of 1944, with no new cost to taxpayers. 
   Today, Federal financial aid programs fail to meet the needs of many students. That means a college education is unattainable for many young people. Public university students can only expect one-third of the cost of attendance at a 4-year institution to be covered by the Pell grant, down from two-thirds of the cost covered in 1980. This bill makes higher education more affordable by increasing the maximum Pell grant by $500 and increasing the number of eligible students by over half a million. These improvements are long overdue. 
   In addition to strengthening Pell grants, this bill builds on other existing Federal student aid programs to help provide our next generation with a chance to succeed. It lowers Federal loan interest rates to improve accessibility and ease the growing debt burden of graduates. In 2004, one-fourth of all graduating students with loans carried more than $25,000 in loan debt. Perversely, last year the Republican-controlled Congress enacted the largest reduction ever to Federal student aid programs to finance tax cuts for the rich. The College Cost Reduction Act--H.R. 2669--begins to reverse failed Republican policies by reducing the Federal interest rate on student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over 5 years. 
   We must strengthen our education system if we hope to compete in a global economy. In addition to making college more financially feasible, careers in public service need to be rewarded. Quality elementary and secondary teachers are essential to our public school system, but in 2003-2004 their median salary was only $31,704. Teachers deserve more than pats on the back. This bill provides upfront tuition assistance for aspiring educators who commit to teaching high-need subjects in underperforming schools. 
   This bill pays for itself by reducing some of the massive fees paid to the scandal-plagued student loan industry. Instead of subsidizing the profits of lenders, this bill puts money in the hands of low- and middle-income students. Not surprisingly, President Bush is siding with the big lenders and he's threatened to veto this essential legislation. He and the Republicans in Congress continue to obstruct real progress in education and almost every other domestic priority. 
   We must address the rising cost of higher education, reinvest in our schools by attracting new teachers, and cultivate the next generation of American leaders. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for America's future and supporting this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act. For far too long, working class Americans have been struggling to make ends meet at $5.15 an hour, a wage that leaves a family of three more than $6,000 below the poverty line. Today we can make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans by increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour. 
   In 1997, the last time the minimum wage was raised, $5.15 went a lot further than it does today. A gallon of gas cost $1.27 and a loaf of bread was only $0.88. It may not seem to most like $2.29 for a gallon of gas or $1.14 for a loaf of bread is too much, but tell that to the minimum wage worker with gross weekly income of only $206. They still have to drive to work and put food on the table, which is nearly impossible at $5.15 an hour without multiple incomes or a second job. 
   For years, states have responded to the inadequacy of the federal minimum wage by passing higher minimum wages. Those states haven't lost employers or faced higher than normal unemployment because of higher minimum wages. Small businesses in California, for example, haven't gone broke because of the high state minimum wage. The argument that small businesses can't afford to pay the minimum wage is fallacy. Organizations making that argument are probably paying a lot more than $7.25 an hour to their snake oil salesmen. 
   Some argue that increasing the minimum wage is paramount to the government engaging in class warfare. One of the richest men in the world, Warren Buffet, doesn't see it that way. ``There's class warfare, all right,'' Mr. Buffett said, ``but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.'' Failure to pass a minimum wage increase would be a huge victory in the class warfare by the wealthy against hard working Americans. 
   Since 1997, Members of Congress have increased our salaries by 24 percent. We can't look our hard working constituents in the eye and honestly say we deserve big pay raises and they don't. Today we can give a raise to someone other than ourselves for a change and have a positive impact on millions of working poor in this country. I strongly urge all my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 2.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of making higher education more affordable. Access to college is absolutely necessary if our country is to fulfill its promise of economic, social, and political inclusiveness for all individuals. By cutting interest rates in half on needs-based student loans, we will make college more accessible to hundreds of thousands of students from low- and middle-income families. 
   Last November, the American people sent a clear and powerful message. They are tired of  business as usual in Washington. Instead of economic policies that help the rich get richer, they want education policies that will help their children to realize an American dream that is increasingly difficult to come by. Since 2001, college costs have risen by 41 percent. According to the Department of Education, such increases put college out of reach for as many as 200,000 would-be students a year. Rising costs have also forced more and more students to rely on loans to pay for college, which now saddle the average graduate with $17,500 in Federal student loan debt. 
   The College Student Relief Act, H.R. 5, offers real relief to students priced out of college and burdened by debt. According to USPIRG, my home State of California has 228,500 subsidized loan borrowers. This bill will save the average California student enrolling in college this fall $2,490. When fully implemented, it will save the average student who starts college in 2011 $4,830. 
   Today's legislation is an important first step in what I hope will be an ongoing effort to make college more affordable. This effort should include raising the maximum Pell Grant amount and exploring other policies to open the doors to college to a larger slice of our society. Our guiding principle should be ensuring that all students who meet academic requirements for undergraduate study can afford to attend college, not just those from wealthy families. 
   I urge my colleagues to heed the voice of the American people and take this initial step toward making higher education accessible to all.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF FORMER REPRESENTATIVE AUGUSTUS FREEMAN (GUS) HAWKINS OF CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, it is often as the dean of the California delegation a sad duty to report the passing of a colleague, but I have to say today that I want to announce and celebrate with you the life of a distinguished former colleague who died last Saturday at 100 years of age. Augustus Freeman Hawkins had a 28-year career in this body, and I just briefly want to celebrate with you the accomplishments of this gentleman. 
   Gus, as we all knew him, was born in Shreveport, Louisiana on August 31, 1907, about the same time my dad was born in California. He moved to Los Angeles. He was elected to the State assembly in 1935. He was elected to Congress in 1962, and served here 28 years. 
   During that 28-year service, he chaired the House Administration Committee, he chaired the Committee on Education and Labor, a whole host of joint committees, Printing, the Library Committee, and decided not to run for reelection in 1990. But among his many accomplishments, and Gus authored more than 300 State and Federal laws in his career, but what he will be most known for, I think, is authoring title VII of the Civil Rights Act which created the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. 
   He was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He sponsored and was noted and will be remembered most perhaps for the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act that he sponsored with Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota at that time. 
   I just want to pay tribute to one of the great careers of one of our great colleagues. 
   I yield to the gentleman from California.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (TMA, ABSTINENCE EDUCATION, AND QI PROGRAMS EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The Ways and Means Committee has an interest in several of the issues in this bill, and we support the bill. The protection of low-income seniors in Medicare deals with people between $12,252 and $13,782 in income. And when their part B premium is $1,122, they need that protection, and extends that through December 31. 
   The Abstinence Education program is one that is very important to the Democrats. We've extended it on the theory that if we really enforce this abstinence education, there will be fewer Republicans. So, we support that big time. 
   The Hospital Perspective Payment System regulation is one of the most important to our hospital community, and we have changed the way we will collect the funds from the hospitals and not collect it all up front. We will collect part of it up front, and then wait until later in the 5-year cycle to see how they behave to collect the balance, which will create less of a financial burden on the hospitals across the country. 
   I thank all the people who have worked to make this more acceptable for the hospitals.  
   The 2008 final regulation that governs inpatient hospital payments under Medicare makes important, long-overdue refinements to the system by differentiating payments based on the severity of illness. 
   In doing so, practice shows that hospital payments are likely to increase hospitals will get smarter about how the document and code their patient cases. There is nothing inappropriate about this behavior, but in order to remain budget neutral, the regulation includes a ``behavioral offset''. The offset was designed to counterbalance the increased spending expected from using the severity-adjusted payments. 
   I want to be clear that the Committee supports both efforts in the regulation--moving to severity-adjusted groupings and the so-called ``behavioral offset.'' However, the regulation includes a prospective adjustment. 
   Questions have been raised about the size of the adjustment and whether it should be prospective or retrospective. Those are fair questions, and it seems that a retrospective adjustment would make a lot of sense. However, we are advised it may take CMS up to two years to gather the necessary data. 
   Given historical payment and coding patterns, we feel it is appropriate to have an interim policy--rather than simply voiding this part of the regulation. As such, this legislation requires a reduction of 0.6 percent in 2008 and 0.9 percent in 2009. 
   Even with that ``down payment'' from the hospitals, we are concerned that the data in 2010 could indicate a need for a substantial reduction to fully recoup the extra spending that occurs in the next two years. I want to be clear that we have talked with hospitals about this possibility and raised with them the difficulty of addressing that when the time comes. This exercise may simply be forestalling the inevitable, not erasing an unwanted reduction. 
   We are limiting the amount of the offset now, in order to spread out the payments over time. When that time comes, I do not want to hear complaints about the eventual amount of this adjustment when it comes on-line down the road.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES GIFT OF LIFE MEDAL ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of the ``Stephanie Tubbs Jones Gift of Life Medal Act of 2008,'' and to thank the many colleagues and friends of Stephanie's who joined together to bring this bill to the floor. 
   Stephanie's life ended as she lived it; by exemplifying concern for the welfare of others. She donated her organs in the waning hours of her life so that the lives of others could continue. In that spirit, this bill creates a commemorative medal for organ donors and their families, recognizing the brave and selfless act of organ donation. 
   The need for organ donation is critical. Since the national transplant waiting list began, more than 80,000 donation-eligible Americans have died waiting for an organ to become available; in 2007 alone, more than 6,500 people died for lack of a suitable organ. 
   As an active member of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, Stephanie worked tirelessly to remedy health disparities in our nation. Organ donation is one area where dramatic health disparities exist, which makes this all the more of a fitting tribute. 
   While minorities donate organs in proportion to their population, the rate of organ donations fails to keep pace with the need for transplants in the population. Minority populations account for close to 50% of the people who are currently waiting for organ transplants. 
   I'd like to take a moment to recognize the help of former Senate Majority Leader and transplant surgeon Dr. Bill Frist, for whom this bill was named for when it was introduced earlier this year. Dr. Frist is a tireless advocate of organ donors and their families, and worked on behalf of the Gift of Life Medal Act. I appreciate his graciousness in expressing his strong support for renaming the bill, and I would ask the Chair to have Dr. Frist's letter of support inserted into the RECORD. 
   I ask my colleagues to help bring an end to transplant waiting lists and recognize the enormous courage displayed by organ donors and their families. This bill honors these brave acts, while publicizing the critical need for increased organ donation, and pays tribute to the selflessness and memory of our colleague. Stephanie's dedication to improving health care should be permanently recognized. I urge passage of the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Gift of Life Medal Act.   
   NASHVILLE, TN, September 15, 2008. Hon. Pete Stark, Chairman, Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.  Hon. DAVE CAMP,  Ranking Member, Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, Cannon House Office Building, Washington, DC.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of ending senseless tax breaks and subsidies for giant oil and gas companies and making needed investments in clean energy and efficiency. Although I support the energy package before us today, I urge my colleagues to realize that this is a small, first step. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done to confront global warming and shift our nation away from our addiction to fossil fuels. 
   Today we have an opportunity to greatly increase energy conservation by setting new efficiency standards for appliances and promoting carbon-neutral green buildings. These two steps will prevent as much as 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. In addition to these measures, I strongly support the Udall-Platts amendment to establish a Renewable Electricity Standard, which will ensure that 15 percent of our electricity is produced through renewable sources by 2020. 
   In 2006 the top five oil companies raked in record-breaking profits of over $119 billion. As President Bush himself has admitted, there is no need to give oil companies taxpayer-funded subsidies when the price of oil is at or near all time highs. I support the tax portion of the package that ends $16 billion in tax breaks for companies like Exxon/Mobil and closes the ridiculous loophole that has allowed business owners a $25,000 deduction for purchasing a gaz-guzzling Hummer. The savings generated are then invested in developing clean energy. 
   My support for the energy package is tempered by the fact that it does not include any increase in our woefully out-of-date CAFE standards. I am also troubled that we are continuing to subsidize corn-based ethanol production. A simple shift from gasoline to ethanol will do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it will eat up open space and continue to drive up food prices. 
   Both bills make important progress and I urge my colleagues to support them. However, larger changes, such as a carbon tax, are needed if we are serious about stopping global warming.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (KIDS IN DISASTERS WELL-BEING, SAFETY, AND HEALTH ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of legislation aimed at protecting children during and after disasters. Our current emergency management system is not  prepared to meet the unique needs of children. The ``Kids in Disasters Well-being, Safety, and Health Act'' (H.R. 3495) represents major progress in fixing this unacceptable situation. 
   The most important role of government is protecting the health and welfare of families. This is a role that the government must not privatize, contract out, or provide only to the wealthy and well connected. 
   Unfortunately, as we all witnessed after Hurricane Katrina, the government failed miserably to protect the most vulnerable, particularly children. It is unclear to me whether this failure was the result negligence or incompetence. Perhaps it was the natural result of running a government using a radical ideology that believes government shouldn't work. 
   What is clear to me is that this body has an obligation to make sure government works and finds ways to help families get back on their feet after disasters. My home state of California is no stranger to disasters: earthquakes, fires, flooding, and mudslides--we've got it all. During the last several weeks, wildfires ravaged Southern California. Just after the worst of the fires, 1300 childcare centers were closed, affecting over 16,000 children. These are children of first responders, teachers, and others that have to get back to work to make sure that the community can rebuild. 
   We should know if we are doing enough to help these families. We should know if FEMA is doing a good job of assisting those childcare centers to reopen. We should know if we are doing a good job of helping missing children to locate their parents. Local communities and governments should have access to the information and resources they need to ensure that children's needs are taken care of. 
   This bill will help to fill an enormous gap in our disaster preparedness system. There is currently no agency charged with safeguarding children in the aftermath of a disaster or coordinating the efforts of various levels of government. This bill will begin to close this gap by establishing a National Resource Center for Federal, State, local, and tribal governments as well as NGOs to use to address the needs of children before, during, and after disasters. It will also establish a commission to examine our past failures and make specific recommendations on how to correct those. 
   Our children are looking to us to take action. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.

It is up to a handful of Republicans to say yes to the voters and no to the Christian Right so we can pass this bill by a veto-proof majority.

   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend and colleague, MIKE MCNULTY (NY-21), who is retiring after 10 terms in Congress. 
   With nearly 40 years in elective public office, MIKE has served his community as a local leader, a member of the state legislature, and its representative in Congress. 
   During his Congressional service, I have been privileged to work by his side on the Ways and Means Committee. On our Committee, MIKE can always be counted on to stand up for the interests of working families, senior citizens, and people with disabilities. 
   Most recently, as Chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee, MIKE has been a leader in protecting Social Security from Republican attempts to privatize it. He's also initiated improvements to the program as well. For example, in this Congress, Chairman MCNULTY was able to secure $150 million in additional funding for the Social Security Administration to lessen the backlog of cases and better serve beneficiaries. 
   While MIKE has never been one to reach for the headlines, when it came to speak up for seniors and the middle class, MIKE's voice was always heard loud and clear. We will miss MIKE's friendship and his steady leadership in Congress. The people of upstate New York are losing an outstanding representative, and we are all grateful for his lifetime of service to his community and our Nation.

   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the House's changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, Amendments Act. After 8 long years of watching Republicans kowtow to the President's tyrannical policies, I am only too happy to stand by a bill that will hold his administration accountable to some of their past actions and prevent future administrations from abusing our civil liberties. 
   Our government was designed to be of the people, by the people, and for the people. But under President Bush, it has been a government of the executive branch, by the executive branch, and for the executive branch. The Administration's so-called ``security measures''--tapping phones, obtaining personal records, and spying without warrants--have undermined basic freedoms and diminished trust in government. 
   It will take a great deal of time to clean up the mess left by this administration. We can take an important step forward today by giving telecommunications companies their day in court and establishing strict restrictions to prevent the government from spying whenever and on whomever it pleases. By voting for this bill, we make it clear that we won't let the President make a quick escape from Washington without bringing his transgressions to light. Rather than hide behind the threat of terrorism to justify illegal activities, as past Congresses have done, we will defend the constitutional rights of our constituents. 
   The Bush administration has tried its hardest to convince us that our country's most basic tenets are unattainable. It believes that in order to protect life, we must sacrifice liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That line of thought is wrong, President Bush is wrong, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and show that they are above the executive branch's scare tactics.

   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Much has been said by the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, by the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee on how this bill helps Americans. Five million kids will receive medical coverage insurance that they don't now have. Seniors will receive preventative care with no copayments. They will receive mental health care at parity. Rural benefits will be extended to the rural communities that need assistance for access to their population. Low-income seniors will receive assistance in paying for their co-pays and their premiums. 
   This bill is fully funded over 10 years, something my Republican colleagues never did in the past. I want to remind my colleagues that there are many myths being floated around here today. It is important to note that 83 of my Republican friends in 1997 voted for an identical bill. The bill that they voted on has the exact same income eligibility that was passed in 1997. The minority leader, the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee on the Ways and Means Committee, all voted for this and included a cigarette tax to pay for it. 
   And I might added that the reductions that they put in their Medicare bill were five times greater than the adjustments we made in the bill today. It included an increase in the Federal tobacco tax. 
   Now I don't know what has changed. Maybe they have learned to hate children in the interim, but nothing has changed in the eligibility. It is the same bill. If it was good for you, then it is better now. And it does a fair thing. 
   The public is sick of radical ranting. They want health care for kids and seniors, and the way to get that is to support the bill before us today.

   Our laws should reflect the reality that hate crimes are fundamentally different from ordinary crimes. Hate crimes cause entire communities to live in fear of being attacked simply because of who they are. Hate crimes are meant to send a message and terrorize an entire group of people, not just an individual victim. 
   Hate crimes are a national issue and should be dealt with at the national level. In 2005, more than 7,000 hate crimes were reported to the FBI. Even this high number is certainly lower than the actual numbers of crimes committed all across America, as many go unreported and the FBI does not receive information from all law enforcement agencies. 
   The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007 (H.R. 1592) recognizes the need for a federal response and allocates the necessary resources to investigate and prosecute hate crimes when local officials are unable or unwilling to investigate incidents of hate crime. Local authorities, however, would maintain their autonomy and primary authority for these investigations. Federal intervention would be the last resort. 
   The bill also removes existing barriers that prohibit the FBI and the Department of Justice from fully assisting local law enforcement agencies in addressing hate crimes. This is vital because local governments often lack the resources necessary to properly conduct expensive hate crimes investigations and prosecutions. For example, the investigation of the Matthew Shepard murder in Wyoming cost over $150,000 and resulted in lay-offs at the local Sheriff's department. 
   Congress has a moral and constitutional obligation to offer the full protection of our Nation's laws to all individuals. This vital legislation expands existing hate crime protections to those who are targeted because of their gender, disability, or sexual orientation. These groups have been frequent targets of hate crimes. According to the FBI, 14 percent of reported hate crimes are motivated by sexual-orientation bias. 
   I fully support this bill. But I feel compelled to also note that it fails to address the growing number of hate crimes being committed against homeless individuals. The National Coalition for the Homeless has documented 614 hate crimes against homeless individuals since 1999, including 189 deaths. Some of these crimes against society's most vulnerable have been caught on tape, giving us a glimpse into the violence and fear of violence that many homeless people experience on a daily basis. I hope that this body will work to bring the issue of hate crimes against homeless individuals to light and move toward protections that recognize the value of all of our neighbors, including those lacking shelter. 
   Hate crimes impact all of us and it is our collective responsibility to actively confront the terror they cause. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Improving Head Start Act of 2007 (H.R. 1429). 
   Since 1965, Head Start has served millions of low-income families and helped children prepare for school. It is an essential program and one whose success has a major impact on children, their families, their community, and ultimately the future of our country. We owe it to our children to pass this bill and make improvements that strengthen and grow the Head Start program. 
   Scientific research shows us that 80 percent of brain development occurs by age 3 and 90 percent by age 5. Studies also show that education achievement gaps between poor and minority students and affluent and non-minority students are already in place when children begin elementary school. These achievement gaps, once in place, tend to persist and are exceedingly difficult to remedy. Head Start and Early Head Start are effective in closing achievement gaps and foster both short and long-term success in participating children. 
   In addition to preparing children for success in school, recent research clearly demonstrates that children enrolled in Early Head Start and their parents realize other very significant gains. Early Head Start children show better approaches to learning, demonstrate more appropriate language acquisition, and exhibit less aggressive behavior. Early Head Start parents create a stronger home environment with more parent-child reading and a greater repertoire of discipline strategies. Early Head Start parents also show significant progress toward economic self-sufficiency. These impacts are significant and result in children with increased linguistic, cognitive, social and emotional competence. What better investment could we be making for our children? 
   Unlike programs dreamed up by ideologues in the Bush Administration like ``abstinence only education'' and ``marriage promotion,'' we know that Head Start works. Unfortunately, less than half of eligible children are enrolled in Head Start. Even worse, less than 5 percent of eligible infants and toddlers are enrolled in Early Head Start. 
   If we are serious about providing all children with an opportunity to succeed in school and in life, we must expand Head Start and particularly Early Head Start. This bill is a step in that direction. It will more than double the amount of money available to Early Head Start programs. The bill will also expand services to infants and toddlers that are so crucial to child development, but often difficult for parents to access. In addition, the Improving Head Start Act will increase eligibility levels so that children from families making up to 130 percent of the Federal poverty level can participate. This change is especially important in areas of the country with high costs of living, including my district where the poverty threshold is well below what it actually costs a family to live. 
   This bill's expansion of Early Head Start and Head Start should be applauded. We cannot lose sight, however, that these programs only address the tip of the iceberg. This Congress must focus more of our attention on all children birth to age 5 and guarantee that all families have access to high quality comprehensive early care and education programs. This is an investment that our country must make if we are serious about giving all of our children a chance at the American dream. 
   Despite the strong bipartisan support for this legislation, the White House has indicated that the President does not support this legislation as written unless we insert a special interest provision for the religious right. The President and many Republicans want to allow religious organizations to discriminate in their hiring practices. Religious organizations have been Head Start providers since the program was established and have done quite well playing by the same rules that prohibit all employers from discriminating. Pandering rhetoric and veiled threats from the White House will not improve the life of a single family. 
   In closing, I hope that all of my colleagues will see the importance of investing in our children and supporting families. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation and a ``no'' vote on Republican attempts to turn this into a vehicle for religious discrimination.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of cleaning up the Republicans' mess. The previous Congress failed to pass 9 of 11 appropriations bills, creating the worst budget mess since the Government shut down in 1996. 
   Today's resolution is far from perfect. But while adhering to the spending limit in the Republican budget, it provides significant funding increases to several important programs. 
   First, the continuing resolution for fiscal year 2007 provides housing assistance to 227,000 people through a $1.4 billion increase for section 8 housing programs. Second, it finances construction of hundreds of new community health centers and improvements to existing facilities. Third, today's bill increases funding for Head Start by $104 million to help prevent a drop in enrollments. Fourth, it raises the maximum Pell grant by $260, which will help more than 5.3 million students afford college. 
   It's time to get to work on the people's business. Cleaning up a mess is never fun, but because Republicans failed to take ``personal responsibility'' for this year's budget, it is necessary. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

   Specific learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, are neurologically based impairments that substantially limit the way these individuals perform major life activities, like reading or learning, or the time it takes to perform such activities often referred to as the condition, manner, or duration. 
   This legislation will reestablish coverage for these individuals by ensuring that the definition of this ability is broadly construed and the determination does not consider the use of mitigating measures. 
   Given this, would the chairman agree that these amendments support the finding in Bartlett v. New York State Board of Law Examiners in which the court held that in determining whether the plaintiff was substantially limited with respect to reading, Bartlett's ability to ``self-accommodate'' should not be taken into consideration when determining whether she was protected by the ADA?

So I would like to thank Grandpa McDermott and Grandpa Weller on behalf of these 500,000 children whose lives are being improved, and Grandma Tauscher, for  helping see that these children's lives are improved. 
   I was lucky enough to have Cherita Jones, a former foster youth, as an intern in my office earlier this year. Cherita worked hard and was lucky to live with a caring foster family. She is now out working as an advocate for foster children. I am proud that we are taking this step here today. 
   This bill does, in fact, continue foster children's care beyond age 18, and it further allows relatives, grandparents, to participate in supporting the foster children and allows them in many cases to live in loving homes rather than group homes and less permanent settings. 
   I hope we can continue to work together to improve their lives, and I look forward to working with Chairman McDermott to protect the Social Security benefits of foster children and make sure that these resources are used for the benefit of these children and not as a funding source for general revenue to many States. I urge the adoption of the bill.

   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great sadness to mourn the passing of my good friend and colleague, Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   While serving with Stephanie on the Ways and Means Committee, and more closely on the Health Subcommittee, I experienced firsthand what a fierce and effective advocate she was in Congress. She was an uncompromising champion for health care as a right for everyone. Her constant effort highlighting the disparities in our health care system and her tireless work on behalf of End-Stage Renal Disease patients made her an outstanding representative. She is, in a word, irreplaceable. 
   Her spirited advocacy and commitment to justice and fairness were accompanied by warmth and strong loyalty. Those who worked closely with her were privileged to see both her intense passion and joy for her work. 
   I extend my sincerest condolences to her son Mervyn and her sister Barbara, and the many women and men who counted her among their family and friends. As a colleague and friend, I am honored to have served beside her. She will be sorely missed.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-62) -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. I just want to remind my colleagues that we are dealing with a President who has a very short memory. Just 2 days ago, he proclaimed October 1 as Child Health Day 2007. Today, he just trashed that. I don't know what he thought he was doing when he talked about improving the lives of children and preventing and reducing the cost of disease and promoting community health, because he is just following a position that denies 1 million kids the right to health care. 
   So I hope, Mr. President, that you certainly don't proclaim a Protect Congress Day, or we are all in deep trouble. 
   This veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program compromise legislation is finally showing the American people the President's true priorities. He is a war President. All he cares about is war and more war. The previous speaker on our side talked about $190 billion for the war in Iraq, and these funds aren't paid for. They add to the deficit. In addition to our children having to look around for health care, they are going to have to look around to pay for that illegal war. 
   Simultaneously voting to extend a State Children's Health Insurance Program would be a good program. We would extend health care to nearly 4 million children, and the President is cutting a million off that cost a fraction of his illegal war. It is fully paid for and doesn't increase the deficit one penny. It passed both the House and the Senate with strong bipartisan majorities. 
   What's wrong with our Republican minority? Why do they insist on denying 1 million children, kicking them off the rolls of SCHIP? Why do they scorn in the face of 43 of the Nation's Governors who have written to the President and argued against his vetoing this bill? 
   President Bush says he has his own plan. I don't know if he had that when he declared October 1 as Child Health Day. Whatever that plan is, it would cause millions of children to lose their health care. My own Republican Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, estimates that the President's plan would cause 1 million children to be denied health care in California by the year 2012. 
   This is a matter of life and death for our children's insurance. Children with health care do better in school, in life, and have their illnesses caught before it is too late. Ladies and gentlemen, the axis of evil is not just in the Middle East. It is right down here on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject the President's veto, have a compromise bill to assure the health of America's children and make sure that that is put ahead of some obscure, extreme, radical ideology. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of pay equity. 
   The rationale for the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007 should be obvious. All people, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, and religious or sexual orientation, should receive equal pay for equal work. 
   Unfortunately, that is not the case today in America. African-Americans make only 77 cents for every dollar made by men, black families make about 60 cents of every dollar made by whites, and gays, lesbians and other minorities regularly face discrimination in the workplace. 
   The Supreme Court's recent decision makes it incredibly difficult for employees to challenge acts of discrimination. The decision limits to six months the period in which victims can challenge their employers and be compensated for discrimination. 
   Such a time limit was insufficient for Lily Ledbetter, whose pay slowly slipped in comparison to the pay of her male coworkers over a period of nineteen years. It would also be insufficient for millions of other workers, who often learn of pay discrimination only after the fact. The majority of companies do not release information on comparable salaries, making it, difficult if not impossible for employees to determine if wage discrimination is taking place. 
   In a typicaly shortsighted move, Bush has threatened to veto this bill on the grounds of preventing frivolous lawsuits. The word ``frivolous'' can be used to describe many things, but it most certainly cannot be used to describe a bill that brings the people of this country a step closer to the equality that they deserve. For someone who claims he wants to spread the principles of equality and democracy to the people of the Middle East, it is unfathomable that he would fail to uphold these ideals for the people of this country. 
   As representatives of a country that was founded on the idea of equality for all, there is no excuse for denying citizens the opportunity to contest acts of discrimination. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I would add my congratulations and praise to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) for the work that they have done to bring this bill finally to the floor for passage. It is a bill that has languished for over a decade. It is good to see that times have changed. We moved expeditiously last year through three committees and on to the floor, and it will leave this chamber today and head to the White House for the President's signature. It is a small but long overdue step toward approving our health care system and preventing employment discrimination, and ensures that our laws governing patients' rights are as current as the latest medical technology. 
   Simply stated, the legislation provides peace of mind, and encourages people to take advantage of the miracles of modern medicine without fear of reprisal or consequences at work or in health care or in qualifying for insurance. 
   GINA, as it is known, prohibits insurers and employees from using the genetic information to discriminate. Thus, a woman who has decided to find out whether she carries the breast cancer gene need not worry about losing her job or health insurance merely because she sought the test. Enactment of this law is critical to protect patients and is needed to encourage people to use robust genetic research and to encourage more research. Additional research will help us determine when we men will get colon cancer or prostate cancer, and not be afraid to go and receive those tests for fear of being discriminated against. 
   This legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support of more than 500 groups representing patients, employees, physicians, providers, and others who value the protection that this legislation provides. I urge strong support for this bill. 
   I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield the balance of our time for the Ways and Means Committee to the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), and that he control the balance of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my colleagues to once again support legislation that would take a modest first step towards a rational energy policy. By ``rational,'' I mean that this bill employs the revolutionary concept that legislation should be crafted with the American people in mind, rather than huge multinational oil companies. By ``modest,'' I mean that we have much more work to do to confront global warming and wean our Nation off our addiction to fossil fuels. 
   The headlines tell a somber story of an economy on the brink. Earlier today, oil reached an all-time high of $102 a barrel. The International Herald Tribune reported that we can expect to see gas cost more than $4 a  gallon this spring. And the Washington Post this morning quoted an economist who announced that ``We're in stagflation, and it's going to get worse.'' 
   Not everyone is singing the blues, however. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Exxon Mobil once again set the record for the highest profits ever recorded by a single company, with a net income of $40.6 billion. As reported by the Times, Exxon made $1,287 of profit per second in 2007. Through loopholes in our tax code, taxpayers subsidized much of that profit. 
   I support the tax portion of this package that ends the over $16 billion in tax breaks for companies like Exxon-Mobil. Today's bill also closes a ridiculous loophole that allows business owners to claim $25,000 deductions for each gaz-guzzling Hummer they purchase. The savings generated are then invested in developing clean energy. 
   The bill before us today makes important progress and I once again urge my colleagues to support it. Tinkering with the tax code, however, will only get us so far. We must be prepared to take bold action to combat global warming by engaging with the rest of the world and adopting either a progressive carbon tax or a robust cap and trade policy.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Chairman, there is no excuse for the wage gap that still exists between men and women in today's workforce. Equalizing wages will provide women with equal pay for equal work and improve the standard of living for millions of American families. That is why I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
   The need for the reform of the Equal Pay Act (EPA) is obvious. More than four decades after Congress enacted it, hard-working women still earn only 77 cents for every dollar made by men. This is certainly an improvement over the 58 cents women earned when the EPA was passed in 1963, but it is hardly enough. And it still will not be enough when the day comes that women earn 99 cents for every dollar that a man earns. ``Equal'' is not a word that allows room for negotiation, and nothing short of women being paid the same wages as men should be acceptable. 
   We are here today to vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act for the fourth time since it was first introduced in 2005. That is three times too many. We took jobs as Representatives of the House with the promise to represent our constituents to the best of our ability. I don't see how it is possible to do that when we neglect to ensure that something as basic and fundamentally important as fair pay is granted to the working women of our districts. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act contains the tools necessary to achieve EPA's goal. It will increase penalties for employers who pay different wages to men and women for equal work, require employers to prove that payment disparities among men and women are job related and consistent with business necessity, and protect employees from retaliation after sharing salary information. 
   In a country that prides itself on equality for all, it is unconscionable that women who do the same work as men receive less pay. I urge my colleagues to bring the ``fairness'' back into the workplace by supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act.

   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I must again make the difficult decision to vote ``present'' on the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act. 
   I support the immediate withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. 
   I can't in good conscience vote to fund President Bush's War in Iraq. This senseless conflict has already taken the lives of more than 3300 American and tens of thousands of Iraqis. It has undermined the United States' prestige in the world, led to the outbreak of a Shiite-Sunni civil war, and cost us $379 billion. Those funds--and the tens of billions of dollars for the war in today's legislation--would be better spent on education, healthcare and other unmet domestic priorities. 
   Nor can I can vote, however, against a Democratic majority intent on taking America's Iraq policy in a new direction. I applaud Speaker PELOSI and the Democratic leadership for working toward the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. My Republican colleagues voting against today's legislation are doing a disservice to both our troops and our security by supporting an open-ended commitment in Iraq. I cannot join their opposition to holding President Bush accountable. 
   My ``present'' vote is therefore an expression of strong opposition to the war's continuation for even one more day and strong support for the Democratic Congress' attempt to get an arrogant and stubborn President to change course in Iraq. 
   I urge the President to reconsider both his threat to veto this bill and his insistence on keeping our troops in harm's way. It is long past time for Bush to end a war he should never have begun.

   Mr. STARK. Madame Speaker, I am pleased that we are finally passing the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. 
   This is a bill that has languished in Congress more than a decade. The Senate has twice passed earlier versions of this bill with unanimous votes, but the House has always blocked action. 
   It's good to see that times have changed. Members from both sides of the aisle--as well as the President support the bill before us. 
   As I hope most of you know, this bill does something very simple, but something very important as well. It protects people's genetic information and family history from being used by health plans or employers to discriminate against them. Enactment of this law is critical to protect patients and for genetic science to advance. 
   Recent breakthroughs in medical science have made genetic testing available to more patients, but with these breakthroughs comes the fear that patients may be discriminated against by insurance companies and/or employers if they are pre-disposed to suffer from a disease or other condition. 
   We are here today to make sure that patients can undergo genetic tests which could help with treatments or cures without fear that the results will keep them from affordable, reliable health care. 
   This legislation is an overdue and important step toward ensuring that our laws governing patient rights are as current as the latest medical technology.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of freedom of the press and an informed public. 
   The Free Flow of Information Act (H.R. 2102) is a straightforward bill that will protect journalists from being legally obligated to disclose their confidential sources of information. This will allow sources to speak more freely, allowing for the vibrant exchange of important information between reporters, their contacts and the public. 
   Predictably, George Bush's Department of Injustice opposes today's legislation, in part because the Administration issued more than 300 subpoenas last year alone. That's understandable. If I had a track record of wasting money on a failing war, abusing civil liberties, suppressing scientific research, and failing to enforce important consumer protections and environmental regulations, I too would want to keep the press and the public in the dark. 
   But it is also despicable. Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia already recognize a reporter's privilege to keep confidential sources, and to do so without risking interrogation or prosecution. A federal media shield law would further protect the public's right to know about corruption, waste and mismanagement in and out of government. 
   In the past few years, journalists have depended on confidential sources to inform them about the torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib, the disclosure of CIA prisons in Eastern Europe, and the President's warrantless wiretapping program. If we left it up to the administration to decide what went into news stories, we would have headlines that told us the war in Iraq is a smashing success and that DICK CHENEY's hunting technique is unparalleled. 
   The Constitution guarantees the right to a free press. That freedom depends on not having to worry about being punished for revealing information that the public has a right to know. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of reforming one of the most antiquated laws still on the books. The General Mining Law of 1872 has remained essentially unchanged since Ulysses S. Grant was President. Originally intended to spur westward expansion, the law has become an environmental and fiscal train wreck. Today we have a chance to reform this relic by passing the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007 (H.R. 2262). 
   Back in 1872 individual miners used hand tools to look for gold and silver; now multi-national corporations blast the tops off of mountains and produce chemicals such as cyanide, arsenic, and mercury that leach into streams and groundwater long after mining operations cease. Much has changed, but the law has not. 
   For 135 years, mining companies have been the beneficiaries of public largesse that would make even Haliburton blush: over $245 billion worth of minerals have been removed from public lands virtually free of charge. Taxpayers have then been expected to foot the bill for the massive cleanup of abandoned mines to the tune of at least $30 billion. Under the 1872 law, mining takes precedence over ever other concern--environmental protection, recreation, or safety. The mining industry, which is responsible for more Federal Superfund sites than any other industry, pays no royalties on extracted metals. In addition, through the ``patent'' process, companies can force the sale of public lands for as little as $2.50 per acre. Patenting has resulted in the sale of over 3 million acres of public property at far below market value. 
   In my home State of California, a recent study found over 21,000 existing mining claims within 10 miles of national parks, monuments, and wilderness areas. The 285 claims within 10 miles of Yosemite threaten one of the Nation's most visited and spectacular parks. 
   The bill before us protects sensitive lands in California and throughout the West by creating environmental safeguards, transparency, and public participation. Some lands, such as wilderness study areas, would be completely off-limits. In other areas, new mines would be permitted only after a showing that they are not environmentally destructive. Local governments can also challenge new projects. The bill restores fiscal sanity by ending the practice of ``patenting'' and requiring that new mines pay an 8 percent royalty and existing mines pay 4 percent, both reasonable rates and well below what the coal and oil industries pay. These royalties are then put into a fund to pay for the cleanup of old mines. 
   It is time to fix a law that deserves to disappear into the dustbin of history. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I would like to concur and respond to my friend from Louisiana, we are just  kicking the can down the road, but we have been doing that under his party's leadership for the past 8 years or so. And the truth is that none of us, the distinguished ranking member, the distinguished ranking member of the Health Subcommittee, the distinguished Chair of the Health Subcommittee, have any idea how we're going to solve this physician reimbursement for the long run, and we don't have time. But I think we have all agreed on a bipartisan basis that it is an issue that we have to address as quickly as possible. So we do recognize that this is a temporary fix, and we do recognize the serious problem of reimbursing physicians, but I don't think there's any chance that we could get that done in the time left to us in this session. 
   And some of the things that we have added, not all of the things we have passed in the CHAMP Act, but there is mental health parity for seniors, which means that they no longer have to pay a 50 percent co-pay for mental health but a 20 percent co-pay, as they would for other services. There are preventative care opportunities for Medicare beneficiaries. There is support for low-income beneficiaries. There is work toward resolving medical disparities, an issue which is of concern to many people in this country. There is electronic prescribing, e-prescribing, as it's called, which we think will be safer and more cost effective in the distribution for pharmaceuticals. 
   As to the durable medical equipment bidding, I want to correct a statement made earlier. It isn't going to cost the taxpayers anything. The CBO has told us that the way this bill is designed, the durable medical equipment providers will pay for this at their option to take an across-the-board cut in their reimbursement rather than have a bidding system which they felt was unworkable and not realistic.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time and urge a vote to override the veto. 
   It isn't everything that everybody wants, but it protects 40 million seniors from losing their access to primary care physicians, and it gives us time to deal with the reforms that are necessary in an orderly way. 
   We should put an end to the overpayment to Medicare Advantage, to stop giving them a blank check to provide services, which, in many cases, are second rate. Good managed care plans that are not for profit and come under the Medicare Advantage plan can exist at 98 percent of payment. There is no reason to overpay the charlatans who provide second-rate service and overbill the taxpayers by anywhere from 13 to 40 percent. 
   We have made some advantages and some benefits come together on a bipartisan basis to give us time to do the work that we should to make our Medicare system sustainable, expand its benefits, save money for the taxpayers and provide the kind of quality medical care to which our seniors are entitled. I urge a ``yes'' vote to override the veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF HOUSE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of increasing public awareness of child abuse and neglect. Nearly 900,000 children were found to be victims of abuse and neglect in 2005. This is unacceptable. Congress must take bold action to protect our Nation's children. 
   Abused and neglected children face a trauma that does not end when the abuse stops. They must also contend with numerous future problems stemming from their abuse and neglect, including mental illness, poor academic achievement, and criminal behavior. In addition, abuse and neglect often starts or continues a cycle of abuse where a third of victimized children go on to become abusers themselves. 
   Congress has taken steps to prevent and ameliorate child abuse and neglect through programs such as the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, Child Welfare Services, and the Community Based Child Abuse Prevention program. These are all good programs, but Congress and the President have consistently under funded them. For example, in fiscal year 2006, the Community Based Child Abuse Prevention program was under funded by $38 million. Congress must fully fund these programs at their authorized levels. The fraudulent war in Iraq and tax cuts for the rich has placed us in a difficult fiscal situation. Even so, we must fund the services that protect our most vulnerable children.  
   By increasing public awareness of child abuse and neglect, we also have an opportunity to implement new policies that address the health and safety of our children. There are 8 million uninsured children in this country. Continuing to deny health care to all children is simply another form of child neglect. We should work to provide health coverage to every child. 
   I hope that the resolution before us will help to galvanize this body to push for policies that protect and nurture children. The thousands of abused children and the millions of uninsured children deserve our attention and commitment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for H.R. 5613, the ``Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008.'' This bill stops George Bush's draconian attempt to gut the Medicaid program, which provides medical care to millions of low-income children and families. 
   If we fail to enact this bill, more than $20 billion in vital Federal funding for States will disappear. This is $20 billion that helps schools provide transportation for physically disabled children, allows local governments to contribute to the State Medicaid share, and trains physicians. 
   This President has presided over the greatest transition from boom to bust since the 1920s. As families face foreclosure and rising food and gas costs, States see declining sales tax receipts and greater numbers in need of assistance. Our President would add insult to injury for working families by dismantling their safety net. 
   The seven regulations proposed by the Bush administration would undermine longstanding practices upon which States have built their Medicaid programs. The regulations are opposed by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers; all the Nation's Governors from both sides of the aisle; and a host of public health, physician, and patient advocates. The bill passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. In this day and age, that is a remarkable phenomenon. I am proud to join colleagues from both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this moratorium and to protect the health care safety net for America's working families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of an important bill that will make America safer and more secure. 
   Today's legislation ends years of gridlock by finally enacting recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission over two years ago. H.R. 1 will distribute homeland security grants based on risk, enhance nuclear non-proliferation, and improve education and economic development in Arab and Muslim countries.  
   Under the Republican regime, I was never one to jump on the homeland security bandwagon as Congress passed meaningless resolutions intended to frighten and divide the American people, repeatedly and falsely claimed progress was being made in Iraq, and conducted no oversight of the Department of Homeland Security. In contrast, the Democratic Congress is already taking meaningful action to improve American security. H.R. 1 is short on rhetoric and long on reforms and tough new security requirements. 
   The 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act contains common sense, bipartisan ideas. Opponents may argue that this bill is too ambitious, but they won't find a single provision inserted merely to instigate a political fight. 
   In the recent election, Democrats pledged to work across the aisle to pass substantive legislation that will affect the everyday lives of all Americans. This first bill meets that pledge. I urge my colleagues to heed the pleas of our constituents to stop posturing and start legislating by voting yes to make America more secure.

   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I'd like to take this time just to urge my colleagues to vote to override President Bush's veto on what is, in my way of looking at it, bipartisan SCHIP legislation. 
   We had 43 Republicans in the House who voted with us, and 17 Republicans in the other body voting with us, many of whom participated in the crafting of this compromise. It is not exactly what the distinguished ranking member from Texas asked. It takes people below 300 percent of poverty, below 50-odd thousand bucks for a family of three. The adults will be out in a year, not tomorrow. It makes an effort to reduce crowding out, and only citizens and legal residents are eligible, and there are some means by which States can enforce that. 
   Children don't choose to be born into families, unlike those of us in Congress, who lack health insurance, and we should be able to give the children the health care they need to become healthy, productive members of society. 
   It becomes more urgent now that we're in a recession, perhaps in free-fall, and we should provide this safety net for families. It probably is the most urgent concern of a parent. 
   We're going to soon address a bipartisan economic stimulus package, and  it seems to me that if we could come together on that and deal with tax credits or tax relief and additional food stamps or additional unemployment insurance that somehow I don't follow the logic that would say that we shouldn't deal with young children. 
   Furthermore, I'm advised today by my 6-year-old son, who I must admit started out at about a hundred, so I kept him out of school, this was not planned otherwise, and he said, Dad, if we don't pass this health insurance they may fire all the Republicans, and I'd hate to see that.

   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the RESTORE Act. Unlike past national security measures, this bill will prevent the administration from violating our basic civil liberties in the name of its phony war on terror. 
   I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues, Chairmen Conyers, Reyes and Holt. Thanks to their efforts, this bill is a marked improvement from the legislation President Bush requested and from the Orwellian ``Protect America Act'' the House passed in August. 
   Unlike the President's proposal and the legislation I voted against, the RESTORE Act will prevent domestic spying. As its name implies, this bill restores the judiciary's vital role in checking the administration's desire to conduct surveillance on whomever they want, whenever they want. 
   It prohibits the government from spying on Americans without the explicit approval of the FISA court. It also empowers the FISA court to determine if domestic communications picked up during blanket sweeps directed at international correspondence can be seized or searched. 
   Importantly, this bill does not grant immunity to telecommunications companies. The RESTORE Act will allow individuals who have had their rights violated to sue the telecommunications companies that made spying possible by sharing telephone conversations and email correspondence with the government. 
   The President has made it clear that he believes the three branches of government are ``me, myself, and I.'' Thankfully, this legislation dissolves him of that notion and firmly re-establishing the important and necessary role that the judiciary plays in protecting our civil liberties. 
   I urge my colleagues to stand up in opposition to this President and vote yes to protect our civil liberties.

   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of establishing a National Foster Parents Day. Individuals and families that open their homes and their hearts to vulnerable children are truly deserving of our recognition. 
   Of the over 500,000 foster children in the United States, 380,000 live with foster parents. Without the compassion of thousands of foster parents, our foster care system would fall apart. Foster parents are the glue that holds the child welfare system together. 
   Every day, abused and neglected children enter the child welfare system and become the responsibility of our society. As the collective caretakers of vulnerable children, we have a moral responsibility to ensure that foster children receive the same love and opportunities that we want our own children to receive. Foster parents are the individuals that take on the immense responsibility of providing abused and neglected children with loving homes, often with very little government support. 
   Too often our society and this body ignore the plight of foster children. We do so at our own peril, because foster children who are not provided with the supports they need to mature and grow do not transition into self-sufficient adults. Society bears responsibility for this failure and we also bear the costs of incarceration, homeless services, and medical care of former foster children who do not become independent. A National Foster Parent's Day will shed much needed light on the struggles of our foster children as well as the sacrifices made by the families that welcome those children into their homes and move them toward brighter futures. It will also provide a forum to discuss the improvements that must be made to our foster care system. Finally, we will encourage more families to become foster parents by recognizing the vital role that foster parents play in lives of children. 
   The thousands of foster parents around the country are the heroes of our child welfare system. We should provide them with every possible support, including the special recognition of a National Foster Parents Day.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I wish I could say I was pleased to be here today to support this important legislation, but you can't say that about this bill the Republicans have brought us. 
   Last July we sent to the Senate the CHAMP Act, a strong bill that preserved and improved both the Medicare and SCHIP program. The CHAMP Act extended health coverage to 10 million children nationwide. This bill doesn't even come close. 
   This bill was designed by the Republicans to support their rich friends, the pharmaceutical industry, the for-profit insurance industry, and to destroy Medicare as millions of American seniors have known it, to harm children, and to cast blame at illegal immigrants and working single parents. It shows the Republicans in their truest form: Help the rich at the expense of the poor; to deny government services to anyone, and only help the profit industries who pay them so generously through their campaign contributions, which will be useless, because the public will realize that we don't need them anymore. 
   The CHAMP Act provided Medicare benefits for all, and it increased protections for low-income beneficiaries. It extended the physicians' reimbursement above par for 2 years and it protected rural providers for those same periods of time. The CHAMP Act overwrote provisions enacted by the former Republican majority designed to end Medicare as an entitlement program. The CHAMP Act was paid for by reducing overpayments to the substandard private plans in Medicare, plans designed to privatize the program by Republicans. 
   For this effort, House Members, five Republican Members and the Democrats, and our staffs are to be congratulated. They worked hard and took tough and reasoned positions. The Senate failed to act on our legislation and the irresponsible Republicans in the House of Representatives failed to help the children in this country as is their wont. 
   What we have before us gives the lowest common denominator a bad name. The Senate has sent us a bill that extends otherwise expiring Medicare provisions by a mere 6 months, meaning that we will be back here next summer, next spring trying to fix a system which the Republicans consistently try and privatize and destroy. That is Medicare and SCHIP. For the next 6 months, the bill delays the 10 percent physicians cut, prevents some therapy caps from going into effect, and protects rural providers by extending a host of particular provisions that would otherwise expire. 
   There are some provisions that run longer. SCHIP will go for 15 months, moving it forward in time when we have a new President, whom we hope will be willing to work with Congress to protect children's health and expand access to care. It also makes longer term reforms to Medicare payment policies for long-term care hospitals and rehab hospitals, two changes that are long overdue. 
   What is wrong with the bill is what it fails to do. It flat out fails to address real improvements needed for Medicare beneficiaries, many of which we had addressed in the CHAMP Act. It lacks increased protections for low-income beneficiaries; it lacks Medicare mental health parity; it lacks overdue improvements in preventive benefits and nonpayment related reforms to the HMO program. It lacks limits on physician hospital ownership and self-referral. And the list goes on. 
   Adding insult to injury, this legislation also lets HMOs in the insurance industry off virtually scot free, even though MedPAC, CBO, GAO, the Office of the Inspector General and even the administration's own actuaries confirm that we overpay these second-rate, for-profit plans relative to the rest of Medicare. 
   I would hope that those of you learned, as I learned, that if you don't like the food, don't eat it, but don't complain about it. 
   We still have a strong bill pending in the Senate, the CHAMP Act. The Senate must act early in 2008 so that we can reach a better outcome for Medicare. We just can't keep subsidizing the for-profit providers and failing to serve our own children and seniors. So we must proceed as best we can. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of strengthening environmental protections, preserving public lands, and confronting global warming. 
   In the past 6 years of Republican budgets, our National Parks, forests, and wildlife refuges were recklessly neglected. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the main entity responsible for enforcing environmental laws, was left scrambling for funding. Nonetheless, President Bush suggested another big cut in his budget request. Fortunately for the millions of people who enjoy our public lands and who rely on the EPA to protect our air and water, the new Democratic Congress is committed to reversing years of dereliction. Instead, we are making overdue investments in environmental protections. 
   The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (H.R. 2643) provides for modest, but crucial, funding increases in a number of areas including: $437 million above the President's request for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund that will allow approximately 150 communities to modernize their drinking water and wastewater infrastructure; $200 million increase over 2007 levels for the National Park Service to end a decade of declines in staffing, visitor services, and maintenance; $900 million more than the President proposed for EPA enforcement and scientific research. 
   This bill protects coastal ecosystems and communities by maintaining the longstanding moratoria on oil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. This restriction protects the California coastlines that my constituents and I hold dear. 
   Finally, after years of denials and stonewalling by Republicans, this bill recognizes that climate change is a reality and requires us to act. 
   It would create a Commission on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation to make recommendations on how to best respond to climate change. This long overdue step will allow us to begin to address the many challenges that global warming presents. 
   President Bush has issued a veto threat and called this bill ``irresponsible and excessive.'' What is truly ``irresponsible'' is wasting billions of dollars on a fraudulent war while ignoring the threat of global warming and failing to protect the environment and the public health. This bill begins to alter the dangerous environmental course that the President and the Republicans have led us down the last 6 years. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes.

   I rise in support of the QI Program Supplemental Funding Act, S. 3560. 
   At nearly $100 a month, the Part B premium can be a real hardship for seniors living on low incomes. 
   This bill is necessary to ensure that low-income Medicare beneficiaries with annual incomes between $12,000-$14,000 are able to continue receiving financial assistance for the cost of their Medicare premiums. 
   I support extending this vital program. If this bill doesn't pass, States will drop poor seniors from the program. 
   My only complaint is that we should be doing more than this today. We have technical corrections from the Medicare legislation we passed earlier this year which should be before us as part of this legislation. Unfortunately, the Senate failed to reach agreement to incorporate those needed provisions in this bill. 
   There is much we need to do to maintain our commitment to Medicare and Medicaid. This bill is a tiny part of that work. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--and on both sides of the Capitol--to do much more.

   Congress has a duty to protect our highways from drivers without adequate safety equipment. This bill enables a full examination into the potential effects of allowing Mexican trucks to enter the United States. Then, Congress can consider whether to allow such entry. 
   Congress has come together--on a bipartisan basis--time again to stop the pilot program. Unfortunately, we have been conistently disregarded by an Administration more concerned with pushing through cross-border trade agreements than the safety of our highways. 
   In 2007, the Supplemental Appropriations bill explicitly contained language limiting the implementation of the pilot program. Despite this, the Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the pilot. 
   In response, the 2008 Transportation Appropriations bill prevented the DOT from using Federal money to fund the pilot program. DOT challenged this language and continued with the program. 
   At the end of July 2008, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure unanimously voted to end the DOT pilot program. Immediately afterward, the DOT defiantly declared it was extending the pilot program--not terminating it. 
   The most vocal message from the House came with the passage of the Safe American Roads Act in May 2007. The bill posed time limits on the pilot program and reporting requirements on the DOT. 
   SARA was a powerful, bipartisan effort. 411 members voted for the measure and only three voted against it. However, this overwhelming effort has been undermined by the Administration in its determination to open our borders to unsafe and environmentally damaging transportation practices. The Administration has performed legal and linguistic contortion upon contortion to find loopholes and semantic arguments designed to bypass the very clear intent of Congress; and Congress must not stand for it. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation to protect America's highways and push back against such blatant Executive disregard for the intent of Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to a Farm Bill Conference Report (H.R. 2419) that will continue our wasteful agricultural policy for another five years. It is a rare day indeed that I agree with President Bush, but he is absolutely right to have issued a veto threat of this bill. 
   With farm income and food prices at or near record highs, now is the perfect time for reform. Unfortunately, this conference report, while masquerading as a reform package, simply tinkers around the edges of our bloated agri-business subsidies. Our current ``farm policy'' is little more than corporate welfare, with benefits flowing to large corporate operations at the expense of small farmers, both here and abroad, who actually need help. Under current policy the top 10 percent of recipients received 75 percent of all subsidies, while 67 percent of farms receive nothing. This is not good for rural communities, small farms, or taxpayers. 
   At best, this conference report represents ``half a loaf,'' as the group Bread for the World has said. The conferees got the nutrition title right and I commend them for it. There are important changes to the eligibility rules for the food stamps program as well as a raise in the minimum benefit. These changes, along with increases in funding for emergency food aid will have a real impact on the millions of families who are struggling to put food on their tables. If all this bill contained were the nutrition title, I would proudly support it. For all the conference accomplished on nutrition, they failed in greater measure on reforming farm subsidies. 
   Proponents of the conference report argue that it represents ``reform.'' They can't be serious. Under this so-called reform, farmers filing jointly could have an adjusted gross income, AGI, of $2.5 million, or $1 million if their only source of income is farm-related and they could still receive subsidies. This amounts to cutting off only 0.3 percent of farmers from the dole. The report does nothing to means test countercyclical payments. Furthermore, the report creates an entirely new $4 billion permanent disaster program that is not only wasteful and redundant, but will also encourage pushing marginal and environmentally sensitive land into production. This is not reform. 
   Real reform would mean eliminating all subsidizes for corn-based ethanol, which have driven up food costs around the world. Real reform would mean ending direct payments except for farmers who actually need assistance. By passing this bill, Congress is missing a golden opportunity to enact real reform. We should not wait another five years to make our farm policy equitable and responsible. By rejecting the conference report we can begin the important work of enacting a fair Farm Bill. I urge all of my colleagues to vote no.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of legislation that will save thousands of lives around the world. By allowing poor countries to use scarce resources to provide for the health and well being of their citizens rather than to repay debt to wealthy nations, we are doing what is humane, right, and just. 
   Many nations struggling to escape the grip of poverty are imprisoned by debt that siphons off large portions of their budgets. In many cases, any type of debt relief is conditioned on adoption of policies that privatize large sections of the economy and primarily benefit international corporations. Such a ``Hobbesian choice'' undermines sovereignty and exacerbates poverty. There is another way that can lift up nations and allow them to invest in their own citizens rather than sending money to foreign capitols, while maintaining control of their  own economies. The ``Jubilee Act'' before us today provides such an alternative. 
   This legislation will expand our existing debt relief program to cancel the debts of the world's 24 poorest countries and provide greater relief to many more without imposing harsh economic conditions. Even under the current limited relief program, numerous countries have made great strides: 
   Mozambique was able to vaccinate 500,000 additional children; 
   Uganda doubled enrollment in public schools; 
   Zambia hired 4,500 new teachers and eliminated health care fees. 
   Imagine the progress that can be made if we pass this bill and bring debt relief within reach of virtually all of the world's most impoverished nations. 
   Debt cancellation under this legislation is not simply a handout that could be used by corrupt regimes to enrich their cronies or build their militaries. This legislation makes eligibility contingent on using the savings to reduce poverty. Countries are ineligible if their government lacks transparency, violates human rights, or spends excessively on defense. 
   We have a moral obligation to help alleviate suffering in our own country and around the world. At a time when much of the world has lost faith in America as a beacon of freedom and compassion, it is also in our self-interest to restore this lost faith and lift countries out of poverty. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in voting for this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (WELCOMING THE HONORABLE LAURA RICHARDSON TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, as the dean of the California delegation, it's my privilege, my honor and distinct pleasure to introduce the newest member of our California delegation, LAURA RICHARDSON, elected to California's 37th Congressional District in a special election held just recently. LAURA RICHARDSON is a passionate critic of the war in Iraq, a supporter of universal health care, and a welcome addition to our delegation. 
   After three terms on the Long Beach City Council and several years as director for Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, LAURA was elected to the California State Assembly last November. And less than a year later, she won a special election to succeed our dear departed colleague, Juanita Millender-McDonald, and joins us here. It is a distinction that she is one of the few people in the history of this country to serve both in a local, State and Federal post within 1 year. She worked for Juanita as a field deputy, and she will continue her important work to ensure that all Americans can participate in a fair and free electoral process. 
   LAURA's career has many highlights. While on the city council, she was responsible for bringing Long Beach's inner city its first job training center for working families; she championed economic development and improved upon transportation services. And dear to my heart, she helped open the first new bank in the city's central area since the 1992 riots. 
   In the assembly, she became the first African American woman to serve as the Assistant Speaker pro tempore. In the House, she will keep California's Democratic delegation a majority female; of our 34 members, 18 are women. 
   She is a member of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and she joins us as an effective voice for working families in Congress. I look forward to working with her to improve health care for everyone and address the disparities in our health care system, issues I know are important to her and should be to all of us. 
   At this time, I yield to my distinguished colleague and senior Member from the Republican delegation of California.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day. 
   Decades ago, I ran for Congress because I opposed the War in Vietnam. After arriving in Washington, I carried out the will of my constituents, repeatedly voting to stop funding the death of American troops and Vietnamese civilians. 
   More than 4 years ago, I voted against the original resolution authorizing the President to take unprecedented preemptive military action against Iraq. In the years since, I have consistently opposed the President at every turn, always voting to deny him the funding he requested to continue his failed War in Iraq. 
   Last November, the American people delivered a loud and clear message to their representatives in Washington. In electing a Democratic House and Senate, the public demanded a new direction in Iraq. 
   Today, however, we're staying the course. 
   The supplemental before us includes no deadlines for troop withdrawal and no enforceable benchmarks for holding President Bush accountable. 
   In other words, there is no way I--or the overwhelming majority of my constituents--would ever support it. 
   We can't go on like this, killing our troops and Iraqi civilians--and wasting tens of billions of dollars that would be better spent on vital domestic priorities like education and health care. 
   You know who supports this bill? President Bush and Republicans in Congress who refuse to acknowledge either the Shiite-Sunni civil war or our lack of progress in Iraq. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to remember who sent them to Washington. It wasn't President Bush; it was America's voters. They've made their opposition to this war clear. It's time for Congress to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support important progress toward reforming our troubled child welfare system. Today, we can come one step closer to fulfilling our promise to abused and neglected children that we will protect them, heal their wounds, and provide them with stable and loving homes. 
   Anyone who has paid attention to the plight of our half a million foster children and the millions of former foster children should be angry at how miserably we have failed them. Once a child enters the system, we, the government, become their parents. Just like parents, we have a moral obligation to act in their best interests. Unfortunately, many foster children are cycled from placement to placement and school to school, over-medicated with psychotropic drugs, and kept apart from their siblings and other relatives who could provide them with support. Not surprisingly, former foster youth are not doing well. They are more likely to become homeless, incarcerated, disconnected from education and the workforce, or using drugs than nearly any other group of individuals. Perhaps most shockingly, these youth suffer from post traumatic stress disorder at rates comparable to Iraq war veterans. 
   The ``Fostering Connections to Success Act'' allows us to turn our anger into action. This legislation will create permanency for thousands of children by providing Federal assistance to grandparents and relatives who care for a foster child. In my home State of California, a State-funded Program exists to help ease the financial burden for relative caregivers. Much needed Federal support will ensure that this program will not be zeroed out during the current fiscal crisis and will be able to expand to help additional children. This bill also recognizes a truth that is obvious to any parent: turning 18 does not mean that a young person is ready to live on their own. I have heard from too many former foster youth that when they turned 18 they found their belongings placed in garbage bags with no idea where they would live or how they would support themselves. By extending assistance to foster youth until age 21, we an help ease their transition into adulthood. 
   Finally, this legislation takes important steps to promote educational stability for foster children and better oversee their medical care. During committee hearings we heard accounts from advocates and former foster youth about children on multiple psychotropic drugs prescribed by different doctors that never spoke to each other. Many foster children have serious and complex physical and mental illnesses. Their care must be coordinated and appropriate. This bill requires oversight and accountability to ensure that foster children are not overly medicated, but receiving effective, high-quality health care. 
   I am heartened that this legislation has strong support from both sides of the aisle. It should. These are our children and we should provide them with the same level of support we provide for children living under our own roofs.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ACT OF 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6331. For whatever reasons, people may be concerned with process. To me, that is a snare and a delusion. Basically, this bill protects the physicians from their 10 percent cuts. If you vote against it, you're voting to cut physicians by 10 percent. 
   It improves benefits for seniors and people with disability, it ends discriminatory mental health copayments. So vote against the bill and seniors don't get mental health treatment. It targets extra help to low-income people. Vote against the bill and you're, as Republicans like to do, trashing low-income people for the benefit of rich insurance companies, the only one group that opposes this bill. 
   It delays the durable medical equipment competitive bidding demonstration, which we have agreed on a bipartisan basis should be delayed. Vote against the bill and let the medical equipment competitive bidding go ahead. It makes improvements in quick pay for pharmacists. Vote against the bill and talk to your local pharmacists, my Republican friends, and see what they think about your voting against the bill, which would otherwise provide them prompt payment. 
   The clinical labs, therapy services, rural providers, psychologists, social workers, dialysis patients all get help in this bill. So vote against it and go back and talk to your constituents who depend on those services for their quality of life. 
   I am ready to have you do that because all of this is paid for in a balanced, fair method, suggested, I might add, by the administration's own actuary, and the Government Accountability Office and MedPAC all say that trimming the payments to Medicare Advantage is the right thing to do, and will extend the life of the Medicare trust fund. 
   So it's not a bill I wish we were considering. The CHAMP Act, which many of you voted, is one. But this is a modest compromise. I urge its support.  
   For several years now, I have pushed to modernize Medicare's reimbursement for ESRD, consistent with longstanding recommendations from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, and the Government Accountability Office, GAO. The current payment system includes a perverse financial incentive to dose higher levels of the anti-anemia drug, Epogen, which can put patients at risk of death and serious cardiovascular events. Both MedPAC and GAO recommend replacing this system by reimbursing providers with one ``bundled'' payment for dialysis services and related drugs and labs, thereby removing the incentive to overuse items and services that are currently separately billed. This will encourage more efficient provider behavior while maintaining and improving patient care. This modernized payment system is consistent with the philosophy governing many of Medicare's other payment systems. 
   It is imperative bundling be done in a way that is sensitive to individual patient needs, protects against provider stinting, and is not ``one-size-fits all.'' Including an outlier pool, risk adjustment, and a strong quality performance system all work to ensure that appropriate care is ensured. 
   That is why I was very proud when the Children's Health and Medicare Protection, CHAMP, Act, which passed the House in August 2007, advanced ESRD bundling with these patient protections. That is also why I am disheartened by the ESRD bundling proposal before us today, as I have several serious concerns with this package. 
   First, I am very disappointed to see that much of this package is designed to appease the profit-hungry interests of the dialysis and pharmaceutical companies. I have long believed that dialysis providers should meet strong quality standards in order to receive increased payments. I oppose the automatic updates in this bill. I hope that when structuring the quality incentive program, CMS pushes dialysis providers to meet a rigorous set of standards in order to get payment increases. In CHAMP, providers had to meet a clear and strong set of quality measures in order to receive bonus payment. 
   Unfortunately, the initial anemia management quality measure in this bill is seriously flawed. The MIPPA quality measure tells providers that they are providing acceptable care as long as they haven't gotten worse than their past track record. That's like telling a D-student that they are doing fine as long as they keep getting at least D grades. 
   This is wrong. We should be encouraging providers to improve the care provided. There are serious health issues at stake, with the FDA warning that using anti-anemia drugs in a way that raises red blood cell levels too high puts ESRD patients at risk of death or cardiovascular events. Sadly, the measure in MIPPA gives providers a pass as long as the care provided just doesn't get worse. 
   Instead, we should be encouraging providers to get more patients within FDA's recommended range for anemia management. We tried to do this in CHAMP when we designed something that pushed providers to at least meet the national average, with the bar getting raised in subsequent years. If the MIPPA quality measure is enacted into law, I intend to work to override or modify it. I hope that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will instead develop a system that pushes providers toward improved performance and assesses them against anemia management measures that are consistent with the FDA label. 
   A second flaw in this package is that it allows the large dialysis organizations, LDOs, to  benefit from a mandated low-volume adjustment. I have no problem with a low-volume adjustment if it is warranted and set right. However, LDOs don't need it, and they shouldn't get it. Repeated studies by the HHS Office of Inspector General show that LDOs are able to get much better prices on dialysis-related drugs than smaller dialysis organizations. Even if an LDO has a low-volume facility, that facility still benefits from the price discounts negotiated with the parent corporation. Giving LDOs a low-volume adjustment is an unnecessary waste of money. 
   Another flaw with the MIPPA package is that it only lets facilities fully opt-in to the bundled payment system in the first year of the phase-in. I suspect that facilities will find the incentives for practice patterns under the old system and new systems to be in conflict, and may quickly realize that moving directly to bundling in year two is easier. To the extent bundling incentivizes more efficient behavior and has the necessary patient protections, if a facility wants to opt-in in year two or three, I see no reason to stop them. 
   I would also like to clarify something about the bundle itself. MedPAC has repeatedly pushed for a broader ESRD bundle. My understanding of the MIPPA language is that it provides for inclusion of all oral dialysis-related drugs in the bundle, including calcimimetics and phosphate binders. Specifically the term ``items and services'' at clause (14)(B)(iv) of the Social Security Act, as amended by MIPPA, and the reference to ``other drugs and biologicals'' at clause (14)(B)(iii), both afford the Secretary broad discretion to include oral drugs furnished to an individual for the treatment of end stage renal disease that don't necessarily have an IV equivalent. 
   I know why some pharmaceutical companies want to exclude these drugs from the bundle. They want another product line where they can play their separately billable game and try to drive up utilization and corporate profits. That is contrary to the philosophy of bundling and not the intent of Congress. 
   These drugs should be included in the bundle to prevent cost shifting to Part D in order to circumvent the new bundled payment. Most importantly, it would ensure that decisions as to which drug a patient receives are driven by clinical decisions not reimbursement policy. This will also ensure that all drugs furnished to patients for the treatment of ESRD are captured in the new bundled payment. 
   I also believe the bundle should set in a way, including any appropriate adjustments, so that more frequent home dialysis, both peritoneal and hemodialysis, is adequately paid and encouraged. 
   ESRD bundling is long overdue, but it is unfortunate that industry has demanded such a high price for it. If this bill becomes law, I intend to keep pushing for these changes and will be watching and weighing-in heavily as CMS moves forward with implementation.

   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   The distinguished gentleman from Louisiana was quite correct; we have worked together on this. But for us now to depend on the other body is sheer folly. We quite have an idea of what they will send us, and it will be much less. There will be no prompt pay for pharmacists in the other body's bill. They will cut payment to oxygen providers and wheelchair providers. There will be less for low income seniors. There will be no preventative services. The only difference will be a slightly less cut to the private fee for service plans, and the administration actuaries have just recently sent us an e-mail saying this will extend the life of the Medicare trust fund.  
   And I apologize also to my distinguished ranking member on the Health Subcommittee, and I understand when we have 50 groups supporting our bill and you only have one, the lobbyists for the private fee for service plan, it gets a little annoying. But we will see if we can find one other group to support your bill. I doubt it, but we will try. 
   I urge this. This may be the last chance. I won't discuss process, but we all know that we cannot rely on the other body to come together and work as well as we have on a bipartisan basis. 
   Every part of this bill has had support on a bipartisan basis over the last year in this House. It is put together to get as much as we can for as little cost to the providers, to extend benefits to the seniors, to provide preventative care, to give mental health parity, and pay the doctors what they are entitled to. Please support the bill, and let us finish our work this week.

   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Democratic efforts to end the War in Iraq. 
   We are considering two bills today, both of which are significant improvements over legislation passed by Rubber Stamp Republican Congresses over the last four years. The Iraq Accountability Act provides funding for the war, but only until July. After receiving a report on the progress in Iraq--or lack thereof--Congress would then decide whether or not to extend funding through September. Unlike the legislation President Bush demanded, this bill holds him and his administration accountable for concrete economic, political and security benchmarks in Iraq. 
   Though I appreciate the attempt to keep President Bush on a ``short leash,'' I cannot vote to continue funding a tragic war that has already taken the lives of thousands of American troops and tens of thousands of Iraqis. Every time I hear the President lie to the American people about the situation in Iraq and about the patriotism of those who dare criticize his many foreign policy failings, I can't help but think he needs a muzzle, not a leash. 
   It's past time for us to get out of this mess and for our troops to come home from Iraq. 
   That's why I'm excited to join my colleagues in supporting the Iraq Redeployment Act. This bill requires the withdrawal of American troops to begin in the next three months and be completed in the next nine. It also prohibits funding for the ``surge'' and permanent United  States military bases in Iraq. My constituents have been calling for withdrawal for years and I'm proud for vote for it on the House floor today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, TOM will be remembered as a passionate advocate for human rights around the world and a strong voice for better schools and a cleaner environment. The obituaries and my colleagues tonight will fill in many details and have much praise for the wonderful job that TOM did in his period here. I just tried to pick out a few things that he will be remembered for. 
   As the Speaker mentioned, he worked to give a voice to the voiceless in Burma, Tibet, wherever oppression raised its ugly head. In Congress, as in life, he was a doer, a leader, a fighter. Two years ago, TOM was arrested in front of the Sudanese Embassy for protesting the genocide in Darfur. 
   He swam every morning at 5:30 until recently. He was a man who enjoyed and lived life to its fullest. 
   As has been mentioned, he is survived by a large and wonderful family he loved, and they loved him. Without saying, our sympathy goes to TOM's wife and childhood sweetheart, Annette, their two daughters, Annette and Katrina, and their many grandchildren and great grandchildren. 
   To appreciate, I guess, all that TOM accomplished, we ought to think a little bit about his life before joining us here in Congress. He grew up in Hungary and survived Nazi labor camps. He arrived in the United States in 1947 on an academic scholarship. And at Customs, you think it is a problem to take off your shoes now, at customs he was greeted and they immediately confiscated his only possession, a Hungarian salami. So they were as thorough then as they are now. 
   He married Annette in 1950, and he also received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics and then moved on to San Francisco. He received those at the University of Washington in Seattle. He moved to San Francisco and began a 30-year career teaching economics at San Francisco State. In 1953, he received a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley. 
   TOM was elected in 1980. Three years later he cofounded the Congressional Human Rights Caucus. 
   Last month, he announced to us that he had been diagnosed with cancer and would not seek reelection. In that announcement he said, and I quote him here, ``I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country.'' 
   Similarly, this House and our country will never be able to fully express our gratitude for TOM's decades of service. He will be missed by his colleagues, constituents, family, and the people whose basic human rights he fought for every day. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the balance of my time be controlled by the gentleman from California (Mr. Berman).

   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to yet another taxpayer funded bailout  of an industry that has been poorly managed for years. I voted no when Wall Street came asking for their handout in September and I will vote no to bailing out corporations that have refused to evolve and build products that people want to buy. 
   The automakers are in trouble because they have been mismanaged. For years they built gas-guzzlers, stifled innovation, and lobbied against reasonable environmental and safety standards. Even when credit was flowing freely, Americans weren't buying Detroit's products. 
   Workers are not to blame--they have already accepted deep wage and benefit cuts. If there was anything in this bill that provided protection for those workers, then I might think differently. What I see, however, is a repeat of the September bailout scenario; a large commitment of taxpayer money with very little explanation of how these funds will address the significant problems of the industry. Indeed, the CEOs tell us that the $15 billion will ``get them through January.'' And then what? 
   If you want to see quality cars being made by unionized workers, go to my district. At the NUMMI plant in Fremont, UAW-organized workers build cars, such as Corollas, that people want to buy. This plant is a joint venture between GM and Toyota and has made a profit for both companies. They are not here asking for a bailout.

   Mr. STARK. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Revenue Subcommittee for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak just to a couple of things, a couple of errors. First of all, I heard from the other side that today was a getaway day. Now, I think of a getaway day as a day to get home to see our constituents. Not, when you say ``getaway,'' how much unfairness in the Tax Code can you get away with? That's not what today's about. 
   I commend the chairman for putting forth legislation that will prevent millions of Americans from paying higher taxes. I want to talk specifically about one small part and that's carried interest. Half of the $50 billion that we are raising is coming from people who should not be getting away with a tax loophole. That's not raising taxes. That's just taking these people who are collecting carried interest deductions or switching to capital gains. It's a scam. They should be paying their fair share of taxes like all Americans. 
   If you look at all of these ``left-wing loonies,'' George Mankiw at Harvard, who was President Bush's chairman of Council of Economic Advisers; Mr. Buffett, the Blackstone Group; Michael Graetz, all of them say it's wrong to let carried interest be taxed at the capital gains rate so that the capital gains of $650 million is the average annual income of the top 20. That's 5.5 million bucks a month. Why should they only pay 15 percent? And the answer is they shouldn't. They should pay 35 percent, and this bill will get us a long way towards fairness.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of this third version of legislation to improve and extend the Children's Health Insurance Program, and I hope the third time will be a charm. 
   Eighty percent of Americans, 72 percent perhaps, a strong bipartisan majority in the Senate, nearly every House Democrat, and at last count 45 House Republicans, all supported this version of SCHIP. President Bush and many of my Republican colleagues, however, opposed the previous version of this legislation. Supposedly you opposed it because, one, it might have enabled the States to provide health care to adults.     
   Two, children in the middle-income families might get health care. And, three, worst of all, undocumented immigrant children might have gotten health care. Also, there was a concern by some that we'd run out of money. I haven't heard that concern of where we're going to get $1.7 trillion for a war that we're fighting, but at least you're worried about bringing that money to health care. 
   The bill before us today answers those criticisms. It should be more acceptable to a few more of my Republican colleagues, perhaps even to the President. The previous version concerns have been met, rectified, and so those who vote against today's legislation can only be voting against the government providing health care to poor children who have no other means of obtaining medical care. That's the only reason left to vote against this. No other way to account for a ``no'' vote. 
   But I'm most proud of what this bill does not do. It doesn't compromise in covering children. It adds $35 billion in new funding to the SCHIP program, and it provides coverage to 10 million additional children. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me, making the third time a charm, not a strike out, for America's children. With even stronger bipartisan support, we may convince President Bush to do right by America's children. Let's provide him that opportunity and guide him down the path to compassion and humane treatment for all our children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   First of all, I'm just amazed that the Republicans are worried that we can't pay for insuring an additional 10 million children. They sure don't care about finding $200 billion to fight the illegal war in Iraq. Where are you going to get that money? You are going to tell us lies like you're telling us today? Is that how you're going to fund the war? 
   You don't have money to fund the war or children, but you're going to spend it to blow up innocent people if we can get enough kids to grow old enough for you to send to Iraq to get their heads blown off for the President's amusement. 
   This bill would provide health care for 10 million children; and unlike the President's own kids, these children can't see a doctor or receive necessary care. Six million are insured through the Children's Health Insurance Program, and they'll do better in school and in life.     
   In California, the President's veto will cause the legislature to draw up emergency regulations to cut some 800,000 children off the rolls in California and create a waiting list. I hope my California Republican colleagues will understand that if they don't vote to override this veto, they are destroying health care for many of our children in California. 
   In his previous job as an actor, our Governor used to play make-believe and blow things up. Well, the Republicans in Congress are playing make-believe today with children's lives. They claim they can't afford health care. They say the bill will socialize medicine. Tell that to Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, and Ted Stevens, those socialists on the other side of the Capitol. The truth is, the CHIP program allows States to cover children primarily through private health care plans. 
   But President Bush's statements about children's health shouldn't be taken any more seriously than his lies about the war in Iraq. The truth is that Bush just likes to blow things up in Iraq, in the United States, and in Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote to override his veto. America's children need and deserve health care despite the President's desire to deny it to them.

   The fact that we don't want to talk about killing children that we send to die in a war and spend $200 billion, we're going to shuffle on, calling things ``socialism,'' Madam Speaker. And we're going to talk about if we only had a chance to do this a little better to make sure that illegal aliens were treated a little less fairly than they are now, we might vote for it. It's too bad. It's too bad they're voting to harm children for a bunch of really petty grievances that they have in the minority. I hope they will change their minds and vote to override the veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I will be submitting for the RECORD an editorial from today's New York Times which concludes by suggesting that the bill, H.R. 4, does not require the Secretary to negotiate prices for all 4,400 drugs used. A smart Secretary could simply determine which prices paid by the plan seem most out of line with prices paid by other purchasers and then negotiate only on those drugs. The private plans are exclusively allowed to negotiate even lower prices, if they can. This sort of flexibility would pose no threat to the free market.     
   It is time for the Medicare drug program to work harder for its beneficiaries, without worrying so much about the pharmaceutical companies. 
   Then, I would also like to respond to what I am sure was not, by one of the previous speakers, an intentional fabrication or misstatement, just probably a remark due to the inability to read a bill and understand what it means. And it is quite correct that in 2000 our motion to recommit had some wording that limited interference by the Secretary. But it is also important to note that it was a completely different bill; and as such, the motion to recommit had no relationship to this bill. And to suggest otherwise is an outright lie. And I will let it stand with that. If anybody would like to see the previous bill, we have information that will cover it. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 4. It is a simple, straightforward bill that should pass by unanimous consent if the Members of Congress want to help senior citizens, rather than the special pharmaceutical interests. 
   The bill rights a wrong included in the prescription drug act passed in 2003. And it takes away the special interest protection that prohibits the Secretary from negotiating to get better prices for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   The present law includes a flat out prohibition against using the negotiating ability and clout of 43 million Medicare beneficiaries to get better prices. That is wrong. We don't prohibit the government from negotiating prices for airplanes, even for oil royalties in the gulf, for highway construction or for anything else the government purchases. 
   Our bill today eliminates that prohibition and goes one step further. It requires the Secretary to use the market strength of Medicare's 43 million beneficiaries to negotiate better prices for seniors and people with disabilities. We had to go further than simply eliminating the prohibition because the current administration has been so vocal in their opposition to using this tool,  even if given the authority. Indeed, they have threatened to veto. 
   Countless studies show that Medicare beneficiaries are not getting very good deals on their prescription drug prices. The Bush administration has shown their ability to negotiate discounts on other drugs. Secretary Thompson did this twice, once when we had the anthrax attacks and then again when we faced the flu vaccine shortage. 
   This change shouldn't be controversial at all. It is a change that is supported by over 90 percent of the American public, and it is a change that should lower taxpayers' and seniors' expenses. It is a change supported by advocates for Medicare beneficiaries, the physicians who care for them, and the community pharmacists who fill their prescriptions. 
   It is a change that is even supported by AARP, which I continue to contend wrongly endorsed the Republican bill in the first place. But even they agree that the government should be empowered to negotiate better drug prices. 
   The only interests standing up against that legislation are the same interests who got the prohibition on negotiation included in the first place, the pharmaceutical drug lobby and those whose campaigns they funded. 
   Those days are over. Congress is no longer about special interests. It is about the interests of the American people, and that is why we brought this bill up as part of the first 100-hour agenda. We urge the President to reconsider his opposition to it, and to work with us to get Medicare beneficiaries a better deal on their prescription drug prices, and to get a better deal for the American taxpayers. 
   It is an important first step in our goal to improve the Medicare prescription drug program for seniors and people with disabilities. I look forward to working with my colleagues and with the administration to improve the Medicare program.  
   Negotiating Lower Drug Prices 
   From all the ruckus raised by the administration and its patrons in the pharmaceutical industry, you would think that Congressional Democrats were out to destroy the free market system when they call for the government to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet a bill scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives today is sufficiently flexible to allow older Americans to benefit from the best efforts of both the government and the private rug plans. 
   The secretary of health and human services should be able to exert his bargaining power with drug companies in those cases in which the private plans have failed to rein in unduly high prices--leaving the rest to the drug plans. The result could be lower costs for consumers and savings for the taxpayers who support Medicare. 
   Under current law, written to appease the pharmaceutical industry, the government is explicitly forbidden from using its huge purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. That job is left to the private health plans that provide drug coverage under Medicare and compete for customers in part on the basis of cost. The Democrats' bill would end the prohibition and require--not just authorize--the secretary of health and human services to negotiate prices with the manufacturers. That language is important since the current secretary, Michael Leavitt, has said he does not want the power to negotiate. 
   No data is publicly available to indicate what prices the private health plans actually pay the manufacturers. But judging from what they charge their beneficiaries, it looks like they pay significantly more for many drugs than do the Department of Veterans Affairs--which by law gets big discounts--the Medicaid programs for the poor, or foreign countries. The administration argues, correctly, that the private plans have held costs down and that there is no guarantee the government will do any better. The bill, for example, prohibits the secretary from limiting which drugs are covered by Medicare, thus depriving him of a tool used by private plans and the V.A. to win big discounts from companies eager to get their drugs on the list. The secretary does have the bully pulpit, which he can use to try to bring down the cost of overpriced drugs. 
   The bill also does not require the secretary to negotiate prices for all 4,400 drugs used by beneficiaries. A smart secretary could simply determine which prices paid by the plans seemed most out of line with the prices paid by other purchasers and then negotiate only on those drugs. The private plans are explicitly allowed to negotiate even lower prices if they can. This sort of flexibility should pose no threat to the free market. It is time for the Medicare drug program to work harder for its beneficiaries without worrying so much about the pharmaceutical companies.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of making college affordable again. 
   Since taking over Congress, Democrats have made historic investments in higher education. We have reduced interest rates on federal student loans by 50 percent. We have increased both the amount and the reach of Pell Grants and we have acted to provide long overdue oversight of the student loan industry. Today, we will reauthorize and reform the Higher Education Act and take another step forward toward the goal of making sure that all qualified students can afford to go to college without being saddled by overwhelming debt. 
   A college degree is not only the best guarantee of a good paying job, it is quickly becoming a necessity in our economy. The College Opportunity and Affordability Act, H.R. 4137, will open up the gates of higher education to students from all backgrounds. By increasing the maximum Pell Grant amount from $5,800 to $9,000, this bill will allow many lower income students to realistically pursue a degree. By making Pell Grants available year round and for part-time students, this legislation would help non-traditional students such as those working full-time. Finally, by simplifying the financial aid application process, this bill will make it easier for students to receive the aid they need and deserve. 
   For too long, the student loan industry, much like the mortgage industry, has operated without proper oversight. As a consequence, lenders entered into quid pro quo agreements with universities and coerced students into high-interest loans. The bill before us today protects borrowers by requiring full disclosure of all terms, prohibiting revenue sharing between colleges and lenders and doing away with draconian pre-payment penalties. 
   We must encourage and reward careers in public service. I strongly support the loan forgiveness program in today's measure. It will provide up to $10,000 in loan forgiveness for graduates teaching in low-income areas or entering crucial fields such as early childhood education and mental health. 
   Four decades ago, President Johnson signed the Higher Education Act and committed to helping low income students afford a college education. Today, Congress has the opportunity to renew that commitment by providing the support and oversight so that all students can fulfill their dream of attending college. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of ending the War in Iraq. 
   Last November, the American people demanded a new direction for Iraq. Today, the new Democratic Congress is taking a concrete step toward bringing our troops home. 
   The Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act sends a loud and clear message to President Bush. It requires the President to begin withdrawing American forces in the next 120  days and to complete the transition to a limited presence by April 1, 2008. 
   This legislation is an important and historic step forward, but it does not go far enough. I support the immediate withdrawal of all American troops. 
   Not next year. Not next month. Today. 
   I oppose additional funding for the war because the situation in Iraq isn't getting better, it's getting worse. Since Bush announced his intent to escalate the war and deploy an additional 20,000 American troops, 600 have been killed and more than 3,000 have been wounded. 
   And for what? The administration just acknowledged in a congressionally mandated report that since the ``surge,'' there has been little to no progress on a host of political, security and economic benchmarks proposed by the President himself. 
   In total, the war has taken the lives of more than 3,600 American service men and women and injured more than 26,000. Countless innocent Iraqis have been killed or maimed. 
   This loss of life is obscene and must stop. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2956 and commit to withholding additional money for Iraq when Congress debates the next war funding bill in September.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to continuation of a failed farm policy that takes from the poor to give to the rich. Although the Farm Bill, H.R. 2419 before us is being sold as a reform package, it is little more than a dressed up version of previous ``Farm Bills'' that have paid over $1 billion to dead farmers and $1.3 billion to individuals who do not farm. 
   Our so-called ``farm policy'' overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest landowners at the expense of small farmers. The top 10 percent of recipients collect 60 percent of all payments. Large landowners receive the most subsidies, which allows them to purchase the best land from smaller farmers. This drives many farmers out of business and increases the price of land. 
   This bill does lower the income cap and prohibits individuals with more than $1 million in annual income from receiving direct payments. Unfortunately, there are numerous loopholes in this provision, which led the Bush Administration's own Agriculture Department to estimate that as few as 3,000 out of the 1.5 million individuals receiving direct payments will be cut off. This bill therefore does little to end the corporate welfare that has become the hallmark of our agriculture policy. 
   Congressmen Kind and Flake are offering real reform. I support their Fairness in Farm and Food Policy Amendment because it creates a meaningful income limit to make sure no subsidies go to farmers with a yearly income over $250,000. It gradually reduces direct payments and reforms the bloated crop insurance program. These savings are then invested into conservation, minority farmers, fruit and vegetable production, and a $5.6 billion boost to vital nutrition programs. This is the new direction in which America's farm policy should be headed. 
   I applaud the efforts of my many colleagues who worked hard to include additional funding for the Food Stamps program and the McGovern/Dole International Food program. Their efforts  will help millions of hungry families in this country and around the world. However, this bill, does not go far enough to provide food for the hungry and looks to the wrong place to pay for the limited funding it does provide. If we are truly concerned about our Nation's hungry and poor, we could stop subsidizing agri-business and put the money we recoup from eliminating current subsidies to feed our neighbors and support family farms. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for meaningful reform, support the Kind/ Flake amendment, and oppose the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I voted against the original resolution authorizing President Bush to take military action against Iraq. As a Member of the Out of Iraq and Progressive caucuses, I have and will continue to call for the immediate withdrawal of American troops. 
   I rise today in strong opposition to the President's proposal to send more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq. Today's non-binding resolution is an important first step. After its passage, I will encourage my colleagues in Congress to take further steps to end the War in Iraq. 
   When a scientist uncovers facts that contradict a theory, he or she throws out that theory. But when President Bush learns of facts that contradict his theories, he throws out the facts. As a member of the reality-based community, I continue to be amazed by this President's disregard for objective truths. 
   The President, however, isn't just a scientist experimenting with chemicals in a laboratory. He is an executive whose decision to take us to war under false pretenses has adversely affected the lives of millions of Americans and Iraqis. The costs of the nearly four-year old conflict are grave. 
   More than 3,100 brave American servicemen and women, including at least 325 from my home state of California, have already died in the war. An additional 23,000 plus have been wounded. Estimates of the number of Iraqi civilians killed since the invasion run even higher, from 47,000 to 70,000. All at a cost of $379 billion to the American people. That's more than $1250 for every man, woman, and child currently living in the U.S. 
   But these are facts. President Bush is more interested in cockamamy theories. 
   In the run-up to the war, Bush speculated that Iraq possessed nuclear weapons. When intelligence officers suggested that might not be the case, he ignored them. To date, no weapons of mass destruction have been found. 
   Bush also hypothesized that the attack would turn Iraq into a liberal democracy. When academic scholars wrote that Iraq's history and culture didn't suggest such an outcome was likely, he dismissed them. Today, despite the election of an Iraqi Assembly and formation of an Iraqi government, the country is in a full-fledged civil war. 
   During the past four years, the President has repeatedly theorized that America was making progress in Iraq, and that ``success'' was just around the corner. I remember, in particular, Bush's summer 2003 statement that ``major combat operations in Iraq have ended,'' his summer 2004 claim that we were ``turning the corner'' abroad, and CHENEY's summer 2005 reference to an insurgency in its ``last throes.'' Despite these promises, the situation in Iraq has gotten worse every year, not better. 
   My favorite declaration came this past summer, when the President said that the formation of a new Iraqi government represented a ``turning point.'' 
   Unfortunately, the body count in Iraq continues to grow. This past July, an average of 110 Iraqi adults died each day, the deadliest month of the war for Iraq. In October, militia attacks spiked 22 percent. In December, more than 100 American troops were killed, the third deadliest month of the war for the United States. 
   But the November elections did represent a turning point--in the United States. The Bush administration no longer has a Republican Congress to lick its boots. What's more, voting on this resolution will soon suggest President Bush doesn't even have the support of his own party. 
   When the President in January suggested sending additional troops to Iraq, Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle criticized his foolhardy proposal. Senator CHUCK HAGEL, Republican from Nebraska, termed it ``Alice in Wonderland'' thinking that would ``represent the most dangerous foreign policy blunder since Vietnam.'' 
   Retired military personnel weren't much more enthusiastic. Former General Barry McCaffrey called the surge ``a fool's errand.'' Retired Colonel Paul Hughes said ``sending more troops to Baghdad is like pouring more water in the sands of Al-Anbar. It's just going to disappear without accomplishing anything.'' 
   I couldn't agree more. The President's proposal to escalate the war in Iraq in the naive hope of winning a lasting peace is another cockamamy theory that contradicts all available facts. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and take this important first step to end the War in Iraq and bring all of our troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE PERSONS, GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IMPOVERISHED, DISADVANTAGED OR OTHERWISE IN POVERTY -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of resolving to cut poverty in half over the next 10 years. America is the richest country in the history of the world, yet 37 million Americans languish in poverty. The poverty rate is an inexcusable 17 percent for all children and 33 percent for black children. As a body, Congress has a moral obligation to alleviate poverty and provide all people with opportunities to lead healthy and independent lives. 
   The resolution, H. Con. Res. 198, before us is simple: it puts Congress and the Nation on the clock and acknowledges our collective responsibility to the impoverished and disadvantaged. As a country, we spend more than all other countries combined on our military and ongoing wars. Yet, our poverty rate is dead last among developed nations. Clearly, we have the financial ability to drastically reduce the number of people living in poverty. The question is do we have the political will. 
   I believe the answer is yes. During the 1960s the poverty rate fell from over 22.2 percent to 12.6 percent. These gains were brought about by the creation and expansion of a strong safety net supported by programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, and AFDC. Now, the safety net is frayed and under constant attack from those who don't blink when approving the $500 billion to fight the Iraq war, but would like to see crucial entitlement programs ``wither on the vine.'' This resolution rejects the failed ideology that has brought us the manmade disaster in New Orleans and the shame of an additional 5 million people living in poverty since 2000. 
   As we celebrate Martin Luther King's birthday, we must redouble our efforts to fight poverty. Congress has to expand SCHIP and continue moving toward universal health care. We need to ensure that all families can afford childcare, decent housing, nutritious meals, and a good education. These are basic human rights. As a society, our obligation is to lift those who are disadvantaged and provide opportunities. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and rededicate ourselves to eradicating poverty.

<DOCNO>Mr. STARK. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reluctantly support this broad housing legislation (H.R. 3221). This bill provides real help to hundreds of thousands of struggling families and institute long overdue regulatory reforms for the Government Sponsored Entities (GSE). My support, however, for the many important provisions in this legislation is tempered by the fact that taxpayers are potentially on the hook for a bailout of wealthy GSE investors. 
   In the first 6 months of 2008, over 230,000 default notices have gone out to homeowners in California. It is imperative that Congress act to assist these families and help keep as many of them in their homes as possible. By authorizing the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to provide refinancing opportunities for at-risk borrowers, this bill will help an estimated 400,000 families keep their homes. This legislation also helps to ensure that future borrowers are not steered into risky sub-prime loans by increasing the conforming loan limit for FHA backed loans. In addition, the bill helps to stabilize neighborhoods devastated by foreclosures by providing $4 billion in grants for local communities to purchase foreclosed homes and convert them into affordable housing. Finally, the bill begins to answer the long-term shortage of affordable housing by creating a robust trust fund that will be used to create and maintain housing for low-income families. 
   After years of lax regulatory oversight driven by the discredited free market dogma of the Bush administration, today we are reversing the tide by creating a new, independent regulator for the GSEs. This regulator will have the power to rein in the worst excesses of the GSEs, including egregious executive compensation. If such a regulator had been in place during the housing boom, perhaps we would not be in the perilous position we find ourselves in today. 
   Despite the many positive and necessary aspects of this bill I am deeply troubled that we are potentially bailing out the very investors whose greed drove the housing bubble and mortgaged the future of countless families. In effect, by providing an uncapped line of credit to the GSEs we are saying that we will  socialize their risks, but for individuals struggling to pay their bills we leave them to the private market. We should be doing just the opposite. 
   Despite my misgivings, Congress needs to act and the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. The positive aspects of this bill that will provide relief to communities afflicted by the recession outweigh the negatives. For that reason, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.
