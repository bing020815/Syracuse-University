<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment. 
   The 2005 energy law required the Department of Energy to identify geographical areas throughout the country where congestion in the electric grid is raising prices and creating reliability concerns. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I don't think I have to tell anybody here on the floor that we have an energy crisis in this country, and there are a host of reasons why we have an energy crisis in this country. And I think most of us understand that, frankly, there is not one silver bullet that is going to resolve these issues. 
   The designation of this 2005 energy law creates interest of corridors, clearly vests States with the primary responsibility for siting transmission lines and considering what local or regional benefits and consequences exist. 
   I think it is clear that in the 2005 law that we are seeking to amend here that the national designation does not, does not, usurp State authority for siting transmission lines. Yet we have a lot of challenges on a regional basis. 
   In California we are attempting to try to work with Arizona to the mutual benefit of citizens living in both States to try to allow for the conductivity of that energy back and forth as well as to try to maintain the stability of much-needed electricity for our constituents in the Southwest. 
   This amendment, I think, would do great harm to that. And that is precisely why I think the 2005 law was designed to address short-sighted and narrow interests blocking the public good. 
   I ask that you reject this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I want to thank her for her strong advocacy on behalf of victims of crime and her long history in being a tenacious fighter on behalf of the families throughout our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise, as a cochair of the bipartisan Victims Rights Caucus, along with Congressman TED POE, and speak on behalf of all the members of that caucus today to provide strong support for H. Res. 590, which supports the goals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, which occurs every October. These goals and efforts are spelled out among the principles of what the Victims Rights Caucus advocates here in the House. 
   Next month, communities throughout the Nation will participate in National Night Out and Take Back the Night marches in order to bring the awful crime of domestic violence, once again, to the forefront throughout our communities. This resolution helps to bring more awareness of this terrible offense and its effect that it has on our families and our neighbors throughout the communities of this great country of ours. 
   In my home State of California, domestic violence hotlines answer more than 30 calls every hour from victims, a sad fact. And domestic violence unfortunately continues to plague our families and communities unless we come together as a Nation to end it for good, not just in terms of the formal efforts that we provide but in terms of all the other community organizations that play an important role. 
   We must remember that domestic violence victims are our sons. They are our daughters. They are our sisters and our brothers, even our parents and our neighbors. They struggle to survive after a crime, and they deserve our services and support to help them cope during their difficult hour. 
   Therefore, it is fitting and appropriate that we today support the goals and the ideals in recognizing National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, which occurs every October.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6003, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. With over 21,000 miles that has already been mentioned of track in the United States and 44 routes throughout America, this reauthorization measure is sorely needed, and Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Brown deserve a great deal of credit and thanks for their hard work and their efforts on this, along with my minority colleagues that are supporting this effort. 
   This legislation, as noted, will make improvements to existing lines throughout the country and in California. California provides over $70 million a year for intercity rail. We have the second, the third, and the sixth most frequently used corridors in the Nation. As a matter of fact, when people think about California, they think of the land of cars. But the fact of the matter is is that we have more intercity passenger ridership in California than any other State in the Union. 
   In my district, the Amtrak San Joaquin lines run from Bakersfield to Oakland to Sacramento. It's the sixth busiest corridor in the country and had nearly 800,000 riders in fiscal year 2006. 
   California, of course, obviously is not alone. This bill that Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Brown have been working on so hard and diligently, the RIDE 21 Act, will promote the development, construction, and the potential for high-speed rail, which is the transportation system that I think is a part of America's 21st century intermodal, interconnected system that will be the state-of-the-art system that we will depend upon. 
   Our friends in Europe and Japan have had great success with developing over 6,000 miles of high-speed rail in Europe and over 2,000 miles of high-speed rail in Japan, and it is expanding. This is fourth generation state-of-the-art technology that we can have off the shelf. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. 
   This November in California we will have a $9 billion bond measure that will help us implement the first state-of-the-art high-speed rail system, 790 miles, trains that will go 225 miles an hour connecting 80 percent of California's population. This measure will be a big shot in the arm to help this State.

   Mr. COSTA. This measure will give an added shot in the arm to assist California and other States throughout the country that want to implement, choose 21st-century state-of-the-art high-speed rail within their States. There are 11 corridors there. This notion that, in fact, we are giving a subsidy makes no sense. Every system of transportation in this country, roadways, airlines, freight, rail, and ports and harbors have had a public partnership, and there is a subsidy in them. And to think that we would not do anything less than that for rail in this country, for passenger rail, makes no sense. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support these good measures for all of the right reasons.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT DIESEL EMISSION REDUCTION SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Congressman Boucher and Congressman Terry, I want to thank you and your staffs for the hard work that you've done with your colleagues. The Energy and Commerce Committee has made a significant difference in bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   This measure, along with its companion measure, Senate bill 2146, is, I think, very important to ensuring that we provide improved opportunities for air quality, as well as throughout the country. 
   I also want to thank my cosponsors in the House bill, which includes the original cosponsors, Congressmen Cardoza, McNerney, Congressman Nunes, as well as Representative Butterfield, Representatives HILL, Kind, Matheson, Matsui, Bono Mack, Shimkus and again Congressman Terry. 
   This measure, combined with Senate 2146, will allow the Environmental Protection Agency to continue the prior practice of accepting diesel emission reduction projects as part of an environmental settlement agreement. These settlement agreements are important when you're trying to reach an accord with the private sector and still, at the same time, clean up the air. 
   For many years the Environmental Protection Agency has funded diesel retrofit projects through the Supplemental Environment Projects, otherwise known as SEPS with the corporations as part of overall settlement agreements. From fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency entered into diesel emission reductions with these settlement environment projects valued at over $45 million. This bill will help maintain this separate private funding source as a part of a private/public partnership for these projects and, at the same time, improve air quality in basins throughout the country that have regional air issues that they are in noncompliance with. 
   This is particularly of importance in my own district that I share with my colleagues, Congressmen Nunes and McCarthy and Congressmen Radanovich and Cardoza, as well as McNerney. The San Joaquin Valley area is a non attainment area, and consequently, we have difficult challenges trying to become an attainment area, especially when we consider that we are one of the fastest growing regions in California. 
   The air basin is 250 miles long, but it's shaped in a valley where you have mountain ranges on each side. Therefore, we not only have our own stationary and mobile sources of emission that we create, but because we're in the center of the transportation hub between Northern and Southern California, actually, all the way along the west coast, we have interstate transportation on 99 and Highway 5, which is no contribution of ours, but it's part of interstate transportation that contributes to the emissions that we have to deal with. So, therefore, this is an important measure. 
   We have among the highest rates of childhood asthma in the State. We  have other issues that we are continuing to deal with. 
   Today, 90 percent of the commercial trucks are powered by diesel engines. Two-thirds of all farm and construction equipment run on diesel engines. Therefore, this measure can make a difference. 
   California does lead the Nation in clean diesel technology, and some of the cleanest types of diesel fuel anywhere in the world. But even retrofit projects have their role and play a significant contribution to improving air quality, not only in our district but throughout the country. 
   Finally, in addition, retrofitting clean diesel technologies for diesel vehicles and equipment, I think, is one of the most cost effective strategies for achieving tangible and immediate air quality benefits. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that these retrofit projects have a 13:1 benefit-to-cost ratio, meaning that the $45 million invested between 2001 and 2006 translates to over $600 million of health benefits that also benefit young people, children who have asthma cases, those who have cardiovascular issues and the like. 
   I want to again thank my colleagues, Congressman Terry, Congressman Boucher and your staffs and all those who are cosponsors of this important measure. This is cost effective. It's meaningful. It will improve air quality throughout the country. 
   At this time I want to urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (AFGHANISTAN FREEDOM AND SECURITY SUPPORT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think from many of the comments that have been made here this afternoon regarding the concerns that we have as it relates to the situation in Afghanistan, we come with the best of intentions to support H.R. 2446, which is the underlying bill, a strong bill; and I am, of course, among those who support this measure. 
   It affirms the United States' long-term commitment to support Afghanistan in the transition that has seen 30 years of civil war, violence and occupation by a brutal regime to a stable and prosperous democratic state at peace with its neighbors. 
   Having said that, though, it is easier said than done, as we all know, for Afghanistan faces many challenges. With the amount of funding that we have provided to the Afghani people for economic and security reasons, I believe that there is increased need to have the sort of oversight mechanisms in place to protect this investment, to ensure its success and, of course, to always make sure that American taxpayers' dollars are well spent. 
   My amendment provides this opportunity in two ways: It provides oversight that includes the Office of Inspector General at the State Department as well as the United States Agency for International Development to provide the necessary oversight within this bill that many of us believe is necessary. 
   The amendment to H.R. 2446 provides such support in two ways: in-country presence and funding. Without in-country presence and without the necessary funding, it won't happen. 
   Currently, the staff of the Office of Inspector General of the United States AID are performing their duties in Manila. Now, you take out a map and Manila is a long ways from Kabul in Afghanistan, which is the capital. We need to have on-the-ground knowledge in Afghanistan and programs that they are implementing, and they cannot perform those duties from Manila, which is thousands of and thousands of miles away. 
   Many of us have visited Afghanistan, and we have on-the-ground knowledge of what is critical to this war on terrorism. We must remember this is where the war on terrorism began, which premeditated the attacks on 9/11. 
   The amendment mandates that at least two staff members will be permanently deployed in Afghanistan in the country. The amendment also increases the funding for both the Offices of Inspector General in accordance with their own plans to increase staffing over the coming years. The Offices of the Inspector General are our watchdog, and they provide vital efforts to ensure that money is well spent in Afghanistan. We need to ensure that these American taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and that waste and corruption, which was mentioned by the previous speaker, is kept at bay, to the degree that it is possible. 
   In conclusion, let me say, Mr. Chairman, that we had tremendous success in South Korea, but we have been there over 50 years and we still have 30,000 troops there. The initial two decades in South Korea will be, in my opinion, as difficult as it is today in Afghanistan. Therefore, we must be prepared to put the proper resources there and to stay the course. I strongly support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (DISASTER RELIEF FOR AFFECTED AREAS IN CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I, too, feel, as I believe most Americans do, for those who have been impacted by the effects of the disaster that occurred with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. And my colleague and good friend from Mississippi makes, I think, strong arguments that it is part of our responsibilities as representatives of the people's House, to, in fact, respond to needs and crises when natural disasters occur. 
   My district, the 20th Congressional District in California, includes the heart of California, some of the best farm land in the country, from Fresno in the north all the way down to Bakersfield in the south. 
   I rise this afternoon to address the concerns, the deep concerns that our constituents have because of a lack of Federal support in declaring Federal designation disaster status for the 31 counties in California that were impacted by the freeze that took place in California between January 11 and January 16. 
   Now, this is a disaster of significant proportions. Unlike a hurricane or a tornado, as we have witnessed recently in other parts of the country, a dramatic freeze takes on different visual effects. But the damages and the impacts to families and their children and people with farms and farm workers, compesinos, can be just as devastating. 
   Since January 11, January 16, doing our due diligence, Governor Schwarzenegger has declared 31 counties in California available for Federal designation disaster. Yet, we have gone now 6 to 7 weeks without the Federal Government responding. It believes now the total cost of the impact of this freeze to the farms, to the citrus industry, to the vegetable industry is totaling over $1.3 billion and growing. 
   These farm workers, these compesinos, are out of work. These farmers have their life holdings in these citrus orchards. The communities, the economic impacts are reverberating throughout the communities within these 31 counties. 
   Last Friday, we had a listening session on the impacts of agriculture. We had members from the foodbank in California, the Fresno County foodbank, Sarah Reyes, an old friend and former colleague of mine. She indicated that over 3,100 households, which contain over 14,700 individuals, over 7,425 children under the age of 5 years of age or less, have been provided food because these folks have no jobs, because there are no jobs available, because the citrus industry and related industries have been devastated by this freeze. 
   It goes on. You know, in places like Orange Cove and Parlier and Reedley and Selma and places in Tulare County, we have seen the need to provide food for families increase 1,000, 2,000 percent. The UFW, faith-based organizations have chipped in. The State has paid millions of dollars. But yet the Federal Government response has been lacking. 
   We have had bipartisan support from Members of the California congressional delegation, by both our United States Senators. Congressman Nunes and myself have introduced an Impact for Freeze Relief for those farm workers, those farmers, their families and the businesses and these small communities. Yet the President has yet to declare, since January 11 through January 16, that these counties are deserving of Federal designation disaster relief. 
   But in the meantime, my colleagues, since December 19, 14 other States have been declared Federal designation disaster areas. Nebraska, December 19, for severe winter storms; Kansas, January 28, severe winter storms. The President, on January 7, declared both those States disaster areas. Missouri, Oklahoma, Florida, Illinois, Washington State, winter storms, mud slides, tornados, all deserving, I believe, and the President believed, for Federal designation disaster status. 
   Yet, 7 weeks later, California, that complied with all the requirements under the Federal law in which our Governor made the request, now finds itself, 7 weeks later, without the sort of Federal designation status that we deserve as taxpayers to the Federal Government. 
   We ask the President, please respond as you have responded in 14 other cases in these other States. Our citizens need the support and the same sort of help that we have given to other parts of the country. 
   So I ask, once again today, for the President to respond to FEMA and to produce the Federal designation disaster relief that our citizens in California deserve and need for those farmers, for their families, for those farm workers and for the communities they live in.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. I think it's important that when we're talking about the debt, that we be up front with the facts for the American public. Yes, the war has certainly cost a great deal, but it's off budget. It's off budget, just like a host of items that are off budget, specifically designed in that way. 
   The largest single segment on the debt is the interest on the debt, which is 6 percent and growing rapidly. And it's true that we've acquired more debt in the last 42 years than the previous 41 Presidents than this President has accomplished in his last 6 years. 
   So I think it's important that we be up front with the American people when we're talking about the debt and the figures that are involved there. 
   Yes, we've got to turn this ship around. It won't come overnight, but it will come with the bipartisan cooperation that I think we saw took place with President Clinton's administration, and that's what we ought to be doing.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss the importance of this pay-as-you-go system that my colleague from Arkansas, Congressman Ross, and my other colleagues have spoken on thus far. 
   What you're going to hear this evening across the breadth and width of Representatives from throughout the country is a common and reoccurring theme, and that is, as Blue Dogs, we believe that putting our fiscal House in order is among the highest of priorities that we are sent here back to Washington to do. And so, therefore, it is a very important discussion that we are having with you this evening, as many Americans sit at their home having dinner and wondering just really what's going on in Washington. 
   What's going on is really trying to draw a line in the sand. Are we about trying to establish and stay with fiscal responsibility or not? 
   Now, PAYGO is a tool, as was mentioned, to try to ensure that any additional expenditures of our Federal budget be paid for. That's not the only tool, but it is one of the few tools that we now have in place. Certainly as Blue Dog members, we are looking and trying to figure out how we can do other efforts to focus on budget cutting and reestablishing our priorities. But right now pay-as-you-go is the most important tool that we have available to us. 
   Now, let me give you a little history of how all this took place. In 1990, when the Budget Enforcement Act was passed, there was an attempt to reign in deficits that had occurred for over 30 years, Federal deficits that had been  experienced since 1970. This Act, passed by a Democratic Congress in 1990 and signed by a Republican President, President George Bush the First, sought to control the budgetary impact of legislation through the enforcement of the provisions that we now refer to as pay-as-you-go. 
   Now, that was law and that was enforced for 10 years, about. Then in 2001, with a new Republican majority in Congress, our current President, President George Bush the Second, abandoned the PAYGO provisions.     
   And that, I think, among other factors took our projected budget surplus, then at $5.6 trillion over a 10-year period, and created the current budget deficit that we have today, which is over $2 trillion over that same time period. Yes, I think it's disappointing for all Americans that a sensible tax policy, an investment in smart growth in our country that was achieved between 1990 and 2001 on a bipartisan basis, has been squandered in the last 6 years to the large unsustainable deficit that we have today. 
   Now, where are we? Well, at the beginning of this year, the new Democratic majority returned to Congress a path of fiscal responsibility. As Congressman Ross and others mentioned, PAYGO was one of the first provisions we enacted. Under these rules we have in every piece of legislation that we have acted on this year enforced the PAYGO principle. This promise we made to the American people we intend to keep true to our word. We have already made great strides in bringing our fiscal house in order; but if we want to continue that, we must include this with all legislation, which includes the alternative minimum tax. It needs to comply with PAYGO. 
   Currently, our national debt is over $9 trillion, with much of it being held by foreign governments. In 2007, China alone had increased the holdings of U.S. Treasury securities by nearly 500 percent in the last 6 years, from $74 billion in July, 2001, to $408 billion in July of this year. Overall, and it has been said before, this administration has borrowed more money from foreign sources throughout the world than the previous 42 Presidents combined. Let me repeat that: overall, this administration has borrowed more money from foreign sources than all the previous 42 Presidents combined. 
   As a proud member of the Blue Dog Caucus, I strongly believe that fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets are essential to make our economy and our country strong and prosperous. Government should not be allowed to spend more than it takes in. Common sense tells us that. Any strategy of our Nation's budget must include a strategy for reducing these record deficits so that we don't pass them on to our children. Without adequate controls, prolonged deficit spending will weaken our ability to fund worthwhile domestic spending programs and jeopardize our national security. That's at the heart of this discussion. 
   I further believe that it's fiscally and morally irresponsible, therefore, to place the burden of today's deficit on our children and grandchildren. And that's why PAYGO is so important, that we draw the line and make this fight this week. 
   The alternative minimum tax is important. We passed that relief on that over a week ago. But it's not worth borrowing from China to pay for the alternative minimum tax. We can do this in a commonsense way, and that's what the Blue Dogs are asking you to support our efforts in.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of the Armenian Turkish newspaper editor, Hrant Dink. On January 19, the legacy of the Armenian genocide continued. Hrant Dink, who was tried and convicted of ``insulting Turkishness'' by recognizing the Armenian genocide, unfortunately, was shot dead over a week ago. 
   Dink was a voice for freedom of the press, for democracy and for Armenian genocide recognition. Between 1915 and 1923, the Ottoman Empire led a genocide on its Armenian population, killing over 1.5 million people. Over 90 years later, the Turkish Government still refuses to acknowledge it occurred. 
   I told the Turkish foreign minister last year that to move forward with democratic reform, Turkey must first comes to grips with its past, just as our country had during the civil rights movement. Yesterday, I sent a letter to President Bush urging the withdrawal of the nomination of Richard Hoagland to be Ambassador to Armenia. Given the assassination of Dink, we cannot have an ambassador who refuses to acknowledge the Armenian genocide happened. It would send the wrong message.

   Twenty-two thousand American nationals were captured during World War II by the Japanese Imperial Forces. All 22,000 were detained on U.S. territory, the island of Guam. For nearly 31 months, these U.S. citizens were civilian prisoners of war. Many were executed and many atrocities were committed against them that included rape, physical torture, and other such efforts, all committed because of their loyalty to the United States. They refused to become a part of Imperial Japan. They would not bow to the occupiers. 
   Two Federal commissions have now recommended to Congress that we have the moral obligation to make our fellow Americans whole from the suffering they endured because of their loyalty and patriotism to our country. 
   I will vote in favor of H.R. 1595, the Guam World War II Loyalty Act carried by our colleague, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. This is an important measure. We must never forget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. I thank the gentleman from California, a colleague, a good friend and an avid supporter of the California State University of Fresno, as we all are in the Valley delegation. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are proud to recognize the Fresno State baseball team, the Bulldogs, the Bulldogs on the West Coast, on their victory of the University of Georgia last night, the other Bulldogs, to claim the 2008 National Collegiate Athletic Division Championship I-A Baseball National Champions. Obviously, as my good friend Congressman Nunes indicated, I am a proud alumnus today. 
   The Dogs came into the tournament as the fourth seeded team and along the way beat Rice University, had two big wins over the University of North Carolina, and they are the first number four seed to reach the finals of the NCAA championship in any sport. It is truly historic in collegiate athletics. They went from the underdogs to the wonder dogs, and they accomplished this after spending over 40 straight days away from home. Leaving Fresno on May 14, they finally came home today. 
   They won five elimination games, including a 19-10 win over Georgia during the championship series. 
   This team was a pure joy to watch on the field. We saw outstanding defensive plays, 15 home runs by the offense, and they had American riveted to their televisions and radios to hear them win last night's game. It was an exciting month for anyone who is attached to the University or our San Joaquin Valley, or those who just happens to love our Nation's pastime, baseball. 
   The character, camaraderie, preparation, and ultimately the performance and success of the team flows from their head coach Mike Batesole and his wonderful staff. This year he was chosen 2008 Collegiate Coach of the Year in baseball. 
   One unique thing about this team is that every player is from California. In fact, many of the players come from surrounding communities; in my colleagues' districts, Nunes, Radanovich, and Cardoza, and the like, they came from Clovis, Hanford, Bakersfield, and Turlock. Fresno State athletics takes pride in recruiting local talent from high schools and junior colleges. 
   These young men are models for student athletes around the Nation. Seven seniors and one junior will graduate within nine semesters. Steve Susdorf was given the Western Athletic Conference All-Academic awards four times in his career with the Bulldogs. These classroom accomplishments should be commended. These are truly student athletes at their finest. 
   There were five Bulldogs who made this year's College World Series All-Tournament Team. They are Erik Wetzel, Steve Susdorf, Steve Detwiler, Justin Wilson, and Tommy Mendonca. Congratulations to them. 
   Tommy Mendonca from Turlock was also named the Collegiate World Series Most Outstanding Player, and was recently named to the 2008 National Collegiate Team. He comes from strong Portuguese Valley roots, and we enjoyed watching him play. 
   Finally, we again want to congratulate the Fresno State team on a season well played. We tip our hat to the University of Georgia for an outstanding series, and all the teams that played this season.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, this House on a bipartisan basis overwhelmingly supported our troops last week by giving them a 3.5 percent pay raise over the next year. What is our President's response? A threatened veto. In a statement opposing the higher pay raise, the administration noted that the President's proposal, in their opinion, provided a good quality of life for servicemembers and families. 
   Mr. President, apparently you have not read the 2004 Kaiser Family Foundation report that indicates that over one in five military families rely on food stamps or WIC for Federal aid. This is simply unacceptable. 
   The best way we can send a message to our troops that we support the grueling work that they do on a daily basis is by showing it, by putting more money in their pockets so they can better provide for their families. 
   The bottom line is that men and women fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan should not have to supplement their income through living on food stamps or WIC. We encourage the President to reconsider the veto threat and to support the entire pay raise.

Is it the intent of the gentleman and the chairman of the SEC to ensure that banks are granted accounting discretion, to the extent that such discretion is consistent with the intent of the language in section 132, including but not limited to in reports that will be required at the end of this month?

   Mr. COSTA. And the legislation doesn't speak to it, but it is my understanding that the chairman of the committee will work on all regulatory agencies, including the banking regulatory agencies, to ensure that banks have the necessary and appropriate flexibility to address the changing market environment regarding capital requirements, accounting, audits and reports, and to do so in a timely manner for reports as of September 30, the end of the next reporting period, and would include but not be limited to the section 132 discretion?

   Mr. COSTA. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend you and the staff for the hard work that has been done on assimilating this very important package. 
   While it is unfortunate that we are in this position here today, the economic security of our Nation is at risk. We are talking about Main Street here. To do nothing is not an option. I look forward to supporting this effort and your efforts in the next Congress to do the reforms that are necessary to bring back economic sanity to our country. I would urge an ``aye'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (BLUE DOG COALITION DEFICITS AND DEBT BACKGROUND -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I thank very much Congressman Ross, the gentleman from Arkansas, who does an excellent job each week in helping convey the message of the Blue Dogs, the fiscally conservative Democrats who are focused on accountability, not just at home but abroad as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to once again echo strong support for the Blue Dog Accountability War Act, and I, too, am pleased that Congressman Skelton, because of his focus and his desire to see the same sort of accountability that I think all Americans want to see, this is a bipartisan issue, chose to include provisions of the Blue Dog War Accountability Act within the new authorization for Defense. 
   Four years ago, we all remember very clearly when this war effort was brought to America. We were told that 4 years ago it would cost $60 billion and that the oil revenue from Iraq, which has tremendous reserves, would go to pay for the reconstruction. I think many Americans thought that that might be a reasonable price to pay, notwithstanding the fact that you can never, ever put a price on the cost of American lives that have been lost nor those that have been injured. Nonetheless, we were told that 4 years ago in monetary costs, it would be $60 billion and the oil revenues would go to pay for the reconstruction costs. 
   Many of you saw the reports this week by a number of press agencies that indicated over the last 2 years billions and billions of dollars have been lost from revenues from the Iraqi oil reserves, but while it was a new story this week, it comes as no surprise to many of us who have been briefed in Congress. 
   I was in Iraq last May, spent time in Mosul, city of Mosul, with a number of our commanders. As we were getting our briefings, as all congressional delegations receive when you go to Iraq, we were told of the problems of getting the oil from the oil field, from the wellheads to refinery because there's only one, and then getting the refined products to where the Iraqis could use the gasoline and the other oil products. They told us as recently as a year ago that every step of the way from when the oil was taken out of the wellhead, put in the truck, on the truck, mind you, because you can't use pipelines because the insurgents keep blowing the pipelines up, that every step of the way, every province, there is graft, there is corruption, there's other types of lost revenue, and those moneys go too often into the hands of these same insurgents that are battling our troops, making side profits off the revenue that was supposed to go to reconstruction, going to pay for insurgents and for bombs that come in the form of IEDs, that end up killing and maiming so many of our American men and women who are trying to fight this battle on behalf of the Iraqis. 
   So this is well-known, and yet 2 years as we look at the problems with trying to get this oil out of the ground and to the refineries, we still have made little progress in terms of eliminating that graft and corruption that currently takes place or the profits from that graft and corruption that go into the hands of the insurgents. 
   And yes, unfortunately, the oil revenues today are still at or below the levels during pre-Saddam Hussein years when, in fact, there were restrictions on the amount of oil they could drill. That's how much progress unfortunately we have not made in the 4 years that we've been engaged in this effort. 
   The fiscal accountability under the Blue Dog War Act for this effort, as it's being included in other aspects of our budget, are critical. The reforms the Americans expected here at home, they're the reforms that Americans expect on a bipartisan basis as we try to change the direction and the course of this war in Iraq. 
   Let me conclude by saying that it's important that we keep our eyes focused on the situation at hand. Many of us have had briefings on a weekly basis with the top generals who are engaged in this effort trying to implement this surge. Just last week in speaking with one of those generals, I told him, I said, you know, we're doubtful on the surge, many of us, not because we don't think American men and women are successful; we know that they will do the absolute best job possible, but we're doubtful on the credibility of the leadership of this administration to effectively carry out what they say, and that's a loss of confidence. If this were a parliamentary system, there would be a vote of no confidence after all that has transpired over the last 4 years. 
   Having said that, I, like most Americans, hope that this surge is successful, for all the right reasons, for all the right reasons, but let me tell you tonight what I told the American general last week. If this surge by this summer is not successful, I hope you will tell the Congress and the American public that it's not working. 
   He responded in the affirmative that he would respond by August on whether or not this was working or not. So I told the general, I said I hope it's successful, but I hope if it's not, you will tell us that it is not and that currently you are engaged in an effort that looks at a plan B. As I told Secretary of State that we needed to be thinking about doing in February of this year, a plan B that would protect our men and women who are at the front lines, look at protecting the borders between Iraq and Iran and Syria, look at redeployment, looking at beefing up our efforts in Afghanistan, in a way that protects our interests in the Middle East but quits trying to convince ourselves that if we want democracy more than the Iraqis it will happen. 
   At the end of the day, Iraq will have to stand up for itself and indicate that they want to make a success out of this effort of democracy. 
   So I want to yield back to my colleagues and I thank my friend, the gentleman from Arkansas, for providing this opportunity for fellow Blue Dogs to come and talk about why we are so concerned that, in fact, a new day has come and why we have to make new changes in direction that will fit the accountability of American men and women, that American taxpayers and that most importantly our American soldiers demand and deserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rahall, Chairman Miller, and Chairman GREEN for all their hard work and their continuous efforts to try to ensure that we deal with America's energy crisis today. 
   I rise in support of the passage of H.R. 6899, but I view this bill as a work in progress. Obviously it's not in its final form. The Senate needs to vet its efforts, and the President needs to weigh in, and therefore it needs more work, in my opinion. 
   I do appreciate, though, the Speaker's efforts on this bill. And I do hope to continue to support her efforts as we look at the compromise, the bipartisan compromise, that will continue to improve this measure. 
   In its current form, however, it doesn't provide some of the comprehensive efforts and solutions that existed in the measure that Congressmen ABERCROMBIE, PETERSON, and others worked on in a bipartisan effort; and I want to thank them, Representatives ABERCROMBIE and PETERSON, for their hard work. Six weeks we worked in June and in July to form the bipartisan compromise effort otherwise known as the National Conservation Environment and Energy Independence Act, H.R. 6709.     
   The differences between that effort and this are the following: 
   First, the bill prohibits drilling within 50 miles of the coast, which, in my opinion, puts a lot of our most promising areas off-limits in terms of the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Second, by not allowing revenue sharing with States, as we do with Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, I think it makes it less likely that States will opt in to leasing, even between the 50 and 100 miles. 
   Third, the bill doesn't directly tie the new royalties generated to funding for renewables and energy efficiency. So it doesn't provide the same benefits that we have in H.R. 6709, although there are some PAYGO issues there. I think they are workable. I think we can get this measure out. I think we can work with them in the Senate. 
   The bottom line is that we need to use all the energy tools in our energy toolbox. That includes both coal sequestration, as well as new advances in nuclear power that doesn't put it in Nevada. 
   We talk a lot about the urge to put an Apollo-like program together. We do. We do need to do that in a bipartisan effort. But sometimes people forget that in the Apollo program, we had the Mercury program so that men could go into space. We had the Gemini project that showed that you could dock and you could spacewalk before we got to Apollo. 
   The goal is to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels, reduce our dependency on foreign sources of energy. We can't get there overnight. We need to have this Apollo-like program that uses our current energy resources here in America to finance the renewables that will bridge the gap. That's what we need to do. 
   It's my hope that the provisions of our previous measure can be incorporated into this bill as we work through the legislative process, as we should do. But I think it's a step in the right direction, this measure. We need to move forward to take a closer look at how we come together in a bipartisan effort in that comprehensive energy package. The American public demands that we do this. Our economy requires that we do this. 
   We are going to have a transfer of $750 million in wealth this year just to pay for our energy price tag. For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure, even though you don't like some of the elements in this measure, as I don't believe some of the elements in this measure are pointed toward that comprehensive effort. 
   But I want to commend my colleagues, Chairman Rahall, Chairman Miller and Chairman Green, for their willingness to compromise. I want to continue my efforts across the aisle with Congressman Peterson and others who are part of that bipartisan effort. That's what we need to do, that's what the American public expects, and that's why I'm voting for this measure. 
   I thank the chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I join my colleague Representatives DEVIN NUNES in honoring the life of Mr. Louis Flores Ruiz from Dinuba, California, who passed away peacefully at his home on Sunday, April 1, 2007. Mr. Ruiz was loyal, compassionate and worked hard to make the American Dream a reality in his life.  
   Mr. Louis Flores Ruiz was born on October 30, 1918 in Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico. At the age of five, he and his family immigrated to the United States and after successfully serving his country by joining the U.S. Army, he was granted United States Citizenship on December 17, 1944. During his time in the Army, he served as a Military Police escorting prisoners-of-war and civilians in combat areas as well as investigating theft. His stellar service to our country made Mr. Ruiz a recipient of the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, one Bronze Service Star, an Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Stars, and a Good Conduct Medal. 
   Upon his return from his service, Mr. Ruiz first worked as a grocery store owner, then as an insurance salesman. After that, he joined his brothers and brother-in-law in Tulare, California and co-founded a large tortilla factory where they pioneered the automation of tortilla production. An entrepreneur and innovator at heart, Mr. Ruiz went on to co-found what has become the largest frozen food Mexican manufacturing firm in the United States, the second largest Hispanic-owned manufacturing firm in the United States, and the largest manufacturing plant in the state of California. Ruiz Foods has also helped establish programs of charitable giving within the community to many organizations that enhance the quality of life for the people of the Central Valley. 
   In 1983 Mr. Ruiz had the distinctive honor of meeting with President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George Bush in the Rose Garden of the White House, as he accepted the U.S. Small Business Administration's Small Business Person's of the Year Award. In 2003, Mr. Ruiz had the pleasure of hosting President George W. Bush at Ruiz Foods in Dinuba, CA. Other major highlights in Mr. Ruiz's life include, placing a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery at the request of President Reagan and being named the 14th person to the Tortilla Industry Association Hall of Fame--a distinction reserved for those who have made positive contributions to the tortilla industry through technical or significant innovations in products, equipment or ingredients while attaining business success. 
   Mr. Ruiz is survived by JoAnn, his wife; their daughter and son-in law, Shannon and Eric Weller; brother and sister-in-law, Carlos and Olga Ruiz; brother and sister-in-law, Edward Sr. and Dolores Ruiz; brother and sister-in-law, Oscar and Alice Ruiz, sister, Margaret Tarasas; and daughter-in-law, Luisa Ruiz; the mother of his four children, Rose; and their daughter and son-in-law, Rose Margaret and Paul Doherty; son and daughter-in-law, Fred and Mitzie Ruiz; daughter and son-in-law, Anna and Dennis January; and daughter Carrie Ruiz. Louis was also blessed with numerous nieces, nephews, godchildren, grandchildren, great grandchildren, a wonderful care provider and many dear friends. 
   Although the passing of Mr. Louis Flores Ruiz brings sadness to his family, friends, and community, we believe his legacy of hard work and kindness will forever live on, through those whose lives he so graciously lived.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES ORGAN TRANSPLANT AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I too want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Frank Pallone from New Jersey, for his good work in this important legislation that we are going to vote on. This effort is really a culmination of a lot of people's hopes, desires and dreams to further advance the medical science that has taken place in recent decades on organ transplants. 
   As a founder and the cochair of the Congressional Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Caucus, I am very pleased to support this measure before us, H.R. 6469, otherwise known thereafter as the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Organ Transplant Authorization Act. 
   I want to thank my colleague Congresswoman DeGette for her hard work with me on this important legislation, as well as the caucus cochairs, Congress Member Camp, Congress Member CLAY and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, all champions of transplant communities throughout our country. 
   This bill reaffirms our Nation's commitment to providing lifesaving care through transplantation, and at the same time it honors our late colleague, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who gave the gift of life by becoming an organ donor after her passing. 
   The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network was created in 1984 as a public-private partnership to facilitate the safe, effective and efficient sharing of organs through donation and transplantation. Since its inception, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, which contracts with the United Network for Organ Sharing, has helped facilitate the transplantation of over 435,000 organs. And nearly 53,000 of them have occurred in my home State of California. I know, because I have worked with the transplant community. My good friend, Dr. Sue McDiarmid, who was formerly the president of the United Network for Organ Sharing, and her colleagues have been doing some amazing work at UCLA Transplant Center to serve the needs of our youngest children specializing in pediatric transplantation with the largest record of transplantation that has taken place probably anywhere in the world, giving these young children, and in some cases babies, a second chance at a full life. 
   Whether it's a kidney transplant that ends a child's need for dialysis or a liver transplant that gives a person a second chance to play catch with his or her daughter or son, the impact of these lifesaving procedures cannot be overstated. With the advancement of medical science today, we are able to do more and more in this gift of life that is so important.

   Mr. COSTA. Still, despite the amazing advances the United Network for Organ Sharing and its partners in the transplant community have made, there is still much work to be done. As has been noted, over 100,000 people are currently waiting for an organ, and the numbers grow each day. 
   Today, we take an important step toward reducing that number by providing additional resources to continue the increased number of donors to improve and to expand the outreach and to help provide those in need with the access to life-saving organs. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to join in honoring Congresswoman Tubbs Jones by supporting this bill and by also following her example in becoming organ donors. After all, it's perhaps the most precious gift we can give. I know because I am one of those who intends to do just that. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote on this important measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Ross), my good friend, who every day is working to represent the constituents of his State. 
   I share, too, the concerns with the lack of accountability that has taken place over the last 4 years as we have put America's finest men and women in uniform in harm's way, fighting this war on terrorism, but specifically in Iraq and Afghanistan, and only to find that too often we have not done the necessary planning, we have not put the necessary resources in place nor have we taken the time to ensure that their work is focused on in a way that brings results, the kind of results that all Americans as taxpayers want to see when we invest in our Nation's interests. 
   The Iraq Accountability Act is an important step to try to reinstate credibility through this war effort, and therefore, we are urging our colleagues throughout the House to embrace this effort. This is not a partisan issue. This is all about making sure that when we invest $25 billion in reconstruction, when we need that kind of investment here at home, that it, in fact, is not taken in by sole source contracting single bids; that, in fact, that the work actually takes place at a level of quality so that the Iraqi government or the citizens can, in fact, benefit from that investment of infrastructure.     
   We just saw recently about the construction of a police station that was so shoddily built with U.S. taxpayers dollars that, in fact, it has been deemed unusable. 
   So as fellow Blue Dog members, we really urge in a bipartisan basis for us as a House to come together. We are the people's House, after all, and it is important that we put partisan politics at the water's edge. We are in a real mess in Iraq. There is no doubt about that. I have every hope, as do most Americans, that, in fact, we do the right thing in ensuring that this effort takes place in a way that brings our American troops home as safely and as quickly as possible. 
   However, if this surge is not successful, as I asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in the Foreign Affairs Committee just 2 weeks ago, that I think it is absolutely critical that we understand what our backup plan is. I think the American public is getting tired of us pursuing these efforts without the sort of time invested effort that is going to ensure that if this effort is not successful, we have a backup and that we are not simply winging it, because I think too often that has been the history of the recent past in this engagement. 
   Mr. Speaker, and my colleague, Congressman MIKE ROSS, I would like to shift this effort of accountability and transparency back to our Nation's shores. I was very moved by the comments Congressman MIKE ROSS made when he talked about the devastating impact of those tornados in his district back in Arkansas. I saw the devastation on television shortly after it occurred. 
   I e-mailed my friend, Congressman MIKE ROSS, and asked him how it was there. He talked about the horrific  challenges his constituents were facing, and I felt for him. I felt for him because whether we like it or not, natural disasters occur throughout the country, whether it is in Florida, whether it is Katrina in Louisiana and Mississippi. I know, because just in January we had a similar natural disaster in California, called the freeze. 
   This devastating freeze has now impacted the State of California over $1.3 billion. Now, when you have a freeze that impacts communities in many counties such as we had in California in January, it doesn't take on the same sort of graphic visuals that a tornado or a hurricane does, but it is the worst freeze we have had in over 10 years. Governor Schwarzenegger immediately declared the State a disaster, an area designated as 31 counties eligible for State aid, and the State has been putting money in there. 
   We have signed a bipartisan letter to the President asking for Federal support. The estimate is that the freeze has affected not only $1.3 billion in losses, and those numbers are adding up, but over 12,000 farm workers, as well as farmers, have been impacted. The livelihood of these farmers, these farm workers and the communities they live in have threatened the economies of these towns where we have had 50 percent, 70 percent unemployment just in the last 4 to 6 weeks. 
   I was talking to a good friend of mine, Sarah Reyes, who heads up the community foodbank back in Fresno County. She told me that in the last 6 weeks they have fed over 91,000 families, 91,000 families that don't have jobs, that are out of work. But still, even though we have sent this letter, the Governor made the declaration, 31 counties have been impacted, the administration has yet to declare the freeze a Federal disaster. 
   So you ask why, why is our Governor, Governor Schwarzenegger's request being ignored? Why is the letter that has been signed by both Democrats and Republicans among the California congressional delegation being disregarded? Why is the administration acting so casually about a situation that puts families out of work and family businesses at risk? 
   Mr. President, the freeze may not make the sort of pictures that we have seen in Florida or in Arkansas or in Louisiana or in Mississippi; but I can tell you, if you come to those communities and visit and meet with those farm workers who are out of work, you talk to those farmers and their families who have invested their entire lives in their family farm, you will see just as dramatic an impact as any devastation of any other natural disaster. So I think it is time for the administration to focus on the accountability in its efforts in California for those families that have been so impacted by this devastating freeze. Accountability is what people expect their government to do. They expect their government to solve problems. 
   When the President spoke here in the State of the Union in January and said that folks are less concerned about the partisan squabbling that takes place and they are more concerned about doing the people's business, I agree with the President. In fact, this is part of the people's business, being accountable, being transparent, and making sure that after action that has already taken place, clearly 6 weeks, now going on to 7 weeks, after the initial disaster, that yet we have no response from Washington. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, folks in California and those 31 counties expect better. My constituents expect better, and I am hopeful that soon the President and the administration will step up to the plate and take FEMA's recommendation and that the Office of Management and Budget will suggest to the President that, in fact, California is deserving of the same sort of support and response and accountability that all of our citizens expect. 
   I thank the gentleman from Arkansas, my dear friend and colleague, Mr. MIKE ROSS.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair, ranking members, and colleagues, especially those who, like myself, from California had an opportunity to serve with Leo McCarthy. 
   Leo McCarthy, as has been said, put faith, family, and service as the preeminence in his life goals, and he lived them every day by example. 
   Leo McCarthy was Speaker when I was first elected to the State Assembly in 1978. Those were heady days in California, and Speaker McCarthy had a contentious caucus that he had to work with among younger members who thought that they oftentimes knew better. But I can tell you that from the lessons I learned firsthand from Speaker McCarthy, later to be our Lieutenant Governor, was that of being a quintessential legislator. He believed in process, he believed in transparency, he believed in accountability, and he believed in working in bipartisan fashions to solve problems for people of California. And because of those facts, Leo McCarthy's speakership was successful. 
   I was part of a group that ended up in what often happens within political families, a difficult speakership fight, and I chose for various reasons not to support Speaker McCarthy. Nonetheless, we travailed for over a year. During that entire time, Leo maintained class and maintained dignity and attempted to still reach out and bring the caucus back together. 
   That was not to be, but his legacy was the fact that he always, always treated people the way he wanted to be treated himself. And for that I would like to join with my colleagues in the memory of a tremendous public servant, not only in California but throughout our country, Leo T. McCarthy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Rahall, Chairman Dingell and other committee chairmen, along with the Speaker, for developing this important, far-reaching bill to address many of the pressing needs to cut our dependence on foreign oil and gas. 
   There are many provisions in this legislation, and we know this legislation is a work in progress, but I would  like to point out an important protection the bill affords for the Roan Plateau in Colorado. These protections are of great importance to Congressmen SALAZAR and UDALL, as well as the people of Colorado and the Nation. 
   The Roan Plateau is also, though, as was suggested by our colleague from New Mexico, a highly important source of natural gas supply to the Nation and will remain so for the foreseeable future. 
   Mr. Salazar gives us an opportunity to address both issues. The language in the bill specifies that the restrictions on the drilling are prospective only and do not apply to private drilling activities. It does not apply to roads, rights-of-way access to privately held land or production. Nor does it apply to pipelines and infrastructure needed to transport natural gas across BLM land to access stem pipelines to transport the gas to the rest of the United States. 
   Roan area gas is of immense importance to the Nation, with an estimated 9 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. California, my State, gets 24 percent of its natural gas from the Rocky Mountains, clean-burning natural gas which today is the fuel du jour. California is struggling, obviously, to come into compliance with clean air standards. This supply of natural gas is important. 
   Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, this does provide new energy sources, solar power, and renewable sources. I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Congressman Salazar for their amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to introduce H.R. 3022, the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Wilderness Act of 2008. This bill adds nearly 115 acres of wilderness in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in California, two parks that are among the crown jewels of our Nation's national park system. Coupled with existing wilderness areas in the parks, this bill will expand the wilderness to about 97 percent on the land base that is included within the park area. 
   About 45,000 acres of the wilderness created by this bill will be incorporated into currently existing Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness Area. The other 70,000 acres will comprise a new wilderness area, which will be named after former Congressman John Krebs. 
   Congressman John Krebs served in this House from 1974 until 1978. He immigrated to this country when he was 17 years old. Like immigrants before him and immigrants since, he came here to find a better life for himself and his family. And in that effort, he contributed mightily, as all immigrants have, over the history of our Nation's years. 
   He served in this House with distinction and honor. He was tenacious, and one of the areas that he worked on was this area of wilderness within the Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness Area. 
   So therefore it is appropriate that we designate this act by including this as a namesake, because within the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, we have California's and some of our country's most beautiful areas. The Redwood Canyon area contains Redwood Mountain Grove, the largest stand of giant sequoia within the parks. The Redwood Canyon also includes over 75 known caves, include the longest cave in California with over 21 miles of surveyed passage. The Hockett Plateau includes vast rolling forests of lodgepole pine surrounding spectacular subalpine meadows. The area is a favorite designation for equestrians, backpackers and anglers, people who, like all of us, like to enjoy our mountains. 
   This bill is obviously important not only to me but for my colleague, Congressman Nunes, and all that have been a part of this effort, for preserving our natural areas for future generations is a responsibility that we all share in common. And it gives us an opportunity to honor Congressman John Krebs, whom I first went to work for back in the 1970s when he served in Congress. He was a mentor and still today is a friend and is living well in Fresno, California, at the young, tender age of 82. 
   So it is fitting and appropriate that we recognize the people who deserve credit for making this bill a reality. Among those, I want to thank Chairman Rahall, subcommittee Chairman Grijalva of the Natural Resources Committee for their support, their staffs, as well as the committee's minority staff that worked so hard on this bill, and the National Park Service. 
   In addition, there is a companion measure over in the Senate carried by Senator Boxer. I would very much like to thank her and her staff for their hard work, including most notably, the State director, Tom Bohigian, who devoted a great deal of time and energy to make this bill a reality.     
   Finally, I want to thank my colleague and dear friend, Congressman DEVIN NUNES, and his Deputy Chief of Staff, Damon Nelson, for their work on this bill. This is a sensitive issue. The land we are talking about resides within Congressman Nunes' congressional district. The wilderness created by H.R. 3022 there is important to Congressman Nunes, as well as to all of us, and I want to thank him for his hard work on this bill and for ensuring that he protects the interests of his district and the local communities and the folks that live and work and recreate in the wilderness and surrounding areas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I request my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 3022, as amended. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. COSTA. First I would like to thank Congressman Nunes for your hard work and efforts on this. Without your support, I don't believe this measure would be a reality. The bipartisan effort I think is a commendation on how we ought to be working on all of our efforts here in the House. 
   Protecting the local interests was a concern of mine, as it was of yours, and I am glad that we were able to find ways to satisfy the existing uses within the wilderness and the park area, because having been one who has utilized that park and have enjoyed it over the years, I want to be able to continue to use it myself in those ways, as do all of our constituents from the valley, who believe this, as I said, is one of our crown jewels. 
   It was always a goal of mine that this be a bipartisan effort, and I am glad that Congressman Nunes feels comfortable with supporting the legislation and proud you were able to help make it a reality.

   H.R. 2632 would designate land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in San Miguel County in northwestern New Mexico as wilderness. The land has been managed as wilderness study area for more than 20 years. The area involved includes a mix of Ponderosa Pine and riparian vegetation and provides habitat for an array of species including the Red-tailed Hawk, bobcat and fox. The area features opportunities for hunting, hiking and horseback riding, among other activities. The area also includes a 1,000 foot deep canyon, Largo, which connects the Canadian River outside of the area. 
   I would like to commend my colleague, Representative TOM UDALL, for his fine work on this legislation. He has worked tirelessly to gain broad support for the measure before us today.

   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, as Sergeant Friday once said, for those of us who remember back to our youth and the old television series, he used to say, ``Just the facts, Ma'am.'' 
   While we are debating the importance of a 20-year study that puts about an additional set-aside of land in New Mexico for a wilderness study, it seems that we have gotten off track here. But let me for the record, as Sergeant Friday once said, just state the facts. 
   Between 1999 and 2007, the number of drilling permits issued beginning with the Clinton administration, during the Bush administration to present day issued an increase in development of public lands on application of permits to drill increasing 361 percent. Let me repeat that. In the last 8-plus years we have increased the applications for permits to drill in public lands, both onshore and offshore, 361 percent. 
   The Bureau of Land Management has now issued over 28,776 permits to drill on public land. Yet at that time, today, only 18,954 wells have been actually drilled. In other words, 10,000 wells have been stockpiled in terms of the permits that have not been drilled. 
   In addition to that, when we talk about making additional available land, whether it's on the Florida coast or the California coast, we know there is opposition to that among both parties, but the fact of the matter is, again--as Sergeant Friday used to say, ``Just the facts, Ma'am''--the area that's available for energy companies to develop is 47.5 million acres onshore on Federal lands that are currently being leased by oil and gas companies. 
   Today, only about 13 million of those acres are actually in production. Again, there are over 47.5 million acres that are currently available for use to be drilled for oil and gas. Only about 13 million acres are actually being utilized. 
   Clearly, there are a multitude of solutions that deal with this painful, painful energy dilemma that we find ourselves in today, not just in the United States but in other parts of the world. There are short-term solutions and there are long-term solutions. 
   Frankly, in my opinion, the sooner we get past this blame game--because if my memory serves me correctly, the loyal opposition was in control for 12 years to develop this comprehensive energy policy. We have been in the majority for less than a year and a half. Yet all of the blame somehow is seemingly being placed on us. The issue on ANWR that was talked about earlier passed this House in previous Republican-controlled houses, only to never see the light of day over in the Senate. 
   So, we can play the blame game, but what Americans want when I go to my constituencies, my district, is us to fashion bipartisan solutions that are commonsense that involve both the short-term dilemma that we are in and long-term solutions. Frankly, when we come together, in my view, to put together that sort of a bipartisan comprehensive effort is when I think we are going to be addressing the long-term needs for our country. 
   Now, the bill before us obviously has nothing to do with the discussion we have just had. For 20 years, 20 years, Congressman TOM UDALL and his colleagues in New Mexico have worked diligently to determine whether or not these lands could be put aside. That's what H.R. 2632 does, as amended. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure before us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Minerals on Public Lands, it is my opinion that the oil and gas companies would not be buying the leases to these lands if they did not believe that oil and gas could be produced there. Yet these same companies are producing in other areas. Two months ago I was in the Gulf of Mexico surveying a lot of good work that is being done there, American companies and others that are actively drilling for both oil and gas. 
   But let me repeat again the current circumstance which we are dealing with. Trends include not only the fact that 13 million acres are actually being used out of the 47 million acres that are on shore, but when you look at offshore, 10 million acres of the gas and oil land that has been leased to these companies are being used out of the 44 million acres that are currently being leased. 
   If we extrapolate from that, the fact is that today's production rates on Federal land and waters, we can estimate that 68 million acres of leased but currently inactive Federal land and waters could produce 4.8 million barrels of oil and 44.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day, if the vast amount of land that is leased on which permits to drill have been allowed but is not currently being utilized were taking place. Are there other opportunities or options out there along with all of the other variables of trying to come together with a comprehensive energy plan, certainly. But I think my parents told me a long time ago that to be prudent, you first ought to use those available resources that have been approved by both the Federal Government in terms of Federal lands, both on shore as well as offshore, and the States that we are also dealing with in the circumstance. 
   So we are inventorying them and keeping a close eye on it, and we want to encourage that those lands already leased are utilized to the degree they could be utilized. And clearly, obviously, we will continue to look at all of the renewable sources of energy that are in our energy toolbox because there is no one silver bullet.

   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 1158 recognizes the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Ozark National Forest in Arkansas. 
   On March 6, 1908, then President Theodore Roosevelt set aside, by proclamation, the Ozark National Forest which today includes more than 1 million acres in the northwestern part of the State. The Ozark National Forest is one of the true gems of our national forest system, providing extensive recreational opportunities, more than 500 species of trees, habitat for 11 threatened or endangered species, and it's very appropriate therefore today that the House recognize the forest's 100th anniversary. 
   This resolution is sponsored by the entire Arkansas delegation, and they are to be commended for their work on this measure. Representative John Boozman and the sponsor, Representative Mike Ross, have worked particularly hard to get this measure to the floor today.

   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia indicated earlier in his comments with regards to statistics gained by the Minerals and Management Service, which the last time I've checked has been under the executive branch of our Republican administration, has increased the leases to public lands, both on and offshore, 361 percent. 
   In addition, the gentleman from Georgia indicated that there is an increase in revenues to the Minerals and Management Service, therefore to our Nation's treasury, because, in fact, more leases are being provided, and there is more oil and gas being derived from those oil leased lands.     
   It is illogical and it would be unfactual to conclude that if revenues are up and more energy companies are seeking those leases, that they are seeking leases to lands that do not have oil nor gas. It is clearly illogical and unfactual. 
   These energy companies are smart, competitive companies. They do not lease lands that they have not surveyed and that they do not have a great degree of certainty, based on the seismology, that in fact there is oil and gas there; otherwise, these record bids that the gentleman made reference to that just came back 2 months ago would not be record bids for dry holes. 
   As a matter of fact, again, the Department of Interior that has been under the stewardship of our Republican leadership for the last 7 1/2 years recently released a report, a report by Secretary Kempthorne, that indicates that only 38 percent of the oil and 16 percent of the natural gas today on public lands, whether they be onshore or offshore, are being excluded from leasing. 
   The fact of the matter is is that we need the energy. We need to do everything we can to stabilize our gas prices. We need to reduce our dependency from energy offshore. This administration and the previous administration started that effort in 1999, but that alone will not reduce our dependency on foreign sources of energy; therefore, we have to work together in a bipartisan effort to use all of the various energy management tools that are in our energy toolbox if we are going to address this issue in the short term and the long term.

   The narrow view of stem cell research espoused by the administration places unrealistic limitations on the medical research capabilities of this Nation. The administration's position on this critical issue leaves patients across the country without the hope that they can be cured of the effects of medical conditions, including but not limited to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, as well as spinal cord injuries. 
   Every person who has had to watch a mother, a brother, a friend, a family member, knows of this terrible, terrible, difficult problem. I know. I have had that experience. 
   These conditions may be curable through stem cell research, but it will only be possible if Congress asks for full-fledged research to take place. We owe it to the afflicted and their families to put forth the best efforts to find cures for these debilitating medical conditions. 
   I urge the House to put political posturing aside and give hope to patients and families by passing this important measure today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, today it is my honor to rise in strong support of House Resolution 1438, which commemorates, as noted by the two previous speakers, the 50th anniversary of the Azorean Refugee Act of 1958. 
   This resolution is sponsored by the Portuguese Caucus, my colleagues and good friend Congressman Devin Nunes and Congressman Dennis Cardoza. We've worked on this together, not only to take note of this significant anniversary, but also to coordinate with our guests, the President of the Portuguese Parliament and three members of the House of Deputies. 
   It was September 27, 1957, when the island of Faial experienced a series of volcanic eruptions that lasted for over a year and shattered the economic infrastructure of that island, and had impacts throughout the Archipelago. 
   During that time, two great United States Senators, John Pastore of Rhode Island, who represented a large Portuguese constituency, and Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts, later to become the 35th President of the United States, offered to help those who were suffering as a result of this natural event that devastated the islands. They did so by drafting and passing the law of Azorean Refugee Act of 1958.  
   It made available special non-quota immigrant visas available to the victims of the earthquakes and volcanoes, and it was extended until 1963, that allowed even more refugees to come to the United States. 
   Between 1960 and 1980, over 175,000 Azoreans have come to establish and develop their roots in the United States and, at the same time, maintain their family relationships to their friends and their members of their families in the Azores and in Portugal. In fact, the 2000 U.S. Census showed that there were almost 2 million Portuguese-Americans in the United States, many of them of Azorean descent. 
   Mr. Speaker, these Portuguese immigrants have contributed greatly to the fabric of our Nation, not only in the Northeast and New England, but in California as well. As has been noted, they have participated in all walks of life. In my district and Mr. Cardoza and Mr. Nunes' the Portuguese-Americans have been dominant in the San Joaquin Valley, not just in the dairy industry, but yes, they've also become teachers and doctors and judges and yes, even Members of Congress. 
   The Portuguese culture is thriving in the San Joaquin Valley, and there are many festas throughout the year, family reunions, the exchanges of those traditions and the ties that bind us quite well. 
   It's important to note that we have, as I mentioned a moment ago, a visiting delegation. Up in the gallery we have the President of the Assembly of the Republic of Portugal, President Jaime Gama. With him are the former Speaker, Joao Moto Amaral, next to him is a member of the House of Deputies, Antonio Filipe, as well as Ricardo Rodrigues. And we're very appreciative that they be could be here to witness this 50th anniversary and this acknowledgment, because we need to understand that it's more than just like immigrants before and immigrants since. We have had a solid relationship with Portugal with the largest Air Force base, military strategic diplomatic involvement as it relates to just not Europe but the Middle East and Africa, all very vital to America's interests. 
   Again, we want to recognize all those Portuguese-Americans for their contributions to our Nation, the Azoreans who came to America under this Azorean Refugee Act. We want to thank our Portuguese Caucus, Congressman Nunes, Cardoza, Congressman Frank, Congressman Kennedy and McGovern, all who are cosponsors of this resolution who represent significant Portuguese communities. 
   We also want to thank Chairman Conyers, Ranking Member Lamar Smith and the leadership on both sides for moving this resolution in an expedited fashion through the committee process and onto the floor. We urge an ``aye'' vote.

   I thank my friends Chairman OBEY and Ranking Member LEWIS, and Chairman MOLLOHAN and Ranking Member WOLF for their hard work and specifically for including sufficient funding to complete the construction of the Mendota Federal Correction Institution. 
   Crowding at Federal medium-security facilities currently is 37 percent over capacity. 
   The Federal Bureau of Prisons expects 7,500 new Federal inmates annually. 
   Once constructed, Mendota would provide 1,552 beds to help address the growing demand. 
   The BOP has spent $100 million to complete 40 percent of a prison in Mendota. 
   With this bill, the Federal Government is stepping up to a commitment that was made to California and Mendota by providing enough funds to complete the prison. 
   Mendota, is a city with an 18.6 percent unemployment rate and 42 percent living below the poverty line. 
   The prison will provide good jobs and a major boost to a very depressed local economy. 
   Again, thank you to my colleagues, completing Mendota is a sign that our new majority is committed to responsible governance.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to welcome this much needed debate, on perhaps one of the greatest challenges facing our generation, our country, this war in Iraq. I intend to support this nonbinding resolution not because I believe it is perfect, rather in fact I feel it is probably imperfect. 
   But I am supporting it because I hope this will be the beginning of a rational, bipartisan dialogue for a new direction to be employed together with the House of Representatives, with the Congress working together with the President. 
   For after all, Mr. Speaker, we are the people's House. The choices that we have before us today are more than simply cut and run or stay the course. For after all, we know a long time ago that was nothing more than a sound bite, and the American public understood that it was nothing more than a political sound bite. We are a wonderful country. We have tremendous resources, ingenuity, and we have credibility notwithstanding our difficulties today throughout the world. 
   And therefore, as the world's greatest super power, we have resources and means in which we can offer alternative choices to bring together people, not only in the Middle East, but allies throughout the world that supported us in the past. 
   Everyone who has talked about this nonbinding resolution talks about the cost. We all talk about their support for our men and women in uniform, our support to continue to ensure that they are properly funded and to ensure that we always, always remember the current costs that have been expended, over 3,000 lives, over 23,000 that have been injured, and a fiscal accountability that has gotten lost in the checks and balances of the Congress, a war that initially was advertised to cost us $60 billion is now in excess of $379 billion, $8 billion a month, with a supplemental request for another $235 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, we do not need nor should we micromanage the war. But we should, as an equal branch of Government, require and demand accountability. That is why I stood up on this floor 2 weeks ago supporting the Blue Dog Accountability Act to ensure that we have an opportunity to review on a regular basis the conduct of the war, the no-bid contracts, the single sourcing, putting our troops in harm's way without adequate armament. 
   Let us not forget, for almost 4 years our President and the course that he conducted and the case he has made has had a blank check, literally a blank check to conduct this effort as he saw fit.     
   And it has only been in the last 6 months when it became abundantly clear in the last year that it was determined that a new course or a new direction would be needed. But, unfortunately, so much of this new course that the President offered last month is more of the same and, unfortunately, too little too late. 
   I told the President that I was doubtful on this surge. Why? Because we have had previous surges, back in August of last year a surge in Baghdad with six brigades that was promised by the Iraqi Army. They delivered two. They weren't very good. We neutralized Sadr City. Maliki got political pressure placed on him. We were asked to leave. 
   Unless we have a robust political effort that accompanies this surge, I fear, unfortunately, more of the same will occur, which is why I asked the Secretary of State last week what is plan B? 
   We are, whether we like it or not, in the middle of a sectarian civil war. And unfortunately, the folks that we are trying to referee are more concerned about how power is distributed and how oil revenues are distributed as opposed to instituting a democracy in the Middle East. And therefore, we need a new direction. 
   Have we not learned the lessons that many of us remember from the Vietnam War? Secretary Powell knew those lessons well. Remember what Secretary Powell advised our President? He says, Iraq, Mr. President, is like a Pottery Barn. We break it, we own it. Unfortunately, how true those words have come. 
   But Secretary Powell knew from his experience as a general that the Powell doctrine invoked four principles, one, to have overwhelming support of the Nation; two, in fact, to ensure that we  had a broad international coalition; three, that we went in with overwhelming force; and, four, that we had an exit strategy. None of those are in evidence. 
   So let me close. I believe that a new direction is evident. I believe America is less safe today than it was before the 9/11 attacks. And as violence in Iraq climbs and the costs continue to soar, we need a new direction in Iraq in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I ask my colleagues to work on this bipartisan manner, evaluating the facts, not on rhetoric, to create a real plan for security in Iraq, stability in the Middle East, and let's not forget Afghanistan, the problems that exist in Lebanon today, and let's come together as a nation. Our troops deserve better.

   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, what the American people want is for us in a bipartisan effort to come together and use all the energy tools in our energy tool box to, in fact, solve America's energy problems. Such an effort is being sponsored today in part by the House Renewable Energy and Efficiency Caucus, of which I am a member. 
   Renewable energy and energy efficiency are important tools for reducing our reliance on imported oil and addressing climate change. In my home State of California in 2007, 23.5 percent of our electricity came from renewable resources such as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric facilities. We've made a lot of progress. The Fresno-Yosemite Airport near my district recently installed solar panels that provide 40 percent of the airport's need for electricity. At my alma mater, Fresno State, we've built shaded parking using solar panels that provide over 20 percent of the energy necessary for the university. We also have dairy farmers and utility companies partnering together to generate electricity through methane gas. 
   This is the kind of partnership and cooperation and collaboration we need. This is an exciting time for renewable energy and energy efficiency. I encourage all to visit this very important expo and forum in the Cannon Office Building.

   Today, we continue that commitment by passing the Defense authorization conference report, which includes a much-needed 3.5 percent pay increase for our troops, improves military health care, and requires a report on the current state of readiness for our forces, which are stretched very thin. 
   Madam Speaker, this Congress has a proud record this year of supporting our troops and veterans. I hope all of our colleagues will join in continuing these efforts by supporting the Department of Defense authorization conference report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza) for yielding me this time to speak in support of this rule. 
   What we are really talking about this morning is do we choose the easy road of least resistance to provide tax relief with the alternative minimum tax or do we choose the more difficult road that requires fiscal discipline, that requires us to be honest with the American taxpayers as to how we are plotting our fiscal priorities for our Nation today, tomorrow and for future generations. 
   We are debating the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2007. It is important tax relief for millions of Americans. I support this legislation as it stands now. It is actually the second time in recent months that the House will send a paid-for alternative minimum tax relief to the Senate. It is important that we do this. 
   According to Secretary Paulson and the Department of the Treasury, unless we fix the AMT, 25 million taxpayers will be subject to it in 2007. That is 21 million more Americans than in 2006. 
   However, it is important, I believe, and I think many of those in the Blue Dog Caucus feel as well, that we pay as we go, that we provide the PAYGO provision that has been in every measure that has passed this House since January of this year. 
   PAYGO was implemented by the Democratic Congress actually back in 1990. It was signed into law by the elder President George Bush, and it was part of the rules of the Congress for 11 years. It was a tool that we put in place to rein in deficits that the Federal Government had experienced since the early 1970s. 
   This Congress pledged to reenact that pledge to the American people, to bring our House back in fiscal order. We have kept that promise since January of this year. Every single bill that we have voted on has complied with the PAYGO rule. 
   It is important that we note that our current debt is $9 trillion. Enough is enough. Much of that debt is owed by foreign nations. We can pass today the Alternative Minimum Tax Act by not borrowing money from China because of this PAYGO provision. I want to thank the leadership of this House for sticking with PAYGO. I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure, the rule and the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (SUPPORTING THE MISSION AND GOALS OF NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding me the time. 
   I rise today to introduce House Resolution 1053 with my colleague, Congressman TED POE. This supports the mission of the goals of National Crime Victims' Rights Week, and that designated that this week, April 13 to April 19, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. 
   Congressman Poe and I introduced this resolution on behalf of Victim Rights Caucus members who have joined this effort over the recent years. 
   In 1980 President Reagan first called for a national observance to recognize and honor millions of victims of crime in our country, their families and survivors. And with a bipartisan effort in Congress, that took place. 
   National Crime Victims' Rights Week also pays tribute to thousands of community-based systems for victims service providers, who, in fact, provide support to the criminal justice system and allied professionals, who, in fact, help those victims of crime every week throughout the country. 
   This year's theme for National Crime Victims' Rights Week is ``Justice for Victims, Justice for All.'' We, as a Nation, must do more to ensure that all victims of crime are afforded their legal rights and provided with assistance as they face financial, physical and oftentimes psychological impacts of crime. 
   When I first arrived in Washington almost 4 years ago, there was a lack of an advocacy group of behalf of victims' rights and issues. Congressman TED POE and I decided, as new Members, that we would put together a Victim Rights Caucus. We're very proud of the effects of this caucus in the first 4 years of its origin. 
   The goals of our caucus are simple: One, to represent crime victims in the United States in a bipartisan effort by supporting legislation that reflects their interests and their needs. 
   Two, to provide ongoing forum for proactive discussion between Congress and national victims assistance organizations to enhance mutual education, legislative advocacy and initiatives which promote justice for all, including, most importantly, the victims of crime. 
   Three, to seek opportunities for education to public education initiatives to help those in the United States to understand the impact on crime on victims and to encourage their involvement in crime prevention, victim assistance and community safety. 
   And, fourth, to protect the restitution fund that was initiated in the early 1980s. Those restitution funds go to the benefits of victims of crimes. Unfortunately, this administration has tried to redirect those restitution funds, which are not taxpayers dollars, but, in fact, criminal dollars, to the general fund. This Congress and the previous Congress prevented that from occurring. 
   Our caucus has been very successful. We have authored legislation, and I want to thank Congressman TED POE for cochairing the caucus with me, and for all of the Members of the House of Representatives who belong to this caucus. 
   Crime victims are our sons, our daughters, our brothers and our sisters, or neighbors and our friends. And they are struggling to survive in the aftermath of crime. They deserve our support.

   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I simply want to note for the Record that I had voted previously for the supplemental measure, and that if I had been here at the time, I would have voted ``aye'' on rollcall No. 265. It is consistent with my previous vote on this measure. While this measure is imperfect, I think on balance it provides the benchmarks the President has recommended. It also provides disaster relief that I think is necessary for many areas of the country that have experienced disaster that the President has so designated in his own message, and I want the Record to note that I would have voted ``aye'' on rollcall No. 265.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2262, HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the Rules Committee for their cooperation and assistance in bringing this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I think there are many reasons why we should support the rule proposed for H.R. 2262. Most important among them is what I believe is a sound, solid legislative process that has led to the amended version of H.R. 2262 that we have before us today. 
   Now, with deference to my colleague who just spoke, let me be clear that the process has worked. Proper order has been followed. We have worked on this issue for most of the last 10 months with the subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Energy and Minerals on Public Lands. 
   The Subcommittee on Energy and Minerals on Public Lands has the jurisdiction to provide a balance. This balance we talk about often in the subcommittee. It is a challenging balance because on the one hand we are to protect and preserve the natural heritage of our Nation's public lands for all of our citizens to enjoy in perpetuity, and to ensure that those public lands remain available for all generations of future Americans to benefit from.     
   There are many numerous ways in which we benefit from them. We know historically that those public lands have played a very meaningful role in our Nation's development, and it's that balance. 
   In this case, the subcommittee knows that the energy and the mineral developments that took place in the 19th and the 20th century were key and critical to the development, economically, of our Nation, and they also had obviously a very important role in the social development as well because if it were not for the discovery of gold in the 19th century in California and the opportunities that discovery brought forth, as in all the other minerals and energy that have been discovered on public lands in the 19th and 20th century, we would not have seen the opening of the West. 
   So, therefore, our subcommittee and the members on the subcommittee are very mindful of the fact that we have this dual role: balancing the resources that provide important energy and minerals to our Nation's wealth and at the same time preserving and protecting those same public lands to ensure that, in fact, they will be available for future generations of Americans to come. 
   And, yes, one other thing, when those public lands are being used in that dual role, since they belong to all Americans, that, in fact, all Americans are able to derive some benefit of the wealth that is derived from the utilization of those public lands for either mineral resource or for energy development because, remember, these lands belong to all Americans, unlike private holdings. 
   So when I took over the subcommittee chairmanship early this year, this issue clearly was going to be one of the issues that Chairman Rahall wanted to address. Why? Well, for two decades, Chairman Rahall has attempted to reform this law. This is not a new issue. Let's be clear about this. This is no rush to judgment of some issue for the sake of having an issue on the floor. 
   The mining law that was put together in 1872, signed by then-President Ulysses S. Grant, has not been changed, modified in shape or form since President Ulysses Grant signed it into law in 1872. 
   Back in the late 1970s and 1980s, Chairman Rahall, Congressman Rahall from West Virginia, a person who  has a great deal of mining that takes place in his own district, came to this issue and wanted to make necessary changes for all the right reasons. As I took over the subcommittee chairmanship early this year, we decided we would build on that record and that effort of Chairman Rahall. 
   In response to complaints, the minority has raised about having more hearings on this measure, let me tell you about the good work that the subcommittee and the committee has done. 
   The Subcommittee on Energy and Minerals, we've held four hearings this year on H.R. 2262, the 1872 mining law. Two of them, one in Elko, Nevada, with Members of both parties well-represented and Senator Reid, the other one in Tucson, Arizona, provided valuable opportunities for local input from community citizens. In total, we have heard from over 33 witnesses in two field hearings and a multitude of hearings here in our Nation's Capital. We have done what you're supposed to do in the process. We've listened. We've made changes. 
   Those hearings led to significant improvements in the bill, improvements supported by both the conservation community as well as the mining industry. That's not to say that everybody has gotten everything they want because, of course, that never happens in this process. No bill will ever be perfect on all sides, but this is a bill that has had thorough vetting and due, some would say past due, for all the attention this matter has gotten over two decades. 
   I would also note that there's a long history as it relates to the mining law reform, the history that really predates this legislation, as I noted. 
   So I think it's important to understand that we have taken into account over the last two decades hearings that have been held in the following States: Nevada, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska, all States in which mining is of critical importance. 
   In short, the need for mining law reform is not a new issue. It's one that has extensive legislative history. The flaws of the current law are well-debated and analyzed. 
   I appreciate the leadership's interest in H.R. 2262 and Chairman Rahall's leadership and look forward to the debate on the amendments before us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, having, as I said, held extensive hearings on this issue over the last 10 months, I think it's important that we respond to the comments that were made from my good friend, the gentleman from Nevada. 
   We did have witnesses who testified on the issue of royalty. We had several witnesses that indicated that an 8 percent royalty would not be unreasonable, some even said perhaps too low. 
   Taxpayers for Common Sense actually urged a higher rate. James Otto, a royalty consultant to governments around the world, stated that he would normally counsel a country to impose a gross royalty of between 2 and 5 percent. However, he did say that a proposed 8 percent might not necessarily be too high. Why? Because a depletion allowance, depletion allowance, which is a tax break, enjoyed by the hardrock mining industry in the United States is significant. 
   Mr. Otto pointed out that the depletion allowance works like a negative royalty. Perhaps only four countries in the world offer such a lucrative tax break, in this case, to our mining industry. This would be offset by a potential 8 percent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for all your hard work on this issue, not just this year, but for the last two decades. I also want to thank the ranking Republican member, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), and the ranking member of our subcommittee, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), for all of their hard work over the last 10 months. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is an important piece of legislation and it provides a balanced approach to public lands. It recognizes that hardrock minerals to our lives are important, but they are also important as a public trust that belong to all Americans. 
   During this process over the last 10 months, we held numerous hearings at which over 33 witnesses testified. For example, in Pima County, Arizona, earlier this year, we had local government  and citizens talk about the important values, as well as the impacts to water, wildlife and recreational opportunities. We also listened to State and local government and tribes and gave them the option to close sensitive lands which are critical to their communities, or to have restraint. Lands that provide, in fact, drinking water supplies. 
   In Elko, Nevada, the subcommittee received additional testimony from people to understand how important the mining is to those communities in those towns. Let's make it clear. We do not want to put those mining operations out of business. They provide a viable industry to this Nation which has already been substantiated. We gained a better understanding on the ways that industry strives, and they are doing a marvelous job for the most part in being responsible and following regulations which they must comply with. 
   Many States have already taken initiatives. The committee listened. We have taken amendments which make mineral exploration provisions to benefit an important part of the industry to keep the momentum and the motivation there. We also took changes in title III to set forth strong national standards for mining but make sure that we are not duplicating existing State law and regulations. The subcommittee hearings in Washington also focused on the issue of royalties, which has been much talked about. 
   Let me address some of those criticisms at this time about it decimating the mining industry. Some of us are old enough to remember Sergeant Friday from Dragnet. Remember what he used to say: ``Just the facts, ma'am.'' Well, the facts are this: These are multinational companies that mine in areas throughout the world, and they pay royalties in those countries. They pay royalties in those countries, and they are existing and doing fine, as they are doing fine in this country. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the total income subject to the proposed royalty, which I would submit is a work in progress, would average roughly $1 billion a year. These are public lands. We require the same for oil and gas production. It is a relatively small number when you take into account that the total U.S. mining industry produces $23 billion each year. 
   The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that the cost of this legislation, should it become law, would approximately be, with this royalty, $200 million over a period of 5 years. That is $200 million over a period of 5 years, a $23 billion a year industry in this country. We think that is a fair shake for these lands that are owned by all Americans, and it makes a serious opportunity to resolve something that has been contentious for two decades. 
   The industry will tell you that they want certainty. They don't want the vagaries from administration to administration. They know this is a work in process. They know the issue of royalties are subject to negotiation between us and the Senate as this measure moves on. 
   So let's be clear about it. This measure, in short, I think reflects a thoughtful and informed process. Did everybody get everything they wanted? No. Is the process still moving along? Yes. We will continue to work with our colleagues of the loyal opposition as we try to endeavor to create a bill that reflects the best interests of America. 
   Let me quickly respond to the issue of the precious metals. This chart explains it very clearly. The U.S. Geologic Survey ranks the import reliance for nonfuel mineral materials. According to the USGS, there are 30 nonfuel minerals on which we are 80 to 100 percent reliant on imports. Simply put, we almost completely import these minerals, as has been stated, rather than produce them domestically. 
   Now, that sounds worrisome, and the Republicans have noted that. But it is important that we realize that 19 of these 30 minerals, two-thirds of them, are not ``locatable'' and therefore are not subject to the 1872 mining law. So the reform of this law will have no effect on the production or the imports of those minerals. They will not be subject to the royalty we propose or the environmental standards. 
   Of the other 11, all but one are simply not available in terms of commercially marketable quantities in the United States. We depend on imports of these minerals. Ones like graphite and rare earths do not exist in deposits where it is economical to produce them or they don't exist on public lands, so they are not subject to the legislation. 
   So if it ain't here, you can't mine it. 
   The only mineral among those 30 that are 100 percent import reliant into this country and impacts both the 1872 mining law and that are ``locatable'' minerals, the only one that is actually located in deposits large enough to be economically produced is fluorspar. Fluorspar. We are dependent upon fluorspar. Now let me tell you what we use fluorspar for: Toothpaste. We get fluorspar from China, Mexico, South Africa and Mongolia. We don't need to worry that the cleanliness of our teeth is in jeopardy because of this mining law.     
   The last time I checked, tooth decay, while distasteful, is not a national security issue. I ask that we support this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (CONGRATULATING 2008 NCAA BASEBALL CHAMPION FRESNO STATE BULLDOGS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Nunes, for the introduction of this resolution. He has the university in his congressional district. Congressman Radanovich and myself share the same sort of pride and enthusiasm for the university, and all three of us work very closely with the institution, we think one of the finest academic institutions in the country. Congressman Bishop, we thank you for your kind words. 
   We want to recognize today the Fresno State baseball team, the Bulldogs, the Bulldogs of the West, on their victory over the University of Georgia last month to claim the 2008 NCAA Division I baseball championship of the country. Obviously, as Congressman Nunes mentioned, I am a proud alum of the University of California at Fresno State, or as we like to refer to it, the Bulldogs. 
   What Fresno State accomplished in their road to victory winning the national championship has all the makings of a movie. The Dogs came into the tournament, it was noted, fourth regional seed, and along the way beat prestigious powerhouse universities like Rice, the University of North Carolina, two big wins. They are the first, as was noted, fourth seed to reach the finals and win the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship in any sport in the history of our country.     
   As a matter of fact, they are the lowest seed to win a national championship, including professional sports. They went from underdogs to wonderdogs. The team played on the road for 40 straight days and 40 nights. Forty days and 40 nights they played away from home, first going to Baton Rouge to win the WAC tournament, then going back to Long Beach to win the Western tournament, and then to the super-regionals in Phoenix to win that tournament, beating the University of Arizona twice, with their record of 30-2, the University of Arizona in their home stadium; yet the Bulldogs prevailed to put themselves in the College World Series Finals. 
   What's important to note about this long trek, this incredible journey, is that there were five Bulldogs who made this year's College World Series All-Tournament Team. They were Erik Wetzel, Steve Susdorf, Steve Detwiler, Justin Wilson, and Tommy Mendonca. Congratulations to all of them. They were all Californians. 
   These truly are student athletes in the finest sense of the word. I suspect the majority of these folks will never play professional baseball, although I suspect they all might want to, and we wish them the best in their endeavors. But these were student athletes who are getting a college education and, in the meantime, enjoying those wonderful aspects of student sports for their university and for their own pride of accomplishment. 
   Tommy Mendonca, from Turlock, California, was named the College World Series Most Outstanding Player and was recently named to the 2008 National Collegiate Team. He comes from a strong Portuguese family, that both Congressman Nunes and I share, and we enjoyed watching him play all season long. 
   The character, the camaraderie, the preparation, and the ultimate performance of the success of this team flows from Coach Batsole and his wonderful staff that really made a difference.  When the team started out 8-11 at the beginning of the season, expectations diminished, but they didn't let that, with a series of injuries, put a damper on their spirit, and that spirit of the Bulldogs came back. Go Dogs! 
   I want to thank my friend Congressman Nunes for introducing this resolution and my dear friend Congressman Radanovich for his support for the university. This is a great time that we share for the Valley and for the University of Fresno State.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 96th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. 
   On March 24, 1915, 300 Armenian leaders were rounded up and deported and killed under the orders from the young Turk Government. And so began the genocide that lasted for 7 years, resulting in an estimated over 1.5 million Armenian deaths. To this day, unfortunately, the Turkish Government denies that this occurred. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the House, I just returned from Darfur with a group of our colleagues 2 weeks ago. Over 450,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in Darfur; yet government officials claim there in Darfur and Sudan that there is no genocide, that the situation is overblown. 
   Yesterday Rwanda, today Darfur. And we can remember the Holocaust. 
   Clearly, silence is genocide's best ally. It is time that the Congress end this silence and pass the Armenian genocide resolution. The message will be clear: the United States of America will never forget and never stand for those who support genocide.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (H. RES. 109, PINEDALE ASSEMBLY CENTER RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 109, recognizing the historical significance of the Pinedale Assembly Center located in Fresno, California. 
   The history of this internment center is a reflection of the 65th anniversary of Executive Order 9066, which reminds us of a dark chapter in U.S. history. 
   On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the order authorizing the forced internment of over 120,000 Japanese Americans, placing tremendous hardship on the innocent that, in many cases, resulted in a loss of jobs, businesses, property and ultimately, in some cases, their dignity. 
   Further, the internment was a violation of their constitutional rights. Internees were denied their liberty, their civil rights, the right to due process, and equal protection under the law. Yet, no Japanese American, before or after their internment, was ever accused or convicted of espionage or sabotage. 
   In fact, over 14,000 Japanese Americans served valiantly and on a voluntary basis in our Armed Forces during World War II with great distinction. One could only imagine what went through their minds, the members of our military, as they defended our Nation's freedoms, while their own families were languishing back in American internment camps. 
   Pinedale, then, following the order, was a relocation center, and the Japanese Americans throughout the West were asked to report to these relocation centers. This relocation center handled over 4,823 individuals. 
   Numbers are just numbers, ladies and gentlemen. But let me tell you some of the stories that passed through this camp. 
   A dear friend of mine, and a beloved Member of this body, the late Congressman Bob Matsui, arrived at the Pinedale Assembly Center at age two. Congressman Matsui fought against all odds, as did all of those, and despite the prejudice and the hardships, rose to be a great leader of our Nation. 
   Another story, James Hirabayashi, interned there at age 17. And he wrote, and you can imagine hearing the words: ``My parents and three siblings and myself occupied a single barrack at the Pinedale detention camp. However, we were soon to be split further apart and never regained the unified family life during the war.'' 
   Later, James received his Ph.D. at Harvard, became a professor of anthropology at San Francisco State and now chairs the Asian Studies program. 
   Another story: Jack Hata was evacuated to Pinedale on his 21st birthday. He recalled: ``The assembly center was made up of rows of tarpapered black barracks enclosed by barbed wire fencing with armed guard towers. The most vivid recollection of the Pinedale experience had to be that of a strong, hot wind picking up every mid-afternoon blowing dust over the entire camp and making seeing and breathing very difficult.'' 
   Today, ladies and gentlemen, much has changed. Pinedale is a part of our history, a place of loss, of hatred and fear. But now it will be transformed into a place of remembrance for healing and hope. 
   The Pinedale Assembly Center Memorial Project Committee cosponsored by the Central California District of Japanese American Citizens and the California Nikkei Foundation is establishing a memorial. The memorial would not have been possible without the dedication and diligence of all those who have supported this effort, including Judge Dale Ikeda, chairman of the memorial project. 
   I am one of those that serves on the Project Advisory Committee. But Dale says it best: ``By preserving the Pinedale Assembly Center story, we hope to teach a lesson in history, that it takes people to ensure `justice for all.' And rather, it is the duty of each generation to strive to form a more perfect union for ourselves and for the sake of our children.'' 
   The memorial groundbreaking will take place next week, February 19, on the 65th anniversary of the executive order. 
   Today, over 5,000 Japanese Americans, many former World War II internees and their families, live in Fresno County, and the Pinedale Memorial will honor these and those who suffered during that period. 
   The memorial sends a message that we are committed to healing historical wounds and replacing the prejudice and fear with the American values of equality and justice. 
   It has been said that those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Let's make sure this memorial helps us learn. 
   Allow me to close by reading the parts of the memorial plaque inscription that will be dedicated next week:  ``This Memorial is dedicated to over 4,800 Americans of Japanese ancestry who were confined at the Pinedale Assembly Center. This was an early phase of a mass incarceration of over 120,000 Japanese Americans. They were detained without charges, trial or establishment of guilt. May such injustices and suffering never recur.''

   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 93rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, which, sadly, was the first genocide of the 20th century, a template for a cycle of genocide that continues to occur to this day. 
   The Armenian Genocide involved the issue of man's injustice to mankind. It continued to occur throughout the 20th century, as we know, in the Holocaust, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and now in Darfur. 
   Growing up in Fresno, California, as we proudly say, the land of William Saroyan, I heard many stories as a young man from the grandparents of our neighbors, the Kezerians, the Koligians and the Abramhian families, about being forced to leave their homes and farms, the stories of long marches and systematic murders. They believe it was the first genocide of the 20th century, and ladies and gentlemen of the House, I believe it was too. 
   Genocide is not something that can simply be swept under the rug and forgotten. The United States cannot continue its policy of denial regarding the Armenian genocide, and I encourage that we once again reconsider the passage of H. Res. 106 to recognize the Armenian genocide.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (SUPPORTING THE MISSION AND GOALS OF NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, as a cochairman of the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, along with Congressman Ted Poe, we rise today in support of House Resolution 119, the 2007 National Crime Victims' Rights Week resolution, expressing the sense of Congress' support for Victims' Rights Week and the efforts to increase public awareness in the United States and throughout the country with everything that is occurring, as my colleagues have indicated. 
   I also want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Congressman Scott for their leadership on victims issues and for helping bring this bill to the floor today, as well as the gentlewoman from West Virginia. 
   Allow me to begin by sending our thoughts and prayers to those victims, the wounded, the friends and the families who were touched by the tragedy at Virginia Tech last week. We as Members of Congress and throughout the country are wearing these ribbons symbolic to remind all of us that in our Nation, and in the world, crime knows no boundaries. 
   Victims of crimes are sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, parents, neighbors and friends. They are those who are struggling to survive the aftermath of crime, and therefore they deserve our support. They deserve the services to help them cope. 
   When I came to Washington 3 years ago, I discovered that there was a void in the leadership on victims issues, so together with my colleague, Congressman Ted Poe, we developed the bipartisan voice for victims in Congress, the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, which we together cochair. For Members and staff who are listening today, we welcome your participation in this Crime Victims' Caucus. 
   On behalf of the caucus, we have introduced this legislation to recognize the fact that, as most Americans know all too well, crime knows no country, no geographic, no demographic, and no political boundary, and it touches all of our communities, unfortunately. 
   This resolution before you provides support for Victims Rights Week and the Crime Victims Fund, which are two legacies of a former President of ours, President Ronald Reagan. Let me give you some of the history of how the Crime Victims Fund started. 
   First of all in 1980, President Reagan, with bipartisan support in Congress, called for a national observance to recognize and honor victims of crimes and their families and survivors. The Democratic majority in the Congress back in the 1980s supported that effort. This week also pays tribute to the thousands of community service providers, those providers throughout our country, that give critical support to victims every week of the year. Victims Rights Weeks have been observed annually, therefore, across the Nation since 1980. 
   But the Congress and President Reagan at the time's commitment to rights of victims led to the passage of what then became known as the Victims of Crime Act, which in 1984 created a Crime Victims Fund. The concept behind the fund is smart and it is simple: We take fines levied on criminals and distribute that money to the victim services providers, those which we talked about. The concept behind that effort is that it is not taxpayers' dollars, it is money that comes from those fines levied on criminals, and they distribute the money to those care providers throughout the Nation. Therefore, let me emphasize, this is not taxpayers' dollars. 
   Yet, for the third year in a row, this administration is trying to take that money meant for victims and to put it in the abyss of our current efforts to balance the general fund. I might support that if in fact these were taxpayers' dollars, but they are not. These are criminals' dollars that are levied for their criminal act. It is simply wrong. 
   For the last 2 years, the Crime Victims Caucus led the effort to protect that fund, and we are doing so again this year. As long as I am in Congress, I will continue to fight any effort that would effectively deny services to those victims. 
   Let me tell you what the Crime Victims Fund has done over the years. It has dedicated more than $8 billion annually and supported more than 4,400 victim assistance programs throughout  the country that has benefited over 3.8 million. It helps get beds in domestic violence shelters, it helps ensure that rape victims receive proper counseling, and, sadly, sometimes it even has to go to help families pay for funeral expenses. 
   This fund, therefore, plays a critical role in all of our communities throughout the country. Several groups which I am proud to represent in my own district include but are not limited to the Marjorie Mason Center in Fresno, the Kern, Fresno and Kings County Probation Departments, Clinica Sierra Vista, the Rape Counseling Service of Fresno and the Comprehensive Youth Service. 
   Our caucus is committed to ensuring that this fund is used for what President Reagan intended: to help victims who truly need and deserve their assistance and to hold offenders accountable, as the Congress intended to do in 1984. 
   In 2007, the National Crime Victims' Rights Week theme is ``Victims Rights: Every Victim, Every Time.''     
   This week from April 22 through April 28, observances are taking place throughout the country in thousands of communities, as indicated by my colleagues. 
   Unfortunately, last year the FBI Uniform Crime Reports found that crime again is on the rise. Violent crime rose by 3.7 percent. Murders increased by 1.4 percent, and robberies were up by 10 percent. This means that victims suffered the indignation of crime and have significant losses that affect them physically, emotionally, and financially. Our caucus and our Congress must recommit our energies to ensure that ``every victim of every crime'' has access to support and services. 
   Therefore, we must talk to the millions of Americans who are victimized each year. We must recall that every violent crime has a victim and every victim has a story. We know about the teenage girl who leaves home for the first time to go to college, to be impacted by a rape; or the young mother who is beaten by her husband on a regular basis but fears leaving him because he has threatened to kill her kids and she has no money and no place to go. Every victim, every time. 
   Therefore, we must do everything we can. The 22 leading national organizations have come out in official support of the Victims' Rights Week resolution including the National Network to End Domestic Violence, Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, Justice Solutions, National District Attorneys Association, National Children's Alliance, National Coalition against Domestic Violence, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and the National Center for Victims of crime. I include the full list for the Record. 
   Victims Organizations Official Support for H. Res. 119 
   Organization: Justice Solutions; National Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators; National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children; American Probation and Parole Association; National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center; the National Judicial College; American Society of Victimology; National Center for Victims of Crime; National Alliance To End Sexual Violence; National Organization for Victim Assistance; Stop Family Violence; Mothers Against Drunk Driving; The National Coalition of Victims in Action; National Association of Crime Victim Compensation Boards; National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; National Network To End Domestic Violence; National District Attorneys Association; Jewish Women International; National Children's Alliance; Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections; Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network; Security on Campus, Inc.  
   Let me close by recognizing one victim advocate in particular for her valuable contribution in this field throughout the country, and her friendship and support of crime victims, Anne Seymour. She helped Congressman Ted Poe and I organize the Crime Victims Caucus 2 1/2 years ago. People like Anne and all the organizations I mentioned are where the rubber meets the road. They are the direct providers, meeting the needs of victims every day. They truly are the unsung heroes, and this resolution honors their efforts. 
   The Congressional Victims Crimes Caucus is committed to working with victims, service providers, and advocates to ensure that from the courtroom to the U.S. Capitol, the voices of crime victims are heard. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this significant resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (ISRAEL'S 60TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, today we have an opportunity to signify an important milestone in Israel's history. We celebrate its 60th anniversary, a truly important time in Jewish history. 
   My district in the San Joaquin Valley is the bread basket of the Nation, but we have a unique relationship between California State University at Fresno and Ben Gurion University of the Negev. My constituents for years have been partnering with their counterparts in Israel to research water, irrigation technologies and agricultural solutions to problems that face our world. 
   Fresno State has a long history in working with many leading drip and micro-irrigation equipment manufacturers in Israel, and the university has a long history of exchange of information with the Agricultural Research Organization's Volcani Center in Israel, including exchange programs that have brought research scientists to work on water and salinity issues. 
   Fresno State continues today to have discussions with Israeli researchers and industry on how to extend a beneficial use of the world's ever shrinking supply of water for the important purpose of feeding our world. 
   For this and many other reasons, we recognize and celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Nation of Israel.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise to urge the House to defeat the rule as well as the AMT fix bill. 
   Legislation before us violates the promises we made to American people in January. We knew in January that complying with PAYGO would not be easy, but up until today, we've fulfilled our commitment. 
   In passing this legislation, we are merely again borrowing from China to pay for a short-term fix that needs a long-term solution. This administration has run up $5.6 trillion in debt over the last 6 years of irresponsible fiscal policy. How much debt passed on to our children is enough? Enough is enough. 
   PAYGO was to be one of the most important reforms we pledged, and today we are now becoming part of that problem by adding to the already $30,000 in federal debt for every man, woman and child in our country. 
   For decades, Republicans have preached the gospel of fiscal discipline and balanced budgets. When and how has that notion gotten lost? We should stay here until New Year's if we have to in order to find a way to offset the less revenue that will be going to the Treasury. 
   I support fixing the AMT problem, both in the short run and long term, but the issue is whether we are responsible or irresponsible legislators.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (BLUE DOGS -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. I thank my dear friend, Congressman Mike Ross from Arkansas, for his leadership not only in the Congress but among our fellow Blue Dogs. 
   I rise this evening to speak on behalf of a comprehensive effort to really address America's energy needs. 
   We have certainly heard a lot of political posturing that has taken place over the last year about various types of energy proposals, and I think the sad fact is that the American public is not looking for a Democratic nor are they looking for a Republican-Democratic energy package; they are looking for an American energy package, one that addresses our near-term needs with the energy crisis that we are experiencing today, one that focuses on our interim challenges that we face, and one that focuses on the long term, over the next 20 years, because Americans realize that it has taken a number of decades to put us in the hole that we are in today, and that certainly overnight we can't a la Harry Potter wave a magic wand hoping that our energy challenges will simply be wished away. It simply is not possible, and the American public knows that.     
   What they do expect is their elected representatives, Democrats and Republicans, to come together, put partisan differences aside, and sit down and try to figure out how we reduce our dependency on foreign sources of energy, as Congressman Ross mentioned a moment ago, reaching almost 70 percent now of the energy that we consume in America each year; almost 70 percent imported from foreign sources. 
   To put it another way, this year, Americans will transfer in excess of $750 billion. Let me repeat that. We will transfer in excess of $750 billion of American wealth to purchase our energy needs. Talk about digging a hole. 
   And where does that wealth go? It goes, in the form of petro dollars, in some cases, to sometimes friends of us, and then sometimes into the pockets of petro dictatorships which certainly wish us no good in the world of the geopolitics that we live in today. 
   We have certain countries in the Middle East that are playing both sides of the terrorist aisle. So, in that sense, we are really financing both sides of the war on terror. We're trying to, obviously, eliminate terror in our world, but yet we have countries in which we are purchasing our energy from who play both sides of the fence and use that, almost like the Mafia did in terms of protection money. 
   So, Americans want us to put together the kind of comprehensive energy policy that I think our Nation deserves, an Apollo-like program that really sets goals over the course of the next 10 years, short-term goals, interim goals, and long-term goals that will not just reduce our dependency on foreign sources of energy, but on fossil fuels, using all the new technologies that are out there that, in fact, will create more American jobs; that will create cleaner air, that can also be exported in terms of technologies around the world. 
   So is there such an effort going on? I'm pleased to tell you, tonight, yes, there is. There is such a bipartisan effort. It began back in early June with a group of Republicans and Democrats sitting together, one night a week, for 6 weeks, talking about what we thought was the art of the possible, the common sense that Americans expect us to use when we're here on the floor of the House and we're in committee. And as a result of that, we produced the National Conservation, Environmental and Energy Independence Act, introduced with 28 Democratic cosponsors and 28 Republican cosponsors on the day that we left session in July. Today we have over 120 cosponsors. 
   Now, this isn't a Blue Dog proposal. This isn't a Democratic proposal. This is not a Republican proposal. This is a bipartisan work product of like Members doing what Americans expect us to do, and that is, sit down and figure out solutions and compromises to some of the most difficult challenges we face as a Nation. 
   Now, what's this bill do? It's a simple bill. It's 34 pages long. It's three titles. The first title is offshore and onshore leasing and other energy provisions. It basically opens up the Outer Continental Shelf within 25 to 50 miles, giving States an opt-in provision, that could be modified in other ways, that we believe, over a course of the next 20  years, will develop $2.6 trillion. Conservative estimates. These are based upon what the Mineral and Management Services estimated the last time they surveyed Federal lands, both on and offshore. When they last surveyed lands on and offshore in the 1980s, using old technology, not the new technology that has 3-D seismology that we use today to determine carbon footprints of oil and natural gas, in those days, what they determined existed in the Gulf of Mexico today, as a result of literally hundreds of leases that have been let in the gulf, we have developed, in that time period of over 20 years, 3 1/2 times more energy resources than was estimated to be there by Mineral and Management Services in the 1980s. Using those same conservative estimates we base this $2.6 trillion that would be realized as a result of opening up these Federal lands, both on the Outer Continental Shelf and on land. 
   Now, what would we do with this money? Well, we have the same royalty program that exists today, in which energy companies bid for leases that come up on a regular basis, and then, of course, these energy companies pay a lease, if they successfully bid on a parcel of leases; and then after they do their due diligence and determine if it's worth, in fact, drilling and utilizing the oil and the natural gas, then they pay a royalty. So we get monies three ways. We get monies when the energy companies first bid on the leases, then we get money when they lease the land that they have successfully bid on, and then, if they decide to determine to drill for oil or natural gas, we get the royalties. $2.6 trillion, we think, is the conservative estimate. 
   Where would we spend that money. We'd put 30 percent of it in the general fund. That would, over the time period, amount to $780 billion. For States that decided to participate they would receive an equal 30 percent or $780 billion. How many of our States could use that money to invest in the infrastructure? That $780 billion could be so helpful in dealing with our national debt. 
   We would also put 8 percent for the conservation reserve. We'd also put 10 percent for an environmental restoration reserve account. We'd put 15 percent for renewable energy reserves. 
   We all want to get off of our addition to fossil fuel. Even the President here said that in his State of the Union speech. But we can't wish our way from fossil fuel. We have to be able to finance the renewable fuels. This would do that. 
   It also would provide 5 percent for carbon capture sequestration and to regenerate nuclear waste. We shouldn't be storing it at Yucca Mountain. We ought to be regenerating it like other countries do. There is energy in that waste, and it could be utilized on those plants. 
   And, also, we need to look at conservation. We need to apply energy standards in residential and commercial buildings that is low-hanging fruit, and provide also support for low income home energy assistance programs for those people who are on fixed incomes, those who are working poor, those who most need the support for to conservation. That's the first title. 
   The second title would provide funding for cleaner energy production and energy conservation incentives. In other words, we would provide continuation of tax credits for existing renewables, for solar, for wind, for the cellulosic fuels, for the new technologies, like, that we think will be so important in creating the new American industries of jobs and energy; and to include bio diesel and other renewable fuels that include the hybrid vehicles that our colleague, Congressman Ross, spoke of that he and I and others have actually had the opportunity to drive. 
   This is what we ought to do. This is taking existing innovative efforts in renewables and funding them, financing them, because that's how you get there from here. This is the interim strategy. 
   The third title of the bill is a portion of the bill that I am going to let my colleague and good friend, Congressman Nick Lampson discuss, because it's an important part that deals with the near-term issues. It involves the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it dedicates some of those revenues and the conservation to 
   energy research programs. This will have an immediate effect in lowering the prices of the existing gasoline, diesel and other fuel oils that we are, currently Americans are hard hit with. 
   Let me close by saying that this measure has the support of 18 Blue Dogs as cosponsors. Certainly, a large percentage of my Blue Dogs colleagues are supporting this, or they are supporting Congressman Green's proposal or Congressman Mike Ross' proposal. But the Blue Dogs share a common desire to put the partisan politics behind us and really do America's business in addressing our long-term, interim and short-term energy needs. 
   Be sure of one thing. This energy crisis that we are in today will be with us for the foreseeable future. We are just one international crisis away from rationing fuel in America. We saw what happened in Russia's invasion of Georgia just a week ago and the implications on that for energy policy. 
   Nigeria provides 10 percent of some of the sweetest, cleanest crude that we import in America. You would think, well, maybe 10 percent's not too much; we could live without Nigeria's oil. 
   Well, let me tell you something. That 10 percent of the oil we receive from Nigeria provides 36 percent of all the gasoline consumed on the East Coast. We know the problems that we have in Nigeria today and the Delta and the instability there, as in other parts of the world. So, Americans expect us to look at a short-term, interim and long-term energy policy. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues, my Blue Dog friends understand that we must use all the energy tools in our energy tool box, and that's what these series of proposals attempt to do, to use, as my parents taught me, a long time ago, Jim, use just some good common sense. You know, Jim, if you use good common sense you can get a lot done and you work with people and you don't care who gets credit. Well, that's what these proposals are all about, to use all the energy tools in our energy tool box for the near-term, the interim and the long-term energy needs of our country. 
   And with that, I yield back the balance of my time to my colleague, Mike Ross and my fellow Blue Dogs. Thank you very much.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. I, too, want to congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for an effort that has extended now over 2 1/2 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, certainly the measure before us, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, reflects a bipartisan compromise and consensus not easily gained. 
   I represent three of the country's most productive agricultural counties in the Nation. In my district alone, farmers grow over 300 various crops, which oftentimes are referred to as specialty crops, fruits, vegetables all sorts of diversified good food in America. 
   For the first time the important segment of American agriculture is being recognized, not in the form of subsidies, but in support of research, competitiveness programs, focusing on pest and disease prevention efforts. Not only does this help our growers, but it helps our consumers to ensure availability of safe, healthy fruits and vegetables for our citizens, a diet that's based upon good science. 
   Our farmers are working hard to implement better environmental stewardship programs, but they face continued challenges as it relates to air quality concerns and water shortages. This makes improvements in those areas as well. 
   Is this bill perfect? Certainly not, but it represents a hard-fought compromise. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.

   Mr. COSTA. Madam Chairman, I want to thank you and the ranking member and the members of the committee for the hard work on a bipartisan basis that really produced, I think, a good product. 
   Unfortunately, I have to rise against the Kind amendment, not because it does involve reform, but I think it involves reform in a way that uses a meat ax and does not provide transition for American farmers, something I think I know something about. 
   You see, I represent a third-generation farm family that has been farming in the San Joaquin Valley since the turn of the 19th, early 20th century. What this bill does, what this amendment does, if it were to be enacted, is not provide the level of nutrition or research and competitiveness for food safety and conservation that the underlying bill has, which is why I support the underlying bill, because it provides real reform. It provides nutrition. It provides the efforts to make American farmers more competitive on a global basis with global markets, provides reform in a host of areas. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I urge that you vote for the underlying bill. Vote against the Kind amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (HUBBARD ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. I want to thank Congressman Kind for his hard work in this very important legislation. 
   I rise tonight in strong support of H.R. 6580, the Hubbard Act, named after Jason and his brother Nathan Hubbard, to fix a flaw that exists, as Congressman Nunes so well stated, in the Department of Defense's sole survivor policy that really originated from the Sullivan Act that was referenced during World War II when the Sullivan family lost all of their sons in a naval combat action during World War II. 
   Right now, the Department of Defense allows a remaining son or daughter serving in the military to be removed from combat or to accept an honorable discharge. However, as we found with the circumstances facing the Hubbard family, military benefits like signing bonuses or access to the GI Bill can be taken away. This is not right. Jason Hubbard of Clovis, California was put in this situation after tragically losing both of his brothers. This legislation would allow a member who voluntarily separates honorably, under the sole survivor aspect of the law, to qualify for programs like the GI benefit, to be allowed the use of the commissary and base exchange, and entitled to benefits of the veteran home loan and other entitlements that our veterans who serve their country so honorably deserve. It was tragic to find that after the circumstance, that there was a request that he return his signing bonus benefit, but Congressman Nunes stepped in and, with the Secretary of the Army, changed that. 
   The legislation that we are about to pass here reflects veterans throughout our country. Our Central Valley, the San Joaquin Valley in California, has a proud history of men and women who have worn the uniform and defended our country in a troubled world, both in the 20th century and the 19th century, and of course today in the conflict in the Middle East, in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The Hubbard brothers now are a part of this honorable military history that all our veterans share in, and like the Sullivan brothers, are being recognized for their service. 
   This bill is fully paid for, and therefore PAYGO compliant. I want to thank Chairman Rangel for his willingness to make this extra effort. In multiple conversations that many of us had with the chairman, he understood clearly, as a fellow veteran, the importance of this legislation. Congressman Kind also showed leadership in his efforts. And of course as Congressman Nunes noted, without Senator Feinstein and Senator Chambliss' help, we would not have gotten the measure out through the Senate. 
   Finally, my good friend, Congressman Devin Nunes, has been tenacious on this piece of legislation, representing his constituents and the Hubbard family, but more importantly, all veterans throughout the United States. The passion and the leadership which Congressman Nunes demonstrated on this bill is reflective of his passion for his constituency and for our country. 
   So I want to thank Congressman Nunes for his hard work on behalf of the Hubbard family, Nathan and Jarrett, who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, to their family and to their brother Jason, who we have named this legislation on behalf of.

<DOCNO>Mr. COSTA. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Thank you very much, the gentleman from Arkansas. I appreciate having an opportunity to share with my fellow Blue Dog colleagues this evening the challenges that our country is facing as we wage this war on terrorism, and try to bring together some level of stability in Iraq. 
   The War Funding Accountability Act that the Blue Dog Coalition is sponsoring, that we present to you this evening, is an attempt to bring accountability that has sorely been missing almost 4 years now after we have been engaged in this effort. And we, as Americans, are all engaged in this effort. 
   This War Accountability Act, if it successfully passes Congress, would require the Department of Defense Inspector General, as well as the Special Inspector General for Iraq on Reconstruction, to report to the Congress every 30 days after any supplemental bill passes, and quarterly thereafter. These reports, unfortunately, have been lacking over the last 4 years. 
   Now, as we look back, there has been a lot of water that has passed under this bridge, at tremendous costs, beginning first with over 3,000 American lives, men and women that have been lost, and over 20,000 Americans who have suffered injuries as a result of this engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   We are talking about the fiscal costs here this evening. But there is no way that we can put a cost or a value on the American lives that have been lost in this effort to try to bring stability and continue to protect Americans on this war on terrorism. 
   What has been lacking is accountability. The Blue Dogs feel strongly that accountability not only in the fiscal sense, but accountability in how we have engaged in this war effort needs to be seriously focused on. And that is why I am supporting this resolution. 
   A couple of weeks ago I met with the President, as he solicited our ideas about how we should go forth. I said, ``Mr. President, I was in Iraq last year, among the first delegation to meet with Prime Minister Maliki, and I asked Prime Minister Maliki what his goals were. He said they were disband the militias, reduce violence, get reconstruction going and move the economy.'' It all makes a lot of sense. Eight months later, going on to 9 months, unfortunately, the Prime Minister's actions have been far deficient of his words. And so today we are focusing on this War Funding Accountability Act. 
   But I said, ``Mr. President, militarily we cannot be successful in this effort alone. There needs to be a political agreement in which the major sectarian factions in this sectarian civil war are willing to agree upon on how to share the political power in Iraq and the oil revenues.'' Let's make no mistake about it. That is what we are fighting in today. 
   Unfortunately, that is the sectarian civil war that we have gotten ourselves into, and without a political solution, we will not be successful in Iraq. 
   I have been there. I looked into the eyes of the American men and women in uniform who are fighting valiantly on our behalf, and we need to put the same support for them as we try to put for you. So as we demand accountability on single-source bidding, on sole-source contracting for the efforts in Iraq, let's also hold the Iraqi Government to the same time lines and the same sort of accountability that we should be holding our own government for. And for these reasons, I support the Blue Dog Coalition on the War Funding Accountability Act. 
   And as I told the President, ``Put me in the doubtful column as it relates to the surge unless we have a political agreement among the Shiites, the Kurds and the Sunnis on how they are going to share power forthwith and how they are going to share the oil revenues, because otherwise, in my opinion, we are kidding ourselves, and, more importantly, we are misleading the American public. 
   And sadly, what is at stake are the lives of American men and women in uniform who are in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan.

   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4 to fix the flaws of this program for our seniors and to save our taxpayers dollars.  
   For many years, I was the principle caregiver for my late mother. 
   Through her experience and my own, it became clear to me that the prescription drug bill passed by the 108th Congress was seriously flawed from the standpoint of being overly complex and not providing cost-savings for seniors. 
   It's time we make the necessary changes. 
   I've heard those opposed to this bill repeatedly claim it is contrary to free market principles. 
   But I ask you, what could be more apple pie to free market than being able to negotiate over pricing? 
   Those opposed to this bill also talk about the CBO's evaluation of the bill. 
   But what they won't mention is that, in 2003 the 10-year cost estimate for this bill was $395 billion. 
   Do you know what they say now? 
   Part D spending will cost the government nearly double the original estimates. 
   As a Member of this House it is time we support our free market and protect our taxpayer dollars. 
   Let's correct this injustice for those living on fixed incomes and put an end to this prescription drug rip-off. 
   This bill is an improvement. We should and can do better.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 2956, the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. 
   Now, certainly this measure is part of an ongoing effort to try to bring comprehensive change. We do have a vested interest in the Middle East as we are engaged in this war on terror throughout the world. 
   Notwithstanding that fact, though, for 6 years, our administration has had a blank check in Iraq, and that war on terror, and unfortunately, I think, by any critical evaluation, at best it has been bungled. At worst, we have made a mess of things. The previous Congresses have left little to be desired in terms of real oversight. 
   With unlimited resources, we have complicated our relations with the Middle East, and it's unfortunate for our country. It seems for every step forward, we take a step back. This legislation, then again, is another effort to begin a new direction, which will protect our interests in the Middle East and begin to develop a plan to bring our troops home. 
   What is lacking in this legislation though is a requirement for the President to tell us how we are going to, in fact, stabilize the areas with all the diplomatic resources available to us and our allies throughout the world in this region. Nonetheless, under the current circumstances, this legislation, I believe, is the next logical step. Clearly, doing more of the same continues to risk precious lives of American men and women in uniform, not to mention our Treasury, with little responsiveness, unfortunately and cooperation from the Iraqi Government. 
   Hopefully, this legislation will allow the administration to engage and work with us for constructive change that the American people demands. 
   I ask for an ``aye'' vote.
