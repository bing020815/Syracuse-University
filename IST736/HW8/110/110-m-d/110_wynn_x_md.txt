   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, today, we are doing something great for America. 
   This bill makes major strides towards addressing our country's growing energy demands. And it makes great progress towards a brighter and more renewable future for America's children. 
   Energy is what drives the American economy. It is what keeps the lights on. But our use of fossil fuels is warming the planet, and may have catastrophic effects on our children and grandchildren. 
   First, we must conserve energy. For the first time since 1975, Congress is acting to require higher fuel economy for new vehicles. This will save American consumers money, and make American car manufacturers more competitive in the global marketplace. 
   The bill also requires that we begin to generate a significant amount of our electricity--15 percent by 2020--from renewable sources like the sun, wind, and water. The significance of this mandate is that it will encourage the development of a greener economy by creating incentives for the advancement of alternative energy sources.

   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Chairman, we have a very simple amendment here today. It would basically restore $18.4 million for hydrogen technology, which would bring the account up to the level that the administration, through the Department of Energy, recommended. 
   This amendment is supported by the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Caucus. I would note the leadership, particularly Mr. Larsen, in crafting this amendment, also the work of Mr. Inglis of South Carolina and Mr. Dent as part of the Caucus. 
   There are some who would say that hydrogen is too far away. In fact, hydrogen is emissions-free and it is here today. GM has 100,000 vehicles ready to go. Honda has vehicles ready to go. BMW released vehicles last year. There are buses, motorcycles, all of which are being fueled by hydrogen fuel cells. Japan is talking about 50,000 vehicles by 2015. We need to keep pace. We need to put the money into hydrogen technology. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WYNN. Madam Chairman, today I rise to express my concerns with Government Accountability Office, GAO, management's response to the GAO employees' petition seeking a union election. 
   It should be noted that applicable law strictly prohibits the GAO management from expressing any personal view, argument, opinion, or statements relating to a union election except to: publicize election and encourage employees to vote; correct the record with respect to any false or misleading statement; or inform employees of the Government's policy relating to labor-management relations and representation as long as these statements do contain a threat or reprisal or promise of benefit and are not made under coercive conditions. 
   Despite these restrictions, Comptroller General Walker was quoted in a January 23, 2007 publication as stating that he ``will present to the employees [his] views on the advantages and disadvantages of unionization.'' 
   Shortly after this statement was published, attorneys for the union sent a letter advising Comptroller General Walker of his obligation to remain ``neutral'' during the employees' deliberations regarding unionization. 
   The GAO's General Counsel responded acknowledging GAO management's legal obligation to maintain strict neutrality during a union organizing campaign. 
   Further, the Comptroller General met with me shortly before I sent a letter to him regarding his response to the union organizing activities. 
   In that meeting, the Comptroller General tried to discourage me from sending the letter, and promised not to interfere with the unionization effort. I informed Mr. Walker that I appreciated his assurances but that would be sending the letter all the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, as chairman of the Environmental and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, I rise today in strong opposition to an amendment that was offered earlier today by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) to cut funding to the Superfund program. The Superfund program addresses public health and environmental threats from uncontrolled releases of hazardous substances. 
   According to the Center for Public Integrity's May 2007 report entitled ``Superfund Today,'' the Superfund program is desperately short of money to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites, which has created a backlog of sites that continue to menace the environment and quite often the health of nearby residents. 
   According to the EPA, one in four Americans live within 4 miles of a Superfund site.     
   Mr. King's amendment introduced earlier today would decrease funding for the Superfund program by $160 million. This is reckless when previous EPA Inspector General reports have indicated a shortfall of at least $175 million for remedial action projects. EPA's rate of construction completions at National Priorities List sites has dramatically decreased in recent years, from an average level of 86 per year during the years 1997 to 2000, down to 40 sites per year during years 2002 to 2006, and most recently EPA projected only 24 cleanups in 2007. 
   These sites present a serious risk to human health and the environment. For example, at the Libby, Montana Superfund site, where a plume of asbestos from a nearby vermiculite mine has enveloped the town, more than 200 people have died from asbestos-related diseases, according to EPA estimates. Cleanup at this site, begun in 2000, has not yet been completed. 
   Let me congratulate Chairman Obey and Chairman Dicks on their decision to reverse the years of budget shortfalls for the core EPA programs that protect public health. I thank them and their staff for working closely with the Energy and Commerce Committee to increase the funding for these programs that are badly in need of funding after years of inadequate budget requests from the Bush administration. 
   This amendment by Mr. King is shortsighted. Every Member that has a Superfund site in his or her district or State that votes for this amendment could be voting to delay cleanup at that site. At many of these sites, citizens are exposed to uncontrolled hazardous substances. Rather than cutting the funding, we need to support the well-considered funding level in H.R. 2643 for the Superfund program to expedite cleanup of these sites, protect drinking water sources, and allow sites to be redeveloped to spur economic development and create jobs. 
   I strongly urge all Members to vote against the King amendment later today. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will read.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (RECOUNTING REASONS FOR VOTING IN FAVOR OF 2002 RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING USE OF MILITARY FORCE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank first the gentlewoman from California for yielding, and also for her consistent, aggressive and activist leadership on this issue. She has been very courageous throughout. She has always taken a principled position, and she is now leading our efforts to stand up and express our opposition to the President. I want to thank her for that. 
   Sometimes one of the most difficult things for a politician or elected official to do is to say I was wrong; I made a mistake. I am here to say that tonight. 
   After 9/11, after the Pentagon was attacked in addition to New York, my district, which is just outside of Washington, D.C., felt the effects very severely. A lot of my constituents worked in the Pentagon. I went to several funerals, and I was very sensitive to the fact that my constituents in suburban Washington, D.C., in Montgomery County and in Prince Georges County, as Federal workers, were very vulnerable to an attack in what is arguably the number one or the number two target of terrorists in the United States. 
   I represent 72,000 Federal employees, most of whom work right here in the Nation's capital, in the immediate Capitol complex area. 
   At that time, the President was presenting, as the gentlewoman mentioned, extensive evidence about the existence of weapons of mass destruction, about attempts to develop a nuclear arsenal, about chemical and biological warfare, and I was of the belief that the President, on issues of national security, would put politics aside and would consider only the best interests of the country. Boy, was I wrong. 
   It has turned out and become evident to everyone that the President's intelligence was seriously flawed. It was inaccurate, it was distorted, and it was exaggerated to create a false impression of urgency that this country had an urgent threat and that weapons of mass destruction, in fact, existed and that they posed a threat to the citizens of the United States and, in my consideration, a threat to my constituents here in the Washington metropolitan area. 
   We were shown classified information, documents, photographs and the like, all of which were designed to create the impression that we were facing an imminent threat. Assuming the President would not mislead the country, I supported the war. That was a mistake. 
   But then it came to pass and became increasingly evident that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that we were not facing an imminent threat. So in May of 2004, in an appearance before the Muslim Council in my district, I said I think my vote was wrong; I think my vote was a mistake. 
   Subsequent to that, I heard people say, well, what about the fact that we toppled Saddam Hussein? Well, that was a laudable goal, but it was not worth 3,000 troops. Well, what about the fact we created elections and they put their finger in purple ink and they had elections for the first time? I said I agree, that, too, is a laudable goal, but that was not worth 3,000 troops. 
   If you had asked me then to make this decision based on what I know now, I would not have voted to support the use of troops.     
   Because, you see, there are a lot of dictators in the world, some of whom we not only deal with, some of whom we actually arm. There are a lot of dictators that are cruel, that murder their own people, that violate human rights. There are a lot of countries that don't have democratic processes. And yet we do not make the decision that we ought to engage with them militarily. So to my way of thinking, the only justification, the only justification would have been the existence of weapons of mass destruction and an imminent threat to the United States that in fact did not exist. 
   What we have in fact seen is that our military presence has worsened the situation. Areas that did not have terrorists now have terrorists. They are called breeding grounds for terrorism because our presence creates a cause for the terrorists, a motivation, if you will, a catalyst, an antagonism. That is not solving the problem of terrorism. That is not effectively fighting the war on terrorism. Our military role has not been productive and effective; in fact, it is been counterproductive and sadly ineffective. 
   It is time to withdraw our troops. We need to begin now to withdraw our troops so that the Iraqis will take more responsibility for their own security. In fact, Mr. Maliki says that is what he wants us to do. He says, ``Give us the weapons, we will do it.'' He is not so excited about having us. Clearly, the American people don't want to be in Iraq. More importantly, the Iraqi people don't want us to be in Iraq. It is time for us to pull out. We are in the midst of a civil war, one that we cannot resolve, and therefore we are not playing a constructive role. 
   We are now on the eve of another adventure in Iraq or, should I say, misadventure, in which the President is proposing not to withdraw but just the opposite, contrary to the recommendations of the joint chiefs, contrary to the recommendations of the Iraqi Study Group. The President is saying, Let's send more troops. He calls it a surge. Folks, it is a troop escalation and an escalation of this war, and I will oppose it. 
   There is a saying that the old folks used to say: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. 
   Mr. President, you fooled me once. Shame on you. Fool me twice? I don't think so. 
   I am opposed to any troop escalation. I am opposed to any surge. I am opposed to any expansion of this war by military means. Yes, we have to fight the war on terrorism, but it seems to me we need to use diplomatic means to create an environment in which we can promote peace. We need to involve the other countries in the region, be it Shia or be it Sunni, who have an interest in a stable region. It is their region. They don't want war as a way of life in their region. Let's involve those countries, the Egypts, the Jordans, the Saudi Arabias. Let them get engaged in helping resolve this war. Let us step back from this war. We need to implement diplomatic solutions. 
   So this is not a question of withdrawing United States leadership. We need to leave, but we need to leave diplomatically. We need to understand that, in the modern world, the use of military force is extremely limited, limited in its utility, because we are operating in a different environment, a terrorist environment, an insurgent environment in which additional troops  only work for a temporary period of time. The insurgency withdraws, melts away, and then reemerges, which is to say, the President's proposal can only lead to a permanent U.S. presence of even more troops, putting them in harm's way. 
   We have lost over 3,000 troops. The Iraqi people have lost tens of thousands more, maybe even hundreds of thousands. It is time to withdraw our military presence. It is time to advance the cause of peace through diplomatic means and diplomatic leadership. 
   I want to thank the gentlewoman again for giving me this opportunity to speak.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Rules Committee for yielding. 
   I rise in support of this rule. I am a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I watched 2 years ago as my Republican colleagues larded up the Energy Policy Act. While we were trying to talk about energy efficiency and we were trying to talk about energy conservation, they were giving over $8 billion in tax breaks to the oil and gas companies, the companies that are making huge profits right now. 
   What this bill does is roll back that tax break as well as require the oil and gas companies to pay appropriate royalties to the government, appropriate royalties to the taxpayer. 
   This bill is looking forward. I am afraid my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are looking backwards. They are still talking about oil and gas. We on the Democrat side, however, get it. We understand that, yes, we are using oil and gas today, but we are also running out of oil and gas in the world and in this country and that we must have alternative energy sources. 
   So what do we do? We say, let's take this unnecessary tax break of $8 billion and let's collect our royalties and let's put that money in a trust fund to develop alternative energy, renewable energy that can last us well into the latter part of this century. 
   Now, personally, I am very enthusiastic about hydrogen fuel cell development because hydrogen fuel cell development definitely leads us down the road to energy independence. Hydrogen fuel cells don't have any emissions; they don't leave any emissions. Hydrogen fuel cells aren't dependent on foreign countries. It is a technology we can develop here in this country that will really make us energy independent and will also address the problem of global warming. But we must invest in it. 
   So let's not look backwards and give oil and gas companies more tax breaks. Let's look forward and invest in renewable energy, in hydrogen, in wind and solar, and the things we have in this country that can make us truly independent. I urge adoption of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that I rise in strong support of this measure. I want to thank our chairman, Mr. Dingell, for his excellent work in what was obviously a long and contentious process. I want to particularly note the work of the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Boucher, the gentleman from Virginia. He did an excellent job moving us through this process. 
   This bill does several very good things. The underlying philosophy, though, is simply this: We all want energy independence. We all want to reduce global warming. But the fundamental thing we have to do here in America is change the way we live. We have to conserve and we have to save, and this bill puts us on the right road to accomplish those two goals. 
   First, the bill addresses the question of fuel efficiency with a compromise that most people can live with, and that is significant because we drive a lot of cars in this country, and it is important that we get the best fuel economy that we can get. 
   We also do some very simple things, such as address the question of energy-efficient light bulbs. Everybody uses light bulbs, and we can do better. This bill moves us in that direction and encourages the development of more energy-efficient lighting. 
   Also, in the course of the hearings conducted by the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Boucher, we heard the National Conference of Mayors say that we need a partnership. If we are serious about energy efficiency and all these lofty goals, it is not just a Federal problem. It is a Federal, State and local problem, and they urged us to include a block grant program to help States and cities and counties participate in the issue of energy efficiency. 
   That language is in this bill. It is called the Energy Efficiency Block Grant Program. It is authorized to the tune of $10 billion. It will allow cities to develop comprehensive programs; towns and counties to develop programs to create energy efficiency, such as programs for homeowners, weatherization programs for seniors, a planning guide for green buildings and more efficiency in planning, traffic flow improvements. All these things could be done through this block grant program. 
   The bill is good. It leads us in the right direction. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1106, which designates April 2008 as National Autism Awareness Month and supports efforts to devote new resources to research into the causes and treatment of autism spectrum disorder. 
   Autism is a developmental spectrum disorder which inhibits an individual's ability to communicate and interact with others. For parents eager to communicate with their child, there is nothing more painful than watching their child fail to provide either a verbal or non-verbal cue of responsiveness. Affecting an estimated 1 in every 150 children and costing an estimated $90 billion to care for those with this disorder, the toll of autism spectrum disorder on our country is significant. 
   The resolution before us supports the goals of devoting new resources to researching the root causes of autism, expanding programs for individuals with autism spectrum disorder across their life span and promoting understanding of the special needs of people with autism spectrum disorder. This resolution also emphasizes the need for early intervention services, starting as soon as the child has been diagnosed with autism. 
   While there is currently no available cure for autism spectrum disorder, early behavioral intervention strategies significantly improve the outcome for those suffering from autism. These strategies can also reduce the level of funding and services necessary to treat people later in life. 
   I would like to note for the record, Mr. Speaker, Ms. Daisy Maggette, my constituent from the Fourth District of Maryland, who has been a tireless advocate and activist in the fight against autism in our community. 
   I would also like to thank my colleague, Congressman DAVID REICHERT, for his work in bringing this resolution to the floor today. I would also like to thank Congressman MIKE DOYLE for his leadership on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution will designate July as Bebe Moore Campbell National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. 
   Mental illness is one of the leading causes of disabilities in the United States affecting one out of every four Americans, and victimizing both those with the illness as well as those who care for and love those afflicted. However, according to a report from the Office of Minority and National Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association, although mental illness impacts all people, African Americans experience a much greater unmet need for mental health services and receive a lesser quality of care, thereby resulting in mental health disparities. Further, according to a Surgeon General's report on mental illness, African Americans who do seek help are misdiagnosed at a higher rate within the mental health delivery system. 
   Communities of color are in need of culturally competent mental health providers and expanding training for all health care providers to serve multiethnic consumers in order to accurately assess and treat African Americans and other minority patients. 
   According to the National Institute of Mental Health, one out of every three African Americans are more likely to stop treatment early, and are less likely to receive followup due to a lack of insurance coverage. Without adequate health insurance, mental health cannot be properly treated. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of African Americans receive mental health treatment, and a significant percentage refuse treatment or view mental health treatment as a treatment of last resort due to a stigma associated with mental illness. 
   To address these problems, obviously we need more resources and access to health insurance. But critically we also need to improve public awareness and encourage minority citizens to confront the illness instead of denying it or being ashamed of its existence in their families and communities. 
   This bill will, number one, raise awareness about mental illness and mental health disparities among minorities nationwide. Second, it will encourage training for health care providers to ensure proper diagnosis of African American patients and minority communities. And, third, it will improve public health by encouraging the expansion of vital mental health care into underserved communities in every State. 
   Let me take a moment and tell you about Bebe Moore Campbell. Bebe Moore Campbell was a renowned African American author who died on November 27, 2006, at the age of 56. She was also my college classmate at the University of Pittsburgh. Through her dedication and commitment, Ms. Campbell sought to remove the stigma of mental illness in the African American community. Her novel, ``72 Hour Hold,'' and her children's book, ``Sometimes My Mommy Gets Angry,'' both bring to light the plight of those with brain disorders. Her goal was to move communities to support mental wellness through effective treatment, increased resources, access to mental health services, and improved community outreach and support. 
   July would be an appropriate month to be designated as Bebe Moore Campbell National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month, since our first book, ``72 Hour Hold,'' which addressed minority mental health was released to the public in July of 2005. 
   I want to thank my lead cosponsor, Congresswoman Diane Watson, as well as all the cosponsors of this bill for their support, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this very important legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WYNN. I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. But it is not the bill I wanted. I think we should begin an immediate troop withdrawal, but this is a good compromise bill that has the virtue of setting a date certain. 
   Now, I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking about ``micromanagement.'' Well, I will tell you, we have great United States troops who perform admirably in spite of the incompetence and lack of planning by this administration. And I will tell you what our troops deserve. Number one, they deserve that we meet the readiness standards that our military has established, and this bill says it. We will meet our readiness standards, and we will make sure our troops are adequately trained and adequately prepared before we deploy them. 
   The second thing they deserve, and this is very important, they deserve accountability by the Iraqi people. The Iraqis need to disarm their militias. The Iraqis need to come up with a political solution. The Iraqis need to divide the oil revenues. That is not something the military can do. 
   Third, our troops deserve a date certain not because we are ``losing the war,'' but because we are going to take a new direction that relies on negotiation and diplomacy, rather than warfare and bloodshed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Mr Chairman, If we are serious about achieving energy independence and reducing global warming, Americans will have to change the way we live, the way we drive, and most importantly, we will have to change from conspicuous consumption to embrace the progressive ideals of conservation. And Congress will have to promote these changes, by making real investments in programs that reduce energy consumption and reduce emissions. 
   This bill is a significant step toward these goals. However, it is only the first step. Critically, this bill does not address emissions caps or fuel efficiency standards, which the Energy and Commerce Committee will tackle after the Recess. 
   Nonetheless, this bill does some very important things to promote a new energy paradigm for America. 
   The bill creates national standards for heating and cooling systems, and mandates improvements to building codes to save energy on new buildings. The bill also contains lighting efficiency provisions based on legislation offered by Congresswoman JANE HARMAN, to significantly increase light bulb efficiency, and encourage the domestic production of more efficient light bulbs by U.S. manufacturers. I was proud to cosponsor that legislation, and am very pleased that it is in this bill. 
   In the area of transportation, the bill provides loan guarantees for plug-in hybrid vehicles and advanced battery development, and grants to local governments to promote use of hybrid vehicles. This bill also includes grants for cellulosic ethanol production and requirements for renewable fuel pumps at what we have come to know as the ``gas'' station. This will increase market penetration of both renewable fuels and flex-fuel vehicles. 
   In terms of electricity, the bill facilitates Smart Grid technology, to enable consumers and utilities to digitally monitor power usage in real-time, and use electricity more efficiently, by using power at times when demand is lower, and reducing use when demand is high. 
   It is important that we move forward with Smart Grid now, and assist technology innovators and manufacturers, as well as utilities, by providing incentives to speed adoption of this new approach to our electricity grid. This is one of the many areas where ``Green'' jobs are being created. 
   During our hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee, the U.S. Conference of Mayors pointed out that if we are to achieve our energy and emissions goals, we need a partnership between the Federal, State, and City and County governments to address energy issues. 
   I was pleased to work on this issue with the Conference of Mayors, and helped get authorization for $10 billion in Energy Efficiency Block Grants included in this bill. Modeled after the HUD Community Development Block Grant, this program will provide formula-based grants to cities, counties, and States. 
   These grants would be used to: (1) fund building and home energy conservation programs; (2) develop ``green'' building codes to promote energy efficiency; (3) develop land use guidelines to promote energy efficiency, increased use of public transportation, and reduce traffic and commute times; and (4) other important local energy-saving programs. 
   While much remains to be done, I believe this bill is an important step towards increasing American energy efficiency, energy independence, and reducing global warming. 
   I urge my colleagues' support of this important bill, so Americans can start changing the way we live and our Government can begin to grow the Green economy.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. 
   Pursuant to the rule, the amendment printed in part A of House Report 110-  300 is adopted and the bill, as amended, is considered read.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding, also for his outstanding leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. I operate from a very simple premise, and that is this, that if America is the greatest country in the world, then all of our children should have health insurance. 
   It's that simple. This bill does that. It covers 5 million additional children of the working poor; and it gives them health care, dental care and access to mental care health services. That's what's needed in this country. 
   It's amazing to listen to the scare tactics of Republicans. It's almost amusing. 
   First, they start talking about illegal aliens. No, that's not what this bill is about. They said, well you are going to kill our private insurance. These are working poor people. They don't have insurance. 
   They said, well, it's $100,000 families. No, it's the existing eligibility limit. Then they say, well, you are going to create a massive new entitlement program. No, it's a grant program with bonuses for States that do a good job of insuring more people. 
   Finally, they resort to Hillary care. We are all supposed to be scared. 
   We are taking this issue very seriously, because we understand that there are working poor people in America that work every day. Half of them are women. They work in the service industries, they work in labor jobs, and those jobs do not offer health insurance. That's why we are here. 
   We are here because when they don't have health insurance. Their children don't get screenings. Their children don't get check-ups. They can't get treated for asthma. When their children are in severe pain, they go to the emergency room, and that costs more money. 
   I will give you example from my district. Deamonte Driver, he had a toothache, tooth decay. It would have cost $80. He didn't get it. The tooth became infected. The infection traveled to his brain. 
   Two surgeries costing $250,000 were attempted to save his life. They were unsuccessful. Deamonte Driver died. We need to prevent these types of tragedies in America. 
   I am appalled when I think about it, that if a third-world Communist country like Cuba can offer health insurance to the families of factory workers, we have to be able to do it here in America, the greatest country in the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (THE CHAMP ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Good morning, Madam Speaker. You know, it's simple: If America is the greatest country in the world, then all our children should have health care. That's what Democrats believe. 
   Today, we're going to pass the CHAMP Act to provide health insurance to an additional 5 million children here in America, the children of the working poor. Who are the working poor? They're the people, one-half of them women, who work in service industries, who work in retail. They're laborers, they're the self-employed. Their employees don't provide health insurance, and they can't afford it. They barely make ends meet. 
   Now, with this bill we will move a long way toward the goal of providing universal health insurance for all American children, and I think that's a good idea. Now, during the course of the day you're going to hear lots of arguments, arguments about processing and why this wasn't fair or done in the right way. You will hear arguments about cost. But let me tell you, at the end of the day, that is all just empty rhetoric and rationalizations. Because the fact is, if America is the greatest country in the world, then all our children should have health insurance. Period.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Madam Chair, the amendment that I am proposing will make sure that the biotechnology research and innovation are included under TIP's funding objectives by expanding the definition of enabling technologies in section 204 of the bill to include ``any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof to make or modify products or processes for specific use.'' 
   Biotechnology is an emerging segment of the technology sector often overlooked as an excellent source of manufacturing jobs and research and development. The biotechnology industry is a driving force in the Maryland economy and a rising sector of the American economy. 
   In the United States, the biotechnology industry has created more than 200 new therapies and vaccines, including products to treat cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and anti-autoimmune disorders. 
   The industry continues to develop innovative therapies over 400 products are currently in clinical trials targeting over 200 diseases. The biotechnology industry is comprised of mostly small start-ups that don't have an existing stream of revenue and are years away from product commercialization. It takes at least 8 years, and then up to $1.2 billion to get a biotechnology therapy approved. 
   It is these small companies, many of which will never see a product come to market or turn a product that are undertaking the bulk of early development gambles and working toward innovative cures. In fact, small biotech companies account for two-thirds of the industry's pipeline. 
   In 2005, there were 1,400 biotech companies in the United States, but only 329 were publicly traded. The majority of the Biotechnology Industry Organization's (BIO) members are small companies that have fewer than 50 employees.

   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation because it is time to take a stand against the violence, the violent acts that flow from prejudice. This is not about the thought police, this is not about sermons on morality, this is about the status of our civilization, and it is about our humanity. 
   As human beings, we have the right to be safe from physical attack, no matter our race, our religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. In other words, human beings have the right to be safe from attacks based on who they are. No one should have to be afraid because of who they are. 
   We need to pass this legislation to ensure that this principle is embodied in our law.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 63, a bipartisan resolution supporting our troops in Iraq, while opposing the President's troop escalation strategy. 
   This marks the fourth year of this war. It is time to bring our troops home now. We have not quelled the violence. We have not thwarted al Qaeda. We have not stabilized the region. We have not deterred terrorist radicals. In fact, because of our presence, there are more jihadists in Iraq than there were before. 
   Thus, I find it inconceivable that the President's response to this situation, 3 years of military failure in Iraq, is to suggest that we add more troops, 20,000 additional troops. 
   Since the start of the war in 2003, over 3,000 U.S. troops have died, more than 50 from my State of Maryland alone. In addition, 23,000 American soldiers have suffered serious injury and will have post-traumatic consequences.  The President's approach will only result in the loss of more U.S. lives. 
   Iraq is in the midst of what has become a civil war between Shia and Sunni. There also is internal tribal and gang violence. Our troops can play no constructive role in this environment, except as targets for all sides. 
   This is not a partisan Democratic issue. Let me be clear. The President's proposed troop escalation runs contrary to the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and military experts such as the Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to a December Washington Post article, the Joint Chiefs have long opposed the increase in troops. 
   Generals Colin Powell, George Casey, John Abizaid and Barry McCaffrey have all expressed skepticism about the President's surge strategy. Even some of my Republican colleagues will oppose this surge strategy, and for good reason. 
   Troop buildups in Iraq haven't worked. U.S. troop levels increased by 18,000 from November 2004 to January 2005 in advance of the Iraqi elections, yet insurgent attacks increased. In 2005, the administration increased troop levels by over 20,000 to secure Iraq ahead of its constitutional referendum. The strategy not only failed to quell the violence, but insurgent attacks increased by 29 percent. 
   Some of my Republican colleagues make an argument that if you support the troops, you must support the mission. They say if we don't defeat radical Islam in Iraq, then where will we do it? Unfortunately, both of these theories are flawed. 
   Our troops have performed admirably, sacrificing life and limb, often without sound strategy or adequate equipment. And, yes, the goal of peace and stability in the Middle East is admirable, but this mission is misguided. The fact is that despite previous congressional support, this mission was inadequately planned and our troops inadequate equipped. In addition, the administration has cast a blind eye at massive fraud, waste and abuse that has undermined the reconstruction efforts and cheated the American taxpayer. 
   We are now in the midst of a civil war that we neither understand nor can we resolve. I support the troops, but I cannot support this ill-conceived mission. 
   As hard as it is for some, we must understand that this is not a World War II type conflict. This is not our great army defeating their great army. 
   We cannot defeat a radical Islamic insurgency militarily. This does not mean we cannot defeat a radical Islamic insurgency. It does not mean that if we oppose a troop escalation or begin withdrawing our troops that we have failed. Rather, it is a recognition of what the American people already know: We need a new strategy. 
   This administration operates under the arrogant assumption that only America wants peace in Iraq. In fact, other Arab nations in the region have an even greater desire for peace and stability. They don't want to see their brethren killed. They don't want to see waves of refugees flood their region. Our new strategy should be a diplomatic initiative to bring countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iran and Syria to the table to engage in finding solutions. 
   Now, I know the war hawks will say diplomatic approaches cannot work. But think about it. It wasn't too long ago that this administration and these war hawks were saying that North Korea was an intractable enemy. Yet today, through diplomatic efforts, we are making appreciable progress. I believe this diplomatic approach can work in Iraq. 
   We need a dramatic change in strategy. We should begin with the withdrawal of U.S. troops and place more responsibility on the Iraqis to foster their own democracy. Most people, including General John Abizaid, understand that we cannot impose democracy on the Iraqis if they don't want it for themselves. That is why I support the End the War in Iraq Act, which would use the congressional power of the purse to bring this war to an end if the administration cannot or will not do so. 
   But in addition to beginning a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops, we must pursue an aggressive diplomatic initiative to involve willing Muslim countries in creating a ceasefire first, a peace process second, and the rebuilding of Iraq in the third instance. These countries have a vested interest in promoting peace and stability in the region. 
   It was said many years ago war is not the answer, and today more war in the form of troop escalation is the absolutely wrong answer. I urge adoption of the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (MERCURY EXPORT BAN ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1534, the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2007. The bill will place an export ban on elemental mercury beginning in the year 2010; prevent Federal agencies from selling, distributing or transferring elemental mercury, except for its transfer between Federal agencies to facilitate storage; and it will create a long-term storage option for private sources of elemental mercury at a facility to be designated by the Secretary of Energy. The location of the designated facility where the elemental mercury will be stored is within the sole discretion of the Secretary of Energy. The bill does not designate a facility location. 
   Let me begin by congratulating Mr. Allen of Maine, the sponsor of this bill, along with Mr. Shimkus, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Environmental and Hazardous Materials, for their hard work in developing this bipartisan legislation which has attained endorsement from the environmental community, the mining industry, the chemical industry, as well as the States. 
   Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that is harmful even at low exposure levels. It disrupts biological processes critical for brain development in developing fetuses and young children. 
   Mercury emissions can be transported over long distances and remain airborne for more than a year. These emissions deposit into water bodies where they are transformed into methylmercury that accumulates in fish and subsequently in humans who eat mercury-contaminated fish. Forty-eight States, including my own State of Maryland, have issued fish advisories warning residents to limit consumption of mercury-contaminated fish. 
   Currently, excess elemental mercury is exported from developed countries to developing countries where it is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining, mainly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This rudimentary mining process releases most of the mercury into the environment, creating thousands of polluted sites and exposing miners and nearby residents to toxic fumes that can cause neurological damage. Data from the EPA and other research groups indicate that 60 to over 70 percent of all mercury deposited in the United States comes from global sources. 
   The United States has an excess supply of elemental mercury that will only increase in future years as the demand for mercury-containing products continues to decline. As of 2010, there are expected to be only four chlor-alkali plants using mercury cell technology in the United States. The decommissioning of these plants would result in an estimated surplus of 1,200 to 1,500 metric tons of elemental mercury. 
   The Department of Defense and the Department of Energy combined are storing close to 6,000 metric tons of elemental mercury and are not selling it on the open market because of the EPA's concerns about the impacts of mercury releases on human health and the environment. 
   This legislation is necessary because the elemental mercury that we export overseas returns to our country in the atmosphere as toxic pollution contaminating our air, soil and water and fish, demonstrating the fact that pollution knows no borders. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of this very important and bipartisan bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I only want to indicate that we are sensitive to the concerns that have been raised, but I do want to clarify that the bill does not specify any particular location, and DOE certainly would be in a position to take into consideration any concerns with regard to where the mercury is ultimately stored. 
   But the point is we do need to make sure that we do not continue exporting this mercury which then comes back to our own shores. 
   I would conclude by saying that I would like to thank Mr. Allen again for his leadership and thank our committee chairman, Mr. Dingell, as well as our ranking member, Mr. Barton. I would like to thank Mr. Upton for his kind words in support of this bipartisan legislation. I would like to recognize the contribution of Mr. Shimkus in working with us and also the role of the stakeholders in bringing together a bipartisan bill that works across the spectrum, both the environmental community and the business community, to give us a bill that I think we can all be proud of.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (LIBERIA DESIGNATION EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Madam Speaker, let me begin by thanking my colleague, Patrick Kennedy, for his leadership on this issue. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3123, the bill which I have cosponsored which would extend the ability of Liberians living in the United States to maintain their temporary protective status designation allowing them to legally remain in the United States, which has become home for many of these Liberians displaced by conflict and civil war in their native country. 
   Founded by freed American slaves, with a flag and a Constitution based on our own, Liberia has always had a special relationship with the United States. In fact, I used to live in a little community in Warren County, North Carolina, called Liberia. 
   But Liberia has had a troubled history in the past few decades. From 1989 to 1997, civil war in Liberia has claimed the lives of almost 150,000 people and displaced 850,000 more. 
   In August of 2003, the U.N. Security Council established a U.N. peacekeeping mission of up to 15,000 soldiers. Although peace has allegedly been restored, these 15,000 troops are still in Liberia today. 
   Based on the election of Ellen Sirleaf-Johnson in 2005, the Department of Homeland Security decided that conditions in Liberia were such that temporary protective status for Liberians currently living in the United States should end. 
   This is illogical. Many of the roughly 3,500 Liberians in the United States today on temporary protective status have been living in the United States  since 1991, over 15 years. They own homes, pay taxes and are pillars of the community. 
   This Saturday I sat with a gentleman who had a 13-year-old daughter. He said, she's never been to Liberia. She only knows America as her home. Many of their children are like this. They've never known any home other than the United States. 
   That alone would be good reason to grant this extension. But the fact is that Liberia still has 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers stationed there. Less than 2 weeks ago, Liberia's former House Speaker and a former top military commander were charged with treason for attempting to overthrow the Liberian Government in an alleged coup. 
   The Sirleaf-Johnson administration is performing admirably in rebuilding Liberia's crippled economy. But there are no jobs or homes for returning Liberians. 
   Many in the Capitol city of Monrovia lack running water or access to electricity, and waterborne illnesses like hepatitis A and typhoid fever are common. 
   Eighty percent of Liberians are unemployed. The Liberian Government has pleaded for an extension of temporary protective status, saying it is not ready to accept the return of these Liberians. 
   Unless we pass this bill, we'll make illegal immigrants of those responsible, hardworking, taxpaying Liberians that fled violence and war in Liberia to seek peace and safety in the United States. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this excellent bipartisan bill supporting an extension of temporary protective status for these Liberians. 
   I urge my colleagues' support for this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (THE SITUATION IN SUDAN, IN SUPPORT OF H. CON. RES. 7 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the growing crisis in the Sudan. Today, earlier today, the House passed House Concurrent Resolution 7, an important piece of legislation that calls on the League of Arab States to acknowledge the genocide in Darfur, to support the U.N. peacekeepers and to work with the U.N. and the African Union to bring peace to the region. I am proud to have been a cosponsor of this important legislation, and I thank the House leadership for its attention to this crisis. 
   An estimated 200,000 noncombatant civilians, including women and children, have been murdered by the janjaweed militia fighters supported by the Sudanese government; 450,000 people have been killed in the conflict. To date, 2.5 million villagers in the Darfur region have been displaced from their homes. Most Darfurians live in camps today. 
   There is no question that the acts of the janjaweed militia and, by extension, the government of Sudan constitute a level of violence that can only be described as genocide. But now that violence has spread. With the splintering of rebel groups into as many as 12 factions, there is increasing rebel-on-rebel violence with the possibility of return to all-out war. 
   The African U.N. has deployed nearly 7,000 troops to the region. Last year the United Nations Security Council authorized a peacekeeping force of 22,000 U.N. troops for Darfur. Those peacekeepers, unfortunately, are still not in place due to the resistance of the government of Sudan. 
   Today, U.N. negotiations with Sudan continue in an attempt to add at least 3,000 U.N. peacekeepers to the existing 7,000 African U.N. peacekeepers, and to allow the U.N. to use helicopters to safeguard peacekeepers and the refugees they protect. The Bush administration has suspended its pending sanctions against Sudan at the request of the U.N. to give these negotiations time to work. 
   I hope that these negotiations will be successful, and that the peacekeepers can be effective in ensuring that there is no further loss of life and that international aid can get to those who most desperately need it. Humanitarian access to refugees is decreasing, due to the administrative foot dragging by the Sudanese government. Humanitarian groups are under increasing pressure due to restrictions placed on them by the Sudanese government, as well as the deteriorating security situation. 
   We must ensure access for humanitarian workers and continue provide to funding and support that they need to perform their lifesaving mission. The conference version of the appropriation bill approved by the House just a few minutes ago included over $360 million in peacekeeping and disaster assistance for the victims of this crisis. That includes $44 million in international disaster and famine assistance funding for immediate lifesaving needs of victims of the Darfur crisis, including health care, access to water, sanitation and shelter, $150 million for additional food assistance in Sudan and eastern Chad. 
   Most of the humanitarian groups now operating in Sudan are doing so supported by the U.S. Government, with money provided by U.S. taxpayers. We must work in cooperation with the United Nations and with our friends and allies around the world to stop these horrific crimes and to provide a essential aid to the victims of this conflict and to bring peace to the region. 
   We must be prepared to keep the pressure on. The emergency supplemental that we just passed calls on the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare a report on companies that do business in Sudan and determine whether the U.S. Government is currently doing business with them. The point is, that if the time comes for sanctions, Congress will be ready. Congress is also calling on Sudan's neighbors to acknowledge the genocide in Darfur and to take steps to stop it. 
   The bill we passed today calls on the Arab League to declare the systemic torture, rape and displacement of innocent civilians in Darfur as genocide. The Arab League must support and accept U.N. peacekeepers to ensure an end to hostilities and the safe passage of humanitarian aid. The Arab League needs to engage the U.S., African Union and Sudanese government to bring lasting peace and stability to Darfur. 
   I am very proud to have supported this legislation, as well as the conference report, and look forward to working with my colleagues to help bring a peaceful future to Sudan and peace to the lives of the Darfurian refugees.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 518, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2007. 
   This legislation is a culmination of efforts that began with the introduction of the international waste bill in the 104th Congress and has been introduced by our committee chairman, Mr. Dingell; and sponsored by all the members of the Michigan delegation, including Mr. Rogers, Mr. Stupak, Mr. Upton, Mr. Ehlers, Mr. McCotter, Mr. Levin, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Kildee, Mrs. Miller, Ms. Kilpatrick, Mr. Camp, Mr. Knollenberg, Mr. Hoekstra, and Mr. Walberg. I want to thank and congratulate all these Members for their tireless efforts to move this legislation to the floor. 
   In March this legislation was reported out of the subcommittee which I chair, the Subcommittee on the Environment and Hazardous Materials, and out of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce.     
   This legislation, which has a long history of bipartisan support, is long overdue in providing States and localities control over the amount of international municipal solid waste that they are forced to accept. 
   The extent of this problem is exemplified by the millions of tons of solid waste that is trucked into this country at the rate of approximately 350 truckloads per day. The volume of the international solid waste that comes into this country on a daily basis places an undue burden on the States' and localities' landfill capacities, as well as their roads and infrastructure, solely at the expense of the States and localities. 
   This legislation seeks to address these concerns by providing the States with the authority to place limits on the amounts of international municipal solid waste that they will accept. It will give the States and the EPA clear authority to safely manage solid waste disposal and to control waste volumes in the best interests of the States and the Nation as a whole. 
   In addition, H.R. 518 provides the necessary legal authority for the United States, through the Environmental Protection Agency, to fully implement the 1986 Trans-Boundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Other Wastes Agreement between the United States and Canada. These are simple steps that will provide the legislative authority to the Federal and State governments, and are also consistent with the powers enumerated in the United States Constitution and our international trade obligations and agreement. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this very important and bipartisan bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. 
   I rise to urge in the strongest possible terms that this House of Representatives override the President's veto. 
   You know, it's really sad that in the greatest country in the world we don't provide health insurance for the children of working parents. We have 4 million additional children that this bill would cover, children whose parents work every day, who work very hard; the children of single moms who work every day; some, like my step-daughter with a 3-year-old son, who go to work every day. But if there is an asthma attack or if there is a major accident, she has to either go to the emergency room and drive the cost up for all of the rest of us or decide not to pay the rent on time so she can pay for the care she needs or go without necessary care. 
   That shouldn't happen in America, and that is what we are trying to do with this very important bill. 
   There is another thing that shouldn't happen in America. In America, a young child shouldn't die because he can't get dental care. That happened in my district. A simple dental infection expanded, grew into the brain and resulted in the death of a young man. 
   We worked on language in this bill to make sure that children in America of working parents could have access to dental care. That is a very important improvement, one that seems lost on the President. 
   Every day we spend millions of dollars. We are up to $600 billion on this war, this black hole of a war. Meanwhile, we tell Americans who go to work every day we can't provide you with health insurance. That doesn't make any sense, not in the country that we regard as the greatest country in the world. 
   So today, Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to really think about what this means. Don't think about the politics. Think about the parents, but more importantly, think about the children who need health insurance now.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (SUPPORTING THE OBSERVANCE OF COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 302. This bill does three things: First, it calls for the designation of March as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. Second, it recognizes national and community organizations for their work in promoting the importance of prevention and early detection through regular colorectal screenings. Third, it urges organizations and health practitioners to ``earn a Blue Star'' by using this opportunity to increase awareness about colorectal cancer. And I will talk more about the blue star in just a minute. 
   But first let me note that colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer and the second most deadly. Approximately 148,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer this year, and 49,000 will die from the disease. 
   Every 3 minutes a loved one is diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Every 9 minutes a loved one dies from the disease. Every 5 seconds a loved one who should be screened for colorectal cancer is not. 
   Colorectal cancer is a silent killer which often causes no symptoms until it reaches the latest stages. Colorectal screenings save lives by catching the disease in its earlier stages. If detected at an early stage, the 5-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is 90 percent. If it is not detected until the later stage, the 5-year survival rate plummets to just 10 percent. 
   This tragedy disproportionately affects minorities, particularly African Americans, who are less likely to have access to health insurance or see a doctor on a regular basis. As a result, African Americans are diagnosed later and are 40 percent more likely to die from the disease. In 2007, 1,600 cases of colorectal cancer occurred among African Americans. 
   Hoping to repeat the success of the red ribbon in symbolizing AIDS and the pink ribbon in symbolizing breast cancer, the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable has selected a blue star to symbolize the fight against colorectal cancer. The star serves a dual purpose; it recognizes the eternal memory of those people whose lives have already been lost to the disease, and it is a shining hope for a future free of colon cancer. 
   This resolution recognizes the important work that national and community organizations have already done in promoting awareness about colorectal cancer, including the creation of Earn a Blue Star day. 
   Additionally, the resolution encourages organizations and health care practitioners to earn a blue star by supporting early identification and removal of precancerous polyps. 
   Recognizing March as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month provides us a special opportunity to focus on education about screening and early detection. As we continue to work to find a cure for colorectal cancer, it is vital that we work together to increase awareness about screening in order to prevent the disease from reaching its deadly conclusion. 
   Before I conclude, I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Kay Granger and Representative Patrick Kennedy, for their leadership on this issue. Although Representative Granger could not be here today, I know that she cares very deeply about this issue and has worked hard to bring this resolution to the floor. 
   I now want to urge my colleagues to join me in support of the adoption of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (ILLUSORY PROGRESS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Good evening, Mr. Speaker. Last Friday, I had the unfortunate occasion to attend the funeral of Sergeant Princess Samuels, age 22, a graduate of Flowers High School in my district and one of the most recent casualties of our misadventure in Iraq. 
   I rise today to comment on what I consider to be a failed policy in Iraq, because she is only one of over 3,700 American soldiers who have been killed in Iraq. Meanwhile, 27,000 U.S. troops have been wounded in action, 12,000 of whom will not be able to return to action, and although we don't comment on it often, at least 50,000 Iraqis have been killed; 18,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in August alone. 
   It was very sad to be with the family of Sergeant Princess Samuels. Her mother, in an understandable note of bitterness, said that here she found herself prepared for a funeral while the Commander in Chief was preparing for a wedding for his daughter. Her anger was certainly understandable, and our sympathies and those of all us in the Fourth Congressional District go out to Ms. Samuels. 
   So I find it very unfortunate that we begin to hear comments such as ``the surge is working'' and that we need to ``stay the course.'' This is the wrong course. This is the wrong course. We need to stay engaged, but we need to move away from this military course. 
   Our troops have fought valiantly and they have done everything we have asked of them. They have done more. But, right now, the GAO report tells us that the strategy is flawed. You see, the strategy was to have a surge that would allow this government some breathing room, and in that breathing room they would have a reconciliation and begin to bring the various sectarian groups in Iraq together. 
   What we found from the GAO report is that that hasn't happened. The surge has only provided the illusion of progress. That is, if you put more troops in, you will reduce the casualties among those troops. But the fact is, the overall level of violence continues to be very high. The number of Iraqis killed remains about the same. 
   Now, last January the President laid out some benchmarks. He said that these ought to be completed, and this is why we are having the surge. The GAO report says only three of the 18 benchmarks have been met. Do the math: that means 15 have not been met. 
   These are not benchmarks that U.S. troops, no matter how valiant, can achieve. These are political benchmarks that this Iraqi Government has failed to achieve. The number of daily attacks over the last 6 months is about the same. In fact, the number of Iraqi army units capable of independent operation has actually decreased. And what we find is insurgents frequently work with the Iraqi police and military forces based on common sectarian ties. 
   There is an interesting article in The Washington Post today. Our U.S. troops are pinned down in a section of west Baghdad and they are calling for relief from Iraqi troops. The relief did not come. Why? Because the Iraqi troops were in league with the Shiite militia in that area and they did not respond. Fortunately, our American troops were able to reach cover and survive, but the story illustrates another failure that is occurring in Iraq as the so-called security forces that we are trying to prop up were in fact working with our enemies. The policy is not working. 
   We can't continue this policy. We need a new direction. We need to look to diplomacy as a way to resolve this problem. People say, well, if we withdraw U.S. troops, there is going to be a blood bath. There is a bloodbath now. 
   The fact of the matter is if U.S. troops withdraw, one of the major catalysts for violence will be removed from the situation. We will then be in a position to support diplomatic efforts, peace initiatives by Muslim countries, by the U.N., by internationally recognized military leaders. Sometimes this country has an arrogance and believes that we are the only ones that can promote peace. I disagree. I believe that other countries, Muslim countries, other people can also promote peace. And I also believe that they want peace, and given supportive conditions, they can in fact create peace. 
   I think we have to accept the fact that the surge gives an illusion of success, but the overall policy has not worked, because the GAO reported the benchmarks haven't been met, and it is time to move in a new direction. I also noted today the British, our allies in this adventure, have already begun to leave Basra, leaving the cities in the hands of the Iraqi security. 
   The point is, everyone but this administration realizes we need a new direction. I hope the administration will look at the GAO report and conclude, as it has, that this policy is a failure and that we need a new policy in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Madam Chairman, as Chairman of the Environmental and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, I rise today in strong opposition to language contained in the report that accompanies the Farm Bill Extension Act of 2007 (H.R. 2419). The report references a ``sense of the committee'' amendment that farm animal manure should not be deemed a hazardous substance pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA). The Farm Bill Extension Act does not contain any legislative text discussing whether manure is a hazardous substance under these statutes. 
   I am strongly opposed to this report language because it would exempt releases or threatened releases of hazardous components of manure from CERCLA and EPCRA. 
   Large animal feeding operations can be significant sources of pollution. According to the EPA, animal farming operations generate approximately 500 million tons of waste each year, three times more raw waste than is generated yearly by people in the United States. This waste, which is usually untreated by operations, produces hazardous substances such as phosphorous, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide. 
   Phosphorous has contaminated local drinking water supplies, requiring additional treatment and resulting in increased costs to ratepayers. The City of Waco Texas for example is spending more than $54 million for capital improvements to address taste and odor problems caused by excessive phosphorous released by cow waste. 
   I also attach a letter from the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, dated July 23, 2007, that discusses the negative impact that such an exemption would have on the quality of our Nation's drinking water supplies. 
   If hazardous substances from livestock waste are exempted from CERCLA, states and local governments would be denied the ability to protect their valuable water supplies and to recover costs associated with cleaning up these hazardous substances from drinking water sources. 
   If hazardous substances from livestock waste are exempted from EPCRA, toxic release information would be withheld from communities and emergency responders. Many of the large feeding operations release large volumes of hazardous air pollutants, such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. A number of studies have determined health problems among animal feeding operation workers and residents who live near these operations, including bronchitis, asthma and antibiotic-resistent bacterial infections. 
   This exemption is unwarranted because CERCLA already includes a specific exemption for the normal application of fertilizer. Only those livestock operators who excessively apply manure to the land to get rid of it, rather than use it to fertilize crops, have potential liability. 
   We should not allow these large animal feeding operations to escape liability for causing pollution to our communities and pass the costs onto community water systems and rate payers. 
   Livestock waste should not be exempt from the environmental protections that CERCLA and EPCRA provide.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (OVERRIDE SCHIP VETO -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Good morning, Madam Speaker. 
   Today, the House will vote to override the President's veto of the SCHIP bill. 
   At the beginning of this debate some months ago, I said that if America is the greatest country in the world, then we ought to guarantee that all of our children have health insurance. Greatness is not measured by the size of our military industrial complex. Greatness is measured by whether we can provide health insurance for 10 million American children. 
   Now, the President has said no, but according to all the polls, the American people say yes. Majorities in both Houses have said yes. Governors have said yes. Private charities have said yes, that we ought to provide health insurance for children in America. 
   This is not a matter of a market fix. Small businesses cannot afford to provide health insurance. Working families, many of them, cannot afford to buy health insurance on the private market. 
   In addition, this bill provides a guarantee of dental coverage, because in America, the greatest country, children should not die because they don't have dental coverage. The bill provides dental coverage and mental health coverage. It's simple: We're the greatest country. We ought to provide health insurance for all our children.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (SMALL BUSINESS FAIRNESS IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Mr. Chairman, let me begin by thanking the gentlelady, the chairman of the Committee on Small Business, for her leadership over the years on this very important issue. 
   The amendment I am introducing this evening would require that the Small Business Administration study the feasibility and desirability of providing financial incentives to encourage prime contractors to meet their goals for subcontracting with socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. 
   Specifically, the amendment would commission the SBA to study different  types of financial incentives that could help or encourage prime contractors to meet their goals set forth in their subcontracting claims for the utilization of small business companies owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. 
   Ironically, you heard earlier this evening about the problem of prime contractors failing to utilize small minority and economically disadvantaged businesses. Given the constitutional constraints that we as legislators have in legislating mandates for achieving these goals for minority and disadvantaged businesses, I believe that we must come up with creative and viable alternatives that can help encourage greater participation in the Federal contracting process by these businesses. 
   One such method to encourage greater participation by small minority and economically disadvantaged businesses would be to devise a means of rewarding prime contractors who meet their small business contracting goals rather than penalizing them. This is similar to the incentives placed in contracts for meeting deadlines and staying within budget. 
   My amendment would simply require that SBA study and report to Congress about different types of financial incentives that could be implemented that would encourage prime contractors to meet their goals for increasing opportunity for socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. This would allow us to encourage DB participation rather than attempting to penalize contractors who fail to meet their goals. This is an approach that offers more carrot and less stick. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlelady, the chairwoman of the committee. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We are prepared to accept this amendment. Many times the proposed solution to a problem, particularly in the Federal procurement environment, is the assessment of penalties. Sometimes this works. Sometimes it doesn't. I have found that when it works best, it is also accompanied by incentives for good performance. 
   The gentleman from Maryland begins this process. It is a worthy endeavor, and I am pleased to support the gentleman's amendment. I want to thank him for the work that he is doing on this legislation, and I urge adoption of the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. WYNN. (FAILED POLICY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYNN. Good evening, Madam Speaker. To varying degrees, Americans realize that it's time to end this war. You hear frustration; you see almost rabid anger. Americans understand we have a failed policy in Iraq. It's not working. 3,600 American troops have been killed; 2,700 U.S. troops have been wounded; 50,000 Iraqis have been killed. This administration is pursuing a failed foreign and military policy. 
   Now, let me be quick to note: This doesn't mean that our military has failed. Our military has in fact performed very admirably. They have done so despite the inept management of this administration, which has failed to provide them with the adequate armor that they need. Yet our military has fought on. But, again, it is the wrong policy. 
   First of all, we need to redefine our notions of winning and losing. This is the wrong war, it is in the wrong place, and it is being, as I indicated earlier, handled in the wrong way. 
   A lot of people are afraid to pull our troops out because they will say we will have lost. No, we will not have lost. We will have been pursuing the wrong policy. It is almost like the British redcoats facing the U.S. revolutionaries in the American Revolutionary  War. They were fighting in the wrong way. We are doing the same thing. We have to face the facts. 
   Supporters of the war are also saying look, we can't get out because the result will be a catastrophe. Note to the administration: It is already a catastrophe. What we need to do is change direction, with the hope that we can actually fight a war on terrorism and save American lives. 
   We can't continue to try to mediate Iraq's civil war. It is time to redeploy our troops, to bring them back home. We have in fact a civil war in Iraq. Both sides dislike our military presence. Iraqi insurgents are willing to kill themselves and become martyrs for their cause. We don't really understand this phenomenon. How can you beat an enemy that is willing to kill himself before you do? It doesn't work. 
   This is not a war in which killing more insurgents will result in ``victory.'' In fact, the National Intelligence Estimates indicate that our presence in Iraq is counterproductive. Iraq has more insurgents now, more militants, more terrorists, more jihadists, if you will, today than they did when we deposed Saddam Hussein. Iraq has become a haven for terrorists, and our military engagement is not reducing the number of insurgents. They are increasing. 
   Our continued presence in Iraq, more than 4 years, leads many Iraqis to the perception that what we really want to do is control their oil resources. This perception undermines any attempt to promote freedom and democracy. They think we just want the oil. 
   We have done one good thing through this Congress. We passed a resolution in this House that says we will have no permanent bases. That is the type of message we need to be sending, that we are not there to control your country. But what should we do in the overall battle against terrorism and in Iraq? 
   First of all, how about some diplomacy? Why is diplomacy always last? From Korea to Iran, here is what we do. We call them names first, and then we, finally, years later, say, well, maybe we ought to talk. Let's try talking first. 
   It is time this administration took diplomatic engagement to a higher level around the world. We need to take it seriously. We need to abandon this go-it-alone policy. 
   How about supporting Muslim efforts to promote peace? I think there are countries in the region, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, who have a vested interest in promoting peace. Let's give them a chance to promote peace. They have the greatest stake in having a peaceful region. There are also international religious leaders who could perhaps mediate a peace. What we do know is that the United States lacks the credibility to promote peace or mediate peace in this region. 
   Let's turn to the U.N. Why don't we ask the U.N. to promote a peace process in Iraq while we pull our troops out? We need a permanent United Nations emergency peace force. I have introduced such a bill. A permanent U.N. entity that would work in these areas of conflict, both in Iraq, in the Middle East, in Africa, the Sudan, Chad, and on and on. We can use the UN as a vehicle to promote peace and save the lives of American men and women who are in the Army and in our military. 
   Also we need to introduce the concept of humanitarian aid. Now, we do some, it is true, but how about leading with diplomacy and humanitarian aid? Put a new face on America's foreign policy. More humanitarian aid, building schools and building hospitals, says to the world that Americans really want to be your friend, as opposed to troops beating down your door, going door-to-door. 
   We also need to keep in mind, although we withdraw our troops, we have not abandoned Iraq. We need to continue to support reconstruction aid. But let me be quick to add, we need reconstruction aid with a lot more congressional oversight. This idea that Halliburton and other companies are just making billions and billions in profits and we don't see anything coming up from the ground in Iraq is unsatisfactory. We need humanitarian aid, we need reconstruction aid, we need congressional oversight to go with it. 
   In conclusion, we really need to spend our money more wisely to fight the real threat that we have. We know the threat is not in Iraq, the threat is in Afghanistan. What should we do? 
   First of all, we need greater emphasis on intelligence, to break up these small cells. The attacks we have seen in Britain and elsewhere are done by small cells. We need to interrupt weapons transfers, because that is what is causing the problem. We also need to interrupt these terrorist camps. We need to use our Special Forces intelligently to fight the real war that we have. 
   Bring our troops home, initiate diplomacy, humanitarian aid, reconstructive aid. We need a sound foreign policy. We don't have it with this administration. But with this Congress continuing to press the fight, we are going to have it.
