   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come down once again with my good friend from western PA, just over the border, Mr. Altmire from Pennsylvania, to just kind of clear up the record here a little bit and talk a little bit about what we have been doing here over the past year-and-a-half in Congress, to talk a little bit about the hole our country is in and how it has led to a lot of the stress that most American families are feeling now, most small businesses are feeling now. 
   But I'm going to take some liberties here, Mr. Speaker, and congratulate my brother and my sister-in-law. A few days ago, Andrea Maria was born to my brother and sister-in-law, and now my godchild, Nicolas, and the second-in-command, Dominick, now have a little baby sister. So I wanted to congratulate my mom and Joe and Shari Burkey, the grandparents, and my brother and sister-in-law for having another one, three for three. So, if the gentleman has a few kids of his own, he knows they're not getting much sleep, but the baby is healthy. 
   Also, I want to talk about, I think with that in mind, is what kind of legacy we're leaving to this next generation of Americans. And our friends today who spoke before us and spoke on the floor a little bit earlier today, you know, were talking about the importance of getting oil into the market and how if we would get oil into the market that it would reduce the cost of a gallon of gas. 
   And what the Democratic leadership has done--and just today we voted on taking 70 million barrels of oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is what we have as a country, 700 million barrels of oil, just in case, if there's some kind of catastrophe, if there's some kind of crisis, that we can go to this oil and use it for whatever purposes we deem necessary. 
   So, a few months ago, as we put oil into this reserve every day and every month, we said, as Democrats, that starting I think on June 30 that this oil would not go into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve every day; instead, we would divert it out of the reserve and into the market. And analysts were telling us that that would have some short-term effect in bringing the cost down. 
   We have seen the cost of a gallon of gas go down in the past few days, not significantly enough, but we feel like that strategic move that we made is having some effect. 
   So, today, we wanted to take that to the next step and say that we're going to take 10 percent of this reserve, 70 million barrels of oil, and pump it right into the market, and it would affect all the speculation that's going on through the Enron loophole, and it would inject oil into the market. 
   And today, we had a vote. And a lot of our friends, who were down on this floor, Mr. Speaker, just minutes and hours ago and have been railing on how we need to get oil into the market, voted against this oil going directly into the market. And you can't have it both ways, Mr. Speaker. You can't say you want more supply of oil into the market, and then when we bring up a bill and just cause the Democrats bring the bill up and say take 70 million barrels of oil and put it into the market to  drive down costs immediately, our friends all voted against it. You can't have it both ways. Either you want oil into the market, you want more supply, or you don't. And just because the Democrats say use the reserve and put it in to stop the speculation and drive the price down, our friends voted against it. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And that's the thing. We get a card, you've got a vote, the board lights up, your name's up there, you either hit the green button for ``yes'' and the red button for ``no.'' And the same people that said, you know, we've got to get oil, we've got to put it on the market, voted against it. And as you said 157 Republicans. 
   Now, we're big on third party validators here with our 30 Something because we know you may not necessarily believe everything that we are saying so we make sure that we back some of this up. 
   Now, here is the statistics, and I will share also some quotes. This is what's happened in the past when we've taken out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this oil that's just sitting there and we've put it into the market. 
   In 1991, this was done by the first President Bush, and prices went down by 33 percent. In 2000, it was done again, 18.7 percent prices went down, and it was done in 2005, which is 9 percent. So any of these examples in which we took directly out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and put it into the market has driven costs down and in 1991 to the tune of 33 percent, but even if it was 10 percent, you're talking about immediately knocking 40 cents a gallon off of a gallon of gas. 
   And that's what we tried to pass today, and 157 Republicans prevented that from happening. That's the bottom line. And so you can't say one thing and then do the other. 
   So you know Mr. Altmire is saying this. I'm saying this. Speaker Pelosi is saying this. But that's not it. We're not the only ones saying it. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich says, First thing is dump about half the Strategic Petroleum Reserve into the world market. You can pump about 2 million barrels a day. The marginal effect of that will bring down the price of oil very substantially.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Right. So we had an opportunity today to do this, and the Republicans have prevented it. You can surmise why maybe they wanted to do that, but we have experts who we try to listen to when it's coming to these major economic decisions that are going to reduce the price at the pump, and we had the opportunity to do that today and it was prevented. So it wasn't just Speaker Gingrich.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Absolutely. So just a few days ago, our good friend from Tennessee, Representative  Wamp--who I sit on the Energy and Water Subcommittee of Appropriations with--Rodney Alexander, a Republican from Louisiana, Johnny Isakson, Republican from Georgia, there are some Republicans who are saying, ``put this into the market,'' but not enough to actually have the kind of impact to actually get this done, not as many as we need. 
   And when you look at the American Trucking Association, when you look at the National Farmers Union, when you look at the Air Transportation Association, all of these groups wanted us to do this today. We did it, and it was prevented from happening: 70 million barrels of oil going into the market today. 
   But part of it--and I know the gentleman wants to talk a little bit about this as well--is what is happening with the dollar and how the dollar has been, because of its weakness at this point, the dollar has increased the cost of a lot of these commodities. 
   And I'd like to yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, let's think about it. When the second President Bush got in in 2000, two oilmen in the White House, and Vice President Cheney has this secret meeting--that nobody was allowed to know about--to begin to implement the energy policy of this administration, Republican House, Republican Senate, Republican White House, and here we go, here comes the energy policy. 
   Now, an energy policy that we agree on today doesn't necessarily have an effect today. Moving barrels out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a unique example of something having an immediate effect. But with energy policies, today's decisions have an effect years later. And so in 2000, when the Bush administration came, Mr. Speaker, and implemented this policy, headed up by the Vice President, we are now feeling the effects of it. 
   There was no massive move towards alternative energy. There was no expansion of nuclear. There was no expansion of biodiesel. There was no significant investment into alternative energies so that we can become independent. And when you look at the fact that we import--nearly 70 percent of the oil that we use in this country is imported from other sources, completely dependent on the Middle East and other countries in South America. 
   So they have implemented their energy policy, and today we have $4 a gallon gas. And the comments saying somehow that it's not their fault, it's not their responsibility, when their policies have been implemented, is ridiculous.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And if you think about what, in my estimation, great leaders would have done after 9/11, and you think about what the Lincolns and the Roosevelts and the Kennedys would have done in that particular situation, we had so much political clout in the world after 9/11. President Bush's approval ratings were off the charts. He failed to seize that opportunity to call up the oil companies, sit them down in the Cabinet room and say, boys, the party's over. We're all getting together, it's going to be a public/private partnership, and we're going in the alternative energy realm together as a country, public and private. He didn't do that. He asked everyone to go shopping; that was the big, creative challenge to the country. And that was a missed opportunity that few Presidents ever get, and he got it.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And when you think about that, and we had T. Boone Pickens in our caucus this week, he was on the Hill talking to both Democrats and Republicans--many people may have seen his commercials about his plan for transferring energy from being oil-based into some of these alternative energy fields, including wind, primarily, for him--but here's a geologist from Oklahoma University who is worth $4 billion in the oil industry, kind of understands what's going on, telling us ``You can't drill your way out of this.'' 
   But his main point was, not only that we're importing 70 percent of our oil, but there's a $700 billion transfer of wealth from the United States into these other countries. And what we're saying is that $700 billion, that should be put to work here in the United States of America building windmills, building nuclear facilities, moving forward with a lot of these other alternative energy sources that are clean and renewable. 
   And you add to that what we're spending on the war in Iraq, $10 to $12 billion a month in Iraq. This is going to be a trillion dollar war, at the end of the day it's going to cost us $3 trillion when you factor in the cost of dealing with a lot of the veterans who have come back, who we have an obligation to take care of in order to honor their service. If that money was spent focusing on investments in alternative energy here in the United States 7 years ago, we would be so far down the path. We would have a green country. We would have green energy. We would have control of the lithium batteries that are being made. You would have plug-in cars. This all could have happened in the last 5 or 6 years. 
   And so we need to get out of this mentality that somehow we're stuck. And I think for public officials to tell us that somehow, when you only have 4 percent of the world's oil reserves, you can somehow drill your way out of this problem is misleading. And Boone Pickens said that, ``They mislead the public.'' This is what he said the other day when he was here, July 23, ``They mislead the public.'' The public thinks we can go and drill and they mislead it, and that we're going to get $2 a gallon in gas. 
   Let's have an honest conversation about how we can prevent us from getting into the same situation a decade from now, where you and I--maybe here, maybe not here--that we're not having the same conversation. 
   And we have an opportunity to do that now. Speaker Pelosi, we've put hundreds of millions of dollars into research and development for these alternative energy sources, and some are starting to come online. But this should have been done 30 years ago, but especially 7 years ago.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And when you look at--and you mentioned it earlier--when you look at a lot of the situations that we have to deal with, that hopefully we can fix in time that my nieces and nephews don't have to deal with, but the debt, just in the last few years, $3 trillion increase in the debt ceiling here to $10 trillion. So we're borrowing this money because of the irresponsible tax cuts that the Bush administration passed when they got in, giving tax cuts primarily to the wealthiest people in the country who are making billions of dollars a year, benefiting from the system we have, and increasing the pressure with health care and energy costs on the middle class at the same time. And so these increases and the money that we're borrowing is coming from China, is coming from Japan, is coming from OPEC countries. 
   So when you think about the situation we're in now and you're paying $4 at the pump because the Bush energy plan, the Bush/Cheney energy plan has been implemented, you're paying $4 at the pump, and then you realize that your country is borrowing money for the war and the debt and the tax cuts that are going primarily to the top 1 percent, and that money that you're borrowing is coming from China and oil-producing countries--so they're loaning you the money, and they're getting interest, you're paying them interest on it just like you would do to the bank--and the oil-producing countries are producing moringe oil and shipping more over here, so we have a $700 billion transfer of payments over to these oil producing countries. When you think about borrowing money from China, paying them interest on the money, and they take the interest that they make off the money you're borrowing and they invest that into basically state-run operations over there, whether it's steel, or any other kind of manufacturer that they lure over with the money that they get from the Americans to build industrial parks, to build roads and bridges so that companies will move over there, to build Navy ships so that they can have a strong fleet in the Pacific, we're funding all this because of the irresponsible practices.     
   So we're trying to dig ourselves out of this hole, and we're still getting resistance. Even to the tune of trying to put 70 million barrels of oil on the market, we have trouble getting that passed because our Republican friends, Mr. Speaker, continue to prevent us from doing that. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And from my perspective, I certainly don't want to put the philosophy that got us into the problem that we are in and reaffirm it and continue to go down that road. We only have 4 percent of the world's oil reserves. What don't you get about that picture, Mr. Speaker?

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And we use 25 percent. So we only have 4 percent and we use 25 percent, and we're shipping $700 billion a year to those countries that are sending their oil over here, and we can't drill enough. Even if we open everything up, we still can't get enough oil to solve the problem. It is simple math and it's disingenuous, Mr. Speaker, to somehow mislead the American public, in the words of T. Boone Pickens, who is an oilman from Texas who is saying the same thing. It is misleading to say that we can drill our way out of this. 
   There are 68 million acres that the oil companies now have, up to 90 million. They've done the research as to where they wanted to purchase the lease. They think there is oil there. They know there's oil there. Go and drill it and stop the political games of trying to say that somehow some of the American people are against it. Go ahead and drill. But that is not going to solve the problem. 
   And I know in your district and I know the people that vote for me in my district want me to come down here to solve problems, not to mislead them and score political points. 
   When I am eating at Vernon's Restaurant about two blocks from me, the best Italian restaurant on the planet, Mr. Speaker, people want to know exactly what we are going to do to solve the problem. And if you explain to them that we don't have enough oil reserves to keep this train going, they're smart enough to realize that they know how the movie ends, and it's not pretty because now we're 10 years from where we are today, gas is at $8 a gallon, and we are more dependent on oil from the Middle East, and we have done nothing with wind and nuclear and biodiesel; so we are in a worse spot than we are today. 
   Now, I would love to go to my friends who are at Vernon's Restaurant and say, ``If we just keep drilling, we're going to be okay.'' But that's not the reality. Those aren't the facts. And the facts have got to dictate what public policy is or we are not doing our job for the American people.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I agree. But it's important for us to realize too that we are moving on the energy issues. We are trying to fix it, short term and long term. Short term by releasing the barrels of oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, have a short-term impact, reduce the cost; and then long term, invest in these alternative energy sources with different kinds of cars and incentives and tax credits for renewables and all of these different policies that will help stimulate a lot of the renewable energy fields long term. 
   We are also trying to do other things along public policy areas that will have an effect for families who are getting hurt today and getting squeezed because of energy and because of health care and because of tuition. 
   One of the things I would like to talk about that we have been doing, families want their kids to have a better life than they had, and they want their kids to move further on in life than they have. And the key in 2008 for that is an education. And what has happened just a week or so ago, one of the policies that we have implemented is reducing the cost of student loans. The cost of a student loan used to be 6.8 percent, or the interest rate on a student loan used to be about 6.8 percent last year. As of just a few days ago, this went down to 6 percent. And this is going to continue to go down over the course of the next few years to about 3.4 percent for a student loan because when we got in, when the Democrats got in, and Speaker Pelosi has a major priority and a major emphasis on education, this is where we put our resources. This is where we made the investment. 
   So for my friends, Mr. Speaker, who don't seem to think there is a difference between the two parties, when you go to get a student loan and its .8 percent less this year than it was last year, that's because the Democrats are in and it was a priority for us to reduce the interest rate on a student loan. And when you go next year and it's even lower and when you go the following year and I think by 2010 it's down to 3.4 percent, the average student loan is going to be reduced by about $4,400. So when you take the $4,400, you take the increase in the  minimum wage, you look at all of these different little policies that we have, they add up to where families and kids can have a better, more prosperous future than their parents had. But those are the kinds of investments that we're making. And just today the minimum wage went up again because of what the Democrats have done. 
   There's a clear focus and a clear philosophy of what we are trying to implement here, and that's for middle class families to have success and for them to move forward and have their kids have more opportunity than they had. Whether it's energy or health care or education, that's where we are moving towards to make sure that we can advance that cause.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And that's the best thing from our vantage point: Prove to the American people as to what your beliefs are and how it's going to affect their lives. And if you have a couple of jobs and you're making the minimum wage, you got a pay raise twice already in the last year, just over the last year. If you're going to school, there is more grant money available for you to go get an education. There is a lower interest rate on the loan that you're going to take out or your parents may take out to send you to school.     
   Those are significant investments that Democrats have made into the future of our country so that middle-class people can be successful and take advantage of these tools. We can't do it for anybody. But these are tools that average families will use and implement to move forward. 
   Two of the things that we can't forget, we have also passed the GI Bill out of the House which will say that if you served this country in Iraq or Afghanistan over the past 3 or 4 years that you will have all expenses paid to go to college. In Ohio, there is a policy now that the Governor has implemented that you can come to Ohio, any veteran around the country, can come to Ohio and have in-State tuition rates if you're a veteran. 
   And look at what we've done for veterans' health care. The largest investment in the 77-year history of the VA was made by the Democratic Congress when we got in here. A lot of us weren't for the war. And I will be the first to say I wasn't for it. But what we all are for is honoring the service of the veterans who go over there and make the great sacrifice and the sacrifices that their family makes. So we have made that investment into the VA program so that the vets have the benefits that they need. And we're honoring their service by making that investment. 
   And if you look to the previous 7 years or 6 years, what the President made, Mr. Speaker, and what the Republican Congress made, it was $14 billion in corporate welfare to the oil companies. It was tax cuts to people who make millions and millions of dollars a year. It was an energy policy that got us $4 a gallon gas. It was a health care policy that gets 15 or 20 percent increase on your health care. A dramatic difference. And I'm proud to stand up here and talk a little bit about what we've done and what we're going to continue to do, because I feel like we're just getting started. And we have an election coming up now in November. And I think there is an opportunity for us to really move forward. 
   So, I'm honored again to be with the gentleman from Pennsylvania. And Mr. Speaker, we're going to wrap up. Again, congratulations to my brother and sister-in-law, they're grandparents to Andrea. And we will yield back the balance of our time.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate it, Mr. Meek. And I was watching you earlier talk about this, and I appreciate your concern and your passion on the issue. And I just can't help but thank Mr. Murtha and the Speaker for taking such quick action on this. 
   This is the kind of thing that unfortunately has been going on for a long time, not only in this particular institution due to a lack of oversight, but also this is what has been going on in Iraq. The stories that we hear coming out of some of the oversight committees are absolutely atrocious to hear about the waste of money and some of the situations on the ground in Iraq. 
   Then to hear the story about Walter Reed, it just seems to consistently be a lack of owning up to what the current situation is on the ground or in the hospitals or wherever the case may be. And that is why you have to have an open process. That is why you have got to have hearings. And if we would have maybe over the past couple of years had more oversight hearings on these situations, maybe we wouldn't be in the situation that we are in today. 
   I want to share with you, Mr. Meek, and I apologize because I have to leave in a couple minutes but I wanted to come by and support you and add my two cents here, today in the Washington Post regarding the complaints at Walter Reed, and this is what is really damning here as far as the issue goes, on the front page of the Washington Post: 
   ``Top officials at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, including the Army's Surgeon General, have heard complaints about outpatient neglect from family members, veterans groups, and Members of Congress for more than 3 years. 
   ``A procession of Pentagon and Walter Reed officials expressed surprise last week about the living conditions and bureaucratic nightmares faced by wounded soldiers staying at the D.C. medical facility. But as far back as 2003, the commander of Walter Reed, General Kiley, was told that soldiers who were wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan were languishing and lost on the grounds, according to interviews. 
   ``But according to interviews, Kiley, his successive commanders at Walter Reed, and various top noncommissioned officers in charge of soldiers' lives have heard a stream of complaints about outpatient treatment over the past several years. The complaints have surfaced at town hall meetings for staff and soldiers, at commanders' sensing sessions in which soldiers or officers are encouraged to speak freely, and in several Inspector General's reports detailing building conditions, safety issues, and other matters.'' 
   That is what hurts, Mr. Meek, is the fact that people knew about this. And  one of the most prestigious obligations that we have as Members of the United States Congress, as Members of the House of Representatives, being the most closely, directly elected officials for the people of this country to represent them in their Federal Government is that we have oversight responsibilities. And to neglect those duties, as the 109th Congress did, on Iraq, on contracting, on intelligence, on all of these things, blistering accounts that we are learning about, this is what hurts, that these kinds of situations could have been prevented, and if not prevented, immediately fixed. 
   And when you think about this, just ask, just ask us, is this Congress, whether Republican led or Democratically led, going to say ``no'' to our soldiers? That is not going to happen. But the fact that this administration refuses, talk about a culture which we talked about in the 109th Congress, a culture and a complete culture of an unwillingness to accept the fact that things can go wrong. We are all human beings. Things go wrong; mistakes are made. The key is to fix them. The key is to not make the same mistakes twice, or in this case, many, many, many times over. And the fact that a few soldiers had to go through this is a shame. But when the problem isn't fixed, when the problem continues and we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of soldiers go through this same situation, Mr. Meek, when it could have been fixed I think is a tragedy. 
   So I want to commend you for bringing this up and sharing this with the House of Representatives and the American people. And I want to commend you for your service on the Armed Services Committee in these difficult times and a lot of the tough decisions that you have to make on that committee. 
   So I yield back to my friend, and I apologize for having to cut out on you early; but you are doing all right on your own.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be on the floor of the House of Representatives here in the United States of America to talk about issues that are pressing, representing the 30-Something Working Group. I will be joined shortly by my friend, Congressman Meek of Florida, who will join us through this discussion. 
   I want to talk about a couple of issues that are pertinent to what has been going on in our country. I think the most pressing issue that we've been dealing with in this Congress and that, I think, most of our constituents are dealing with every single day is what is going on with our energy policy here in the United States of America. 
   We have heard, as Democrats have come into office with Speaker Pelosi's leading this House of Representatives, is that one of the key issues that we're trying to deal with is to make sure that our country is energy-independent and to reduce our dependency not only on oil but especially on foreign oil and to move off of oil in general, into renewable energy, into biodiesel, into solar, into wind, into nuclear, into a lot of these other areas that will allow us to be energy-independent, that will provide for renewable energy and that will provide a stable supply of energy here in the United States. 
   One of the issues that keeps coming up is: Why don't we keep drilling? Why don't we drill in ANWR? That will solve our problem. I'm sure, in the next special order, the folks who are paying attention to this debate will get the other side of this. But from our perspective and from what the analysts are telling us, if you begin drilling in ANWR and if you start the process today, it will be 10 years from now before you get one drop of oil out of ANWR. If you continue, in 10 years, you will get 40,000 barrels of oil a day in a market that has 80 million barrels of oil. In 20 years, you will get yourself up to about 800,000 barrels of oil a day, and you will reduce the cost of a gallon of gas by 1.8 cents per gallon. Now, that is 20 years from now. So, if we start today, in 20 years, we will have a savings of 1.8 cents per gallon of gas. From our perspective, that is not a long-term strategy. 
   One of the reasons that it is not a long-term strategy is that we have now currently 68 million acres of land on the continental shelf, onshore, that is eligible to be drilled upon. There are 8,000 leases for drilling on these acres of land, 8,000. Of these 8,000 leases, there are only about a quarter of them that are actually being used or that are being pursued. 
   What we are saying is, if you have 68 million acres of land and if you have 8,000 leases already to drill on those acres of land, why do we need to go somewhere else up in ANWR--up in Alaska--when we're not even drilling in the areas that we have now in which the oil companies have permission to go and drill? That is the question. 
   So we have this available to us now, and if we got into the 68 million acres of land, that would produce 4.8 million barrels a day.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Reclaiming my time. 
   I have a great deal of respect for my friend from Indiana. I wanted to give him an opportunity to speak his peace. 
   It's not up to us, and that is the point I was going to make. This is already available. It's the oil companies that are not pursuing this. They have the leases. They have the space. They have the okay, but they're the ones that aren't doing the drilling, and that's the point. 
   One of the reasons is that there is a difference between the certifications. When you have to mine for coal and you get one of these permits and you get the ability to lease, there's a 20-year lease for coal companies, but you have to show that you're diligently developing your mining with coal. Under oil and gas, it's only a 10-year lease that is renewable, but you don't have to show that you're diligently developing the leases and that you're diligently developing the mining in trying to get the oil and the gas out. 
   So the oil companies have the leases--they have the ability to do it--but the law does not require them to show a diligent developing of a particular resource. That is the problem. So they're holding the leases and are, in our minds, driving up the cost. Now, I think there are some other things going on, too, with commodity markets and whatnot, but this is the gist. 
   There is a bill that is coming out of Mr. Rahall's office from the Natural Resources Committee, the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act of 2008. I will be happy to share with my colleague and have my staff get to your staff the proper information here because there is no reason why they're not developing it, and that's the problem that we have here. 
   So look at what is going on in the commodities market. We have passed a bill out of this House of Representatives to try to address that problem. If we soon pass Mr. Rahall's bill that will deal with the lease issue and the oil companies' being able to hold onto these leases, I think then we can force these folks to either get rid of the leases and get them in the hands of somebody who will actually do the drilling or they will have to drill it themselves, but you have to show diligence in developing that particular resource that you're going after. 
   So that's really the main issue here, and I appreciate the opportunity to bring that up and to further expound on that point because it puts the ball right back in the court of the oil companies'. 
   So, on all of these prongs, whether it's futures or whether it's the leases or whether it's the $14 billion in subsidies that the taxpayers have given the oil companies, on each of these issues, we're trying to change the policy, and we want to join with the Republicans to help us to do that because a lot of this oil and gas is available to be developed, to be explored, to be used here in the United States of America. 
   Not only that, there is a bill that we passed, I think, in 2005 that would allow a 50 percent tax credit to build refineries. That is one of the other points that has been made, which is of the refineries. Why aren't there more refineries? Refineries now are only working at 85 percent capacity.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I would be happy to yield. I'm going to yield to you because you're my friend, but I'm going to have to leave, so I'm not going to get a chance to rebut you guys, but go ahead, because Mr. Westmoreland and I are going to be on Fox later, so we'll be glad to take that up over there.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Reclaiming my time. 
   I'd like to chat with you about it. I think it would be important to have Mr. Rahall involved in that conversation.     
   Our argument on this side, and I think it is not a prima facie case here, these are the facts that have been explored. They have the leases, they have the land, there is nothing preventing them from doing it. You have a 50 percent tax cut on refineries. They still haven't done that. And we are giving them $14 billion to help develop this stuff. I mean, how much more do you need? And you are the most profitable industry in the country. 
   So it leaves folks like us to say, you know, you are obviously not doing things properly, because the price of oil is going up. 
   And I agree, obviously China and India are a major component of this. No one is saying it will be $20 a barrel if we implement this stuff. But if you talk about it, most people are saying anything between a 10 and 100 percent increase because of the commodity trading, which probably puts it somewhere in the middle at 40 percent, which would be 40 or 50 bucks a barrel. That alone would reduce it to about 90 bucks a barrel. 
   Now, drilling has increased by 66 percent since 2000, so there is more drilling going on to try to keep pace with that. But the prices have increased. Last Friday a barrel of oil increased more in one day than it cost 10 years ago. That is a significant increase, and you can't say there are some shenanigans going on here. 
   All we are asking is, I think if we pass something like the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Relief Act of 2008, if we say that you have to diligently develop those leases that you have, I think that would be a piece of this argument, to say you got the lease, you are not allowed to sit on it. Either develop it or give it to someone else. 
   No one here is saying we are going to be off oil tomorrow. What we are saying is we don't want to be in the same situation a decade from now or two decades from now because we opened up ANWR and saved 2 cents a gallon. That is not going to get us where we want to be. And the sooner we take the brain power here in the United States of America and put it to work to develop some of these alternative energies, the better off we are going to be.  
   So, 68 million acres, 4.8 million barrels a day, 44.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas, this is the direction we need to be going in. This is the direction that I think Americans want us to go in, Mr. Speaker. This is the direction that the Speaker and the Democrats want to lead this country in.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, regardless of how we develop it, I think this is what we have done. We put billions of dollars into research and development, and we will continue to put more into research and development, maybe even over the protests of some of the folks on your side of the aisle. 
   But you could talk about oil shale and you could talk about all of these the other issues. We have 68 million acres right now, there are 8,000 leases, and you folks keep talking, Mr. Speaker, the other side keeps talking about going up to ANWR, when we have 68 million acres already to be tapped, 8,000 leases ready to develop this. They are only using a quarter of them. Go ahead and drill. But why do we have to go up to ANWR, when we already have the ability to do it now? That is all we are saying. 
   So, yeah, we should use technology to figure out other ways to develop oil and the coal-to-liquid. As long as you are sequestering the CO  
   2, speaking on behalf of myself now, I don't have any problem with it. You have nuclear plants that are going on and permits and leases for moving that process forward.
   So this is going to be a comprehensive bill and a comprehensive approach to all this. But when you have the oil companies getting $14 billion, you have the commodities problem that you have, and you have them buying leases and holding them because they don't have to diligently develop, like they have to do for coal, you get skyrocketing gas costs, and that is what we are trying to fix here. 
   The oil companies have more incentives than they could ever possibly need. They have been getting $14 billion in basically corporate welfare. They get a 50 percent tax credit to develop a refinery, and they still haven't done that. So these issues are hanging around here, and we are trying to change it and the rhetoric from the other side is we got to go to ANWR, when we already have the ability to address these problems here. 
   So I think we have a comeprehensive approach on how to fix this problem. It is much different. And, again, to just say, you know, Mr. Speaker, it was the other side. They were in charge for 6 years, had the House, had the Senate, had the White House, and we are currently living under their energy policy and the Bush economy.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Reclaiming my time, you are exactly right. We could sit here, Mr. Speaker, and blame each other about whose fault it is. I say that as a point of clarification, because one is now you have solutions that you didn't implement while you were in, they didn't implement while they were in, Mr. Speaker. So I think that is an important point to make. 
   But the discussion here today is look at what the 
   Democrats have done. We are trying to repeal the $14 billion in corporate welfare. We are trying to crack down on the commodities futures trading. We are trying to make sure that oil companies can't just hold leases and not develop them, and not develop them and diligently pursue the natural resources that are there. That is what we are saying. The other side is saying, go to ANWR. Now, that is not a solution. 
   So the discussion that we are having here is that your side is saying, go to ANWR and drill, and we are saying there is 68 million acres, 8,000 leases, and they are only using a quarter of them. The oil companies are holding them. They could get 4.2 billion barrels a day, and they are not doing it. That only leaves one conclusion. 
   I guess we are kind of blaming each other. But if you put up drilling in ANWR or drill in what we have now and focus billions of dollars on an alternative energy policy and strip the $14 billion from the oil companies and make sure that if they get leases they got to use them and make sure that there is not all kinds of monkey business going on in the commodities market, that is our solution, which your side votes against. 
   We are going to have an election. You guys are going to say drill in ANWR, we are going to say alternative energy, and the people are going to decide. So we can blame each other all we want, but the people are going to hear our position, they are going to hear your position, and they are going to hear the presidential candidates' positions, and they are going to decide who they want to vote for. 
   I believe and our caucus believes that when we get the message out that there are already 68 million acres to be developed, there are 8,000 leases being held by the oil companies, that they are only using a quarter of them, that it will look like our friends on the other side are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the oil companies. And we are going to have a vote at some point on Mr. Rahall's bill that will allow and force the oil companies that if they have leases to use them, that you may fall on the one side of that and we may fall on the other, and then the people will have that vote to decide on. 
   I am getting a bit redundant, but we want to make sure our friends who are just kind of passing through the debate catch both sides. 
   The gentleman from Indiana, I know he is a busy man, but if you have time tonight, me and your partner in crime there will be on Fox TV, on Hannity & Colmes, to further this discussion, and I very much look forward to it. 
   I think my partner in crime, Mr. Meek, is not here, will not be here, and I will take your thank-you's later, because you had more of my special order than I had.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to be on the House floor. And I must say that free speech is a beautiful thing in the United States of America. Our friends on the other side can pretty much say anything they want in this wonderful Chamber in this country, with absolutely no ramifications or connection to the truth at all. And I want to just share with the American people and I want to share with other Members of Congress, Mr. Speaker, and my good friend here from Connecticut, some facts that have been absent over the last hour and really over the last couple of days. 
   I think it is important to just go back and piece the history together. Over the past 6 years there has been a Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a Republican White House. The gentlemen on the other side, fine men from fine families who have been speaking here, have completely forgotten about the last 6 years. They think that they ran up a high bar tab and that it can be fixed rather easily. The fact of the matter is they ran up, the Republican House, Republican Senate, Republican White House, $3 trillion in debt, $3 trillion over the last 6 years. 
   They just got out of office in January, and here it is June, and they're acting like this is ancient history. Three trillion dollars. They had the debt limit raised five or six times, which means they had to pass legislation out of here that would allow the Department of Treasury to borrow more money. And then 5 months after they're out of office, they come here, Mr. Speaker, and they talk like they've had nothing to do with this. 
   Now, we saw our friend from Texas earlier hold up the Blue Dog Coalition debt limit sign, over $8 trillion, almost to $9 trillion in debt and act like they had nothing to do with it. But the American people recognized in November and asked for a change in government, and they got it. 
   Let me clear up another fact that has been misrepresented here today and yesterday and over the past couple of weeks. This is their quote, ``The Democrats are somehow going to raise taxes. It is the largest tax increase in the history of the United States of America.'' Not accurate. Not true. I ask the American people, and as I speak and it is written into the Congressional  Record, we need to ask all Americans to keep their tax forms from this year and hold on to them and match them to next year's tax forms. There will be no increase in taxes from the Democrats. None. And take the statements that have been said here, take your tax forms. Don't believe me. Don't believe Mr. Murphy or Mr. Meek or any of our other 30-something friends who are going to come here, keep your own forms. 
   Now the bottom line is this; we know how to govern. Our friends on the other side have had their chance. They got the keys to the car in 2000 when President Bush won and they controlled all levers of government and failed miserably; $3 trillion in debt, a foreign policy that's a complete disaster, a FEMA organization agency that can't even respond to natural disasters in the United States of America. They can't even get the American citizens their passports. So save the lectures for somebody who wants to listen to them, because quite frankly, we don't, and the American people do not want to listen to them. That's the bottom line. When you can get the American people their passports on time, then come talk to us about worrying about environment and creating jobs and the economy and foreign policy. Enough is enough. 
   My friends, Mr. Speaker, on the other side are putting all of their trust in Mr. Bush, our President, because he says he's going to veto all our bills. Well, let's just look at what the Republican Congress did. President Bush, Mr. Speaker, said that he's going to veto all our bills if they come in one dollar above what his submission was to the Congress. Let's look at what happened in 2005.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, let's look at what happened here in the last couple of days. Right here, about 20 minutes ago, we heard two of our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, talk about a balanced budget amendment. They just ran up $3 trillion in debt, raised the debt limit five times, and it is like it never happened. Let's put on a balanced budget amendment, the constitutional amendment. 
   It is unbelievable.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the beautiful thing about this is that for how many years they talked about the protecting the homeland, about homeland security, that it make us safer fighting there so we don't have to fight here, all their rhetoric hasn't delivered. 
   So here we come, right? We come with an increase in funding so we can fund the ``loose nukes'' program, the Nunn-Lugar program, so we have more people out with more money buying more loose nuclear weapons that are getting spread around the world, we put hundreds of millions of dollars more into this program, which is going to keep us safe. 
   Mr. Speaker, last week, the mother of all rhetorical contortions, we are passing a Homeland Security bill here, or trying to pass, where 3,000 Border Patrol agents will be funded; technology for all our ports to monitor chemical and biological weapons coming in; grants for first responders, police, fire. We also passed 50,000 new cops for the country for communities who can't afford them, a lot like mine. And they held up the bill. They held up the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are trying to pass funding for 3,000 Border Patrol agents, and they are trying to hold up the bill. Now, who is for homeland security now? And on and on and on. 
   But what we have shown, and this is what I love about it, is that when these bills pass, those men and women who get hired to be Border Patrol agents will know it was the Democrats. When the minimum wage goes in this summer, they will know it was the Democrats. When you go to get a Pell grant, they will know it was the Democrats.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. They are not going to see a tax increase. Again, keep your tax forms from this year, compare them to what you fill out next year. There will be no tax increase. Period, dot, Mr. Speaker. When you wonder why the fiscal conservatives gave the Democrats a chance and why we are passing balanced budgets, why we passed a rule in the House called PAYGO which says if you spend money, you got to pay for it. You got to find a cut somewhere to cut it out. 
   Here is why they voted for us: This President and the Republican Congress, as we have stated ad nauseam on this floor, have borrowed more money from foreign interests in the last 6 years than any other President and Congress before them combined. Combined. From foreign interests. 
   Now, look here: Japan; China; UK; Caribbean; OPEC countries, $67 billion of our debt; Japan; China, $349 billion. 
   Now, we are trying to compete with China. And one of our friends was up here earlier today with an amendment. We have to compete against China. No kidding. Well, then why did you, he wasn't here, but why did his predecessors before him borrow over $600 billion from China, and then turn around and say, hey, aren't we competing with the bank we are borrowing from? How are we going to work this out?

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think it is important for us to say, we know that the government can't do everything. We know that we can't solve every problem. We have got some basic responsibilities though, defense and what not. 
   One of the things we are doing here when it comes to gas and oil in the bill that we were on the floor today with, the Energy appropriations bill, is to invest into alternative energy sources. It is very important for us to recognize and for the American people to recognize what we are doing with our budget, because we had a lot of amendments and ``cut this'' and ``cut that.'' 
   This bill passed out as a bipartisan bill on the House Energy and Water Subcommittee, led by Mr. Hobson from Ohio, who is a great ranking member and was a great chair of this committee. But, finally, over the hurdles 
   of many Republicans, over the hurdles of the President, we are now investing into renewable energy and energy efficiency procedures here $1.9 billion, a 50 percent increase in energy efficiency and renewable energy technology. An additional $300 million was added from the joint resolution 2007 resolution we passed. 
   We are investing in biofuels. Solar energy, hydropower, geothermal, new vehicle technology, new materials technology so we can have lighter vehicles that don't use as much fossil fuel, weatherization grants, carbon capture and sequestration, climate change science research.  
   You want to talk about moving the country forward? This bill funds 3,500 scientists.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Here we have a budget that actually funds scientists, funds research. There is a great report that has come out called Rising Above the Coming Storm, something along those lines, a beautiful panel of experts led by the former CEO of Lockheed Martin, probably not a Democrat, if I had to guess, but a very detailed report on what we need to do. 
   One of the key components was focus on basic research in the physical sciences. That is what this bill does. Our friend, when I mentioned this the other day, I said, this is a jobs bill. This is the next generation of people that are going to benefit from the research money. They are going to get into research. They are going to partner with businesses and spring out in more research and development and manufacturing and everything else. 
   He said, well, this is not a jobs bill. I take issue with what the Member from Ohio is saying. 
   Well, I am sorry. If we figured out a way to do research and create jobs from it and create new industries, isn't that a good thing? That we were able to get a real good bang for our buck in the investments that we have made? 
   I just think, Mr. Speaker, that illustrates the difference in philosophy. We have one party in this country who comes to the floor and says they can solve every complex issue with two words: Smaller government, lesser taxes, this and that. 
   We have a bill that doesn't raise taxes and we are able, because we peeled off $14 billion in corporate welfare that we were giving to the oil companies last year and we put it in alternative energy research, we were able to make that investment without raising taxes. Don't be mad at us. Don't be a hater.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I don't want to say it is fun, because there are a lot of people that are still struggling, but it is so much better now to go back to your district and people ask you, what are you doing about gas prices? And we have got a great budget, and it is not immediate. That is the painful thing that you have to realize. People are struggling and people who are driving from lab to lab, they somehow have to use a lot of transportation, it is hard. 
   But we have something here that we are passing from the House that is going to significantly over time reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and it is going to benefit the average American consumer. 
   So, let's look at this in the broad sense. Of all the promises, the Democrats made promises, they got in, we  gave them a shot. We are taking advantage of this shot. One, we didn't raise taxes, first of all. 
   But look at what we did. If you are the average person sitting out there, you now in July will have an increase in the minimum wage to over $7 an hour. So anyone who is associated with that will get an increase. Those people slightly above will also get an increase. Included in that was a tax cut for small businesses, so that those people who are bearing the brunt of this will benefit as well. 
   Then you are getting $700 more in your Pell Grant. So if you have got kids in school, you are going to get an extra $700 a year grant money. If you are in Ohio, Governor Strickland's budget, a former Democratic Member of Congress who is now Governor, passed a budget where there is a zero percent increase in tuition in Ohio next year, zero percent the following year, which traditionally has been almost a 9 percent increase over the past 5 or 6 years. 
   So if you are a student in Ohio, you are getting a 9 percent cut in your tuition from an increase that would have happened to zero, and you are getting an extra $700 Pell Grant. You are talking about an almost $2,000 tax cut for average families in Ohio if you go to school. 
   So you got the minimum wage, you got the Pell Grant, you have community health clinics, about $400 million increase between the supplemental and what we are doing in this year's bill. There will be hundreds of more health clinics around the country this year. People can get their healthcare. We are investing in research, 3,500 scientists will be funded through this bill in all of these different areas for alternative energy research. Increased funding in Head Start, Even Start, after school programs. This is a bill for the people.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. When you look at why are we doing this, because we are competing against 1.3 billion people in China. We are competing with 1.2 citizens in India. Not only do we have to do that, but we have to put the pedal to the metal and increase the speed of what we are doing here. This is just the beginning of what we need to do to be competitive, to make sure that we have enough engineers and scientists doing the kind of research that we are passing bills on now, starting to lay the groundwork for, so more kids can afford college. 
   And we have to ask all of the citizens of this country to step up to bat and really make sure that you are developing your skills and talents to the best of your ability because we can't do it for you. We are going to help with funding and after school. We are going to make sure that kids get the kind of support that they need, but we need Americans to step up to bat and develop the kids so we can compete. 
   We only have 300 million people in the country. We are competing against 1.3 billion in China and 1.2 billion in India. We need everybody to develop to their fullest extent. 
   One final point, we are creating through these bills new industries that will pay dividends for our country. The alternative energy is one. With all of the funding in research, it is going to create things and scientists are going to develop things and partner with the private sector. Ten years from now, we can't even imagine what will come with this investment just this year. 
   In committee we had testimony that there was a blip in energy research, an increase in the late seventies when President Carter was here, and then it went right back down. In those 2 years, solar panels were developed. In those 2 years of that increase in funding. 
   Give these bright people the resources they need. And also, we have been able to move stem cell research which the President has vetoed. We can't even imagine the health care advances that will come from that research. 
   So we are creating new areas for young people to grow into and to create jobs for American people.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It is going to be interesting to watch the contortions with our friends on the other side of the aisle, you can see their strategy is to blame the $3 trillion that they ran up somehow on us when we weren't in charge of anything, and then they are going to start taking credit for things like the earmark transparency that we, we are in charge here, so if it passes, we have done it. What we have done they are going to try to take credit for. 
   But it will be so much nicer, I think, next year when all of this is passed and the American people recognize it is the Democrats that has done this. And if the President vetoes it, let's go out and campaign, take that one to the American people and let the President defend not hiring 3,500 scientists in DOE to do alternative energy research. Let him say he is going to veto the Pell Grants. It will be easier because we won't have to come to the floor as much, occasionally just to remind the American people what we are doing instead of trying to push what we are doing now. I think that will be a good time for us. 
   So we are happy that we do get some support. As I stated earlier, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson) has been a tremendous advocate for putting this budget together through the Energy Department, but the extremists in their party which have been governing their party for the last 6 years, are still coming kicking and screaming into the high-tech research and development economy that we are in now, and somehow think if they cut taxes for a millionaire and that millionaire invests that money in a plant in China, that somehow is benefiting average Americans. Wages have been stagnant for 30 years. So we are trying to create new economies, new sectors of the economy that will grow and provide opportunity for most people. 
   I just saw a poll yesterday, 7 in 10 Americans think the economy is getting worse for them. That is obviously not shared prosperity, and our friends come to the floor and say the stock market is doing great. Well, that is great if you have stocks. And even if you do, I don't know if it makes up for the stagnant wages and the 20 percent increase in health care costs.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Let's reassure those soldiers and their families who are serving that this will not be another Vietnam when these kids come home. I think we've already seen that. In the VA budget, $1.7 billion above the President's request for medical services. We have major construction, $3.6 billion, $193 million over the President's request. For medical administration, these vets have been backlogged for years, mental health and substance abuse, increase $100 million over the 07 request. Assistance for homeless vets, health care sharing incentive fund. A lot of money that's going to take care of them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Let's just remember that we're doing all this without raising taxes. Check your form this year, compare it to next year, there  will be no tax increase. We're reducing the budget. We balance it in 5 years, unlike what has happened over the past 6 years with a Republican House, a Republican Senate and a Republican White House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's important to remind the American people of this, that they borrowed billions and billions, $644 billion from Japan, $349 billion from China, $100 billion in 06 from OPEC countries in order to begin the largest debt, $3 trillion. Our friends on the other side have raised the debt limit while they were in charge five times so they can borrow more money from Japan and China and put our national security at risk here and, quite frankly, not account for the budget in the United States like they should. 
   It was an honor to be here with our friend from Florida.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I also rise in opposition. I have been listening to this debate over the past couple of days. It seems like the past couple of years. It has been a lengthy debate. 
   Our friends on the other side, Mr. Chairman, after running up over $3 trillion in debt, are now going to lecture us about how we should be thrifty. You had 6 years to try to close the annual deficits, and your budget you are submitting again this year will be over $200 billion in deficit. 
   Now, we are not here to be lectured to. Three trillion dollars. And the Republican House, the Republican Senate and the Republican White House in the past 6 years borrowed more money from foreign interests than all of the previous Presidents and Congresses combined. 
   So, my colleague from Ohio, Mr. Jordan, who was up here earlier talking about now we have got to try to compete with China, well, it is very tough to compete with them when the Republican Party, Mr. Chairman, borrows money from them hand over fist like drunken sailors over the past 6 years. 
   Now we are here to clean up the mess, and our budget that we pass will balance it. What your amendment is going to do is it is going to take away from research that is going to help grow the economy. You are going to cut biomass research. You are going to cut geothermal research. You are going to cut hydro research, where your own party was just up here saying what a great thing it is. You are going to cut solar research. You are going to cut wind research. You are going to cut concentrating solar power research. Solar heating and lighting research will be cut under this. Solar PV ratings will be cut under this. Hybrid electric system. We are getting testimonials from all our constituents in our districts about how they want lower gas prices. You do that by reducing your dependence on foreign oil and investing in alternative energy. That is what we are doing in this bill, and your amendment will cut that. 
   Advanced combustion engine research will be cut in this, materials technology research will be cut in this, fuels technology will be cut in this, technology integration will be cut under this amendment. 
   This is a responsible bill that was voted by both Republicans and Democrats out of the Energy and Water Committee. It makes great investments. It turns the page on the past of not balancing your budgets, not making the investments, Mr. Chairman, and I commend you and Mr. Hobson for putting a great bill together and stand to ask our Members to reject this amendment.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I just want to clarify something. In 2008, there will not be a tax increase. And no one has to believe me, Mr. Chairman. No one has to believe our friends on the other side. What the American people need to do is keep their tax forms from this year and compare them to their tax forms from next year. There will be zero increase in taxes. 
   This is a balanced budget, which the other side has not done, and it makes strategic investments so that we can create alternative energy resources here so we reduce our dependence on foreign oil.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I would like to clarify. The other side is trying to say that if there are tax increases in the future, it all has to do with this bill which we just increased by a few hundred million. It has nothing to do with the $3 trillion debt that was run up in the last 6 years, Mr. Chairman. The 2007 tax returns versus next year's, the American people need to look at them, no increase. Our friends are saying ``the largest tax increase in the history of the United States'' and it happens 2 years from now. I thought history was in the past. For 2008, check your returns, no tax increases.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. What's funny here, Mr. Speaker, is that this is another pattern, as these issues continue to come up, where the Republicans continue to offer solutions that have absolutely nothing to do with the problem that we're trying to deal with. You know, they lack ideas. They are a party that's void of ideas. 
   We cannot drill our way out of this problem. That's the issue here. Drilling has increased in the last 7 years by 66 percent, and there has been no decrease in the price of gas, there has been a tremendous increase. And on Friday, there was an increase in the per barrel cost of oil that was larger than a barrel cost 10 years ago. So the increase this year was more than a whole barrel cost 10 years ago. We've been drilling more than we've ever been drilling, 66 percent more in the last 10 years, and it's still not reducing the price. 
   The key here is we need to move off of our dependency on foreign oil. So if  you look at what the policies have been up to this point--and everyone says, you know, they come down to the floor, ``if we could only drill in ANWR,'' if you started drilling in ANWR today, you wouldn't get a drop of oil for 10 years. And in 20 years, you would only reduce the cost of a gallon of gas by one penny. That is the energy plan of the Republican minority in Congress and President George Bush: Go drill, and in 20 years we'll save you one penny per gallon of gas.     
   What we're trying to do is to make a very mature decision, which is unusual for Washington, that if we take the $15 billion or $18 billion in subsidies that we're giving to the oil companies under the Bush administration, we can move that into alternative energy research and development and have a long-term plan to solve this problem. We do not want to be here. Hopefully, God willing, our constituents will continue to elect us.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. What we're trying to say is we don't want to be in the same position 20 years from now or 10 years from now that we're in today, so that means that we need to make some long-term decisions. It's easy to come down to the floor: Drill, drill, drill. Drilling will not solve this problem. 
   If you look at what President Bush's policies have been, if you look at what the Republican Congress' policies have been--drill, increase by 66 percent--gas still goes up through the roof. The war in Iraq has totally destabilized the region that has more oil than anywhere else, and it has totally helped to drive up costs. 
   What we're trying to do is to have these mature discussions, not drill and veto, drill and veto, drill and veto. Let's stop the manipulation of the commodities market. Let's stop the manipulation of the futures and everything else where it's just continuing to drive up the cost of gasoline for average people. That is basically what is going on. 
   I think Ms. Wasserman Schultz made a great point. There are 68 million acres of land, Federal land, that the oil companies could tap into if they wanted. They have not. As for the refining capacity in the United States, everyone says, ``Build more refineries. Build more refineries.'' The refineries we have now are only working at 85 percent. So there are a lot of smoke and mirrors coming from the other side. 
   What we are trying to say is we need long-term, responsible policies that are going to stop providing corporate welfare for the oil companies, and we need to invest that money into long-term biodiesel, nuclear, wind, solar, and all of these other issues. 
   With that, I'd like to yield to our good friend from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. When most of us here are back home, I know that people say, ``Just stop the politics. Solve the problem.'' That entails our making some tough decisions long term, and this is kind of the general theme of what we're talking about here. 
   It is that we're trying to provide, yes, some short-term relief but also some long-term planning and long-term investments so that we're not here 10 years from now. If you're running a corporation or a business, you have a long-term business plan. This is our long-term business plan for the United States of America. 
   Do you want billions of dollars going to the oil companies that are, supposedly, supposed to help them increase refining capacity and help make it easier to drill but where they're not doing it for whatever reason? Public tax dollars. So the average taxpayer is getting hit at the pump, and their tax dollars are going to the oil companies, and still the price is not going down. 
   What we're trying to say is this money can be better spent. We are making a decision here to invest this into the long-term alternative energies which will prevent us, as a country, from being in the same position that we're in today 10 years from now. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If you look on every issue, right, it is like we get hit on 9/11, the Taliban is housing them in Afghanistan, somehow we end up in Iraq. We have an energy problem. Drilling is up 67 percent. We have all this land and everything else, all these other areas. We got to keep drilling. That is the answer, when we know that it is these other things going on in the commodities market. 
   We look at trying to reduce the cost of college education. It is like we will put the banks in charge of loaning the money to the kids. Or if we want to provide prescription drugs, I got an idea. We will have the taxpayer pay for it, and we won't do any negotiations with the drug companies at all. 
   It is like they have a solution that doesn't address the current problem that we have at hand, Mr. Speaker. And what we are trying to say is we have solutions that will last more than a decade or two, and if they are wrong, we will switch them. But to come down and say drill, drill, drill, drill, drill. In ANWR, for example, it will reduce the cost of a gallon of gas by 1.8 cents per gallon of gas 20 years from now if we start drilling today. Totally off the mark.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Before we were even born. But they have been dealing with this issue of oil and gas and the Middle East and dictators and how do we do this and prop up this one and try to figure it out. 
   In this whole scheme, I was watching a thing on Darfur last night. The only reason we couldn't get things done in Darfur is because China has oil in Sudan and we couldn't go in there because they were blocking things at the UN. Oil has become a major, major geopolitical and domestic problem in the United States of America. It has come to a head, and it is Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and the Democrats who are trying to move us off the dime and say long-term alternative energy is the investment. If we drilled in ANWR today, in 20 years you would save 1.8 pennies per gallon of gas. We can't drill our way out of this thing. 
   So if we don't start getting innovative and having a NASA-shoot-the-moon project for alternative energy, we are going to be in the same spot a decade from now, two decades from now. Our constituents did not elect us to come down here and play politics with this.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, as we a couple weeks ago had a big brouhaha here on what we would do as Democrats to protect the homeland, I think Frank Rich is exactly right: They are already trying to get us here, and this war has created more terrorists who are trying to get at the United States. Many may be here already. We don't know. 
   But if you look at what we wanted to do with the homeland security bill a couple of weeks ago, put 3,000 more Border Patrol agents on the borders, make sure that we completely fund the cargo inspections coming in and out of our ports, make sure the technology is at our ports to find out if biological or chemical weapons are coming in, fund the first responders, fund the cops, fund the firemen, fund the equipment that they need for interoperability, so we have an agenda on how to protect the homeland that is much different than this one here. 
   But as Mr. Rich said, and there was also an article today in The New York Times, U.S. generals doubt the ability of Iraqi army to hold gains. 
   Now, no kidding. They had a big brouhaha with the speaker there, who was a Sunni Arab, who was put on leave at the request of a broad coalition of the three parties after incidents in which he lost his temper at other members and struck them or allowed his guards to rough them up. Now, I understand we have had a few brouhahas here in the House and in the Senate, but we didn't have an occupying force telling us to get along and get together. 
   These guys can't get their act together, Mr. Larson, in a way that will allow them to take over their own country. When you look at what is going on here and the testimony before Congress on June 12 from General Dempsey, in charge of training the Iraqi army, he said there is a need to increase the Iraqi forces by at least 20,000 troops this year and a further expansion would be needed in 2008. That is not possible. He said, ``However, the past few days of fighting have not yielded the kind of success that we needed. Despite the efforts to encircle leaders from al Qaeda and others there, we are not getting the job done.'' 
   We have so many cultural differences with the Iraqi people, the difficulties in training them, the lack of competence among the administration to jump on this, the lack of troops, on and on and on and on it goes. 
   I want to lend my voice to yours, Mr. Larson and to Mr. Kendrick Meek from Florida, to say that it is time to bring these troops home. Let's redeploy in a very responsible way, protecting the safety of our troops, Mr. Larson, which we all support, and make sure that we handle this politically and diplomatically, because we won this military battle, but now it is an occupation.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It is an honor to be with you, Mr. Meek. And I appreciate that you were on the floor today passing legislation commemorating a fine citizen down in Florida, a leader in that community. And I want to thank you for taking the time to come out. 
   There are so many issues that we need to discuss today, Mr. Meek. The President submitted his budget this week to the Congress, and we are going to have to go through that with a fine-tooth comb and recognize some of the mistakes that are in there and correct them. 
   And as I said the other night here, Madam Speaker, the only thing that stands between President Bush's budget, which would have been passed post the election, is Speaker Pelosi. And so we have got a real opportunity here to make things right and to make some real progress. 
   A couple of things that we want to talk about that are in President Bush's budget that we need to fix immediately as we go through the hearing process is the tax increase that is going to be placed on middle-class families. The President's entire budget is balanced on the backs of 33 million American families who will be forced to pay higher taxes through the alternative minimum tax. This was a tax that was put on years and years ago to make sure that wealthy Americans had to at least pay a base level, the minimum level, of taxes. Regardless of how much you make, you had to pay this much. And through that process over the years, that AMT started creeping and creeping and creeping into middle-class families now to the point where it may go past the $100,000 point, meaning that if you make $100,000 or possibly even less, you will be forced to pay this alternative minimum tax. The President did not deal with that. We are going to have to fix that because the alternative is it means a tax increase on 33 million Americans. 
   Cuts to health care and to our seniors, Madam Speaker. The President's budget cuts Medicare and Medicaid by over $100 billion over 5 years, $300 billion over the next 10 years. And these are two key components of our health care system in the United States of America that cover about 80 million Americans. There have also been cuts to home energy assistance for poor families. As cold as it is today here in Washington, D.C., and across the country, the President submits a budget that cuts that by about 18 percent. 
   There are a couple other things I want to talk about here, Mr. Meek, and I am glad you are paying attention and asking me to help you out here today. We have seen this tremendous change in the economy over the past couple of decades where we went from basically a national economy to an immediate global superpower post-World War II. And with that there have been tremendous changes. 
   Here is one of the key components that have affected us, and as capital moves and globalization occurs, whether we like it or not, Mr. Meek, here is what has happened. This is a chart that indicates the new global workforce. And the increase, from the left side, 1985 to 2000, the increase from about 2 billion people that were considered in the global workforce to almost 6 billion people. That means China has been added to the list. That means India has been added to the list. That means Central American countries have been added to the list. And now all of a sudden we have expanded the global labor supply, which has driven down wages for people here in the United States. This is a major issue that we have to deal with. 
   And, Mr. Meek, as you know, Speaker Pelosi was kind enough to appoint me to the Appropriations Committee, and today we had a meeting with our chairman Mr. Obey, and he said we  want our committee to be about the future, and we want our committee to solve future problems. And that is really what we need to deal with here. 
   Here is another issue. As we have had the increase in labor, most Americans have been losing ground, Madam Speaker. And if you look at real median household income, and this comes from the New Democratic Network Web page, this is from the U.S. Census Bureau. Real median household income: In 1999, it was $47,500, real median household income. It was, in 2005, $46,500. That real median household income is dropping, not rising. And so this is an issue that the President's budget does not address, but we are going to have to address this, and we have already made great strides to do this. 
   Two other charts I want to share with Mr. Meek, Madam Speaker, real quickly is people say, well, if you are productive, you will make more. The top line here in the red is the increase in productivity; the blue line is the median income. As productivity has increased by 15 percent, wages have actually gone down. So the tie between productivity and wages no longer exists because of this new global market that we are in, which is a major public policy issue, Madam Speaker. 
   And then, finally, the share of national income in 2003 and 2004. This is the change. The change. The bottom 99 percent, their share of national income went down 2 percent. The top 1 percent, they went up 2 percent. And the top .01 percent went up 1 percent. So you can see that the bottom, the 99 percent hasn't benefited from what is going on here, and the top 1 percent has. So the question is what do we do, and what have we already done? 
   If you look at what the new Democratic majority has already done, Mr. Meek, they have already, in the first 100 hours, made strides to try to rectify this. Passed the minimum wage to try to give the American people a pay 
   raise to $7.25 an hour, and that means thousands of dollars a year depending on how many minimum-wage workers or how many minimum-wage jobs you perform. It could mean a couple thousand dollars a year. In addition to that, we have cut student loan interest rates in half for both parent loans and student loans, which will save the average person taking out a loan about $4,400. So you add the minimum wage. And in addition to that, we were able, in the first 100 hours, through the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, to also repeal corporate welfare and invest that money in new alternative energy sources. We passed the stem cell research bill, and alternative energy and stem cells are going to open up two new sectors of the economy. And then in addition to that, we were able to pass and give permission to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate down drug prices on behalf of the Medicare recipients. 
   So this package, the first 100-hour package, has done a lot to try to address some of these problems: Boost the minimum wage, cut student loan interest rates in half, and allow drug prices to be negotiated so that we will actually reduce the burden that is being placed on people. 
   So, Mr. Meek, I think there has been a lot that has been done. There has been a lot that has been done here on behalf of the American people just in the first 100 hours, and we are going to continue to move on global climate change, global warming. We are going to continue to move on alternative energy. We are going to move on research and development. We are going to continue to provide the kind of oversight that the American people deserve in order to fix some of these problems.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If the gentleman will yield, I think this is very illustrative of your point. Here we said earlier, the share of the national income  went up 2 percent for those people in the top 1 percent of the country. The bottom 99 percent, their share of the national income went down 2 percent. 
   Add on that what you are saying, okay, what you just said about the devolution of taxation. Okay. So now these are the same people who have to vote on property tax issues. These are the same people who have to vote on libraries. These are the same people that have to vote on the penny sales tax to keep their counties running. So I think they are getting squeezed from all sides. 
   Then, when you look at what the top 1 percent have benefited from the globalization of America and the ability to be in the stock market and benefit from that, and get tax cuts and the tax loopholes and everything else, the bottom line is, Mr. Meek, the bottom 99 percent have not benefited from all of this.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate your insight, Mr. Meek. You have talked about this, and we have been talking about this for a long time. 
   We would love to come in, as the Democrats did in January and swore in Speaker Pelosi, and come in and bump the Pell Grant up two thousand bucks and eliminate student loans altogether as far as paying interest on them and all kinds of other things we would like to do. But we are limited by the kind of budget that we have inherited from the President in a 6-year presidency and a 14-year Republican control of this Chamber. 
   Here is what they are doing: The 2008 budget authority says that the red on the left, $230 billion or $240 billion a year, is going to be spent just paying the interest on the money that this country has borrowed; not to pay down the debt, but just to pay the interest payments. We are going to have to spend $230 billion because of that. Look how that just dwarfs other priorities in the budget of the United States. 
   The next one is education. The next one is veterans. The next one is homeland security. All pale in comparison to what we are forced to spend to pay the interest on the money we are borrowing. 
   As Mr. Meek has said in his previous chart, this money, over $1 trillion, has come from foreign interests. This President and the Republican Congress borrowed more in 4 years from foreign interests than all of the previous Presidents and Congresses combined. Combined. This is the net result, the interest that we have to pay on the debt. 
   So what has happened is that we have a huge number; $2.102 trillion in 2006 is the amount of foreign held debt, $2 trillion. That is unacceptable in the most powerful, wealthiest country on the face of this Earth. 
   So we have seen what has happened since the Clinton administration had some sanity. We had a $5.6 trillion projected surplus. It went down $8.4 trillion. Now we are in a $2.8 trillion deficit. We have some real problems. 
   So when it goes to making the investments that we want to make in education, the investments that we want to make in health care, SCHIP, the COPS Program, making sure young kids are covered, have some form of health care coverage, Madam Speaker, we are limited by the budget that we have been handed. 
   Unfortunately, we can't start from scratch, but there are some decisions  that need to be made, and I can tell you that it is not acceptable to me, and I know it is not acceptable to my friend from Florida, to continue to allow people who make millions and millions and millions of dollars a year to continue to get a tax cut. 
   Some may say they earn it. Maybe they do. Some do. And some work hard. Just because you wear a white collar doesn't mean you don't work hard. But what we are saying is, that group of people benefit the most from the lavishness that this country has given them, the roads and the bridges and the safety and the security provided by defense, the stable markets in which to invest money, in which many, many do, into the stock market. This is all provided for by the stability that comes out of this institution, and therefore they owe a little bit back. 
   Now, even if you don't believe that, our alternative, we have a decision to make: Either we borrow this money from the Chinese, the Japanese and the OPEC countries, which gets us to that chart where there is $2 trillion in foreign-held debt by this country, or we ask those people who are making millions and millions of dollars a year, Mr. Murphy, to pay their fair share, to step up to bat and help us solve this problem that we have so we don't have to put the future of our kids and our grandkids in the hands of Communist China.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And you are right. In years gone by, they would have greased that sucker up, and it would have flown through the House and the Senate, who knows what kind of changes. It wasn't until in the last year or so that the Republican majority at that point couldn't even agree with each other. So we have had to come in and clean up with the continuing resolution, which we made some great advances with veterans and some other issues that we were able to deal with. 
   But when you look at it, we don't want to get into, and you are exactly right, there is going to be an increase in taxes if the President's budget over the next few years stays, because that alternative minimum tax is going to creep in and is going to creep in to average American families' lives, middle-income families. And so I appreciate you making that point.

And now Nancy Pelosi stands between that budget and the American people, and we are going to make sure, and our friend from Florida. So we thank you for joining us.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate that. As we are wrapping things up, I found it interesting, I saw as we are talking about budget priorities and the kind of investments that we want to make as a country, looking at what the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has to say and what he said yesterday and was quoted in the Wall Street Journal and a lot of other media outlets. 
   Focusing on, and I will say, and I will quote, he said, Ben Bernanke said, The best way to narrow the gap between high-income and low-wage workers in the U.S. would be to strengthen education and training programs. 
   That is our call, and that is the mission for us, to make sure that average people have the skills and the tools and the opportunity with the increase in the Pell Grants, with what we already did by cutting student loan interest rates in half for both parent and student loans, cutting that in half and giving thousands of dollars back to those families. Those are the kinds of things that we need to continue to do, and No Child Left Behind and everything else. 
   So we need to make sure that as we reform these systems, we also provide the resources, as we started this, for the local level to make sure they can get the job done. 
   We are just wrapping up. We only have 1 minute. I want to give out Speaker Pelosi's e-mail, 30-Something Working Group e-mail, 30somethingdems@mail.house.gov, or you can come to our Web site, www.speaker.gov/30something.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate the gentleman's opportunity. Those decisions are made above my pay grade, but I can honestly say that we have numerous debates on this floor, which I think have been significant and monumental, especially in the first 100 hours, as we have talked about here. I don't exactly know how to respond to you. I think we do have adequate debate here, depending on what the issue of the day is, both sides getting an opportunity to do that. 
   We get our hours and talk about the things that we want to talk about, and you get your hour to talk about what you want to talk about. There can be, I am sure, some discussion. If there is room for us, as we push certain policies, that is what we are here to talk about. That is the issue of the day.

   And I appreciate your running over here, hustling over here. I actually wasn't going to come. I have got some meetings tonight that I have to get at, but I saw you over here out of breath, and I thought I would come over and sling-shot you in.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate that. And it is an honor for me to be in the Appropriations Committee, and my friend on the Ways and Means Committee provides the ways and the means for us to get the job done. 
   One of the issues that we have talked about today a little bit is what the Democrats have been doing in Congress since we got here a couple of months ago. And I think it is very important, as we see all of the news stories about Walter Reed, as we see the news stories about the Attorneys General, we see the news stories about what is going on in Iraq, a year ago or 2 years ago, those stories wouldn't have even been possible because the threat of oversight hearings that Speaker Pelosi and the Chairs of our various committees have been executing is the exact balance of power that we were talking about prior to the elections last year. And the American people, very wisely, thought it was time for there to be some oversight. 
   But I must say, Mr. Meek and Mr. Speaker, that all of the thoughts that we had about what was going on in a lot of these various agencies we thought were bad, but we didn't know they were this bad. And I don't think anybody would have said the level of pressure, for example, in the Attorneys General situation, the level of incompetence and neglect at Walter Reed is just absolutely shocking. And we knew about it with the war. We saw the lack of execution in the war. We saw it in Katrina. And now, because the Democrats are in power, we are now able to begin to fix these problems. 
   The whistleblower reform strengthens protections for Federal whistleblowers to prevent retaliation against those who report wrongdoing, waste, fraud, abuse. This is how we begin to reform government, by allowing those people who are in the institution of government to be able to speak freely and to be protected and not to be bullied or prevented from somehow improving the institution. 
   The Freedom of Information request, we had some provisions here. More timely disclosure of government documents, restoring the presumption of disclosure to FOIA, helping FOIA requesters obtain timely responses, improving transparency and agency compliance with FOIA, providing an alternative to litigation, and providing accountability for FOIA decisions, opening up government, transparency in the 21st century. It is an information-based society, an information-based economy; and the more we open it up and allow the information to flow, the more we are going to be able to improve things. 
   One of the great problems we had in China several years with the SARS issue is that nobody knew about it and you can't fix problems that you don't know about. And whether you are in a family or on a team or in a business or running a government, you need to make sure there is free and open access to information. 
   Now, granted, there are sensitive issues, national security issues that need to be protected and need to be kept in order to secure the long-term future of the country. No one debates that. But when we are talking about government documents and the execution of an administrative or executive branch department protecting whistleblowers who may have information in order to make the government improve, this isn't to punish anybody. This is to improve the government. And that means some difficult decisions need to be made. 
   And I think, under the leadership of this House, we are moving down that road, step by step, very methodically to improve the lives of people in this country and to reform the institution of government.     
   That is what we are all here to do. We have had several other things that we had. 
   But I want to talk for a minute, Mr. Meek, if you don't mind, about oversight. I know you had mentioned oversight earlier in the evening, but what is going on and what has gone on already in this Chamber, as I mentioned, the Walter Reed thing came because of the threat of Democratic oversight and the committee oversight process that has already been going on.  
   For example, the war in Iraq, between the House and Senate, more than 97 oversight hearings have looked into the conduct of the Iraqi war. Ninety-seven. There is the big number hearings. And more are coming. 
   Tomorrow in the Appropriations Committee we are going to pass out the supplemental that is going to begin the exit of this war, begin the end of this war.

These are the same people, Mr. Meek, these are the same people who were in charge several months ago, and for the previous 14 years, that led to the dismal display that we see at Walter Reed, the conduct of some of the people in the Veterans Administration. The same people that had oversight then are now upset and trying to point the finger.

   I want you, Mr. Meek, to try to name me one person in this country that would dare send one of their own kids off to war without the proper equipment, that would not ride in a Humvee that was armored. And there are kids still getting killed in Iraq now because the Humvees are light armored and not heavy armored. They don't have the proper equipment and everything else. We are still losing kids because of that.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Going on 5. Sixty to 65 percent of Iraqis believe it is okay to kill Americans, to shoot at Americans. We are in the middle of a civil war and we need to get ourselves out of it, not get ourselves further into it. So these hearings are an important component of that, to try to pull ourselves out of this situation that President Bush has gotten us into. 
   I say that because--for several reasons. One is, some people say well, if you have an end date, then they are just going to sit back and wait until we leave. The problem with that theory is if we say we are going to stay forever, then they are never going to do their share, and the problem has been the Iraqi soldiers won't get trained, the problem is we can't get a political solution because everyone thinks we are just going to stay there and keep the situation intact. 
   They need a goal, and the goal is, in our supplemental bill, if you do not have improvement in some of the benchmarks we have in there, political and military, if you don't have improvement by July, we are getting out. If you are showing some progress, we will give you until the end of the year, until the fall. And if you haven't met the goals by then, then we are out. 
   You have got to meet your obligations. Believe me, I didn't support this  war from the get-go, and it kills me, it kills me, that we have got to spend $100 billion to get us out of a situation. That kills me. 
   This last couple of weeks we have had hearings in the Labor, Health and Education Subcommittee on Appropriations, and you see the millions of dollars the Bush administration submitted that they cut from physical education programs, art programs. They flatlined TRIO, GEAR UP, Upward Bound. All flatlined, with thousands of more kids going into those. Head Start. Only 60 percent of the kids eligible for Head Start get covered. There is a $100 million cut in Head Start, and we are going to go spend $100 billion? 
   I am voting for the supplemental, because I will do anything to get us out of there, and I believe this supplemental is the best step for us to take to get us out of there. 
   But it is not only what is going on in Iraq, Mr. Meek. I don't know if you had a chance to see this memo.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I would just like to make a couple more points to support you before I take off. 
   I don't know if you have seen this. I am sure you have as a distinguished member of the Armed Services Committee in your fifth year already. The memo from the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ortiz) chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, and Mr. Abercrombie, House Armed Services Committee, Air and Land Force Subcommittee, these are the folks in Congress on the ground. They submitted a couple of days ago for Members of Congress, editors, defense writers and other interested parties a memo on military readiness. 
   I want to say a couple of things that I think are very important on where this war has put our military readiness, an elective war in Iraq as opposed to a real threat to our national interest, and the situation it has put us in. And our distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) who sits on the Defense Committee could probably speak better than I can on this. 
   Short-term readiness in this memo addresses the needs of soldiers on the field today. Iraq and Afghanistan have been marked by a lack of adequate funding for equipment, from effective Kevlar vests and helmets to uparmored Humvees which are better able to protect our personnel from roadside bombs. Compounding the lack of equipment for both deployed and nondeployed units is the fact that if nondeployed units don't have the same equipment they will use in combat, their training is less than optimum. 
   So if you don't have a Kevlar vest to train in when you actually are in the field and have to wear one, it is a much different scenario, and you may not have the proper training you need. 
   Long-term readiness, military preparation for any challenges our Nation may face tomorrow, that encompasses everything from manpower training and equipment to preposition stores of military equipment strategically located around the world that, the Government Accountability Office reports, have been deeply ransacked for Iraqi operations. 
   Check this out. Roughly half of all of the ground equipment in the United States Army is in Iraq or Afghanistan, nearly half the ground equipment that the Army owns. Since the start of the war, the Army has lost nearly 2,000 wheeled vehicles and more than 100 armored vehicles. Harsh desert climate, mountain terrain, virtually continuous combat and the physical weight of extra armor is wearing out equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan at up to nine times the normal rate. 
   The Army GAO report details that the Army has not been keeping accurate track of what they have or what they need to reset the force, nor can they provide sufficient detail for Congress to provide effective oversight. 
   The National Guard, between 75,000 and 100,000 pieces of National Guard equipment worth nearly $2 billion are now in Iraq and Afghanistan instead of National Guard armories around the U.S.; and National Guard units are left with about one-third of their equipment. These urgent equipment shortages hit especially hard on the military's ability to train Guard and active Army units, and they are forced to prepare and train for deployment with minimal equipment. 
   We have a real problem where the American Army is not ready should we have another incident around the world, or should someone, heaven forbid, attack the United States, or should we have another Katrina. For this President to talk, Mr. Speaker, about protecting the troops and saving the troops and being on the side of the troops, this is being on the side of the troops.  
   Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the dean of the Ohio Democratic delegation.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the opportunity to be here. 
   Tonight we rise to honor one of the great Members of Congress that has ever stepped foot into this Chamber, and that has ever served in the United States Congress, and that's John Seiberling. Mr. Seiberling passed away a  few weeks ago. We rise today, I am joined by my colleague, and I join my colleague, Congresswoman Betty Sutton. We split the Congressman's old district in Akron and Kent, her particular district goes up to Lorraine, but Ms. Sutton has to leave us, because she is going to go into the Rules Committee room and actually put forth some comprehensive energy legislation that we just heard so much that we weren't doing, that's going to be here on floor of this week addressing all of the issues that the American people want us to address. 
   With that, Ms. Sutton, I will yield to you.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Ohio. (HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN SEIBERLING -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Good luck up in rules. I know we are going to do the right thing. I know Congressman Seiberling would be proud of the efforts we have been making on behalf of the environment, on behalf of alternative energy. 
   I just had the opportunity to kind of peruse through some of my old staff, was his old staff, had an opportunity to peruse, as you were talking the Plain Dealer Magazine from 1986 when Congressman Seiberling retired, and they did a full spread. Just looking through here, I had prepared remarks, but this is a heck of a lot better than what I was going to say. 
   As you go through, and you talk, as Congresswoman Sutton was talking about the Cuyahoga Valley and the park, which basically, for those who don't know the area, Cleveland and Akron would have just grown together, and they would have just been this huge, you know, megacity. 
   Because of the vision of John Seiberling and Ralph Regula, who is just retiring from Congress now, there is this huge Cuyahoga Valley National Park that is one of the beautiful landscapes in Ohio, has separated Akron and Cleveland and provided this gorgeous scenic area. But that's the kind of vision that Congressman Seiberling had. 
   I am trying to find the quote here from Mr. Regula, if I can find it, the newspaper is sticking together because it's 22 years old, but there is a great quote in here from Mr. Regula, just talking about how this is John Seiberling's legacy, is that the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. 
   To have the vision and the foresight that Congressman John Seiberling had is something that I think all of us who serve in Congress aspire to, because it's not about dealing with, necessarily, the problems that we have today, but as we deal with those problems, figure out how we put the country in a good position 10, 15, 20 years from now. When this gentleman was talking about the Cuyahoga Valley National Park 30 years ago, almost 40 years ago, and when he was talking about preserving the wilderness and the natural landscape of our country, not just historic buildings, but historic landscape, and the natural landscape that we have in this country, he was a man ahead of his time. 
   I also had an opportunity to look through one of his old pieces of campaign literature. As we hear the rhetoric, and I know Congressman Seiberling wouldn't in the least bit mind me incorporating some of what the Democrats are doing today into his kind of memorial here, he wouldn't mind that in the least bit, I was looking through his campaign literature. 
   I just want to share with everyone some of the things he was saying in his election in 1970, 38 years ago, when the Vietnam War was going on, issues on the economy, I will give you an example here. On the economy, ``I oppose the economic policies of the Nixon administration. Instead of ending the war and massive military space spending, Nixon has chosen to squeeze the little guy with high prices and unemployment.'' 
   On pollution, ``Facing the greatest environmental crisis of our history, we must move as fast as possible to end the major causes of pollution. I favor a system of fees to be charged against polluters in proportion to the amount of pollution they create.'' 
   This is a guy who was in northeast Ohio and not too far from coal country, standing up saying this is what I believe in. This is what I believe, and this is where I think the country needs to go.     
   On cities, ``Our Nation's priorities are out of whack. The urban crisis is the result. We must cut spending for extravagant military projects and start spending more on health care, crime control, education, housing, recreation areas, public transportation, and other pressing human needs.'' 
   He was extremely involved in the impeachment of Richard Nixon because he sat on the Judiciary Committee. He was obviously involved in interior projects and in making sure that the natural beauty of the United States was preserved. I believe that, as Ms. Sutton stated earlier, he partnered with Congressman Mo Udall and led the way to adding more than 100 million acres to our national parks--wildlife refuges, wild rivers, wilderness areas. He successfully moved to enact the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980, protecting 56 million acres in Alaska's parks, wilderness areas and forests and, as I mentioned earlier, with Congressman Regula, 34,000 acres of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which is now one of the Nation's most visited. 
   This is just a great guy, I mean just a class act. His lineage comes from the Goodyear Tire Company, which his grandfather started. He just goes back from that kind of stock--Harvard, Columbia stock--that kind of ivy league stock, but he never, ever lost that common touch. 
   We were talking about Stephanie Tubbs Jones earlier and how you can be on stages with Presidents and can be passing key pieces of legislation, but when you run into them at the grocery store, they're the same people that you always knew. John Seiberling was just like that. 
   Mr. Speaker, we've been joined by the dean of the Ohio delegation, the gentlewoman from Toledo (Ms. Kaptur). 
   I don't know. Did you have an opportunity to serve with Mr. Seiberling for a few years?

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate the gentlelady's coming. We thank you for your personal recollections. Those of us who came a few years after had to hear the stories, but you were here for a lot of that and for a lot of those fights. 
   You know, even until the last few weeks of his life, until the last few months of his life, at any time I talked to him, he wanted to talk about what was going on in the country. He wanted to talk about what the President was doing and how he was doing it wrong. He wanted to talk about alternative energy. I mean, as you said, his mind was always working on how we can fix the country, on how the country can do better and on how we can move in a new direction. 
   I want to share an article. Tom Diemer from the Plain Dealer wrote this article and did a great job, which he always does, about Mr. Seiberling's reflecting on his accomplishments with the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. He is quoting Mr. Regula as saying: 
   `` `Without John Seiberling, there would never, never have been a Cuyahoga Valley National Park.' The Canton area lawmaker and an original cosponsor of the parks bill said, `Not a chance. This is going to be a lasting monument to John Seiberling.' '' 
   Against strong odds and Gerald Ford in '74 to try to get this greenbelt together, Mr. Seiberling said, ``That is one I am most satisfied with. Saving the beautiful valley was a real joy. I get letters every week from people who say, `I just drove through the Cuyahoga Valley, and I'm just so grateful to you for taking action to preserve this beautiful area, and it means a lot to me and my children.' ''     
   ``When I get letters like that,'' Mr. Seiberling went on to say, ``it brings tears to my eyes because I realize that those people have the same feelings that I do.'' 
   And that was him right there. I mean, that's him in a nutshell, that he understood what the people wanted, and he knew that he was down here to execute those values and those ideas, and he did it. And just a wonderful guy. 
   So I would also like to extend my condolences to Betty and the three sons and the big family on behalf of me and all the constituents from the 17th district, how great it is when we walk around and talk to Mark Udall and he talks about his dad's relationship with Mr. Seiberling and all the battles that they had. 
   In closing here, I would like to just share and ask, Mr. Speaker, that this article be submitted for the Record. And I'll make a copy. And this is John Seiberling's political philosophy and legislative philosophy summed up in this article by Mr. Diemer. ``What we are trying to do is maintain a livable world.'' Think how appropriate this is for today. ``What we are trying to do is maintain a livable world free of nuclear disaster, a world that we have not polluted to the point where we can't breathe, and where we preserve some natural beauty so that we can have the solace and the experiences of being out in God's world. I feel basically it is all part of the same effort to preserve part of our heritage for our children.'' 
   Peace, a clean environment, pristine national parks and wildlife areas, and how urban sprawl has eaten a lot of it up in our time. And I think for those of us who fill his shoes here, it's now our obligation to go in and talk about urban redevelopment, to talk about preserving these natural spaces. 
   But more importantly, as the debate on energy has heated up over the past few weeks and few months, for us to present a comprehensive energy policy here, and to fund the investments in alternative energy. 
   He would be all over this. He would be at the cutting edge of biodiesel and solar and wind, and I think in some ways we're honoring his legacy as we move into the alternative energy areas. 
   And just think what he would be thinking today, as Merrill Lynch is getting bought out, Lehman Brothers is going bankrupt. When you think of all the problems in the housing market, because the government failed to regulate the markets properly, he would be at the forefront of every single one of these fights. 
   So you and I and Betty and those of us who need to honor him by coming down here and making sure that this standard that he set for us gets met every day here.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Ohio. (45TH ANNIVERSARY OF JOHN HERSCHEL GLENN, JR. BECOMING FIRST U.S. ASTRONAUT TO ORBIT EARTH -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 252, recognizing the 45th anniversary of John Glenn and his historic 1962 orbital flight aboard Friendship 7. 
   I commend my colleague, the Honorable ZACH SPACE for his efforts on this resolution and am honored to be an original cosponsor. 
   John Glenn's orbital flight and his many extraordinary achievements in war and peace are appropriately enumerated and memorialized in this resolution--and it is an amazingly long account. Without doubt it is an unsurpassed record of accomplishment that includes six Distinguished Flying Crosses, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, and the only Ohioan to serve four consecutive terms in the U.S. Senate. 
   At Cape Canaveral on February 20, 1962, John Glenn blasted into space and became the first American to orbit the Earth. After several excruciatingly long launch pad delays, people all over the world and every school child in America heard Scott Carpenter's lift off directive--Godspeed John Glenn--soon to be followed by the cool voice of the pilot: ``Roger. Zero Gs and I feel fine. Capsule is turning around. Oh, that view is tremendous!'' 
   As he reached an altitude of 162 miles at a velocity of 17,500 miles an hour, the excitement quickly turned to tension and apprehension when the flight instruments indicated that a loose heat shield threatened a safe return. While the capsule skated back through the atmosphere, Friendship 7 reported a real fireball outside. To our great relief the plume of parachutes and splashdown told us that after a nearly 5 hour flight, Glenn was safe and sound back on Earth. 
   On February 26, 1962, John Glenn was received with a standing ovation before a Joint Session of Congress in this chamber. Parades in Washington, New York, and New Concord, Ohio, soon followed. Friendship 7 is now prominently displayed in the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum near Orville and Wilbur Wright's 1903 Flyer, Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis and Apollo XI. 
   John and Annie Glenn celebrated their 64th wedding anniversary on April 6th. Annie is a true American hero for her extraordinary personal efforts to overcome stuttering. Her public efforts to help others with speech and communication disorders are nationally recognized. She received the first national award of the American Speech and Hearing Association for inspiring those with communicative disorders. The National Association for Hearing and Speech Action annually presents the Annie Glenn Award to an individual achieving distinction despite a communication disorder. She is a national treasure. 
   In 1941, John Glenn was on his way to Annie's organ recital at Muskingum College  when he heard over the car radio that Pearl Harbor had been attacked. His patriotic public service began shortly thereafter when he volunteered for military service and continues today through his work at the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at the Ohio State University. 
   In a lifetime of accomplishment he found in adventure and challenge he met with courage. John Glenn is an American hero. He has proudly served his Nation as soldier and statesman and he still likes to fly. 
   I join my colleagues in urging the passage of the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate that, and I think you are exactly right. There was a misrepresentation of the facts of the legislation that was put forth to the White House. I think it's important for us, for us to go over in a snapshot of what the supplemental bill did that the President just vetoed. 
   What this bill did was increase by $1.7 billion the amount of money that was going to defense health care for the troops. What it did was it increased veterans spending by $1.7 billion above what the President wanted. We tried to make law the benchmarks that the President set up for progress in Iraq on January 10, his benchmarks, and he vetoed that. 
   Now, the President is vetoing his own statements, if that is not confusing enough. The key component of this piece of legislation is the piece that says that our troops can't leave here and go to Iraq if they don't have the proper body armor, if they don't have the proper equipment, if they don't have Humvees that are up armored, and if they don't have the amount of rest that they need. That is what the President just vetoed. 
   I think this is a pretty sad day in American history when you have the President of the United States trying to win a PR battle and using the troops as hostage. Those are not my words, those are the words of General Paul Eaton, who just said, after the statement, this is what he is saying on the President's veto, ``This administration and the previously Republican controlled legislature have been the most caustic agents against America's Armed Forces in memory. Less than a year ago, the Republicans imposed great hardship on the Army and the Marine Corps by their failure to pass the necessary funding language. This time, the President of the United States is holding our Soldiers hostage to his ego. More than ever apparent, only the Army and the Marine Corps are at war--alone--without their President's support.'' 
   Terrorism around the globe is up 25 percent. Stop doing what you are doing to make terrorism increase by 25 percent. Enough of the scare tactics that if we don't fight them there, they are going to come here and get us. The same scare tactics that they have been trying to employ for the past 5 years, this is the same group of people who told us, as was stated earlier, that the oil money would be used for reconstruction, it would only cost $50 billion, and now we are upwards of some $500 and some billion after the 2008 budget, going to be greeted as liberators. All of the statements that have been made in the past 5 years have been wrong, colossal mistakes. 
   The same people that said the mission was accomplished are the same people that are now telling us we don't want any timetables, we don't want any deadlines, we don't want any goals for when we maybe should possibly, at some point, get out of Iraq and redeploy out. We don't want any of that. They expect, after all these mistakes, all of these blunders, that somehow we are going to trust them. 
   I am sorry, but you know what? Between now and when the President decides it's time to get out, how many more soldiers are we going to lose? How many more kids are we going to go up and see at Walter Reed who have brain injuries and post-traumatic stress? 
   That's the difference between today and a year from now. That's the difference between a deadline and an open-ended war, kids getting killed and innocent Iraqis getting killed. You know, I think that this is the height of arrogance that this veto showed by the President.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I totally agree with you. I think the first step for most people who find themselves in a massive hole and going in the wrong direction, or following someone who continues to lead them down the wrong road, is to not follow that person any more. 
   What the Democratic Congress has provided is what the American people sent the majority of the Democrats down here for in November, and that is to take this war in another direction, take our foreign policy in another direction. That is what this supplemental bill has done. The American people wanted us to take care of the veterans, and we increased $500 million for post-traumatic stress disorder, $500 million additional for brain injuries, that is what the American people wanted, for us to fix the veterans's problem. 
   They wanted to make sure, they got tired of hearing about kids over there without body armor. So we made sure that no kid could go over there, or soldier or adult who is going to Iraq will not be over there without the proper equipment, body armor, up-armored Humvees, the proper rest when they get back, for over a year, let them rest. We gave the American people what they wanted, and what the troops deserved. 
   To have that vetoed by a President who has been wrong on every single major foreign policy and domestic issue over the past 6 years doesn't make any sense to the American people, and it certainly doesn't make any sense to us. You look, and it's getting better. You hear this all the time, it's not getting better. 
   It's not. If it was getting better, do you think you would have this uproar from the American people? Do you think you would have all of these new Members of Congress if things were getting better? 
   In a report that just came out, National Counterterrorism Center, terrorist incidents in Iraq rose by 91 percent from 3,468 in 2005 to 6,630 in 2006 and getting worse. Innocent Iraqis are getting killed all the time, and they believe it's because the American soldiers are there, because the American presence is there. That is what they believe, and we are saying we need to redeploy out of these major centers and stop policing a civil war. That is exactly what's happening. 
   One of the things we wanted to do in the supplemental that the President just vetoed is hold the Iraqi government accountable for training their own soldiers. You know, the President has always said, when they stand up, we stand down. Then they keep telling us that the Iraqi soldiers are standing up, but we are not standing down, which means they are not standing up. 
   We wanted to put benchmarks in there so that the Iraqi soldiers would have to meet them or were leaving. Now, you can't give people open-ended situations in which they can get out of. All we are trying to do is hold the Iraqi government responsible. 
   I don't like saying it, because I didn't support this war from the beginning. To go in there and knock everything around and then say you are not doing what you are doing, but the bottom line is, if you do not get yourself trained, if you do not, as a country, get your police force ready, and your military ready, we can't stay here forever.     
   And, Mr. Speaker, I don't think that is too much to ask. And the response from the President through his Secretary of State, Secretary Rice, signaled Bush's opposition to, ``Any war spending bill,'' check this out, ``that penalizes Iraqi's government for failing to make progress.'' We are not going to punish them for failing to make progress. Are we in a therapy session here?

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And let's be clear about this whole issue of deadlines. There was a deadline that came out of the House version, for the political junkies that are paying attention, Mr. Speaker. There was a hard deadline that came out of the House version, not in the Senate version. And the compromise that just went to the President had the goal, just the goal of maybe getting out of Iraq. No hard deadline, just the goal, because we knew that he would veto a hard deadline. And as much as we don't like it, he is the President of the United States. But there is the goal of leaving. This President, Mr. Speaker, can't even think about the goal of getting out of Iraq. He doesn't even want to talk about it. 
   There is no deadline in this supplemental that he just vetoed, no hard deadline at all. The language said, the goal of getting out. So let's be very, very clear. 
   Now, when people ask, well, why do we need to get out. People I think feel why. There's a lot of really good examples, not just from Democrats as some of our friends may like to think, but from a variety of others.     
   Here's what is happening in Iraq, as the Washington Post reported, ``A department of the Iraqi Prime Minister's Office is playing a leading role,'' this is the Iraqi Prime Minister's Office, playing a leading role ``in the arrest and removal of senior Iraqi Army and National Police Officers, some of whom had apparently worked too aggressively to combat violent Shiite militias, according to U.S. military officials in Baghdad. Since March 1, at least 16 Army and National Police Commanders have been fired, detained or pressured to resign. At least 9 of them are Sunnis.'' 
   So now they are removing police and military people that are cracking down on the wrong, somehow the wrong group of terrorists. And some folks say this is not like Vietnam. 
   How about Senator Hagel, leading Republican, conservative. I read today he had an 85 percent rating from a conservative think tank. So he is clearly a conservative Republican. He just got back from Iraq. Here's what he says in Mr. Novak's column of yesterday, or 2 days ago. ``This thing is coming undone quickly, and Maliki's government is weaker by the day. The police are corrupt, top to bottom. The oil problem is a huge problem. They still can't get anything through the parliament. No hydrocarbon law, no deBaathification law, no provincial elections.'' 
   That's CHUCK HAGEL, our friend in the Senate, our colleague in the United States Senate. Republican from Nebraska; 85 percent conservative rating from a conservative group here in Washington. 
   We're saying that we need to change direction, Mr. Speaker. We're saying that the Iraqi government has had over 4 years to try to piece this thing together, and that we've done all that we can do. And the American people do not want to lose any more soldiers to this war. And we want a deadline. We want to get out. We want to get out with respect. We want to get out with dignity, we want to get out and protect our troops. 
   But it turns out that the presence of the United States in Iraq is inciting violence. We're inciting the civil war. We're the ones being attacked, as well as others around. And in April, it's been the sixth highest month of American soldiers getting killed in the entirety of the war. 
   Let's fix this. Let's go in a new direction. This is not time for bravado. This it not time for ego. This is time for the American people to come together and the Congress to come together, the President to recognize that this has not worked, and for us to try to re-establish some level of credibility in the world. And this President needs to listen to the will of the American people. 
   And I want to make one final point, because we have this tremendous debate in the country that is not always framed the right way. But I want friends who we run into in the street, and someone says I'm pro-choice and I'm pro-life, and I think we're all pro-life. But the debate has been framed as such that pro-life Americans take their role and their issues very seriously. 
   And I find it extremely ironic, as a pro-life Democrat who voted for the partial birth abortion bill, that this President has two vetos. His one veto is on stem cell research, because that's a pro-life issue. And his second veto is to continue a war in which thousands of American soldiers have been killed and injured, and in which tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens, innocent, many of them, have been killed. And by keeping this open-ended, by keeping this open-ended, we know that there will be more death and destruction. 
   So I find it ironic that this President has two vetos; one pro-life, supposedly, and the other pro-war. And how they reconcile that on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, I'll have no idea. But I think it is important for us to recognize how sometimes dysfunctional the philosophy, Mr. Meek, of this President and this administration has been. 
   And so, let's, on the anniversary of ``Mission Accomplished,'' and recognizing the failures of the past, let's do what Americans do, and that's fix the problem. Americans are full of problem solvers, and that's what we do in this country. We fix things, whether it's the car or the computer, or the truck, we fix things. 
   And I hope that the President will find it in his heart to sit down with Speaker Pelosi, to sit down with Leader Reid and the leadership from this Congress, and draw on the knowledge of IKE SKELTON, the Chair of our Armed Services Committee, who's been in this institution, I think, over 30 years. Draw on the knowledge of JACK MURTHA, who's been in this Congress almost 40 years on the Defense Appropriations Committee. And stop listening to those people who got us in this situation. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Can I share with the American people and our colleagues one more? First, I thought it was interesting, and our crack staff here, the President gave his speech in front of the Jefferson Memorial. We've got a great quote, 1789, when Jefferson wrote a letter to Madison talking about war. ``We have already given one effectual check to the dog of war, by transferring the power of letting him loose from the Executive to the Legislative body, from those who are to spend to those who are to pay.'' 
   And I think it would be appropriate, if Mr. Bush is going to use President Jefferson as a backdrop, that he should recognize at least his philosophy on some of these issues. 
   But a quote from General John Batiste, retired general. Today, and this is on his response to the President's veto. ``The President vetoed our troops and the American people. His stubborn commitment to a failed strategy in Iraq is incomprehensible. He committed our great military to a failed strategy in violation of basic principles of war. His failure to mobilize the Nation to defeat worldwide Islamic extremism is tragic.''     
   ``We deserve more from our Commander in Chief and his administration.'' That is Major General John Batiste, retired general. 
   It has been a pleasure being here with you today. I hope this week, with the leadership of Leader Pelosi, that we continue to stand strong behind the American people. And you can be assured, Mr. Speaker, that when Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid are there tomorrow negotiating that they will be representing the will of the American people, the 65 percent of the American people that want a deadline to get us out. 
   30somethingdems@mail.house.gov for any e-mails that the Members may want to send us. The charts that we have here, some we showed tonight and some we didn't, are all on our Web site www.speaker.gov/30something. And, again, the e-mail address is 30somethingdems@mail.house.gov.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. As we've gone through this debate for years and years and years, as you said, we've been on the floor talking about this for a long time; and you start to hear these arguments, the same ones over and over and over regardless of what the facts are on the ground. 
   And the issue, I think, that has become most apparent, and some say the surge was a success. Some say, well, maybe it wasn't. Some say there hasn't been any political success. Some say there has been some. I think this has kind of gotten boiled down to one point. Some people are saying we need to stay. And you know what? Maybe, maybe if we accept that argument, maybe they're right. Maybe we should stay. But they're only going to stay at the expense of the future of this country. We will bankrupt this country if we continue to stay in Iraq. 
   And when you look at all of the great powers over time, they get too extended, too far out, too far out ahead of themselves; and what we are saying here is there is a reality on the ground that we need to deal with in order to address the issues that are facing the United States of America. This is about making sure that we are a strong country. If we are not a strong country, we are of no good to anybody else. 
   And the point that we are trying to make and that the Speaker is trying to make and the Democrats in the Senate are trying to make and like-minded Republicans are trying to make is that we can't sacrifice the United States of America for Iraq. 
   Now, we do bear some responsibility because we went in, but you can't continue to say that we are going to borrow, because we don't have this money. We are borrowing it all. $3 trillion is what the projections are now for the cost for Iraq when you factor in vets coming back and health care and what not. $3 trillion? We are going to borrow it from China and Japan and OPEC countries to fund a war that we are not having any political progress at all? 
   The sides are not reconciling. They're not moving forward in the political process. That's a problem. 
   So, even if you say we need to stay, you need to then be willing to spend enormous amounts of money, United States dollars, over the course of the next several decades and, as some people have said, over the course of the next hundred years. 
   And what we are trying to say is, we've got problems here at home that we need to deal with. We've got an energy crisis. We've got a health care issue that needs to be dealt with. Growing inequality. We can't afford to spend $3 trillion on this war. 
   Now, I don't think that's unreasonable because the strength of the country is at stake, and all we have to do is look around. We don't have this money. And this isn't just us. Joseph Stiglitz, Noble Peace Prize economist, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and there's no such thing as a free war. The Iraq adventure has severely weakened the U.S. economy whose woes go far beyond loose mortgage lending. You can't spend $3 trillion, yes, $3 trillion, on a failed war abroad and not feel the pain at home. 
   This is a political reality that we have to deal with in the United States of America. And we are making difficult decisions. No one is saying yank the rug out. We are saying have a responsible, planned exit in which this country and the soldiers that we have trained and the close to $1 trillion that we have spent already, that investment, allow these people to take over their country. 
   I think there's a little bit of a misperception that there is not going to be, like we are going to be able to just leave Iraq, whenever it is, tomorrow or 10 years from now; and if we do it right, that there is not going to be any conflict, we will just kind of sneak out and everything will just harmoniously arrange itself. 
   And I think we need to realize that whether we get out 6 months from now or a year from now or 8, 10 years from now, there's going to be conflict. You have got groups of people that have hated each other for thousands of years. And there is not going to be any real polite settlement of this dispute.     
   And so we need to realize that. And by realizing that, I think it helps us get to the point where we say, well, maybe we need to just get out now because this dust-up is going to happen anyway. 
   And when you look at what happened the other day with the Iraqi offensive onto this militia group and then a thousand Iraqi soldiers left and abandoned the mission, would they have left if we weren't there? That's a question I think we need to ask, would they have left? But they know we're there. This is part of the problem. 
   We're creating a welfare state. These people are in a state of dependency upon the United States, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. And if we continue to be there all the time, we're never going to leave, we're always going to be here for you. You know, you see all the time, this is the equivalent of a 35-year-old person still living at home with their parents. They get into a state of dependency, and they can never be responsible. 
   And I understand all the dynamics. I didn't want to go into this war in the first place, I was against it from the beginning, so we've got some responsibility to bear. But haven't we made the investment? And we know at some point they've got to step up and make their own way here. So I think a lot of us are just saying, let's just do it. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I don't know if you've had an opportunity to see the documentary, and I haven't seen the documentary, but I've seen Phil Donahue talking about the documentary that he did, it's called ``Body of War.'' And it's basically these soldiers who have come back and the injuries that they're dealing with, the folks that we see going up to Walter Reed. And talk about an eye-opening experience when you first go to Walter Reed and you see these 21, 22-year-old kids without legs, without arms, severe brain damage, brain trauma, you know, all of the gruesomeness. But I think Donahue does a good job by bringing this to life and doing a documentary, Eddie Vetter does some of the music on it, so it's really a compelling case. But it goes to the point that we're all talking, you know, we're all talking numbers, 4,013, and 29,628 injured. I mean, these are numbers, but these are families that have been ripped apart, that will never be the same. 
   If we have an opportunity and enough facts to stop this thing, because it's not in the best interest of, obviously, a lot of these families, but this country, and you look at the human cost, as Ms. Wasserman Schultz has said, is tremendous. The financial aspect of this is detrimental to the future of this country. The readiness of our own troops, the lack of readiness, to be able to address some of these problems. And this is not something that you have to believe the Democrats or believe a politician on, this is retired Major General Punaro, Commission on the National Guard and Reserve, ``we think there is an appalling gap in readiness for homeland defense because it will be the Guard and Reserve that have to respond for these things.'' Army Vice Chief of Staff Richard Cody said the Army, ``no longer has fully combat ready brigades on standby should a threat or conflict occur.'' We're not making this up. In this country, we need to be prepared to responsibly, prudently, and practically disengage ourselves. 
   Empower the Iraqis. We've trained them for years. You know, I hate to always fall back on this example, but it's like when you're getting ready for a football season or a basketball season or a baseball season, you go through spring training and then the game is on a certain day and the coaches are coaching you, at some point you've taught the team all you can teach them, you've practiced as much as you can, and you're not fully ready for the game, but you've got to go play. And the coaches can't go on the field for you. And that's the situation we're in. 
   The Iraqis are never going to be perfectly prepared, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. It's never going to be perfect. There's never going to be a perfect time where all these people are trained to the tee and we're going to be able to say, now they're ready. Because you always make mistakes, you're never trained enough, you're never prepared enough, especially when you're dealing with all the cultural issues that we're dealing with. 
   So what we're arguing is that they're never going to be perfectly ready. And I think there would have been a better chance the other day of these thousand soldiers 
   sticking with the mission that they had and staying there, but they knew the Americans were there, and so it became convenient to say, I'm out of here, the Americans will take over.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, when you look at how many different ways the Iraq war is like that pressure point that you hit and it has all these different ramifications all over the country, all over the economy, all over our society in so many different ways, and this is the one issue that needs to be addressed if we are going to make any kind of headway into converting our economy over from manufacturing and basically the industrial age into a new high-tech economy that everyone benefits from it. 
   Now, in Youngstown, Ohio, or in Warren or Akron or Cleveland or the industrial Midwest or Pittsburgh, Detroit, whatever the case may be, if the amount of money that was spent already in Iraq, nearly $1 trillion, was invested into these communities that, for example, have been hurt by globalization, and the big debate in the Ohio and Texas primary was NAFTA, NAFTA, NAFTA, and some areas benefited and some areas didn't, and Texas did this and Ohio did that and whatnot, just think, if all the communities that were very successful 50 years ago and pumped a lot of money into this country in steel and rubber and coal and all this stuff that were hurt by globalization, the investment of $1 trillion was made into those communities in water lines, sewer lines, roads, education, community colleges, worker retraining, investments into the NIH research, investments in alternative energy, figuring out who's going to make the windmill, figuring out how biodiesel is actually going to work without having all these different adverse effects, figuring out who's going to make the solar panels and how we're going to make these investments, $1 trillion that has been spent in Iraq, and we have no real signs of success.     
   No real signs of success. So this is what we're all factoring in here: The fact that it's costing us $1 trillion already and projected to be $3 trillion; the fact that all that money is borrowed; the fact that our friends on the other side raised the debt limit five times and borrowed $3 trillion already from Japan, China, and OPEC countries; the fact that our homeland has suffered because of the Guard and Reserve, and so we are incapable now of addressing major threats to the United States; the fact that our army is not at the level it should be, all of these factor in. The lack of readiness, the money, and then the lost opportunity. 
   We are Americans. We think about what can be. We think about the future. We think about where we want to go, what we want to be, what we want to do. And we are stuck because we don't have the resources to make the investments that Americans have always made: canals, railroads, Internet superhighway, investments in all these research projects that bounce into the Internet and put men in spaceships and land them on the moon. That's what Americans do. So let's put ourselves in a position where we can make these investments so these kids that we talk about all the time can have a future, have an economy. When you look at the benefits of NASA and science and technology and math over the years, how many corporations benefited from all of that, that's what we're talking about doing. Let's think about the future. 
   And when you look at this war as missed opportunities with Afghanistan, national security alone. We have missed opportunities catching bin Laden, focusing on Afghanistan, focusing on the global war on terror, these networks. We should have been tripling and quadrupling our special forces and hiring people who speak Farsi to translate tapes that we're pulling down from the satellites. All this stuff could have been done. A missed opportunity. Economically, missed opportunity. 
   So, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, thank you for coming down to this floor and claiming our hour tonight, and it's been great to be with you again. And we're going to keep plugging away here.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate it, and no more important than the Ways and Means Committee, of which you serve on, and all your hard work over the past 4 years in the United States Congress, previous to that in the Florida Senate, previous to that in the Florida House, following in your mom's footsteps, who was also an appropriator in the United States Congress. So it is an honor to follow in her footsteps. 
   I think there is a couple of very important points that we want to make in regards to this bill that we have before us on Thursday. It passed out of the Appropriations Committee last Thursday, and this, in essence, in fact, in reality, is the piece of legislation that will help change the course of our Iraq policy. 
   The President has had free rein for the past 5 years from a Republican Congress that just went along with everything that he wanted to do, and I found it funny this weekend, as we were watching some of the weekend shows, and I was watching Meet the Press and former Congressman Tom DeLay was on, Richard Perle, one of the top, President's top defense advisers was on, and they were arguing that  if we pull out of Iraq, that somehow the sky's going to fall, okay, and that this whole thing, that Iraq is going to turn into a catastrophe, and it is going to fall apart; it is going to spin out of control. 
   I just could not help but to think that these people, Mr. Speaker, have absolutely no credibility to comment on what is going on in Iraq. They can talk and they can say what they need to say, but the bottom line is they have expressed their opinion over the past 5 years, and it is difficult to find any statements that they have made that have been either factual or predictions that they have made that came true. 
   I want to say a couple of things about this bill that we are going to pass.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We are saying basically and General Petraeus is saying this. Now they are saying that we are going to need until summer to figure out whether or not the surge is working. In our bill that we are passing, that we are going to pass on Thursday, it says by July 1, which is the summer, that if by July 1 there is no progress being made, that we immediately begin to withdraw our troops down in 180 days; and if by October 1 the President does not certify that the benchmarks that he came up with are met, we begin to get out of there; and at the absolute latest, we start withdrawing March of next year and have everybody home by August of 2008. 
   Here is what I want to say, because here is the big argument that we had. We are saying that there are benchmarks that they need to meet, and if they do not meet them, they are deadlines, and we are coming home. What we are hearing from the other side is that you cannot have benchmarks, you cannot possibly have any benchmarks, you cannot tie the President's hands. Well, actually, it is funny.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. That is right, and now all our friends on the other side are saying, you cannot possibly set a deadline, you cannot possibly tie the President's hands. Very interesting when you go back and do a little research. 
   In June of 1997, when our troops were on their way to Bosnia under President Clinton, House Republicans brought to the floor an amendment that would, guess what, set a timeline and a date certain for withdrawal from the U.S. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, a mission that was only 18 months old. So all of the Republicans who say that we cannot possibly be for a timeline were for a timeline 10 years ago in Bosnia. 
   Now, our friend from Indiana Mr. Buyer, who we had a nice debate with over the resolution a few weeks ago, offered an amendment that by December 15, 1997, President Clinton was required to report to Congress on political and military conditions in Bosnia. By June 30 of 1998, all troops had to be withdrawn. That was an amendment that the now-ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs offered in 1997, and you will never guess all of the Republicans, members of leadership today, who voted for that amendment, and now all of the sudden they are saying, you cannot possibly be for a timeline or a date certain, and on and on and on. 
   We will continue to go through this debate. This will be the debate the next couple of weeks, but the Republicans in 1997, some of the top leaders in Congress today, supported a date certain that we would come out of Bosnia, withdraw the troops, and that was only 18 months into Bosnia and only $7 billion, and here we are today, 48 months, $379 billion, and over 3,200 American lives.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. The President has to deal with Congress now, and what is in this bill I think holds the President accountable. This bill does not just hold the Iraqis accountable, but it holds the President accountable. 
   The benchmarks that are in this supplement that we are going to pass are the President's benchmarks that he outlined in January that we need to hit. Now, if we do not hit them, then what do we do? The President says, do not tie my hands. We are saying, these are your benchmarks. We have been there for a long time, and if they do not step up, the Iraqi troops do not step up, it is time for us to go. 
   The bottom line is that there is no incentive for the Iraqis to step up because at this point they feel like we will stay there forever, and we are saying that we are not going to be there forever; get your act together.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Because I have to take off a few minutes early, and I want to go through real quick, I want to talk about what these folks who say they are going to vote against this bill, what they are voting against from the veterans' standpoint, okay. 
   Now, these are folks who consistently say, Mr. Speaker, we support the troops, work for the troops. We have got to get the troops back. I think we all believe that, but there will be an opportunity on Thursday to really put your voting card where all the rhetoric is. 
   Defense health care, we add $1.7 billion of an increase to the President's request. Here is what you are voting against if you vote against the supplemental. You are voting against an additional $450 million for post-traumatic stress disorder and counseling. 
   You are going to vote against $450 million for traumatic brain injury care and research, and if you have been to Walter Reed, as we all have, you will see unbelievable brain injuries. 
   You will be voting against $730 million to prevent health care fee increases for our troops. 
   You are going to vote against $20 million to address the problem at Walter Reed, and you are going to vote against $14.8 million for burn care. 
   Now, that is just defense health care. Now veterans health care. Now, we have got to support these veterans coming back; an additional $1.7 billion above the President's request for veterans health care. 
   If you vote against this supplemental, here is what you are voting against.     
   You are voting against $550 million to address the backlog in maintaining VA health care facilities. You will vote against $250 million for medical administration to ensure there is sufficient personnel to support the growing number of Iraqi and Afghanistan troops coming back. That was the major problem at Walter Reed because of the contracting issue, because some people had to make some money on the deal; $229 million for treating the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. It is a growing number, $100 million for contract mental health care and $62 million to help speed up the process. 
   Now, there are other things in here. We are going to talk about readiness. 
   But if you vote against this, that is what you are voting against. I would hate to see the political commercials that may be run if you are on the other end of this thing. 
   I mean, that is just, I wouldn't want to be in that position, but that is what is in the bill. So rhetoric is rhetoric, action is action, and it is $1.7 billion more for defense health care, $1.7 billion more for veterans health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Ohio. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here on the House floor to kick off another segment of the 30-something Working Group Special Order, soon to be joined by a group of 30-somethings in the Democratic Caucus to address issues pertaining to not only young people throughout the country, but citizens of our country and the kind of leadership that the Democratic Congress is providing here. So I appreciate the opportunity to be here. 
   Several issues that have been discussed prior to this by our friends on the other side that I would like to at least comment on. The first one is: The economy is going great. 
   I read an article with great interest today out of The New York Times. The title is ``Growth in U.S. Economy is Slower Than Thought.'' This economy is only growing at 2.2 percent, in large measure, due to the fact that we haven't balanced our budget. We are nowhere near balancing our budget because of the Republican leadership in the House since 1994, and in the Senate and also in the White House. For many, many years, the Republican answer to balancing the budget or trying to make our payments is to go off to China and go to the banks in China and borrow money from the Chinese government in order to fund the increase in spending that the Republican House, Republican Senate, and Republican White House were pursuing. 
   And one friend, Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Texas, said that the economy has created 7.2 million new jobs. 
   When President Clinton was in and the Democrats balanced the budget in 1993 without one Republican vote, the expansion years under President Clinton, we created 20 million jobs. Welfare rolls were the lowest they had been. So you have to balance your budget, so you stop borrowing money from China. 
   And we have got a lot of other issues dealing with China as well. They are manipulating their currency, Madam Speaker, and we are starting to generate some support in the Democratic Congress for addressing this issue. China is not giving the proper alignment to their currency, and it gives them a 40-percent advantage to goods that they ship over here. And so if you have a company in the United States of America, like I do in Warren, Ohio, called Wheatland Tube, and Mr. Altmire, who may join us here later, their raw materials cost as much as the product from China when it hits the shores of the United States, final product, because there is a 40-percent advantage that the Chinese have, Madam Speaker. 
   So because these issues haven't been addressed, Wheatland Tube is laying off 30 or 40 people, white collar jobs. So our friends have not addressed any of the issues. 
   But they have been talking about an issue that is near and dear to my heart, and that is the Employee Free Choice Act. This is a wonderful piece of legislation that is going to allow members of a workforce to merely sign if they want to start a union or not. And I hope that our friends recognize why. And I am from Youngstown, Ohio; so I find it funny when our friends start talking about these big labor bosses, to try to portray good, hardworking Americans who want to work for a decent wage and have health care, that somehow that is wrong and somehow that is unAmerican. 
   So this Employee Free Choice Act will allow our folks, our workers, to merely sign a card. And if half sign that they want to start a union, it is basic democracy at the workplace. You will be able to start a union. 
   Here is the reason why there is so much anxiety in the United States of America: We have had economic growth, but if you are not in the top 1 percent, you are getting squeezed. If you don't have a lot of money in the stock market, you are getting squeezed. And it took us almost 10 years to raise the minimum wage for average workers, and one of the first things the Democratic Congress did under the leadership of the Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, was to raise the minimum wage to try to get everybody in on the game. 
   But here is what has happened: This is from 2000 to 2004. The red line that is increasing is productivity, the change in productivity, the growth in productivity percentage-wise from 2000 to 2004. You see a tremendous increase in productivity. 
   Median income is the black line. It has actually gone down. So for the first time in history, increased levels of productivity have led to the decrease in median income. That means that our globalization, although it may benefit certain people and certain sectors of the economy, is leaving a lot of people behind. 
   So if workers want to join together to say how do we be a part of the solution here, how do we try to increase income? I think we should allow them to do that. We are not saying they have to. There is nobody intimidating anybody. 
   And my friend from Tennessee made a mistake, Madam Speaker, when she spoke. She was saying that the National Labor Relations Act and the National Labor Relations Board were there so workers didn't intimidate other workers to join unions. 
   The whole premise of the National Labor Relations Act is because business folks in that time had a tremendous advantage on firing workers and threatening workers. So we don't run from the fact that we want to allow people in the workplace to be empowered, and this is the reason we need to do it. 
   Now, as we do this, we also need an expansion of our international standards that we have. We have clean air in the United States, and it needs to be a lot cleaner, but we have made great progress. We need clean water in the United States. I am from the State of Ohio where the Cuyahoga River caught on fire because there was so much industry and pollution that it literally caught on fire. 
   We need to make sure that these standards that we have here in the United States somehow are transferred to the global economy so that when we are dealing with China, when we are dealing with India, when we are dealing with some of the Asian Pacific countries, we try to lift up the standards. It doesn't do us much good to clean the air in the United States of America and have dirty air in China. We are not making progress. So we have a long way to go. And I think what we are doing this week is making sure that our workers in the United States of America are allowed to do what we all do on election day, and that is join together and vote, and they should be allowed to join together and to vote as well. 
   One of the myths that we have with the Employee Free Choice Act is, well, you are going to have to sign a card and someone is going to know. 
   If you want to sign a card or a petition to even have an election, you have to sign a card or a petition in order to even have an election to start a union anyway. So we are not doing anything that is not already going on. You are either going to sign a petition to vote on it or you are going to sign a petition to actually create a union. And if you are willing to stick your neck out to have the vote, you are certainly going to be willing to stick your neck out to sign the petition in order to cast a ballot to create a union.     
   So I think we are dealing with very troubling times. We need to make sure that we are representing all of our country because, quite frankly, Madam Speaker, for the longest time in this country, the last decade or so, at least from this institution here that we represent in the House of Representatives, there has been such a tilt, such an emphasis on cutting taxes for the top 1 percent. And you are not going to see the Democratic Party raise taxes on the middle class at all. 
   But if we have a choice to make between borrowing the money from the Chinese in order to fund our government or asking people who are billionaires to pay a little bit more in taxes so that we can provide health care for children, we are going to ask the millionaires and the billionaires in the United States to pay a little bit more and to meet their obligation and to meet their responsibility to society. They have benefited from the United States stock market. They have benefited from the protection of the United States military. They have benefited from the infrastructure. They have  benefited from the Internet, which was developed from public research. They benefit from the vaccines. They benefit from the Centers for Disease Control. They benefit from public education. So if we ask the wealthiest to meet their obligation and their responsibility, as a beneficiary of this great society, to put back into our society in order to keep the game going, we are going to need to do that. 
   And if you question the priorities of the Democrats, all you need to do is look at what is going to happen in our supplemental, where there is going to be an additional millions of dollars, to the tune of $750 million, for health care for children, Children's Health Insurance Program. Do you want to talk about priorities, Madam Speaker? Under the Republican leadership, 6 million children were eligible for the SCHIP program, but weren't registered. 
   So all we are saying is we are going to take every opportunity we can possibly get to make sure that those kids get the kind of health care that they need and they deserve in the wealthiest country on the face of this Earth in the entire history of our planet, Mr. Murphy. 
   And we don't shrink from these. I would be happy to talk about our decisions that we have made here in this Congress since we started several months ago to anybody who wants to listen. We passed the minimum wage increase out of this House with $1.3 billion in tax credits for small businesses so that they can reinvest back into their companies to keep the game going, to keep the economy going. 
   We reduced and cut in half the interest rates on student loans, which will save the average person who takes out a student loan almost $4,500 over the course of the loan. That is what the Democrats did in the first 100 hours. We increased the minimum wage. We cut student loan interest rates in half. We repealed corporate welfare by about $13 billion. We are going to take that money and we are going to invest it into alternative energy research. 
   We put PAYGO on because we are signaling that we are going to make a balanced budget a priority in this House. Got to be done. Got to be done. We have implemented some of the recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report to make the country safer, and we allowed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate down drug prices on behalf of the Medicare recipients. 
   That is what you call governing. That is what you call moving an agenda forward. And that includes making sure that these workers who work every day, work hard every day, go to work every day, work overtime, lead increases in productivity, that they can at least benefit a little bit from it. 
   And I would be happy to yield to our fearless leader from Connecticut, the fighting Irishman, Mr. Murphy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And this is not by any stretch of the imagination are we saying that workers don't need to be flexible, unions don't need to be flexible. We are now competing with the globe. And our workers now, as we have seen in large measure through the suppression of wages and everything else, this is a global workforce where just from 1985, where it was 2.5 billion people, now it is up to almost 6 billion in the global workforce. So that in and of itself increases the level of competition for our own workers, which has led to the wage issue that we have to deal with and everything else. 
   So we are not saying that unions don't need to be flexible. I come from an area of the country where we had a lot of steel mills. Now there is just one or two left of the integrated variety, and the tremendous, tremendous changes that the steelworkers have gone through. And I have a good friend, Gary Steinbeck, Madam Speaker, a friend back home who is subdistrict director for the United Steelworkers in Ohio, and the tremendous changes in work rules that the steelworkers have made in order to keep the industry  afloat. These folks are ready to sit down and figure this out, and they know that. 
   But our point is look what has been happening here. This is a chart, ``Change in Share of National Income from 2003 to 2004.'' The bottom 99 percent has had negative 2 percent change in their share of the national income; the top 1 percent has seen almost a 2 percent increase in their share of national income. This is a structure that cannot stand, man. It cannot stand, man. This cannot stay the way it is. This cannot continue. 
   You can't have this separation where the top 1 percent is increasing their share of the pie and everybody else is getting reduced. You can't have it. And so what we have tried to do here is bring some equity to the system and, since we have been in Congress, increasing the minimum wage; cutting student loan interest rates in half; investing in stem cell research to try to open up another industry where we can create jobs for our kids, the next generation; making sure we repeal the corporate welfare for the oil companies and invest that money in alternative energy sources so we can open up a new sector of our economy with research and health care and biotechnologies and alternative energy sources. We have a long-term agenda here by helping people today and open up these two new sectors. This can't go on. We can't continue like this, Mr. Murphy, and call ourselves the greatest democracy in the world. 
   And when you go around the world and you are trying to sell democracy and capitalism, that is not a very good argument. You know, that is kind of what a lot of countries in a lot of other parts of the world look like, where the top 1 percent get all the benefits, and the rest of the rest of their country doesn't see the progress. 
   Can I make one final point, because I am getting worked up. We only have 300 million people in the country. We don't have the luxury of having a billion people like they do in India. We don't have the luxury of 1.3- or 1.4 billion like they do in China. We only have 300 million people. So we need to make sure that everybody is on the field playing for us, educated, skilled, and moving the country forward. This cannot stand, man.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It cannot stand, man. It cannot stand. I totally agree with you. 
   The fact that our friends, and can you imagine our friends on the other side of the aisle, our Republican friends, who are deficit hawks, and they are still talking about it. It is hilarious to hear, Madam Speaker, the contradictory aspects of their words and their deeds. There is still a lot of talk about, you know, being a deficit hawk and balancing the budget. 
   It was the Republican party, Madam Speaker, that started the Medicare prescription drug bill. They originally said it was $400 billion, then it was $700 billion, and then it was a trillion. And the night we voted on it at 3 in the morning, it was a $400 billion bill. That was a good deal. Then we find out months later it was actually a trillion dollars, and that the actuaries that knew it was going to cost a trillion dollars, they weren't allowed to tell anybody. 
   So this Congress voted on legislation without all of the facts, and a major fact was the cost. But the point here is our friends not only passed that bill without telling us all of the information, they also put, as you said, a provision in there that explicitly would not allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate down drug prices on behalf of the Medicare recipients. They didn't leave it ambiguous, they stated in the bill you're not allowed to negotiate down drug prices on behalf of all of these millions of seniors who want to participate in this new drug benefit. 
   Now did it have anything to do with the pharmaceutical lobby being up here so much and donating all kinds of money, I will leave that for the American people to decide. But the fact of the matter is, within the first 100 hours that we got in, we changed that provision. Once we passed it out of here, we need to get it through the Senate and hopefully the President will sign it. But in our legislation we allowed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate down drug prices. 
   We hear a lot about the free market, but what is a better representation of the free market than allowing all these consumers to join together and negotiate down drug prices or anything else on behalf of the recipients.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. To further our point, this is real median household incomes as to why we need to do this. The Free Choice Act that we are going to pass out of this House tomorrow, it is not for the employers who treat their workers well which most are. It is for a few people that are obviously getting mistreated and they want to join together. Now that seems to me a basic principle of our democratic society. 
   This is real median incomes from 2000. In 2000, they were $47,500. In 2005, it is $46,300, a decline. This is what we are talking about. 
   Now you can either be in a position of power and say that is fine and you are not going to do anything about it, or you are going to be in a position of power and say we are going to try to help, we are going to try to fix this. Do we have all the answers, no. But we are going to try to raise the minimum wage so this person may get a pay raise. We are going to pass the Employee Free Choice Act, so maybe if you are having a problem and want to join together and try to affect this situation, you can. 
   We are not saying you have to, we are saying you can. 
   And if you happen to be this same family who has seen a decline and you have a kid in school and you are taking out loans, we are going to cut the interest rate loan in half to try to close this gap a little bit because we are in a position of responsibility. We are not here to give away the store, but we are here to say there are issues where we can help people. 
   You know what, if we have to ask somebody who makes a million dollars a year to help us do this, to invest in education, invest in the stem cell research and invest in alternative energy resources, we have to do it. 
   As a politician, as a Member of Congress, I would love to go to all of my constituents and say you all get a tax cut, and we are going to lower your tuition costs, we are going to provide health care for poor kids, we are going to retrain workers, and we are going to build roads and bridges, we are going to provide for the defense of the country to make all this possible, and we are going to have stable financial markets, but we are also going to give you a tax cut. We are going to put a court system in place so that we have the rule of law. 
   You know, one of the most expensive things to do is have a justice system with police and sheriff departments and courts and judges and attorneys and public defenders and prosecutors to make this whole thing go, to enforce contract law. That is all expensive stuff. All we are saying is we are trying to keep this thing rolling, man. We have had a pretty good thing going on. We just want to keep it going, and you can't see the top 1 percent do well and the bottom 99 percent, as I was showing in the earlier chart, not do well, actually see a decline in income by 2 percent. 
   So what we need to do is move forward in a very comprehensive way, not in a radical way, but some of the stuff we have already done.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. There was a funny article in, I think it was Roll Call when we first got in how frightened the banks were about the whole student loan deal.     
   Because we have been talking about possibly doing just direct student loans, here is the government money, here is a student, you give him the money, he takes it and he pays you back with a little bit of interest, boom, done. That sounds pretty efficient to me. 
   Well, the banks are upset because they were worried that if we changed the system as it was, that they were not going to make money, the banks, thanks to the student loans. And I am sorry, but we are not here to make you money. You want to talk about welfare, you want to talk about getting on the public dole, my God, you go out and compete with everybody else. We are not here to pay you 6 percent or 8 percent on a student loan. We are here to get a kid into college that cannot afford it otherwise. That is our responsibility, and this kid is going to get a degree and then a master's degree, and he is going to help us create this new economy. 
   Here is what we are talking about with cutting student loan interest rates in half, the stem cell bill for stem cell research, and alternative energy, repealing the corporate welfare. 
   We have got to create new industries. Whether you vote for the free trade agreements or not, we are in a global economy, and we are competing with China and India and the rest of the world. As we see some of the traditional manufacturing move offshore, some legitimately, some not so legitimately, because of what China's doing with their currency, we have got to come up with what the new industries are. So what we have tried to do is invest in the stem cell research and invest in alternative energies, the future job creators, and then also make sure that college is affordable by increasing the Pell Grant and making sure we cut student loan interest rates in half so kids will go to college and then have these long-term sectors of the economy that are growing that they can move into. 
   But if we do not have healthy, educated citizens moving in, getting educated, moving into college and helping us create this economy, all this is for naught. We need a lot more people creating a new economy than we did 50 years ago. 
   My grandfather worked in a steel mill. He went to high school until 10th or 11th grade. That was another world ago, and unfortunately in this institution, if we start playing the same game we have been playing for 50 years, and I think both sides, and I think we have recognized this because the minimum wage bill that we passed had $1.3 billion in tax cuts for small businesses to reinvest back into their companies. 
   So the idea of if you cut taxes for the rich, they are going to invest back in the United States and create jobs, that is done. We know that. They get a tax cut, and they invest it in Asia, okay. It is your money; do what you want with it. But let us not pretend they are going to somehow build a factory in Niles, Ohio, and hire a thousand people. Not going to happen. 
   And the Democratic philosophy, old one, not the one as we know from what we have already done here, was if you write a bigger check, somehow the problem is going to go away. 
   I think the king of leadership that the Speaker is providing, and Steny Hoyer and Blue Dogs and Jim Clyburn and some of the newer members in the 30-something Working Group is there is a middle way here. There is a way where we can raise the minimum wage and give small business tax cuts. We can cut student loan interest rates in half and do stem cell research. We can repeal corporate welfare that is going to energy companies who seem to be doing okay, they do not really need our $13 billion, and put that in alternative energy research. 
   There is a middle way here that we are trying to negotiate that I think is 21st century government.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I agree, and there are so many fields that we need to explore. It is nice to say, well, everyone is going to go to college and do this and do that, has my boy not done well, but there are a lot of other things that I think have great dignity and great contributions to our economy. 
   By the year 2010, we are going to need 200,000 welders that pay pretty well, and in my community I met with a vocational school. They are starting at 13, 14, 15 bucks an hour. People told me a story of a guy making 30 bucks an hour as a welder with full health care benefits. 
   So as we pursue this college, we also have to remember the community college pipeline, the vocational school pipeline for truck drivers and welders and a lot of these other industries that we continue to figure out how does this company, as China is expanding, how do we export and sell them something and grow our employment base here. 
   So there are a lot of different things that I think we need to talk about that the approach is so much different from what we are doing than our friends on the other side.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. There is no question, and the more you get into this, the more you see, and again it is not that government is the only answer, but I will give you an example. 
   We had today in our Health Appropriations Committee, there is a tremendous nursing shortage, health care shortage, and there are some programs that will help nurses with low-interest loans. If you are going to go into nursing, you get these low-interest loans to try to get minority and low-income nurses and health care workers into the field. So there is another program that will go in and try to recruit and get people in and help them pay for it in order for us to get nurses and health care workers in the underserved areas. 
   That program, I think this is the one that was zeroed out by the President in his budget. Now, does that make any sense at all? We have a nursing shortage, and we have tremendous health issues for our kids and poor families that we need. As I said earlier, we have only got 300 million people. We need them all on the field playing against China and India, that we are not going to make this little bit of investment into making sure that we get health care workers in underserved areas? 
   The health care system is already getting skewed to the suburbs where a lot of these health care systems can make money in the suburbs, and the level of charity care in the cities are going through the roof. 
   So it does not make any sense not to make those investments because the yield that we are going to get is going to be tremendous. Not only are you getting someone that otherwise would be less productive to be more productive, they are in a field of nursing. They are going to make decent bucks, going to pay taxes. Their kids are probably going to go to college. I mean, this cycle continues. 
   Let us get it going in a positive way, not dissimilar to what is happening, like you mentioned, with the college tuition costs. Four hundred thousand kids in this country qualify and have the grades to go to college but do not because they feel they cannot afford it or they can afford it, one or the other, but either way it is an impediment for 400,000 Americans going into college. Now, would that not be great? 
   These are the kind of issues that I think we need to fix, and to ask a millionaire to pay a little bit more, I think, is a lot better than borrowing it from China, which is what we are doing now, and there is a real decision that we need to make. 
   We are talking about in our committee about streamlining the SCHIP program, you know, like when you qualify for free and reduced lunch, you just sign your name, how many members of your family and what your income is, and you qualify for free and reduced lunch. Well, we want to do that for SCHIP so we make sure we are covering all our kids, that they have health care. 
   You can argue about the situation of parents and everything else, but you do not blame the kids for that, and you make sure they have got the kind of health care that they need. And how do we make sure that my goal, and I do not know how long this is going to last, but my goal is to make sure we have nurses and doctors and clinics in some of these schools. You have some of these schools where 80, 90 percent of the kids qualify for free and reduced lunch, qualify for SCHIP. Let us put a clinic in there and tie it to the health care program, tie it to the wellness program, make sure these kids are getting the kind of attention that they need, and in all the while, make sure that we demand as elected leaders and leaders in our community, demand from the parents to send your kids to school ready to learn, and you as a parent do your share, too. 
   This is not a one-way ticket where we are going to do everything, or the teachers are somehow going to have to do everything, but both sides. We need to be innovative. We need to create these new ideas and implement them and reform government and make proper investments in a balanced way, but the parents and the schools need to also step up, and the parents especially. The basic fundamental structure of our society is the family. They need to step up, send their kids ready to learn, and provide their own personal leadership. 
   So I yield to my friend for some closing remarks.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I agree with you. One more, with the SCHIP thing, I get excited about this stuff because it is really cool, but with the SCHIP thing you will fill out your form, you do your free and reduced lunch, you will do your SCHIP deal and also start to get letters from the Department of Education at third, fourth grade as to what Pell Grant number you will get as far as how much you will be able to receive from Pell Grant based on your income. So these kids, this is the new way of doing things. This is you do not just spend the money. You change the psychology of the kid and the family. 
   If a kid in third grade who would never think of going to college starts getting this Pell Grant, you qualify for $4,000 or $5,000 a year in a Pell Grant when you go to college, not if, when, you know that kind of kid all of a sudden is now thinking about college or trade or something.     
   So we are trying to do this all in the same way. And I hope that we recognize, I think as Nancy Pelosi has, Madam Speaker, that America was great because we were the ones who wanted to be the best at everything. So why don't we have the best health  care? Why don't we have the best education? And let's get down to business and start doing it. 
   Any questions for Members who are listening, www.speaker.gov/30something is our Web site. E-mail is 30SomethingDems@mail.house.gov. And I have got to confess, I did not know your mom is Polish. I just figured you were 100 percent Irish.

   The thing is there's like hundreds of people on the other side of the aisle who are taking earmarks, who feel like that it's better that they make the decision for their own district as to where the money should be spent or some bureaucrat in Washington makes the decision as to where the money is spent. Somebody's spending the money. Now, it's either the elected Representative who's going to spend the money or it's going to be someone here in DC who's going to spend the money and has no idea of what the dynamics of the district are, what your long-term economic development plans are, what the health and safety welfare needs are of your district. 
   So I think it's best in a democracy for the elected Representative, who gets to have meetings in their office with different constituents, as to who will decide where this money is spent. 
   Now, is the autism center in Youngstown, Ohio, pork? I got three-hundred-and-some-thousand for that. Is the water line in a poor community to make sure that we have clean water, is that pork? 
   I love it when the Members from the western part of the country come to the House floor and talk about all this government spending. You know, in California, in Arizona, there are congressional districts that would not even exist if it wasn't for a Federal investment. There are congressional districts that they're in a desert. How do you think the water gets from the Colorado River to your congressional district? Through osmosis? No. There is Federal investment that is invested in these different congressional districts, you know, the Colorado River Basin Project and all of these different projects that bring water to your district and your constituents. 
   So I think it is absolutely absurd for people to come to the House floor, and we've done exactly what we said we were going to do. We made this process transparent. There's nobody here that thinks you should be able to hide something. So now when you make an investment or you claim an earmark, your name goes on it, and it says Rich Center for Autism in Youngstown, Ohio, at Youngstown State University, Congressman TIM RYAN, 17th District.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. The issue here is that the earmarks are a very small percentage of the Federal budget. All of these bills have been bipartisan. If you look at all of the appropriations bills that have passed out of the House, there has been a significant number of Republicans who have joined with the Democrats to make these investments, especially Members of the Appropriations Committee that have looked at these issues very carefully to make these investments in a bipartisan way. 
   The energy bill, of which our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, have derided us and it's a Democratic this and a Democratic that, 314 votes; 314 votes, which is 70 or 80 Republican Members of this body have joined with us to try to increase CAFE standards, make investments in alternative energy, make investments in the middle America and the Midwest. This is on a bipartisan basis. 
   So it seems like those folks who come to the floor seem to be on the fringe level of the party that they're talking about these things. But I think it's important for us to talk about some of the investments that we have made here. 
   There has been a significant shift in priorities. Now, we haven't come anywhere close to achieving what we have wanted to achieve since we have taken over. We don't have 60 votes in the Senate, and the Republicans have done a good job of blocking a lot of our legislation that we've tried to pass. 
   The President has vetoed SCHIP, which is the State Children's Health Insurance Program, that we wanted to provide 10 million middle-class kids with health care, and the President vetoed it twice. And the fringe Republicans, many have joined with us. RAY LAHOOD, STEVE LATOURETTE, a lot of good Members of Congress have joined with us to try to override that veto, but the President was able to sustain it. 
   So we asked to cover health care for 10 million kids, $35 billion over 5 years. President said we're spending too much money. Turned around within days and asked for $200 billion more for Iraq that we're going to borrow from China. And so some of the investments that we're trying to make, I think it's important for the American people to know what we have done.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We've raised the minimum wage for the first time since 1997. We've cut student loan interest rates in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, which will save and increase the Pell Grant by $1,000 over the next 4 or 5 years. We will save the average student or their parents, whoever's footing the bill, $4,400 over the course of their loan that they take out. Those are significant investments to the middle class. 
   We're going to fix the AMT, which would come in and zap 23 or 24 million people. 
   But I think it's important that we share with the American people, Mr. Speaker, the investments that we have made here, that are different than what the President wanted us to do, and we can go through this. 
   But medical research, $607 million above the President's request. That's a lot of money, $607 million to research Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's and diabetes. Now, I think the American people want us to work together to try to fund some basic research.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, it's interesting that one of the gentlemen, Mr. Speaker, that was down here complaining about earmarks just minutes ago prior to our getting down here, and we are not here to play gotcha but we are here to reveal what has happened here, in this bill loaded with earmarks, loaded with all this pork, one of the gentlemen down here, Mr. Speaker, had requested 20 earmarks worth $38 million but turns around and comes to the House floor and is critical of the Rich Center for Autism in Youngstown and dam safety projects and after-school programs and some of the other districts that are here and calling it pork and in one of the instances was trying to in some way disparage the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) in his project that he had that was named after him and the same gentleman is now supportive of the Thomas Road Improvement Program that is now under way that his predecessor, Representative Bill Thomas, submitted with his own name on it for the project but yet comes down and is critical. 
   So our point is not to play gotcha. Our point is to say that Members of Congress should be able to direct a certain amount, and it's only a small percentage of the budget. I don't even know if it's .5 percent of the entire budget.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We have got more here. The gentleman from California, the previous gentleman, who just made fun of us for all the earmarks, had 20 earmarks worth $38 million and is supporting one now named after the former Chair of the Ways and Means Committee. 
   Another gentleman down here that was from Michigan got press releases, and you will love this one, $3 million for an extended cold weather clothing system through the Army. He was just down here making fun of everybody, and he's requesting thermal underwear. And it's not funny because the reason we are here is to make sure that we are getting this all out. And for Members of Congress to come question the Rich Center for Autism. And I know Mr. Altmire has a lot of issues. We have all got issues.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. You know, obviously there have been situations decades ago where, you know, everyone was spending too much money. And for us to put in the PAYGO rules that say you've got to pay for every dime you spend one way or the other I think is a significant step in the right direction. Nobody here wants to continue what has happened over the last 6 years. 
   And when you look at what's happened, over $3 trillion in debt has been borrowed from China, Japan and OPEC countries. Our friends on the other side, when they were in charge, raised the debt limit five times in order to go out and borrow more money. And we see the situation that we're in now. So we're trying to, slowly but surely, rein all of this in and make very strategic investments. 
   And I would say, Mr. Speaker, that you can go to the Web sites for the Speaker and our caucus and what we're doing. We're making investments into alternative energy, research and development, so we can open up new sectors of the economy. We're making investments in education, saving the average family who takes out loans and utilizes the Pell Grants $4,400 over the course of that loan. That's a middle-class tax cut. What we're going to do with the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, we're going to prevent 23 million people from getting a tax increase next year. And that's a middle-class tax cut. These are people making $50,000 to $75,000 a year. We're going to prevent that from happening. 
   Significant steps in criminal justice. Cops on the beat. In communities like Youngstown, Ohio, the city doesn't have the tax base to keep hiring more and more cops, so it's harder to develop your economy if you don't have security. So, these are the kinds of investments that we're making.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And I would just like to say, go to our Web site. Look at what we've done for K-12, student aid, rural development, the farm bill. All of the things that we've passed out of here have been investments, actually met the President's budget numbers, so it's just a shift in priorities. 
   So, I'm saying I think we've made significant progress this year, and we hope to expand it next year. 
   And with that, Mr. Meek, I yield back to you.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate that. And it is time to wrap it up. And I think as we were home over the July 4th break and as we were meeting with our constituents and going to parades and getting out and about and reconnecting with our district, one of the issues we heard, obviously, is gas but also just the squeeze that families are feeling now. And one of the reasons we need to get Iraq wrapped up and get our troops back home is because it is costing us $12 billion a month in Iraq. And if we continue to go down this road with supplementals of $180 billion and continuing to go down that road, those are investments that we can't make here in the United States. 
   And I think a lot of people would say, Mr. Meek, that we have got to make investments back here in the United States of America so that we can build roads and bridges here in the United States as opposed to roads and bridges in Iraq. And that's one of the key issues here. 
   I know the gentleman from Connecticut wants to say a few words. But I think it's important for us to realize there is a direct connection between what we are doing in Iraq and what we are unable to do because of the budget. 
   One of the issues that we're talking about too is what has happened to our budget here in the United States. And just a few short years ago in 2000, January of 2001, we had a $5.6 trillion surplus, and after President Bush got sworn in up until today, we have a $3.2 trillion deficit. That's an $8.8 trillion swing, and that is part of the reason we have a weak dollar, and that is part of the reason that oil is so expensive. So we've got to get our house in order here. 
   So we talk about the war in Iraq and about how we need to finish it and honor our troops and support our veterans and make sure we have health care and whatnot, but we have got to balance the budget here in the United States and make those investments here, put people to work here in the United States building roads, bridges, infrastructure, water lines, sewer lines, septic tanks, broadband. 
   I yield to my friend from Connecticut.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If the gentleman would yield, if you think about the amount of money that we have spent in Iraq, that we are going to go and fix the Middle East and make it different and the money that it costs, almost $1 trillion that we have spent there already and the projection of $3 trillion when you start talking about taking care of all the vets that are going to come back with traumatic brain injury, amputees. When you factor that cost in, Joe Stiglitz, the Nobel winning economist, says $3 trillion it's going to cost. 
   And I think it's important for the American people to realize that if we had made different decisions early on in this decade that those billions and billions and billions of dollars could have been invested into alternative energy sources, could have been invested into loan guarantees for nuclear plants, could have been invested in coal to liquid or whatever. Pick your issue. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I just want to make the point that I was there with you, talking to the chairman of the Transportation Committee, and the point is it's not just airline fares, it's not just reducing from $4 a gallon down because of the millions of gallons that we could just take out of the oil reserve that is just sitting here in our country, and there are several of them. Just take the oil out. 
   Everyone's talking about drilling. Take the oil out of where it is right now. Just turn the spigot on. Just turn that spigot on and let that oil flow. 
   My point is that when you do this, it's going to have an effect because the airline companies are laying people off, just today in Toledo, and all over the country. 
   So this is about making sure that we have jobs in the country. Airline pilots, machinists. The whole nine yards. So I wanted to put a little texture into that argument, a little context in that argument, support it even more to talk about jobs here in American.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think it is important. Here is the history. Not just the short-term history, kind of what the gentleman from Connecticut Mr. Murphy just went over, but that long history. We have been since we got in trying to push legislation on every single issue that is going to help middle-class families in the United States of America. 
   We raised the minimum wage for the first time since 1997. The new increase will go here in just a few more weeks. On July 24th there will be another minimum wage increase for those people earning the minimum wage. Some people have two minimum wage jobs, who will get another $28 a week, which isn't a lot, but with high gas prices it is a lot more than what would have happened if the Democrats were not here. 
   If you look at the investments we made in biofuels already through the farm bill and the alternative energy that Mr. Murphy already mentioned, some economists are saying this is keeping gas down 50 cents a gallon more now because of the biofuel blends that are coming in. 
   If you look at what just happened last week when you would take your kid or a student was going to try to take out a loan to go to school, and the interest rate was 6 percent instead of 6.8 percent, that is because the Democrats are in Congress and pushed that bill. That did not happen when the Republicans were in charge here. 
   Madam Speaker, we did that. Democrats did that. So when you are talking about who is on the side of the person going to the pump at $4 gas, it is the Democrats. We are against the oil companies. We are against President Bush. And if you look at the last 8 years, who would you rather have fixing the problem? President Bush and Dick Cheney and the oil companies, or the Democrats, who increased the minimum wage, invested in alternative energy, and made the kind of commitments on student loans and education that we have made. There is a clear difference here. 
   And here is all the land that the oil companies have to drill on: 102 percent of Colorado, 130 percent of Kansas, twice the size of Illinois, 2 1/2 times the State of Ohio. Go drill. Go drill now. You have the leases. You have picked out the land yourself. Go and drill it. But, no, you want to go up to ANWR and drill, a small little piece. All we are saying is you have the leases. We are talking about 20 years down the  line. Even if you started drilling here in ANWR or anywhere else, 20 years. Speaker Pelosi is saying, take it out of the oil reserve that we have right now, and the President is saying no. 
   So do you want to get oil into the market now, Madam Speaker, or not? It is pretty clear. There are people in our communities that are hurting, and we have a short-term plan and a medium plan and a long-range plan that is being fought tooth and nail by the oil companies.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And save 5 cents a gallon. This is about people that sent us down here to make mature, responsible decisions, not the issue de jour, what is going to rattle will public. We have got a responsibility. 
   We only have a couple of percent of the whole reserves in the world, and we consume 25 percent of the daily energy in the world. And for us to come here and say if we just drill, which we are saying, go ahead and drill. That is fine. Drill now. Here is all the places, 6 million acres you have. Go ahead and do what you have to do and make your money. But we are going in another direction, because we are not going to rely on imported oil from the Middle East to solve this problem. We are going to rely on the Midwest and the ingenuity in the country.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. One of the provisions for taking this right out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and pumping it into the market is it stays in the United States market. What they are drilling now, wherever they are drilling, doesn't necessarily mean the oil they are taking out is staying here in the United States, all of it. So there are a lot of issues here that we need to deal with. 
   But, Mr. Meek, I just want to get nostalgic for 30 seconds with you, if I could, before we close up. I remember four or five years ago when the whole 30-Something Group started and we started on the issue of Social Security privatization accounts. Congressman Meek and I started coming down here on that issue. Then-Minority Leader Pelosi asked us to come down here, and we got into the nuts and bolts of the privatization accounts. And it was 60-40 people in our generation were for it, until we got into the nuts and bolts. 
   We began to explain night in and night out on this floor, and throughout the country Members would go home and started to talk about Social Security privatization, putting this social insurance program in jeopardy, and we ended up killing the President's privatization account scheme that he was going to set up. 
   What I am saying to Members here is if we just continue to get the facts out on this, that there is oil, 80 percent of the known reserves, the oil companies have the permits to drill it, we passed legislation that says use the permit or lose it so we can get people in there who want to drill, and we just keep talking about that, and what we are going to do with taking the oil that is already there in the reserve and put it into the market, there is no doubt that our plan in the short-term is better and we have already made the investments in the long term that I know will be better.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I move to strike the last word, Mr. Chairman. 
   First, I would like to lend my support to my chairman of this subcommittee, and also Mr. Hobson, for their great work on this bill. I think it's a great bill. I think you have really shown the rest of us in Congress how a committee can and should work together for the good of the country. 
   I would like to address a few issues that have been brought up, not necessarily related to the bill at hand, with regard to spending. And I am glad to see a couple of my friends on the Republican side have found some religion over the past few months. These were the same Members who were here over the past 6 years, Republican control of the House, Republican control of the Senate, Republican White House, and ran up $4 trillion in debt for the United States of America. We didn't hear boo from them while all this was going on. And the biggest problem has been most of that money was borrowed from foreign countries, Japan, China, OPEC countries; $4 trillion mostly borrowed from foreign countries by the Republican Party. 
   They've also mentioned that there has been stress on families. Well, I'm glad they finally came around to understand that, too. And some of the things that we have already done, Mr. Chairman, have addressed those issues: $700 increase in the Pell Grant, that will relieve some pressure for families; student loans rates being cut in half, that will reduce pressure on families; increase in the minimum wage, which begins this summer; increased SCHIP coverage; increased coverage for women's health care needs. These are issues that are going to relieve the pressure that most American families are feeling, and it took a Democratic Congress to implement that. 
   Now, to the heart and soul of this bill. I think this bill does two things, Mr. Chairman. One, this is a national security issue. What Mr. Hobson and Mr. Visclosky have done here is increase the security of this country by reducing our dependence on foreign oil, by increasing our funding for the ``loose nukes'' program so that we can be safer. And this dovetails perfectly into what we've already been doing here with the Homeland Security bill, where we're going to have 3,000 more Border Patrol agents, where we are going to have technology for our ports so we are making sure we cover the cargo in. This bill fits directly in with that. Money for our first responders, COPS program. This all fits together as a piece of a national security bill. 
   And this bill also, I think equal to the national security provisions, this is a bill about economic development. The problems we have been having over the last 30 years is that wages have been stagnant. And Rose in Illinois and some of the other people that my friend from Texas have mentioned have had stagnant wages for 30 years. This bill makes the kind of investments that the study from the National Academy of Sciences recommended, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' The head of that study was the former CEO of Lockheed Martin. And he noted, along with a very distinguished panel, that the connection between research and development and growth cannot be understated, especially research in the physical sciences. And when you look at what this bill does, 3,500 researchers are funded through this bill; $93 million for research with hybrid cars, $49 million for advanced combustion research, $48 million for materials research for  fuel efficient cars, $23 million for fuels technology, $708 million for coal energy research. 
   This is an economic development bill. When we began to fund NASA, that created thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs in science and engineering. This bill will do the same thing. It will give Rose in Illinois and all of those other folks who have had stagnant wages an opportunity to go into a field that is growing with public research and private research. This is a jobs bill, this is an economic development bill for a lot of the regions who have suffered under the global economy. 
   I appreciate what the chairman has done, I appreciate what the ranking member from the great State of Ohio has done with this bill. This is a jobs bill and this is a national security bill. I urge its passage, and I urge that this amendment go down.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for his fine arguments, and all of the gentlemen and ladies who have made their presentation here tonight. And I would also like to thank the Appropriations Committee for the Transportation and HUD bill. This was passed out of committee in a bipartisan way unanimously with Democrats and Republicans. So, again, we come to the floor to have a discussion with a very small group of fringe Members from the other side, Mr. Chairman, so that we can continue to get fiscal responsibility lectures from the Republican Party. 
   Now, getting lectures on fiscal responsibility from the Republican Party is like getting lectures on animal welfare from Michael Vick. It really doesn't have any credibility. It really doesn't have any credibility. 
   So we need to look at what the two different approaches here. And I am not going to be long because we have a lot of votes tonight, and we want to get the Members out of here as soon as possible. 
   There is a difference in philosophy, and the bottom line is this: There are certain things that individual members of our society cannot do. One of them is build a road. Another is build a bridge. And others that we have already had discussions about are going to college and being able to afford college and making sure some families have loans to go to college. And that is what we are here for. That is what we are here for. We are here to do the things that individual citizens cannot do for themselves, and that is what is included in this bill. 
   We have had talks about trillion-dollar train wrecks coming up, and I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona stating the fact that, yes, the party in power over the past 6 years, $3 trillion was borrowed primarily from China, Japan, and OPEC countries.     
   And our friends on the other side had to go to the Treasury Department and ask for the debt limit to be raised so that they could go out and borrow more money. So the lectures have all been given and we've heard them, and we'll probably hear them again later this week and we'll probably hear them again next week. 
   One of the Members mentioned entitlement spending. It was the Republican Party, Mr. Chairman, who passed the largest increase in entitlement spending with the Medicare part D. And you want to talk about fiscal irresponsibility; they passed it without even giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services the ability to negotiate down the drug prices. That is the platinum standard for fiscal irresponsibility. 
   So we move forward. What would this cut do? What would this 1 percent cut? 
   And as the gentleman from New York stated earlier a few of the programs, I think it's important that the Members  know what exactly is going to be cut here. Safety belt performance grants, going to be cut. Occupant protection incentive grants, going to be cut. State traffic safety information system improvement grants, going to be cut. All of the investments in future growth. 
   In aviation, the inspectors, the budget for inspectors in aviation for this country will be cut under this amendment. There will be less inspectors inspecting the maintenance of our airplanes than there would normally be if this amendment doesn't pass. 
   Transportation, Housing and Urban Development programs. Airport safety grants under this amendment will be cut. There'll be less money for airports. $6.9 billion in this bill for air traffic services. That will be cut. 
   Continue on. Rail, passenger rail grants, those will be cut. Improvement and safety grants, those will be cut. 
   This is the kicker. Housing for the elderly. That will be cut under this amendment. Housing for the elderly will be cut under this amendment. 
   And we don't say that these are going to be cuts just because they're going to be cuts, and we're not saying we're spending money on these programs just to spend money. This is the difference. 
   I think this amendment, Mr. Chairman, is very simple and it sounds good. Why can't we just cut 1 percent across the top of this budget? 
   There's changes going on in the world that make it a little more complex than we would normally think it is. I'll give you some examples. Traveling on our Nation's highways has grown by 94 percent from 1980 to 2005, from 1.5 trillion miles to 3 trillion miles. Of course you're going to need to spend a little bit more money if you have more people on the roads and you have more roads. 
   Now, the congestion has resulted in 2.3 billion extra gallons of fuel being burnt. That means $794 per commuter. Now, there's no way a commuter can get the $300 tax cut that they got a few years ago and go out and somehow fix the congestion problem. There's no way to do that. 
   We had this same discussion with brownfields. An individual citizen can't clean up a brownfield. You need the Federal investment. 
   And when you're talking about elderly housing, the elderly population in the United States, Mr. Chairman, is going to grow over the next 25 years by millions and millions and millions of seniors, so it's important that we make these investments. 
   Another program that will be cut is housing for the disabled. 49.7 million Americans live with a disability. Forty-three percent of those are women. Forty percent of men 65 and older have disabilities. If they had the money to pay for it themselves, they would pay for it and we wouldn't need to be here. 
   We're making these bipartisan investments, Republicans and Democrats, on the Appropriations Committee to help move the country forward. And one of the key approaches that we've had when we started this year, under the leadership of Chairman Obey, is to figure out what the world's going to look like in 10 years so that the investments we make today will have our society ready to compete in the global economy 10 years from now, 20 years from now. 
   And the bottom line is, this bill here reflects the values of this country, passed by Democrats and Republicans in the committee. And those 1 percent cuts may not mean a whole lot to me, may not mean a whole lot to the chairman, but if you're an adult with a disability, elderly senior, if you're a disabled citizen of this country, if you use the aviation system. 
   How do you fix the aviation system by yourself? You need to do that together, and that's the investment that we make here. So I appreciate the difference in philosophy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman and also want to lend my support to this fine piece of legislation. I also thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). This is something that many areas of our country need. Those areas that once thrived in the Industrial Age and are trying to recreate their economy need the kind of early capital that this bill is going to put into these small firms. 
   The gentleman from Pennsylvania who was here earlier, Mr. Altmire, and I are trying to create a Technology Belt between Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown, and Pittsburgh. We have many early startup companies that need the venture capital that they are going to be able to access, in particular in the New Market Venture Capital Program, which will allow low-income areas to expand the reach for more capital to go in there, also the office of Angel Investment, where we have public-private partnerships so that those early startup companies will have that early capital that they need. Tax cuts for the top 1 percent don't get to these businesses. We need that early capital in order to grow them 
   In Ohio, for example, we have a company in Cleveland called BioEnterprise.  Over the past 5 years they have brought in over $500 million in venture capital, 80 percent of it from outside of the State of Ohio. They employ 20,000 people in northeast Ohio. The hardest thing for them to do is to get that early venture capital. That's what this bill does. 
   So I want to thank the gentlewoman, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio and also the gentleman from Pennsylvania for putting this together. We are giving life and hope and opportunity to those areas of the country that are trying to retool their economy. This is going to allow us to do this, whether it's medical device technology, any kind of medical technology that may be coming up, advanced manufacturing. These are the kinds of programs that we need. 
   So I want to thank everyone again for putting so much effort into this bill and being so thoughtful. These are the kinds of things that are going to help us create a strong, vibrant economy in the United States and in the industrial Midwest.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, and I also thank our friend, the dean of the delegation, Mr. Regula. 
   I would just add for a minute my thoughts and memories of Mr. Gillmor. I graduated from Bowling Green State University, so I knew of Mr. Gillmor before I even got into politics, because as many of the Members from Ohio know, he is a legend in northwest Ohio, especially in Bowling Green and especially with the Bowling Green Young Republicans. He was very familiar. 
   I remember, as we all do, taking the little trolley back and forth from the office buildings over here, and for some reason our conversations always ended up talking about Ohio State football. Mr. Gillmor loved the Buckeyes. He loved going to the Ohio State football games. I remember being in the State senate seeing him at the Ohio State football games. That is just the kind of guy he was. He loved football, he loved his country, he loved his constituents, he loved this institution, and he certainly will be missed. 
   So from the citizens of the 17th District, we just want to thank Mr. Gillmor for his service and send our condolences and our prayers to his family and his children and his wife, Karen. And also to say, as Mr. Boehner, the minority leader said, he was a gentleman. He was a gentle man. In the midst of all the chaos of Washington, DC, his silence and his gentleness were very refreshing, and he will be missed.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. While we are hitting on the war, I think it is important for us to maybe go back and reevaluate  why the Democrats have the position of redeploy out, wind this thing down, and I think it is important for us to go through some of the numbers. 
   Mr. Meek had already mentioned the number of troops killed. We have had another nine that were killed in the last couple of days, and our hearts and prayers go out to all the families that have been affected by this and who have lost soldiers over there. The most heartbreaking thing we have to do is go to these funerals and see a 20-year old kid who has been married for a year with a 7-month-old son or daughter. 
   It is heartbreaking when we don't even know what winning is. Ask the President. What is winning this war? What does that mean now? We can't really get an answer from the President. 
   But a couple of things, why we think the President and his policies have made this situation worse. The number of insurgents in Iraq in 2003 was 5,000. The number of insurgents in Iraq in March of 2007 is 70,000, all Sunni, mostly Sunni. What I love now is the President is starting to say, Mr. Speaker, ``bin Laden is now saying we need to attack Americans in Iraq. See why we got to stay there?'' 
   No kidding. Right? No kidding. Bin Laden? Of course. We have 150,000 soldiers in a war zone. Of course, bin Laden is going to say go hit them over there. 
   But the problem is that we are creating more terrorists. And if you are trying to win the hearts and minds of people, okay, the number of civilian casualties in Iraq since the invasion, estimates range from 54,000 to 76,000. Those are innocent civilians in Iraq. Do you think we are going to be able to go over there and win their hearts and minds if we are killing innocent civilians with the bombs we are dropping? This needs to be won diplomatically. When it needs to be won diplomatically, it becomes very difficult when you have 50,000 to 75,000 civilian casualties. 
   One more thing, and then I will wrap my portion up here. The average daily number of daily attacks by insurgents in July of 2003 was 16 daily attacks in 2003. The number of daily attacks by insurgents between November of 2006 and February of 2007, 149. From 16 to 149. We are aggravating the situation. We are making it worse, and the surge is making it worse. 
   I yield back to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If I could just say, as we have increased the number, the incubation that a lot of our friends on the other side have supported, where more and more not only insurgents, but as Ms. Wasserman Schultz has said, more and more al Qaeda, more and more terrorists; so if you have a situation where you only have, for the sake of the example, 100 al Qaeda, and then we have the war, and now we have 1,000 al Qaeda, and then the President says well, we need to fight them over there or they are going to come over here, we have 900 more coming gunning for the United States because of the inability to actually execute this war.     
   To say we are making progress, and we have some amazing ability to find some of this information out, the number of hours per day of electricity in Baghdad prior to the war was between 16 and 24 hours a day. Now in May of 2007, the number of hours per day average 5.6 hours per day. That is feeding the problem that we are having over there. 
   Production of barrels per day prior to the war, 2.5 million. Production of barrels per day in May 2007, 2.16 million, so almost 400,000 less than prewar production. 
   Unemployment rate in Iraq went from 20 up to 40 percent in December of 2006. This problem has increased. I know our friends on the other side of the aisle continue to try to tell us there are improvements, but the statistics tell us otherwise.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. All we really have to do is talk to some of the soldiers who are over there and who have come back, which I'm sure most of us have. And when they explain what's going on on the ground, it's mind-boggling to think in cities of 140, 150, 160, 170,000 we've got American troops, for example, on the west side of the city, with 1,000 Iraqi troops on the west side of the city, and 1,000 on the east side and 1,000 Iraqis; 2,000, 4,000 total for the whole city, 2,000 of the 4,000 being American. How are you going to control a city of 170,000 people? And a surge of an extra 1,000 or 2,000 is not going to make a difference. It's going to make it worse. 
   This surge is not the first time we've tried this. This is like the fourth time, and every time that we've tried a surge in certain areas there has been an increase in the number of daily attacks, not a decrease, because it incites the area, and you still don't have enough. 
   And we've all said from the beginning, if we went in there with 3- or 400,000 troops, where we were able, after the statue fell, to secure the State, to secure the country of Iraq, that would have been a different story, and all the looting was going on and the museums and everything, and then Secretary Rumsfeld said, well, they're just blowing off steam. At that point, you lost control and it went all downhill from there. 
   But my point is that you talk to these soldiers who are on the ground, and they see that they can't handle this situation the way it is and that the only way to do it is through diplomacy, is to try to patch up some of these political problems, which gets worsened because of the innocent civilians that are dying in Iraq, which makes them not like us.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. In a very practical way, we're pushing. I mean, I think this Congress has done everything that it can do, but if we're not getting any help from our Republican friends, a couple have shown great courage to try to end this thing, but not getting the support where we can override the President's veto. 
   Now, this is the stark reality that is frustrating for all of us, the Speaker I know for sure, and all of us, is that we're trying to end this war. The first bill we passed had a hard deadline. The second bill we passed had a goal to get out. The President still vetoed that, Mr. Speaker, and we're trying the best we can within this institution to move this iceberg, as you say. 
   But the President consistently vetoes these bills that we're trying to pass. And so now we're to the point where we've got to figure out what's the best we can do, and it looks like the best we can do is try to get him to at least have these benchmarks that are in there, report back in September, July and September, with some of this, and get our veterans the support and the funding they need. 
   Nobody likes that. I don't like it. I don't even know if I'm going to vote for it, to be quite honest. I'm so frustrated with the President at this point, but we've got decisions to make as to can we take a step in the right direction even though it's not as far as we want to go. 
   But I think this is a call, Mr. Speaker, for the citizens of this country to step out and step up, not the ones that we see wearing the pink, not the ones that we see with the bull horn, but if we're going to end this war, it's going to be average people who support our philosophy but have yet to say anything, and not in your district or my district but in districts where their representatives come down here and support the President. 
   You can't sit on the sidelines on this one, not as a politician, but as a citizen you've got to come out here and help us do this, and I think there needs to be a direct call to a action. 
   Just to let you know, Mr. Speaker, we are sending a letter to the U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops from me and several other Members, asking them to reengage the war issue; that this is the issue of our day and that they need to be more active and they need to get involved in their local parishes and demand that their citizens get off the pews and start participating and getting legislators to move off the dime. We've got to do this by September, or in the fall while we're beginning the process for 2008. Or we're going to continue to be here and legislators are going to continue to get away with voting to support the President when 71 percent of the American people don't think he's handling this job properly.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, my friends on the other side were saying that this is about politics, and I would like to say that this is not about politics. This is about governing, Mr. Chairman, something the Republicans in Congress know very, very little about. 
   Now, we have heard lectures today about spending too much money. $4 trillion under the Republican watch, Mr. Chairman, borrowed from China, Japan and OPEC countries with a Republican House, a Republican Senate, a Republican President. Mr. Chairman, I hope the Republicans will spare us the lectures on fiscal responsibility. 
   And then, Mr. Chairman, they start saying that, well, you're spending it, but you're not spending it right. You can spare us the lectures on spending. Need we bring up Katrina, need we bring up Iraq, Mr. Chairman? We don't really need lectures from the most blatantly irresponsible spending Congress in the history of this illustrious body. 
   Now, the Homeland Security Department was created by the Republican Party, Mr. Chairman. They ran on it. They ran campaigns against Max Cleland on it. They created it. And so now they're saying that if we actually fund it to protect the country, that somehow we're doing something wrong. That's what you do with programs that work; you fund them. 
   And now more to the point of what I think the real substance of this argument is really all about: The National Intelligence Estimate said that the war in Iraq has created more terrorists around the globe. That means, Mr. Chairman, that there are more terrorists out there now than there were before, and they're all coming to get us here in the United States. President Bush even says all the time, You know, if we don't fight 'em over there, they're going to come over here and get us. 
   So what we're trying to do in this bill is to protect the homeland. We're trying to protect against all those terrorists that have been created in the last 5 years, that have joined al Qaeda and all of these other groups that now want to come over here. We're trying to actually protect the homeland. 
   So we want to secure the ports. We want to make sure we have the first responders. You're impeding progress with the shenanigans that have been going on here the last 24 hours.

   The bottom line is this: The new Democratic Congress has fulfilled the promises that we have made, Mr. Chairman. Passed the minimum wage, cut student loan interest rates in half, security issues. When you look at the budgets that we have passed, the largest increase in veterans spending in the history of the VA to take care of those soldiers who are out there, a $500 to $600 increase in the Pell Grant, fully funding Head Start, SCHIP, Even Start, after-school programs, investment in alternative energy sources. 
   If I was you, I wouldn't want our bills to pass either, because when these pass and we take it to the American people, Mr. Chairman, our friends on the other side are going to wish they would have had the level of competence that the Democrats have.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Just to clarify. The ranking member submitted earmarks. There are no earmarks in the bill. That's a clear difference. 
   I ask my friend from North Carolina, what do you want to cut out of this bill? The Border Patrol? The 3,000 Border Patrol agents? Do you want to get rid of the technology that we're going to have on the ports to scan cargo coming in? Is that what you want to cut? Do you want to cut the money that we're giving to our first responders? 
   Mr. Chairman, exactly what is it that you don't like about this bill? There are no earmarks and we're funding programs that are going to protect the homeland. 
   Now, we understand clearly, Mr. Chairman, that our friends on the other side have had a difficult time governing the country. That doesn't mean they have to impede us from doing it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, we are going to be brief. We just wanted to make a few more points here before we wrapped things up. 
   One of the issues that is a major issue for the country, for the Congress, for the American people, for people living on border states, is Customs and border protection. 
   We sat here many nights, Mr. Meek and I, and listened to our friends come on the other side and give 5-minute speeches, 1-hour speeches, on the issue of immigration, on the major threat to the United States of America of illegal immigrants coming over our border. 
   In this homeland security bill that our Republican friends filibustered today and yesterday, there is $8.8 billion for Customs and border protection. $1 billion is provided for border security fencing and tactical infrastructure, along with 3,000 additional Border Patrol agents being funded. 
   Now, we have a bill that they agree with. I mean, you want to talk about the Potomac Two-Step, Mr. Meek? We have got a bill here that, across-the-board, everybody agrees with. You ask them why they are not voting for it, and they say, because we are against earmarks. 
   We say there are not any earmarks in here. Now why are you voting against it? Politics. 
   We have got to get past this, especially on an issue so critical as this. 
   Now, we added $27 million for 250 additional Customs and Border Patrol Agents for commercial operations and validations of commercial vehicles, verifying that trusted shippers have placed necessary security measures mandated in the SAFE Port Act. I mean, I don't understand. I mean, you know, this is my fifth year here, but I don't understand. 
   We are trying to pass a homeland security bill, and one of our friends, our buddy from North Carolina on the other side, said today that we should have passed the defense bill first. That was his big argument he made today, when we just passed a defense supplemental bill for $120 billion, with close to $100 billion of defense spending in there. We just passed one, and the funding goes until September 30th. 
   We are talking about protecting the homeland, Mr. Meek. We are not talking about all these other great things we are doing. This is essential. This is our constitutional duty, is to protect the country. Article I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, Mr. Meek, creates this House right here, and that is our first obligation, to make sure that we support that. 
   So I think it is important that those folks who are at home find out what is going on in this bill. Those folks in our own congressional districts across the country, who are members of law enforcement, who are police, fire, they need to know that we had millions and millions, and it probably adds up to billions of dollars, in here.     
   One of the things you hear about is intra operable communication grants. If you hear from our local police and first responders, it is that they don't have the proper equipment in a crisis situation to communicate with each other. So we put in here $50 million to continue a program to help local police, firefighters and first responders to talk to each other during a crisis. 
   Fire grants, $800 million; that is $500 million above the President's request  to address communications and staffing problems facing local fire departments. 
   Emergency management performance grants. And $300 million for all hazard grants, State and local emergency managers, national emergency management agency performance grant report. There is a $287 million shortfall in that program. We are trying to fix it. We are trying to fix it. And we had a filibuster last night until 2 in the morning last night.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Two points I want to make before we wrap things up here tonight. I appreciate what you've said. 
   One of the provisions in this Homeland Security bill, and I keep going back through here to see what our Republican friends filibustered, and we have heard a lot over the last couple of years about airport security, obviously after 9/11. 
   I want to share with the American people, Mr. Meek, and get into the Congressional Record exactly what is in this bill for transportation security. There is $6.62 billion, $307 million above last year, $219 million above the President's request. 
   There are three major components of this bill: Explosive detection systems, there is $849 million for procurement, installation and maintenance of equipment to protect commercial aircraft. This allows the TSA to address the most pressing needs identified in their recent aviation baggage screening study. They studied it and said, here is what we need. We said, here is $849 million, get what you need to make the American people safe when they fly. 
   Air cargo explosive screening, $78 million, which doubled the amount of cargo screened on passenger aircraft. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle filibustered this bill. It did not pass because of what they were doing. 
   Secure flight certification, TSA would certify that no security risks were raised by TSA secure flight plans that would limit screening of airline passenger names only against a subset of the full terrorist watch list, another mechanism to protect the American people. 
   Three major components of protecting the people when they travel, make this process easier and safer at the same time; our Republican friends filibustered this issue last night and today. 
   I want to end with one point. Conservatism is dead. I want to be completely clear about this. This isn't a George Bush, Madam Speaker, has screwed things up so bad we can fix it if we are just more conservative. Republican House, Republican Senate, Republican President, implemented the neoconservative foreign policy and implemented the conservative agenda without any inhibitions, without any barriers. It was all implemented. 
   Their tax policy, their spending policy, their foreign policy, their domestic policy, all passed the Congress and was implemented, and we have the largest gap between the wealthy and the poor since 1929. We have a foreign policy disaster that doesn't even need an explanation it is so atrocious. From the Middle East and all over the world, we are less safe today than we were just a few years ago because of this philosophy on government. 
   They have run down government for a decade and a half to two decades now, and when you turnaround and you need health care or you need FEMA to be able to react to a natural disaster, it doesn't work because you ran it into the ground. The philosophy doesn't work. It is not enlightened. It is not flexible. It is eight key words, and if you can't fit the whole problem of society and the complexity of society into those eight key words, then it doesn't work. And that is what we have seen happen. 
   We need a government that can change, that is responsive, that adapts  to the needs of our society. And our conservative friends have wrecked it. Now we have the keys to the car, and we are trying to do some things that are constructive. And we understand that they were incapable, Madam Speaker, of governing, but it doesn't mean that they should then impede us from doing it. That is what we want to do here. 
   Port security, border security, fire grants, police, first responders, all of these things are in this bill that our friends filibustered, and you will see our agenda implemented. You have already seen it in the increase in the minimum wage. You will see it with more community health clinics. You will see it with funding of Head Start. You will see it with Early Start and after-school programs, safer food. You will see it with transportation investments. You will see it from the Democratic Congress. 
   Their agenda has been implemented over the last 6 years without anybody to stop them, and it doesn't work, period-dot. The field mouse is fast, but the owl sees at night.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. The opposite of that, if there is not a date certain, that means that there is no end. And quite frankly, if there is no end in sight, how do we expect the Iraqi troops to get trained and to actually stand up if they think we are going to continue to be there? You know, it's like raising kids, at some point they've got to leave the house. They've got to stand up on their own. They've got to go pay their own rent, their own cars, their own insurance and everything else. I think that is what we are trying to communicate. We're not saying we want an end date just to have an end date. There is a reason. I think it is important for the Iraqis to know that the American people are not going to support this forever, and they need to stand up, regardless of what side you are on on the vote a few weeks ago or at the beginning of the war. 
   I want to talk about what happened last night and today on the House floor and what bill we were trying to pass. As most people know who are paying attention to this now, we have a procedure here where we bring a bill to the House floor after it goes through the committee process. And yesterday it came to the House floor and it was what we will call an open rule, so anyone can offer an amendment. There were over 140 amendments to the Homeland Security bill. And our friends in the minority who used to run the Chamber, Republicans, Madam Speaker, were frustrated about earmarks in the congressional process, and so they were protesting this bill. They kept invoking a motion called a motion to rise, which basically ends debate on the bill and on the amendments and stops the process. They did this, I think, nine times last night, and debate went until 2 in the morning. 
   I share this with other Members and those paying attention, Madam Speaker, because they, in essence, filibustered the Homeland Security bill. And it is important for us to recognize what this bill does. This funds the Homeland Security Department. I want to go through this because our friends filibustered more border patrol agents, 3,000 that the Democrats were trying to fund and get to the border so that we can secure our border. 
   Now, we hear from our friends on the other side about border security, about illegal immigrants, about all of this stuff that they keep talking about about illegal immigrants and terrorists. Last night and today, Mr. Meek, we tried to put 3,000 Border Patrol agents on the border, and they filibustered the bill. So we have not had a vote on this bill. It has not passed the House. 
   We had money in here for first responders, for our firemen, those people who would arrive on a scene first in the most critical time in the most critical positions. They filibustered that. So this bill did not pass the House. 
   We have equipment and technology that will allow us to keep our ports safe and to monitor what is coming into our ports and detect possible attacks on the United States; the Republicans filibustered that. And this bill did not leave the House floor today as it was scheduled. State grants for law enforcement, $90 million, urban area grants. The list goes on and on. Transit grants; emergency management perform grants; fire grants; metropolitan medical response grants; interoperable communication grants; port security grants; REAL ID grants; explosive detection systems; air cargo explosive screenings. It did not pass the House because the Republicans filibustered the bill today. You know why? Because of earmarks. And you know what? There wasn't one earmark in this bill, not one; not a Democratic earmark, not a Republican earmark. It was pure politics today on the House floor, Mr. Meek. You know it, I know it, they know it. And who suffered through all of this? The American people. 
   Let me make one final point before I volley it back over to you. The National Intelligence Estimate stated last year that the war in Iraq has created more terrorists around the world who hate America. Okay. So whether you were for or against the war in Iraq at this point is irrelevant, really. What are we going to do now? Well, the National Intelligence Estimate has said that there are more terrorists who hate America now. So now there are more terrorists out there than there were before, around 9/11, that are going to come to America and try to harm us. 
   So, in order to combat that, the majority of the Democrats are saying, why are we fighting this war in a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, was not harboring terrorists, was not the Taliban, right? And we have this war going on. Democratic philosophy is, fund the Homeland Security bill. Protect our ports; protect our borders; fund our first responders. Let's put some money so we can have more Arabic-speaking translators so that the stuff we are pulling down off the satellites we can translate. Right now we don't even have enough translators to translate the tapes that we are taping from the satellites from terrorists around the world. 
   Let's be smart. This isn't 1940. You don't drop big bombs anymore. Everything is decentralized; it's more delicate, it's more complicated. It takes a more complex constructive debate, not filibustering the demagogue earmarks in a bill where there are no earmarks. 
   I thought what happened in the last 24 hours has been a real disservice to the American people, and I think it continues to point out why they had a change of heart in the last election. 
   A couple of the comments that I would like to respond to, Mr. Meek, that were made today and last night. First of all, we hear a lot from our Republican friends, Madam Speaker, that the Democrats are fiscally irresponsible, okay? Which holds absolutely no water.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Will the gentleman yield? 
   The arguments we were hearing today from our friends, two things that really struck me as funny, actually, it was so outrageous, one is, we are not fiscally responsible, Madam Speaker. That was the first argument is that we're not fiscally responsible. This is coming from a party who, in the last 6 years, Republican House, Republican Senate, Republican White House, borrowed more money from foreign interests than every President and Congress before them combined. Now we are going to get lectures on fiscal responsibility. Borrowing money from China, Japan, OPEC countries, South Korea, the list goes on and on. And we've only been in charge 5 months. We haven't even passed a bill yet and now they're saying we are fiscally irresponsible. It doesn't hold any water. 
   And then the other comment was that we are not spending the money properly. This is coming from the party that has been running the war in Iraq, where they are giving more money to Halliburton. Halliburton has already been fined for marking up food, trying to basically war profiteer off of what's going on in Iraq. The Pentagon lost a trillion dollars and nobody even knows where it is. And we're going to get lectures on how we are spending our money. Same group of people who oversaw Katrina, the disaster where people were dying because of the poor investment, poor management, poor execution, poor planning of this administration with a Congress that provided zero oversight, we are going to get lectures on how to spend money and how to run government. Doesn't hold any water. 
   Now, here's why I think, and I'm going to get out here on a limb here a little bit, Mr. Meek. Here is why I think our Republican friends are trying to filibuster and distract and throw up red flags and put some smoke into the air to try to distract, and mirrors, just to try to get everybody thinking differently.     
   Here is why I think. I want to just briefly review what we have done with our budgets out of committee. Some haven't passed yet, but some are on their way, and we are going to get these through, because the American people deserve it. 
   Our veterans budget, Mr. Meek, was the largest, and we all know the veterans' problems across the country, we don't have to outline them, the largest increase in veterans spending in the history of the VA. Our veterans who come back home will be taken care of. 
   Saying that we support our troops is not a punchline for us. It is something that we take to heart. Budgets are about priorities and values, and in our budgets we have the largest increase for veterans. We have programs that are funded in there for brain injuries, for posttraumatic stress, to make sure the drug supply stays safe for our veterans, and on and on and on. We fixed the Walter Reed problem, rehabilitation, prosthetics. Everything that is needed for our veterans, they got. 
   In the last 21 years, there has been a small coalition of veterans groups who have their own little budget that they submit to Congress. Never before has Congress met what they wanted in their budget, until this year. We not only met it, we surpassed it by $230 million. We went above and beyond even what the veterans groups were asking for, because that is the commitment that we have. 
   With that coming down the pike, if I was in the minority and been in charge for 16 years or 14 years and had a President, a Republican President, and didn't deliver on any of that, I wouldn't want to talk about the Democrat's success either. I would want to start all kinds of other fights and filibusters and do everything else. 
   That is just the beginning. In the education bill, we increased the Pell Grant by $600 or $700. In Ohio, for example, where Governor Strickland now passed a budget where there is a zero percent increase in Ohio college tuition next year and a zero percent the next year, it used to be 9 percent and 9 percent, you take that, if you are a student going to school in Ohio, you go from 9 percent increases to zero percent increases and a $700 bump on your Pell Grant, that is a tax cut for average families. 
   We have increased Community Health Centers, so poor and middle-class people can go to a Community Health Clinic, by $400 million. Thousands of people in America who didn't have access to healthcare will now have access to it, at least through a clinic. 
   EvenStart, Head Start, after school programs, all funded with increases from the Democratic Congress. We passed the minimum wage, Mr. Meek. We passed a $200 million-plus investment in alternative energy resources and research. 
   Now, I am done, but I just want to make the point that with all of this positive news going on, Mr. Meek, I wouldn't want to talk about our budgets either. I would filibuster anything to prevent the Democratic Congress from passing these bills, taking them to the American people and campaigning on them next year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman and appreciate the opportunity to make a few remarks here. 
   Madam Speaker, a lot has been said here. The minority leader came down and said this makes him sick. Another speaker came down and said we are somehow holding the troops hostage. Another Member comes down and says this is a sad day. You know, I think all that rhetoric may be nice, but what we are trying to do here is run the government. As has been stated several times, when the Republicans were in charge, they put bills together and got them passed. And now all of a sudden to take a stand here like this has never happened is, I think, a tad bit disingenuous. 
   But we have to ask ourselves now that everyone is bringing the troops in here: What are the troops fighting for? They are not fighting for a Defense bill. They are not fighting for a VA bill. They are fighting for our country. And what is our country? Our country is a country that makes investments in its own people. They are fighting for America because it's a great place to live. It's a great place to get educated. It's a great place to get health care. And for us to say somehow they are just fighting for only a portion of our society, I think is a bit disingenuous, too. I bet if we talked to some of the troops and we asked them what it means to be an American, they would say it means to be free and to be able to achieve the American Dream. And you achieve the American Dream by being healthy, by being educated, by having access to this great country. That is what we are trying to do here. 
   We have a great bill. This Labor-HHS bill is great. It is called the people's bill. Just like the VA bill is the people's bill. This all goes together. This is one cohesive investment that we need to make in our country; and we are asking the Republicans, Madam Speaker, to join us. 
   You can't hide behind the President. Article I, section 1 creates this body. We are the ones who fund the government. If the President wants to veto this, help us override the veto. 
   These are all good bills. And when those veterans get home, as Mr. Obey stated, they need the same exact kind of attention and their families need the same exact kind of attention that every other citizen gets. They want high quality, low-cost education. They want high quality, low cost health care, and they want an opportunity for their kids to live the American Dream. Is that too much to ask? That's the question: Is that too much to ask?

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, if I can intervene here, I mean, you look at the money that we're borrowing and then we're giving tax cuts. So it's not that we have the money laying around here and say, boy, we've got a lot of money laying around here, why don't we just give the wealthiest people in our country the money back. We're actually going out to China and OPEC countries and borrowing the money to give tax cuts, and then we borrow 
   the money from OPEC countries to fund the war to get oil from the Middle East. 
   This is the most convoluted scenario that you almost think you've got to read a Tom Clancy novel to drum it up. And then when you look at the priorities that aren't getting funded here that we're now trying to fund, and on the House floor today we had the minority leader, we had the minority whip, we had all the leadership of the Republican Party tell us how somehow funding education, lowering tuition costs, reducing the amount of student debt that our students are going to have to incur, funding community health clinics is somehow not an important priority, that somehow if we put all these bills together with the defense bill and the veterans bill and education bill and health bill, that somehow those aren't all American priorities, that somehow when these vets get back, that because all these bills are somehow put together in a process that's going to speed this whole thing up, that somehow when those vets get back, they don't need health care, their kids don't need health care. Somehow when the vets get back that they don't need education, they don't need increased Pell Grants to send their kids to school. 
   Am I missing something here? Like these vets are out fighting for our freedom here, just for a defense bill, or just for a vets bill, that they're somehow not fighting for some of these basic, fundamental American values that we have. And look what's going on back at the ranch when our friends are playing around with the budget, not wanting to pass legislation, passing tax cuts for the top 1 percent, look at the hole we've gotten into. 
   Now, this is something that is very important to me, and I remember a few weeks ago I was at my brother's house who has two young kids, Dominic and Nicky. One's 1 and one's 2. And my sister-in-law said it's scary about these toys. I remember her saying that. 
   Here's from 2001, and it goes up as the years come, the amount of imported toys coming from China. Okay. Over here, the yellow line that drops off, that is the number of Consumer Product Safety Commission employees going down. So we only have 400. As the number of imports from China and toys come into our country goes up, the Bush administration has reduced the number of Consumer Product Safety employees to actually monitor these toys. Same thing's going on with food. 
   So when you look at these mixed priorities, you know, sometimes we think, well, the war's going on in a far-off place or it doesn't affect me. If you've got kids and you've got toys, this irresponsible behavior that we saw in Katrina, we saw with the government contracts in Iraq, comes right into your household because of a lack of investment into the United States.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We haven't borrowed money to make sure that we can hire enough people in the Consumer Product Safety Commission to make sure our toys are safe coming in from China. We're borrowing money to give the top percent a tax break, people making millions and millions and millions of dollars a year, and hey, if you make millions, God bless you, but now we're in a position where we don't have enough employees to monitor the toys coming into the country and we're giving multimillionaires a tax break. We're borrowing the money from China, which is pretty interesting when you think about all these toys coming in from China, that we're borrowing the money to fund the war and the tax breaks from China. So China's now our bank. So now they, of course, want their products coming into the country. 
   So, now all of the sudden, things like the reduction in employees at the Consumer Product Safety Commission happens because the Republican House and Senate and the White House have got us so dependent. 
   You mind if I go through here? I don't even know what these toys are. I see them on my brother and sister-in-law's floor. You'll know soon. You're newly wed. 
   The football bobblehead cake decoration. Okay. These are toys that have been recalled due to lead. This has a Patriots bobblehead.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. When you think about hundreds of millions of dollars worth of trailers sitting in the gulf coast that never got used for Katrina, when you think about all the wasted, unbid contracts through FEMA, to Halliburton, and in the war, I mean, hundreds, hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars. 
   Then all of a sudden we find that we have these regulatory issues, this is security, this is economic security. This is family security, when you hear Democrats talking about securing the country, it doesn't mean we want to start a war, it means we want to protect the homeland, and border security, family security, food safety, toy safety, product safety, these are things that it is our responsibility, as Members of Congress, to take care of. You have people sitting in towns and cities and counties all over the United States that are very, very concerned with this issue. 
   To have a person who is in charge of these kinds of things say we only have one person who is in charge of toy inspection, and we don't need any more money to do it is a complete dereliction of duty, of our responsibility here. When you look at what we are trying to do at every single turn, from raising the minimum wage to reducing college costs, to ensuring product safety, to ensuring food safety, this is about economic security. This is about homeland security. You know, 50,000 new cops on the beat, first responder funding. I mean, these are all things that we have been pushing and our friends, many of them on the other side, are obstructing this from getting done.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. How about the President the other day? This drove me crazy. He says, Congress is wasting their time with all these hearings. It ceases to amaze me anymore that we try to pass children's health care, and the President says, well, they can go to the emergency room. We are trying to have oversight so that we can have real product safety, safeguards up for food, and you are having all these hearings. We are trying to oversee what's going on in Iraq so we can, A, fix the problems we are having, but, B, finding all of these billions of dollars that have been going to these nonbid contracts and the jobs are not actually getting done. Then he said, oh, you are having all these hearings. 
   Then he said today, about the SCHIP bill, I don't know if you heard this, but he said, Congress is trying to pass this health care bill for kids, but it's really a trick. He said it was a trick. This is not a trick. This is us trying to pass health care for kids. He thinks it is somehow cute to say that on Halloween that this is somehow a trick.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We are getting them now, and, of course, it's important to recognize that you probably can't monitor every piece of corn that's coming into the country or every product that's coming into the country. But what happens is if you do have a significant presence, one is in random inspections, there will be a general consensus among people shipping food into your country that there will be inspections, and they may get caught if they do not keep meeting the standards. 
   But at the same exact time, what this does here is if people are getting busted for sending food in from China, then all of a sudden you are going to see production increases here in the United States, whether it's toys being manufactured or maybe something else. So it's very important. 
   This is about safety. This is about protecting our kids. This is about making sure that our families have, when they are having Thanksgiving dinner, have a lot of knowledge and confidence in how the government is administering these programs.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, you know, one of the things we talked about while you were out trick-or-treating was the connection between the money that has been borrowed by the past three Congresses and the administration from China, that's now our bank, and how their exports have been facilitated into this country, in this instance, the toys. So it's very difficult, I think, from a perspective of someone who's borrowing money from a country to say, hey, wait a minute; we've got some real issues with doing business with you. It becomes very difficult. And so I think our position with China, borrowing the money, the OPEC countries and many, many others, has put us at a significant position of weakness in dealing with a variety of foreign policy issues, but also dealing with issues like this. 
   Now, I showed this chart earlier, Mr. Meek, and I know, I think this was your idea to get it. But this is the chart of the number of toys being imported into the country and the number of employees that are assigned to protect the consumer. And so, much of this, much of these imports have been from China, and I don't think it's a coincidence that we want to somehow facilitate business with this country, which is fine. We know we have to do business in a global economy. But you don't do it at the expense of the health, safety and welfare of your own citizens.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We just need to, I think, look back, and I say this with the utmost respect, Mr. Speaker, because the President basically, yesterday, in his press conference, I think it was yesterday or maybe today, in his press conference basically was making fun of Congress for holding hearings, making fun of us. But when you look at what we're holding hearings on, we're trying to fix problems that we have in the country. So we're having hearings on FEMA and the disaster that we all saw on TV at the gulf coast. We're having hearings on Iraq, the unbid contracts, the problems that we're having there, the wasteful spending, the billions of dollars that the Pentagon doesn't know where it is. We're trying to have hearings to find out what's going on. Hearings on toys. I mean, we're trying to figure out how do we fund this, how do we have enough consumer product safety workers here in the country to make sure that our people are safe when you're dealing with products or food. I mean, when the administration then continues to make light of these very serious concerns, it's troubling to us to somehow say that we're holding hearings, which is our constitutional duty. Article I, section 1 of the Constitution created this body. 
   So, again, we have Katrina, we have the war, we have toys, we have passports, FEMA, we have all of these issues that we're dealing with in this country. I'm sorry if we're trying to solve these problems. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If the gentleman would yield, it's, I mean, we're obviously in a very complicated world. We're trying to solve some very complicated problems. And the frustrating part is when you have the President of the United States have a series of comments throughout his administration that have basically, you know, simplified all of these issues. You know, after 9/11 the big great challenge he gave us, Mr. Speaker, was to go shopping. You know, we try to pass children's health care and he says, well, you can get health care at the emergency room. And then, Mr. Meek, at his press conference today, he said that our whole children, SCHIP, trying to cover 10 million people program was a trick on the American people. These are, you know, we're wasting time holding hearings. 
   There are very serious issues that our families are dealing with, and to have the President of the United States, the most powerful man in the free world, someone who is able to stop children's health care from being administered in this country to 10 million kids, someone who's able to veto bills, and you need to rally, you know, a lot more Members of Congress in order to pass something, to try to simplify and make light, and I like to have as much fun as anybody else and we have our share of fun here, but we're dealing with some pretty serious issues. That the President's behavior and tone and temperament and comments on these issues becomes very frustrating.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Can I make a point too? And I want to say this because we all have a lot of good friends who are on the other side who have voted for the Labor-Health-Education appropriations bill, voted for defense, voted for the vets; and the argument being made today was that somehow this was unique that we are putting several appropriations bills together. If you ask people in our districts, the whole process is foreign to them anyway. It's just get the job done. And when we look back at our Republicans friends, Mr. Speaker, when they were in charge, on 59 different occasions, had put bills together like we're trying to do. And so I think it's important. We are trying to get the job done. But this is not every Republican. This is, in my estimation, some very fringe, extreme members of the Republican Party who are basically backing the President on these things, and he has just enough Members on the Republican side to sustain a veto.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It's the same disjointed kind of argument that the President, Mr. Speaker, has given us on the SCHIP bill. This is 10 million kids, $35 billion over 5 years. We could pay for these 10 million kids to get health care for a whole year for 40 days in Iraq. And the President, who has run up $3 trillion in debt, borrowed it from China, raised the debt limit five times, is now going to draw the line in the sand on fiscal responsibility on 40 days in Iraq to provide health care for 10 million kids. I mean, there are so many disjointed arguments and floating pieces that are going around here that just don't make a whole lot of sense to many of us. 
   I hope that we can try to continue to push to get more Members on the other side of the aisle to join with us to do some pretty basic things that the American people want us to do.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be before the House of Representatives once again with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy) to share with the American people and our colleagues some of the issues that are facing the United States of America today, and that I think will have ramifications for the future of this country. 
   The past few weeks here have been very exciting as we continue to try to press the President of the United States to find his way in Iraq and begin the withdrawal of our troops. 
   I think it is important for the American people to recognize the position of the majority party in the House of Representatives and the position of the majority in the United States Senate represented by Speaker Pelosi and Senate majority leader Harry Reid in which we are trying to begin the process of winding down the war in Iraq and expanding the global war on terrorism. 
   The war in Iraq does not have anything to do with the war on terrorism, and we hear from the President consistently that if we don't fight them over there, we are going to have to fight them over here. I think it is important for us to recognize that only 2 to 3 percent of the people fighting in Iraq are al Qaeda. We are in the middle of a civil war in a country that 70 percent of the citizens of that country in  Iraq believe it is okay to shoot American soldiers. That is where we are in the middle of this civil war, a religious civil war between religious groups and ethnic factions in which Americans in many instances are the targets of this civil war now. 
   We have seen in the last 4 months, Mr. Speaker, the deaths of more Americans in that 4-month period than any other 4-month period during the war. It is getting worse by the day. Many of us continue to talk to soldiers who come back and go back and forth, and they are very discrete with us and they share with us information that they are maybe not willing to say publicly. But if I have heard it from one soldier, I have heard it from 15 or 20 from my district and around the country who I have talked with. And they inevitably say: What is winning? What is winning this war? 
   We ask the President time and time again: What does winning mean? We are beginning to try the process that the President keeps vetoing of winding this war down. 
   When you have a scenario where you have a couple thousand or 3,000 or 4,000 U.S. and Iraqi soldiers in cities of over 100,000 trying to secure and trying to find out who these insurgents are when they all dress in civilian clothes, they all drive civilian cars. No one has a uniform on. No one is driving a tank. This is a guerrilla war that we are in the middle of. It is becoming very, very difficult for us to secure it. I believe we have missed the opportunity to secure that country because we lack troops. 
   I don't want to take all of the time up tonight. I know Mr. Murphy is such a courteous New Englander that he would probably let me, but I think it is important that the citizens of this country know that the Democratic Party is trying to end this war. We want timetables. We want accountability, and the one thing that we are saying to the President of the United States, two things, this is not going to be an open-ended war and you are not getting a blank check. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Just to think about the lack of planning and details for the whole deal, as these Iraqi troops are supposed to stand up, we are supposed to stand down. That is why in our supplemental we said let's work something out. There was no exact formula, but as one brigade of Iraqi troops are trained to the level the President certifies, we bring one home. 
   If the whole premise of the President's policy was as they stand up, we stand down, he has been saying that for such a long time, and that was in our supplemental bill that we passed a couple of weeks ago. 
   I know our good friend Steve Israel from New York and Ike Skelton have been promoting this idea for a long time, and that was in there. That is the kind of thing that the Democrats are doing. 
   But to focus on the lack of planning, not to beat a dead horse, but we now have soldiers over there who are in charge of two, three, 400 Iraqi soldiers. One person that I know who is in charge of 400 Iraqi soldiers, do you know how many interpreters he has to communicate with?

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. One. He has one interpreter to help him communicate with 400 Iraqi soldiers. 
   Now these are all of the things that were not accounted for before we went into this place. That's what we are saying. There is a time and a place for military action. Afghanistan is the one we all cite, where they were harboring the al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. 
   But now we have put these soldiers in a position where they are losing their friends. They are in dangerous situations. They don't know how long they are going to be there. Their tours keep getting extended, and you can't keep doing this to our soldiers. 
   And then you have a natural disaster in the United States and you don't have enough Guardsmen and -women to address the local problem.     
   Let's fix this. Let's work together to fix this problem and let's work with the President. Let's work with the members of the minority party in the House and the Senate to say let's start winding this thing down. That's what we want to do, and that's how I think we are going to begin to regain some credibility in the world. We are actually going to be pro-troop, pro-soldier by getting them out of a position that they can't survive in. We see the death tolls going up and we see what's happening at Walter Reed, and when you look at what we were able to do, immediate funding for the troops for the next 60 to 90 days and an evaluation of how we are doing, is that too much to ask? 
   I yield to my good friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Absolutely. We have another thing to add to the list of the promises that were made that we rehashed here many, many times. When you look at we are going to be greeted as liberators, we only need $50 billion, we can use the oil for reconstruction, you know, all of these things that were told to us before the war that ended up not being true, we have something that we can add as we have seen this week, May 12 edition of the news, and comparing it to this statement that the President made on the Iraqi government, New York Times, January 28, 2005, ``But asked if, as a matter of principle, the United States would pull out of Iraq at the request of a new (Iraqi) government, he said,'' the President said, `` `Absolutely. This is a sovereign government.' '' 
   May 12, 2007, fast forward, majority of Iraq lawmakers seek timetable for U.S. exit. Majority of Iraq's parliament members signed a petition for a timetable governing withdrawal of American troops. The American people want us out. The Iraqi parliament wants us out. Seventy percent of the Iraqi citizens think it is okay to shoot an American soldier. This President is the only one in the world who thinks it's a good idea for us to stay there, and it's the same person who told us this slew of inaccurate data, information, tactic, strategy 5 years ago. 
   So we are trying to fix this problem, and we are having a heck of a time getting past this President. And he is the President and he does have the veto power, but he needs to recognize we want accountability. He's not getting a blank check, and this is not going to be an open-ended war.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Let's look at what we are just trying to do. All we're saying is we're going to give the President, he wants $100 billion and we're saying we want to give you $30-some billion, and then D.C. lingo, fence the rest of the money in, the other $50 or $60 billion, until he comes back, the President comes back to us in July and is able to articulate to the United States Congress and the American people and the world what exactly the progress has been. And if you have progress, then you will be willing to come and make that argument to us here. And then we will have another vote, and we will decide if we are going to release the rest of the money or do something else, begin winding it down even quicker. 
   But I find it very disturbing, Mr. Speaker, that the President of the United States is not willing to come to the United States Congress, created by Article I, section 1 of the Constitution, the people's House, and articulate why our soldiers are still in Iraq, why we're not having success, why benchmarks aren't being met, why the Iraqi soldiers aren't being trained. You come back to the United States Congress and you tell us what the situation is, and then we control the money, and if there's progress we will give you more. If it continues like it's been going, we're going to give you enough to get these kids back home.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate it, and you're absolutely right. 
   And we have got an obligation to do that, and the ramifications of this war are being felt all over. And one of the regrets that we have had is that we continue to run up this huge budget deficit in order to pay for the war. And it's time for us to start challenging those people who have been doing well, those people that this primarily has been the burden of this war, has primarily been the responsibility of those families and those soldiers who have been fighting in it, and the burden that they have faced has been much greater than anyone had anticipated. And so I think it's important for us to also recognize in our supplemental bill what we have been able to do and what we have tried to do with some of this additional money. 
   Almost $2 billion for defense health care for those soldiers who are serving their country currently, that we put an extra couple billion dollars in there above the President's request to deal with the health care issue for those who are serving their country right now in this most dangerous time. 
   We also added an almost additional $2 billion for veterans health care and made sure that we are taking care of our veterans when they come back. We are going to see a tremendous surge in veterans health care when these soldiers get back home, and we want to make sure that they have the resources necessary to do that. 
   We don't want this to be a country that promises you before you go to war all kinds of Cadillac coverage and then when you get back you're left on your own. The Democratic Party had attempted to fix that through the supplemental process, and again, that bill was vetoed. 
   $500 million in there for post-traumatic stress disorder, which is going to be a huge problem given the kind of environment that these kids are fighting in. 
   $500 million in there for brain injuries, again a major problem with those soldiers who are coming back injured. 
   We're trying to take care of our veterans, and we're doing a good job, but we keep getting this process and these bills vetoed by the President of the United States, and it is very important that we begin to recognize that this can no longer be a stumbling block. 
   In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic-led Congress, in our budget authorization bill several weeks ago, put in there the largest increase for veterans spending in the history of the veterans administration. We are trying to take care of our veterans, and we are doing it in spite of what the President is trying to do by consistently vetoing our bills.     
   We are putting the money forward, we are asking for some accountability, we are taking care of our veterans, we are taking care of our soldiers, we are making sure that they don't leave to go over to Iraq without the proper body armor, the proper Humvee, up-armored Humvees, and the proper amount of rest. 
   Our soldiers are getting worn out by continuously extending their tours, by sending them back second, third, fourth tours, their families are having problems, high divorce rates. We are seeing it all over. It's time for us to refocus. 
   Then, when you look at who else is being affected by this situation that we have in Iraq, you are also seeing the issue with the National Guard readiness. We have seen, unfortunately, over the last couple of weeks, because of the natural disasters and the tornados, especially in places like Kansas, where the National Guard does not have the equipment, in many instances they don't have the manpower to try to deal with the issues that they are facing in their own State. There are so many issues that are being affected. 
   Let me just share with you some of these problems that we have and what we are trying to do to address that. We put in, in the last supplemental bill, $2 billion not requested by the President for a new strategic reserve readiness fund, of which $1 billion is for Army National Guard equipment shortfalls. We are trying to address it. 
   The President vetoed that too. So bad enough you are vetoing health care for our soldiers, you are vetoing health care for our veterans to the tune of $2 billion; you are vetoing veterans health care for post-traumatic stress disorder; you are vetoing health care for those soldiers who come back with brain injuries. You are also vetoing an extra $1 billion for Army National Guard equipment. 
   I mean, come on. We are trying to move this process forward. You know, it's a typical D.C. move, that if it's not your idea, we are against it. You know, if I didn't come up with it, I'm against it. That has been the President's attitude. We can't have it, because it's not us that is suffering; we are in air conditioned quarters. We got offices, cars, nice meals, you know. Our families are here with us. 
   It's the soldiers who are suffering, and their families who are suffering, bearing the brunt of this war. 
   This is Lieutenant General Steven Blum, chief of the National Guard Bureau: ``The Governors are rightly concerned that while the personnel part of the Guard has never been better, never been more ready, the equipment piece to the National Guard back here at home has never been less ready, and they are trying to resolve that obvious disconnect. The message is clear what we have, and the budget does not produce the level of readiness that they feel comfortable with.'' 
   Just being admitted. That's being admitted by the chief of the National Guard Bureau. This is the Government Accountability Office report from 2007, just a couple of months ago in January. This is a nonpartisan bureau that we have here: ``The high use of the National Guard for Federal overseas missions has reduced equipment available for its State-led domestic missions. At the same time it faces an expanded array of threats at home.'' 
   Reduced equipment available for our National Guard; our soldiers, not having the proper body armor; our Humvees not properly up-armored; our soldiers not getting the proper rest; our veterans not getting the kind of health care that they deserve; our defense, our soldiers in the Defense Department, not getting the level of health care and attention that they need and that they deserve; and an American public that wants this war to be over. Sixty percent say that it was a mistake to go in the first place. 
   We have an obligation to respectfully and orderly wind this war down and begin a surge of diplomacy in the Middle East, asking our neighbors in the Middle East, asking the United Nations to take part in a peace-keeping effort in Iraq, making sure that our soldiers are there and the periphery, a certain number, to make sure that we are still in the region to a certain extent to protect against some kind of Iranian influence. 
   I yield to my good friend, who I know has been very busy tonight. Thank you for taking time out of your schedule to honor your commitments. 
   I yield to my good friend from Florida.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, I appreciate you coming down and articulating that. And it's been consistent since we've gotten in with the first 100 hours as to what we're doing now, what we plan on doing, what we've passed out of this House, what we've passed out of this House sometimes on several different occasions. 
   And if you look at the two major supplemental votes, you look at, you know, what did we do in the first one is we put timelines in there, deadlines in there, date certain we're going to get out of there. 
   And you stated, I think, so articulately, that the Iraqi soldiers, if they know we're going to be there, then they're going to continue to rely on us. And if you leave the training wheels on the bike, you're never going to learn how to ride on two wheels. And it's time to take the training wheels off, Mr. Meek.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I am trying to pay attention to you, but I'm thinking to myself, you do owe me money. 
   I'm kidding. 
   For the record, Mr. Speaker, that was a joke. 
   As we listened to the debate over the past couple of days, we heard a lot from our Republican side, this is about the kids and you have to do this for the kids. I am thinking to myself as I am listening to the debate that it was the Republican Congress since 1994, post-Bill Clinton, when it got out of control in the last 6 years with President Bush, Republican House, Republican Senate and Republican White House, that garnered almost $3 trillion more of debt for our country, as you just pointed out. 
   Now, if you are concerned about the kids, the first thing you don't want to do is leave them in a worse position than even you were in. Quite frankly, if we keep going down the same road that the Republican-led Congress and President steered us down, that is a road of debt and deficits and borrowing money from China and Japan and OPEC countries and some of our best competitors.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. One of the other critiques we heard last night and today about the Democratic budget is: More government spending. They want the government to spend the money instead of the individual. 
   Well, I'm sorry, I don't know how you expect to fund veterans' health care if the government is not going to do it. Who do they want to do it? Wal-Mart? Home Depot?

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Ohio. (THIRTY-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate that. 
   And $3.6 billion from the resolution, continuation resolution from last year, for veterans' spending. That increase is government spending. Because we have to fund health care for veterans because it was the government that sent the veterans out. 
   Now, I am not saying that every dollar the government spends is good, but I remember last year under the Republican budget and the year before under the Republican budget passed by a Republican House and passed by a Republican Senate, signed by a Republican White House, that gave $14-15 billion in subsidies to the oil subsidies, that was government spending; and our friends on the other side of the aisle weren't very critical when public tax dollars were going to corporate welfare for the oil companies when they were making the greatest profits they have ever made. That is government spending. 
   What we are doing, not raising taxes, the same revenues as the President's budget had, we are going to reprioritize that money and we are going to take that money and spend it on our veterans and invest it in education and increase the Pell Grant almost $4,600. We are going to take that money and cover thousands and thousands and thousands more kids under the SCHIP program, the State Children Health Insurance Program. That is the difference between these two budgets. 
   When the President says he is going to veto this supplemental bill that is going to get us out of Iraq, you know what else he is vetoing, $1.7 billion increased over the President's recommendation for veterans' health care. That is in the supplemental bill that he says he is going to veto. 
   Also, $1.7 billion above the President's request for defense health care for our soldiers. The President says he is going to veto that. 
   There is $500 million for post-traumatic stress disorder for soldiers coming back. The President says he is going to veto that. 
   There is $500 million in there for brain injuries; and we have both been to Walter Reed visiting the soldiers with the level of brain injuries that we have never seen in combat. So $500 million, the President says he is going to veto that. 
   Almost a billion dollars in the supplemental for children's health insurance, and the President says he is going to veto that. That is what the President is saying he is going to veto. 
   We hear a lot about government spending, and we hear a lot about the kids. You can't send these kids off to war and, in many instances, adults off to war, and then when they come back your argument is we don't want government to spend money. That doesn't cut it.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Let's look not only at the supplemental but with the budget the President presented. We, the Democratic budget, increases the Pell Grant to at least $4,600 from a little over $4,000 now. As you said, we are constrained by the $3 trillion of debt that was created over the past 6 years by our friends in the Republican party.     
   But this Democratic budget rejects all of the things that the President recommended. Here is what the President wanted to do for higher education. He wanted to eliminate the Perkins loan program. He wanted to eliminate the Federal supplemental opportunity grants, and he wanted to eliminate leveraging education assistance partnerships. He wanted to completely eliminate them. 
   Now, we are competing with 1.3 billion people in China and over 1 billion people in India. The key component to economic growth in America in the next decade or two or three or four or probably for the existence of this country is to invest in education, and when you look at what the Democrats have done in the first 100 hours, we cut student loan interest rates in half for both parent loans and student loans, and here we are in our budget and we raised the Pell Grant in the CR as well, and here we are raising again the limit for the Pell Grant to $4,600. That is investing in education. 
   When you look at the billions of dollars we are going to put into children's health care to make sure that every kid in the United States of America has access to health care, those are investments that are going to pay off in the long term, and that is going to lead to a strong America, a strong economic growth. 
   Now, our friends on the other side, and I do not want to talk too much about this, but it has been levied against us that the Democratic budget is somehow going to raise taxes. We have the Brookings Institute, we have the Center for Economic Policy, and we have the Concorde Coalition, three independent folks who have said we are not raising taxes; and I am going to tell you why we are not raising taxes right now. 
   We are going to fix the alternative minimum tax. It has been creeping into the middle class, and we are going to provide 23 million Americans with a tax cut because we are not going to allow the AMT to go in and creep into their tax levels. 
   Not only does the budget not raise taxes; we include tax relief where the child tax credit stays on, marriage penalty relief stays on, 10 percent bracket tax deduction stays on, and a deduction for State and local taxes all in this bill. 
   I want to say one further thing on the tax issue, that the same people claiming that the Democrats are raising taxes are the same people that said that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. They were the same people that said that it would only cost us $50 billion in Iraq, and we are already to the $500 billion mark. They were the same people that said we would be greeted as liberators. They were the same people that said they would be handing roses out to the Americans. Same people, same President that said mission accomplished, you know, same person that said we are in the last throes, the Vice President's comments on the war. 
   So they are the same people saying that we are raising taxes, and all I want to say to the Members is this, the American people can reserve judgment on whether or not this budget does it. We know it does it, but they can reserve judgment. Keep your 2006 tax returns, keep your 2007 tax returns, make a copy of them, and next January and February, March, April, when you get your taxes back, you compare your 2008 tax returns to your 2006 and your 2007, and you will see that there is absolutely no difference. 
   Then you can add those comments that we have been getting here over the past couple of days, you can add that to the column of weapons of mass destruction, and last throes and mission accomplished. Just take that comment on its axis and put it in the column with the list of all the other issues that have been in some ways misrepresented here on the House floor and across the country. 
   So I am proud of this budget. I am proud that the Democratic budget invests $50 billion to cover children. I am glad we are investing in veterans health care, and those are things that need to be done. Those are not things that individual families can do. Those are the things we can only do collectively as a society, as a community. 
   I am so proud that you have had the opportunity to come down here and lead this debate, as we are beginning to wrap up. I think it is important to say that the Democrats have heard the call from the American people in the November election. The country wanted to go in another direction, and that is really what we have done.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, I think the American people will be very glad when they see this budget. They are going to be very glad over the past couple of weeks and really over the past 100 days of all of the accomplishments led by Speaker Pelosi and Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn and Rahm Emanuel and John Larson, and really the amazing leadership we are getting from our leadership in our caucus and the real teamwork on behalf of our freshmen Members and the different aspects of our caucus. 
   I have never been prouder to be a Democrat than in the last couple of weeks on this floor and to pass that resolution last week that is going to get us out of Iraq responsibly, invest in our veterans, make sure they get the kind of health care they need, the first 100 hours, where we began to bring some fiscal discipline to the House, cut student loan interest rates in half, repairing student loans, invested in alternative energies, invested in the stem cell research and some great advances, creating new sectors, raising the minimum wage, all of this was done in the first 100 hours. 
   When you add to that the supplemental and the $1.7 billion and the billion dollars for vets and the additional $1.7 billion above the President's request for health care for our soldiers, and you add this budget of $50 billion that is going to go to poor kids to make sure that they get health care so they can go out and get up on their feet and go to school healthy, ready to learn and move forward and get a good job and pay taxes and advance their families forward, break the cycle of poverty, these are the kind of investments that we are making, increasing the Pell Grant to $4,600. Key investments. 
   So I am proud of what has been going on here, and it has been a pleasure to rekindle this kind of debate that we have, and I really appreciate your friendship. 
   With that, do you have any closing comments? I am going to wrap it up here. 30somethingdems@mail.house.gov. If anybody wants to e-mail or see any of the charts we have had, you can go to www.speaker.gov/30something.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. The sense I am getting from my district now is that this is all fine probably if everything is going okay for everyone else. But the fact that things aren't going well, people are struggling to pay for their health care and college tuition. They are living paycheck to paycheck, bankruptcies are up, foreclosures, and kids are getting killed because of an administration that has been less than forthright with the facts. I think that is what is stirring among the American people. 
   That is what happened in the election in November; and I think quite frankly the key to moving the kind of agenda we want to move here is going to be organize and tap that energy that is back home in a lot of our districts. Unless we do that, we are going to struggle. But I think we have the wind at our back. We have the American people at our back. They like what we are doing. There are good responses from the bill we passed on Friday.     
   We have got to get out of Iraq, and this President does not have the credibility to I think withstand the kind of pressure that is coming from the American people. The American people want out. They are tired of watching what is happening. Five more soldiers got killed, more kids maimed, more kids injured, more kids at Walter Reed, more kids go into a VA system that is less than adequate, and the American people are looking for the kind of changes that you have talked about, Congressman Meek has talked about. 
   The bottom line I think is this, and whether you are talking about the war or anything else. For the war, it is like, well, there is only two options here. We either go down the road the President has taken us down and keep going or we have this alternative that we presented to get us out in the next year, hopefully earlier. An alternative to not going with our proposition is to continue to give the President a blank check, continue to have kids get killed, continue to not have a plan with absolutely no explanation as to what we are doing over there. No one even knows anymore.  
   To go along with the President's budget means that as we look through our notes here and the research we did, 1 million children who are currently covered under the SCHIP program will get cut out of it. Our plan, invest $50 billion to cover millions of children who are currently uninsured. Which way do you want to go? I mean, this is not brain surgery. The President wants to continue to give tax cuts to the top 1 percent. We want to cover kids with health care, without raising taxes.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker, but this Congress wants to add up to $50 billion to cover $50 million of new children on the State Children's Health Insurance Program. We want to get the Pell grant up to at least $4,600 and we reject the President's proposals for cuts. 
   Now, imagine the leadership in the United States of America in 2007, Mr. Speaker, 2007 where he is going to say we want to not fund Pell Grants, we want to not fund children's health insurance and we want to continue to spend $2 billion a week in Iraq.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Is that not interesting that the soldiers we talked to, Mr. Speaker, at Walter Reed, back home, the kids that have gone, come back, gone, come back, and they are going back again, the reason you hear about why these kids want to go back and you think why would you want to go back, they want to go back because their buddies are still there. They feel like if they go back that they will be able to save their lives. 
   The last couple of funerals I have been to with kids who were stop-loss and were supposed to come home but ended up staying longer than they probably should have and ended up not making it back, the reason they wanted to go back in the first place was to protect their friends, and that is the heroism, that is the valor, that is the nobility of the cause. That is why these kids go back. 
   To talk about that the debate last week, and many of us did not get an opportunity to speak for a variety of different reasons, but to hear, Mr. Speaker, some people say that if we bring these kids home, somehow that is going to make us less safe here in the United States, is an appalling argument, that this administration and this Republican Congress would rubber stamp this war to go over there, and that National Intelligence Estimate has told us that this war has created more terrorists, not less. It has created terrorists, Mr. Speaker, and then now that we have thousands and thousands and thousands of more people gunning for us here, these folks have the audacity to tell us, Mr. Speaker, that somehow us bringing our kids home is going to make us less safe. 
   Now, that, to me, is appalling and to continue that kind of disjointed logic is unacceptable to me because we have kids in our districts who are not back home. They are either in Iraq, and many of them have gotten killed under the guise of the war, and to tell us that by bringing our kids home and getting them out of a civil war is going to make us less safe does not make any sense because all of the intelligence in the whole world is saying this war in Iraq has completed the final piece of the fanaticism of the Middle East. 
   We have given anyone who kind of wanted to join but did not really want to, they are now joining. They are now a part of everything. They are now a part of the terrorist groups. They are now a part of the terrorist organizations. They now hate the United States more than they ever have, and so I find the whole operation appalling.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. On behalf of the American people, I think they are trying to see what we are trying to do. We are trying to end this war, stop the killing of our own kids, stop the maiming of our own soldiers, get them out of a civil war, try to calm down what's happening, stop the $8-plus billion a month that we are spending over there, and try to take some of that money and invest that into our own students, our own kids. 
   I was, just before I got here, having dinner with an old friend of mine, who is a Republican. He said, we have spent $400 billion, soon to be $500-and-some-billion dollars on this war. Can you just imagine, we could have covered all of our citizens for health care, we could have paid for everyone's college education, and, you know, gotten some stuff done in this country. 
   Instead, we have $500 billion, we have well over 3,000 kids have gotten killed, adults and soldiers, some 25,000 maimed or injured and God knows how many innocent Iraqi civilians, many of them children.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We're still struggling. There are a lot of emotional issues that Cleveland Indians fans have had for a long time. And then you factor in the Cleveland Browns and the drive and the fumble and Michael Jordan singlehandedly beating us a couple of times in the playoffs and you add this to the mix, we have some psychological issues we need to deal with, Mr. Speaker, and hopefully we will be able to work through them. 
   But today is the day that we are talking about the excess in spending on the war. We hear a lot back in our districts, I'm sure you do in the Seventeenth District in Miami, and I hear in the Seventeenth District of Ohio, we hear about the rising cost of health care. We hear about the rising cost of education. We hear the problems that we have incurred in this country because we haven't invested into developing alternative energy sources in the United States of America, and we haven't developed them fast enough. 
   We have all these issues that local communities deal with, Community Development Block Grant money that they get from the Federal Government that local communities can build sidewalks and roads and sewer lines and they can use all this money. That is Federal money that works its way down to local communities. And when we look at the needs of local communities, every single day in the paper in Ohio, it is water lines, it is sewer lines. In the summer it is what sports do we have to ask the kids and the parents to pay for this year? Why are we cutting the art programs? Why don't we have enough money to handle the septic and the sewer systems in our local community? For years, the Federal Government continued to make those investments. And what we hear now coming out of the executive branch, Mr. Meek, is that we don't have the money to do it. 
   Now, we are talking about providing health care for 10 million kids, poor kids, who live within 200 percent of poverty, a family of four making maybe $40,000 a year. What we are arguing on our side is that we think it is in the best interests of this country, all of us together, not one family or this family, all of us, is that if we provide and pay for health care for these 10 million kids and their families, because we believe on this side and our friends on the other side who voted with us, not the President, we believe that if we make this very small investment of $35 billion over 5 years, that we are going to have a healthier country, that we are going to have kids who aren't sitting in the classroom getting other children sick, that they are going to be able to concentrate and focus. 
   We sit here and we say, ``We need more people to major in math. We need more people to major in science. We need to compete with the Chinese. They graduated thousands and thousands of more engineers than we did in the United States of America.'' Part of that is we need our kids to be healthy. We need them to be able to concentrate in school, not sneezing and getting colds and pneumonia and not missing classes. We need them to be healthy. And that is the basic concept behind the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   To have the President, after he began a war that is going to cost us $2.4 trillion, with a T, tell us that we don't have enough money to provide health care for these 10 million kids is a complete outrage and doesn't really make any sense. Now, I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, for the Congress to know and to be reminded that over the past 6 years, with a Republican President, a Republican House and a Republican Senate, that this President and that Congress, those Congresses have borrowed more money from foreign interests than every President and Congress before them combined. Over $1 trillion in foreign money. Now, the same Congress and the same President asked to raise the debt limit, meaning we can go out and borrow, as a country, more money, five times he asked to raise the debt limit. Then, on top of that, the final number is the increase of the debt under this President is $3 trillion. So he raised the debt by $3 trillion, raised the debt limit five times. Now we have a war that is going to cost us $2.4 trillion, with a T, and he says, ``We don't have enough money, Mr. Speaker, to provide health care for 10 million kids at $35 billion, with a B, over 5 years.'' 
   For 40 days in Iraq, we could pay for 10 million kids to get health care for a whole year. Forty days in Iraq. And what is the investment going to get us? It is going to get us healthier kids. It is going to get us kids who can concentrate and pay attention in school. It is going to save us money in the long run because we are not going to cart these kids off to the emergency room 2 weeks later with pneumonia when we could have taken care of them with maybe a small prescription. Those are the kind of prudent investments that we want to make in this country. Those are the kind of investments that we should be making in this country. 
   We talk a lot in this country about what are we going to do in the next century? We lost manufacturing, and we are not sure what the new economy is going to look like. But there are some things we know about, Mr. Speaker. We know that our kids in Niles, Ohio, or Youngstown, Ohio, or, Miami, Florida or wherever you are from, are competing more directly with the students in China. We know that our kids are now competing. The old steel belt and the old rust belt in Ohio is Cleveland and Youngstown and Akron and Pittsburgh. For the longest time, those cities used to compete with each other and those businesses used to compete with each other. Now this whole region is competing with Shanghai. And our kids are competing more directly with those kids in China, India and all over the world, 1.3 billion people in China, 1.2 billion people in India. We only have 300 million people in the United States of America. We are at a real disadvantage when it comes to just mass numbers. And democracy is not always easy, either. If you want to open up a factory in China or you just clear a neighborhood out, you give everybody 25 bucks, they give you a week to get out. There are no environmental laws. There are no worker rights. It just happens. The government comes in and moves everything along. Democracy is sometimes a little more difficult, in a good way. We have rights; property rights, human rights and all kinds of different things that citizens in China don't have. 
   But my point here is this, we only have 300 million people. So if you look at what the Democratic agenda, the 6 in '06 and what my friend from Florida has been stating, what we have been trying to do is very, very simple. We're trying to invest into those 300 million people so that they're healthier, so that they're more educated, so that they are able to live the American dream. Now, no one here is saying that everyone needs to be a winner. We understand that life is life. There are winners and there are losers. But as a  country, we want to make these investments because we all benefit from it. We all benefit from that.     
   The investments we are making now, just look at our agenda now. One of the first things we did, we raised the minimum wage for the first time since 1997 so that we are lifting people up. One of the second things we did is we reduced the cost of college education, or tried to. We cut student loan interest rates in half. So when you go out and borrow for your kids to go to school or a student borrows next year to go to school, the interest rate will be 3.4 percent, as opposed to last year when it was 6.8 percent and that money was going to the banks. They were making a heck of a lot of money off of it. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are saying keep those rates low; let's improve access so that everyone can go to a community college and get a skill or they can go off to college and get an associate's degree or a master's degree or Ph.D. so that they are educated to compete. What we also did was increased the Pell Grant by $1,000 over the course of the next 5 years. Is that as much as we want? No. Absolutely not. We are not even close. But we are moving in that direction. It's tough, when you have a war that is costing you $2.4 trillion, to come up with any money to make these kinds of investments. But that is what we wanted to do, and we have changed the direction in regard to college education. 
   Now, if you're a kid going to school in Ohio, where we had the new Governor come in and he froze college tuition for 2 years so there will be a zero increase next year and a zero percent increase the following year, if you add that to what we have done with the student loans and the Pell Grants, you're talking about saving average families thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars. An average student loan, because of the interest change we made, an average family will save $4,400 over the course of the loan. 
   Now, we are not coming out here beating a drum, saying we have got to cut taxes, we have got to cut taxes for millionaires. We are saying if you send your kid to school and you take out a loan, we just saved you $4,400. If you have someone in your family, or one of your students, kids that are going to school that are working for minimum wage, they got a pay increase. If you're utilizing the Pell Grant, you're going to get more of that. These are good, solid investments we've made. In addition to this, we have the State Children's Health Insurance Program. So these kids have opportunity. 
   Now one of the other things that really isn't on the agenda to talk about, but the Senate just passed it last night, we are trying to pass it again through the conference committee and hopefully get the President to sign it, but the President said he was going to veto it, is the Health and Education bill, where we are making investments to build community health clinics so that people who don't have health insurance now can at least go to a health care clinic and get some preventive care. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just found it stunning, and I think a lot of other citizens of this country did as well, and I know many Members of Congress have found it stunning too, when we were having this big debate about children's health and the President said, Well, they have health insurance. They can go to the emergency room. 
   I found that absolutely stunning that the President of the United States, in 2007, his solution or lack of solution is to say that these kids could just go to the emergency room. Now, I am sorry, but that is unacceptable. Not only is it bad economics, it is unacceptable from a moral position. 
   It has been frustrating, but I want the American people, Mr. Speaker, to understand what we have done through the House is passed legislation. And my friend with the great reform of the Small Business Administration, our friend from Pennsylvania, creating an angel investor fund and basically retooling the SBA for the 21st century in a high-tech economy, the things that we have done have been investments into our country and into our people. 
   Now, I'm sorry. Giving $100,000 tax break to someone who makes millions of dollars a year is not benefiting anybody because they are not even taking that money and investing it back into our country. They are investing it probably in China and India. What we are saying is we are going to make these investments.

No one here is satisfied. No one here will say, This is great; we have really accomplished everything we wanted to. We can go out and turn out the lights and let someone else finish the business. 
   We have got a lot more to do, if you look at what we want to do with alternative energy, if you look at what we want to do as far as continuing to try to reduce the cost of education, K-12 and whatnot.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I had an interesting weekend, and I am glad to be with you and our new friend from Connecticut. I had a very interesting weekend because everyone in Niles, Ohio, in the Mahoney Valley, was talking about the first 100 hours. So I found it very interesting that so many people were actually paying attention to what was going on here. 
   I think a lot of it had to do with Speaker Pelosi and the first woman Speaker being here. But there was a genuine excitement that things had changed in Washington, D.C. and I am sure you felt it in Miami. I know you were there. I talked to you last night. You were there. And I am sure they felt it up in New England.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I did, yeah. I actually spoke at the Akron Press Club, which I felt was very important. And then I spoke at Our Lady of Mt. Carmel grade school, my old Catholic grade school. And we had a little alumni affair there. 
   It was interesting, because there were so many people talking about what had happened down here, the historic nature of the changes. And when you look and you think about all of the political promises that we have probably all heard in our careers at one point or another about, we are going to do this, we are going to do that, and you hear people say that. 
   But for Speaker Pelosi and the majority here to lead and run campaigns all over the country and make those assertions and make these promises and then to come within the first 100 legislative hours and actually deliver on these issues is impressive. And I think it tries to restore some of that credibility that has been lost, I think, over the past couple of years. 
   So we immediately stabilized a lot of families. I mean, it is not implemented yet, but our goal: minimum wage, cut student loan interest rates in half and help negotiate down the cost of prescription drugs. And then open up two new sectors of the economy by repealing the corporate welfare and investing that in alternative energy sources, which will lead to more research from the private sector, investment by the private sector, and try to open up this new alternative energy sector of our economy, and then the stem cell research bill, which will allow us in the health care industry to open up and do  further research to move the economy forward. 
   So we are trying to do some compassionate stuff, some progressive stuff, but at the same time stabilize. It has been interesting. It has been fun to go back home. Mr. Meek, as you remember the last couple of years, you would have to go back home, and you are talking to your constituents, and there is not a whole lot to say. 
   You know, we were often talking about what we were trying to prevent from happening, or motions to recommit or amendments we offered for PAYGO in all of those committees and Charlie Stenholm and Dennis Moore who offered all of those provisions to try to balance the budget by implementing PAYGO. Well, we implemented PAYGO from the House side. 
   I think it is very important that we were able to actually go out and do that. So I am excited about what is happening here.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And it is exciting because it is just starting, Mr. Murphy. It is just starting. 
   And when you meet with the Speaker and you see the intensity in her eyes and the focus about this was really just the beginning and we are not here to say, well, we did our first hundred hours and we are done. We are going to chalk it up and we are done. This is about continuing to move forward. We have got to reauthorize No Child Left Behind. 
   And when you talk to Chairman MILLER, who is the Chair of that committee, you see the look in his eyes about an opportunity to change the face of education in this country, to finally put some resources back behind No Child Left Behind to where it actually will work. 
   And when you look and you see, and I know, you know, Senator Kennedy is talking about putting money in there to help school districts figure out how they can possibly extend the school day and extend the school year so that we can make sure that our kids are on par with kids from Korea and some of these other countries where they go an extra couple, 3 weeks a year more than us, which equals another year or two over the course of a 12-year education cycle. These are the kind of things that we want to implement here. 
   And if it wasn't for the, and we got into this, too, a lot back home. You know, a lot of people had an almost unrealistic expectation that we came in, we can come in now, Mr. Murphy, and Ms. Wasserman Schultz and wave a magic wand and all of a sudden there is a lot of money here. Well, we have got a lot of making up to do because of the irresponsible fiscal inadequacies and inability of the Republicans to actually balance the budget. So we have got to go up and clean that mess up. We have got to figure out how to extract ourselves from this morass we are in in Iraq and then finally make the investments that we want to make. 
   So we have got a lot going on here, Mr. Meek, and we are very excited about the proposition that we have in the future. When you look at the opportunities that we really have in this country, I think they are great. But it is about focusing on the human capital in the United States of America, Mr. Murphy, and making sure that we make the kind of investments into the health care, education in the United states and the stem cells and the alternative energy are going to put us on a strong path to move forward. 
   And I would be happy to yield to my friend from Connecticut.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Will the gentleman yield? 
   It was interesting, because one of our friends from the other side gave a 5-minute speech about the values of free trade. I think pretty much everything he said I agree with, and I voted against almost probably every trade agreement that has come before this Congress since I have been here. And I agreed with everything he said. We are trading. It creates value. It invests in our countries. We all understand all that. 
   The problem is that we are not making the investments into the United States that will help us grow new sectors of the economy that will replenish the jobs that we may be losing. 
   Now, people in Youngstown, Ohio, obviously, don't like to lose their jobs. But if there was a job there that they could get trained and go into and make the same kind of living and have the same stability for their family and provide for education and health care for their own family, they would be fine with it. So you can't have free trade and then not invest in the stem cell research. You can't have free trade and then not invest in the alternative energy research to help stimulate the economy and create new sectors that will ultimately yield employment for our folks in our communities. 
   Be happy to yield to Madam Chair of the Legislative Appropriations Subcommittee.

   What I think is an important point here is that we could have come in and not passed the pay as you go. We could have done the irresponsible thing. And everyone says, well, the Democrats are controlled by all these interest groups. Well, we could have been irresponsible and said this interest group is going to get this and this one is going to get that, and we will borrow the money from China, as Mr. Meek had the chart up, and we would pay everybody back. 
   I am telling you, Madam Speaker, she is great. We are doing the right thing. We could have done the easy thing, and we could have paid everybody back and made increases that were irresponsible because we would have continued down the charts where we are borrowing the money from China, paying the interest. They are taking that money, investing it back in their economy, buying submarines and everything else. But we did the right thing. So we have got to take the hit now, but the long-term economic interest of the country is going to be much better off.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And if we get an opportunity as we go through the oversight of the war, oversight of FEMA contracts, there are millions and millions and millions, if not billions, of dollars that have been wasted through the war, the contracting, the Halliburtons. You know, story after story we hear off the record, that is all going to come out through the hearings. You know, if Halliburton has a truck and the tire goes out, they just get rid of the truck and they buy a whole new one. Well, that is at the taxpayers' expense. And there are stories after stories after stories of these kinds of things happening. 
   So part of what we are doing is we are making the tough decisions today, the responsible decisions today, get into the oversight, find out where the waste is; and I really hope that we continue to push Mr. Tanner and Mr. Cardoza's bill that says we audit the whole government, because this government is clearly incapable of functioning in the 21st century economy. 
   If we are going to have the resources that we need, Mr. Meek, to invest in education, to invest in the health care, to invest into those things that are important, that are going to yield benefits, business incubators and research and development and stem cells like we  did with the corporate welfare to repeal some of that, that was easier to do than getting to the nuts and bolts execution of government, but it is going to be a lot of hard work over the next few years to figure out where we are wasting money, what programs aren't working. 
   Now we may have and be in agreement that the principle of a program is what we all agree on, end poverty, provide health care for kids, whatever the case may be. But the actual execution of that program may not be yielding the kind of results that we want or at the level we want. 
   There is still too much poverty. There are still too many kids out there that don't have health care. There are still too many kids that qualify for S-CHIP that aren't signed up for it. So, you know, over the course of the next year or two, as we go through the oversight hearings, we are going to be able to determine what programs work, which don't and which ones we need to fix. That is difficult to do.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Ohio. (HONORING COACH TONY NAPOLET -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I have given many speeches on the floor of the House, but none do I feel so good about as the one I am about to give about my friend and a great man in Warren, Ohio, Coach Tony Napolet. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the recently completed season and the still ongoing career of someone who is an institution in Ohio high school football in the community of Warren and the family of Warren John F. Kennedy High School. It is Coach Tony Napolet. 
   Overall, Coach Napolet has garnered three top 10 AP rankings, five State semifinal appearances, a winning percentage of 71.6 percent during his time at Warren John F. Kennedy High School and an overall coaching record of 191 wins, 84 losses and three ties. All of the records, all of the statistics and all of the awards, Mr. Speaker, cannot speak to the influential and inspirational man that is Tony Napolet. 
   Mr. Speaker, in short, he is a legend. He is funny, he is passionate, he is loyal, he cares about his kids, and he is the best. Tony Napolet is every part of what a high school football coach should be. He realizes and has always realized that the role he plays is not just that of a football coach, but as someone who is preparing young men for the next step in their lives, whether that involves football or not. 
   I had an opportunity as a young man to coach for a season with Coach Napolet at Kennedy, and you think about how you try to define, Mr. Speaker, or pick a couple of points that really describe Coach Napolet, and there are a couple that I think of. One is his faith in God, something that he is not afraid to share with his players, the students at Kennedy, and it is not just the prayer before the game, and it is not just the mass that we go to before the game. 
   It is when you go to a mass during the week or in the morning and you see Coach Napolet at one of the many churches, Catholic churches, in the City of Warren, where he is actually practicing what he is preaching. I remember him telling the kids to have a relationship with God, to make God your best friend. It is that kind of an example that he sets for his kids. 
   But there is another one, the St. Henry's Division V State championship game several months ago, that I think really sticks with these kids. And it is the situations that Coach Napolet is in and how he responds to them, because life many times is about how you respond to situations in your life. 
   The Kennedy team was, unfortunately, down 21-7. Then they got the ball, and then they were down 28-7 towards the end of the game and only a few minutes left, and the Kennedy offense got the ball back, and they ran a flee-flicker. They tried to score. 
   Regardless of how much time was left in the game, Coach Napolet was teaching these kids that you never give up. You persevere, regardless of what the circumstances are. And those are the lessons that he has taught those young men who have graduated from Kennedy and have played football for the Warren John F. Kennedy Eagles. 
   So, today, Mr. Speaker, I am not honoring a coach and his distinct record but rather a great man who also happens to be a coach. 
   Coach Napolet, we love you and you really are the best.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for the opportunity. 
   I am proud to have joined as the lead Democratic cosponsor with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) on the House version of this legislation. I would like to thank Mr. Sensenbrenner, Senator Brownback, and Senator Kennedy for their leadership in moving this bill. 
   Last year, Congresswoman DeLauro and I introduced legislation called Reducing the Need for Abortions and Supporting Parents Act which contains a provision similar to what is in this bill before us now. 
   What this bill does is make a commitment to new and expectant mothers whose child receives a diagnosis for Down syndrome or other prenatally or postnatally diagnosed conditions. Society will be there, and it tells them that society will be there to support you. We will bring every resource to bear to ensure that you are able to raise a beautiful baby. 
   Never should a pregnant woman feel that her options are limited by a lack of public support for the types of social services that could help her, her family, and her baby.     
   The sad reality, Madam Speaker, is that over 90 percent of pregnancies with a diagnosis of Down Syndrome are aborted. This should not and need not be the case. We have not done enough to help these women and their families. We must do more to get them the support they need, the support they deserve, and this bill is a crucial step in that direction. 
   Lastly, I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader BOEHNER and my friends on the other side of the aisle for working together to get this common ground legislation passed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman and I thank Mr. Walsh, the ranking member, for putting such a terrific bill together that is going to allow our Nation to compete in the global economy of the 21st century. 
   This bill makes investments in our kids, this bill makes investments in our workers, and this bill makes investments in American families. If our kids and our workers are healthy and educated, then we will be able to compete in the global economy. 
   I think it is important, just with this bill, if we look at what is going to happen next year when these investments hit, when students and workers are going to get a Pell Grant and it is $500 or $600 or $700 more for them. Tack that on to the education bill last week, where interest rates will be cut in half. Tack that on to the Energy and Water appropriations bill, where we are investing in our scientists and alternative energy research and we are creating new sectors of the economy so that we can compete in a global economy. 
   The anxiety that has been felt across this country over the last couple of years has been profound, and this bill helps address the challenges that American families have had. By reducing the cost of education, by making sure that we have community health clinics for people to go and take their kids, with the SCHIP program, this bill will have more to do with us being a competitive country in the next couple of decades, I think, than anything else we could possibly do. 
   So I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member and say that this is a bipartisan bill. This came out of the committee with the unanimous support of Democrats and Republicans, who agree that these investments needed to be made. 
   Madam Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman again and thank the Republicans for their support.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island. And I also find it a bit peculiar that our friend from Florida, being from Ohio, we disagree on our favorite college basketball team, we disagree on our favorite college football team, so it is not a real surprise that we are going to disagree here. But I find it peculiar that he was saying that he was trying to support the workers. And I wish he would remember the vote on the minimum wage when he and the leadership of his party were consistently trying to prevent us from passing the minimum wage to help the American worker. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to make a point here because I think what just happened on this House floor 5 minutes ago was extraordinary. 
   For a member of the Republican Party to get up and defend what has happened here and the investments that we're making I think exposes what's been going on here for the last several months, is that we have a fringe group, Mr. Chairman, of Members of this Congress who consistently get up and try to pin Members against each other, try to find specific programs and somehow expose somebody as somehow being irresponsible. And I think it's extraordinary what happened here, that we have an extreme group in this Congress that consistently tries to divide us when we're trying to get the people's work done. 
   This is the United States of America, and the gentleman from New Jersey benefits from the Federal court system that helps Wall Street thrive. It's the rule of law in this country that is funded by the taxpayer, courts, judges, buildings, the rule of law, and that allows Wall Street to benefit. That allows citizens in New Jersey to earn a good living and to pay taxes. 
   And we have Members from Texas, Mr. Chairman, the great investment that this country has made into that great State, NASA, the universities, Texas has benefited from those investments. 
   Members from the West, where the West wouldn't even exist, we have congressional districts that wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the investment of the Federal Government to build dams. The Colorado River Basin Project--there wouldn't be congressional districts in the West if it wasn't for the Federal investment. 
   We're the United States of America, for God's sake, and let's stop trying to divide each other. Let's recognize that this bill has been supported unanimously from the Appropriations Committee, Democrats and Republicans, and I want to thank the distinguished Member from New York who put so much thought and concern into this bill, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) and gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson), who have consistently tried to make investments and recognize that people in Alaska, kids in Alaska need help, and I'm okay with that. I've never been to Alaska but we have needs. 
   Let's stop trying to divide each other and stop the lectures of fiscal responsibility. The mess we're in is here because of $3 trillion in debt that our friends have borrowed from China and Japan and OPEC countries over the past 6 years; borrowed more money, Mr. Chairman, from foreign interests than every President and Congress before them combined. 
   So enough of the lectures on fiscal responsibility. We're here now. Let's make these investments. Let's compete in a global economy by making these investments. We're competing against 1.3 billion people in China, 1.2 billion people in India. We need to make these investments. We only have 300 million people in this country. They need to be educated. They need to be healthy, and they need to live in a clean environment. That's what this bill does. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to share some of those minutes with my good friends who are here, and I just want to kind of go on the point that Mr. Murphy was making. 
   We have a situation now where everything that we've done I think is going to help average folks, middle-class folks, lower middle-class folks, poor folks, upper middle-class folks. Think about a family who in July is going to get an increase in the minimum wage, struggling to get by, looking to get a little boost, and they get the boost because of a new Democratic Congress and the priorities of the Speaker that we're going to implement. 
   And then you have a kid in school or you have young kids that need health care, and you're going to now be able to access the SCHIP program. You're going to be able to go to more community health clinics because there's been an increase of hundreds of millions of dollars. Some more people are able to be covered.     
   Then, if you are in a State like Ohio, where the Governor, Governor Strickland, used to be a Member of this body, signed a budget that has a zero percent increase in tuition costs this year and next year, that used to be 9 percent on average in Ohio. 
   Now this same family has an increase in the minimum wage; they have a $500 increase in the Pell Grant. They have student loans they are taking out that will be cut in half from 6.8 to 3.4 percent. If they have young toddlers, they will be covered under SCHIP. This family now will be a healthy, educated productive family in the United States of America, so that the 300 million people we have in this country can all be on the field competing against China for us, competing against 1.3 billion people in China for the United States, competing against 1.2 billion people in India for the United States. 
   Now, isn't that a good thing? Aren't these good, smart, targeted investments? I would say they are, and the benefits that we are going to yield from these investments are going to serve us for generations to come. We did a study in Ohio years ago; I think the University of Akron did the study. For every dollar the State of Ohio invested in higher education, they got $2 back in tax money, because those people made $40,000 a year instead of $20,000 a year. 
   Now, this is a good investment. These are good investments for us to make. Long term, they are going to make us more competitive. When you look at what we are doing, what we are trying to do with stem cell research, what we are trying to do with alternative energy research, this is good stuff.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We are trying to compete with 1.3 billion people in China, 1.2 billion people in India. We only have 300 million people in the country. 
   So it seems to me that these investments that we are making are very wise, targeted investments. There is no tax increase. But what we are saying is, is it better to make sure that the banks have an increased inflated profit margin, or is it better for us as a country, the public, to make those investments in the families and basically give these families a tax cut? These middle-class families are getting a tax cut. 
   If you are taking out a loan, and you have two, three, four people in your family, you have a couple of kids going to school, both parents work, you are making 60 or $70,000 a year, and you are taking out a student loan, and last year if you took it out it was 6.8 percent and if you take it out this year and it's 3.4 percent, that's a tax cut for that family. When you go to file for the Pell Grant next year, and there is an increase of 4 or 5 or $600, that is a tax cut for a middle-class family. 
   What we are saying is we have a totally different philosophy from the Republican Party. They are cutting taxes in half over the past 6 or 7 years for the top 1 percent of income earners in the country. 
   We are saying, and the American people will make a judgment on this in the next election, would they rather have their Congress give a tax cut to someone who makes $1 million a year, or would they rather have us make the investments in the Pell Grant, in SCHIP, in community health clinics, reduce and cutting student loan interest rates in half and investing in alternative energy? Because that's what we are saying. 
   We would rather make these investments. We haven't raised taxes on anybody at all. That's the beauty of this whole thing, is we are just shifting our priorities. Instead of $14 billion going to the oil companies and corporate welfare, we are investing that money in alternative energy research. Instead of having billions of dollars go to the banks, we are investing that money into kids and giving them more access to college education, raising the minimum wage. 
   The American people, and many people are seeing, we all are seeing the numbers of Congress right now. We are not good, we understand that. But when these budgets hit, and the American people file their taxes next year, and they see there has been no increase, but yet they go to file for a Pell Grant and they see an increase in that and they see the student loan rate has been cut in half for the loan last year they had to take out for their kids and they get a boost in the minimum wage, and we are hiring thousands of scientists to do research and development through the energy bill that we passed last week, or that we will pass this week, these are the things that the American people will recognize, will understand and will see and these are going to yield long-term benefits. 
   One final point, the Republican Party has had their opportunity over the past 6 years to fully implement their whole agenda. They had a Republican House, huge majority, Republican Senate, Republican White House. 
   They implemented the extreme neoconservative domestic agenda and foreign policy agenda, and the country has never been in worse shape. 
   Their philosophy, there is no more debate, what are we going to debate? They have had the chance to do it. They have done it. It's over. They have implemented it. 
   We have got the chart you showed, all the money borrowed from China, you know, all the money borrowed from foreign interests, the wages stagnant for 30 years, a foreign policy that's an atrocity right now, not a friend in the world. 
   So they have had a chance, and the American people have been kind enough to give us a chance, and they are going to be very proud. I understand that they may not all have felt yet what is going to come their way, but I believe that early next year, when our budget is implemented and they are having a chance to actually experience what we have done, they are going to say they are the Democrats again, and we are glad they are back in power.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think that is such a poignant argument to make. Our friends on the other side are basically saying we are against the minimum wage, we are against increases in the Pell Grants, we are for higher interest rates for students to take out loans to go to school, we are against stem cell research. We are against research in alternative energy. They were for offering amendments to cut the budget for all the increases we were making, instead of giving the money to the oil companies to put in alternative energy. They were offering amendments to cut that. 
   When we offered earlier on to strip the oil companies of the $14 billion in corporate welfare they were getting, our friends voted against it, the extremists in their party. So you are exactly right. What are you for? What are you for? 
   I think we are quite clear as to what we are for on this side: lower student interest rates, more money for grants to go to college, higher minimum wage, focus on alternative energy, secure the country, 3,000 more Border Patrol agents in this country, technology to monitor biological chemical weapons on our ports, more funds for police and fire interoperability through the walkie-talkies, and able to talk and communicate with each other. 
   I mean, we have got a real agenda here.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. The bottom line is that this is not just us, or the Democrats or the American people. Mr. Meek, Mr. Murphy, these are the soldiers who are coming back. 
   I don't know what your personal experiences have been, but the soldiers in my district who have come back, and I meet them for a cup of coffee at the coffee shop and they talk off the record, they say, Get us out because this is insane. It is ridiculous. The only thing we all hear from the soldiers who say I want to go back, they say they want to go back because their buddies are over there. They are not going back because there is some great cause that the President has outlined for them. They are so far beyond that. They go back because their buddies are there, and God bless them. Those are the kind of buddies that we all want. 
   I think it is important that that picture that you showed, Mr. Meek, and what the minority party is trying to do here by not giving us enough votes to override a Presidential veto in the House and in the Senate is they are complicit in following President George W. Bush's foreign policy that has taken this country right off the cliff. Mr. Meek, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Speaker, $600 billion, thousands of lives lost, innocent people in Iraq getting bombed. 
   And here's the bottom line that I think the country needs to know and completely understand. This President has made the country less safe. There are more terrorists today that are gunning at the United States than ever before. Even pre-9/11, and now al Qaeda is coming out and saying we are stronger than we have ever been. We are as strong as we were on 9/11. 
   We have thousands and thousands of more terrorists who want a gun to come at the United States. There are sleeper cells I am sure in the United States, but when we try to pass a Homeland Security bill that funds 3,000 more Border Patrol agents, that puts the proper equipment and the proper technology on the borders to make sure that when the cargo is coming into the ports that those are checked, that our first responders have the proper equipment that they need, the Republican minority basically filibustered in the House and tried to stop that from happening. 
   So what we are saying here is that if we don't quickly rectify this problem and start making investments that we can go after Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda instead of this mess that we are in in Iraq, then we are more vulnerable as a country. And if something happens in this country, it lays right at the footsteps of the White House because we have been fighting this war. It has been ridiculous. The whole concept has been ridiculous. George Herbert Walker Bush said it was crazy to go into Iraq. This has not made any sense since the beginning. And now we are wasting $600 billion fighting a war in some country that we don't know a whole lot about instead of focusing that money on making sure that we get Osama bin Laden, making sure that we destroy al Qaeda. That's the war. 
   And so if al Qaeda hits the United States of America, it is because George Bush led us into a war in a country that didn't have any al Qaeda members in it.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, $50 million for children's health care or 5 months more in Iraq, let the American people make that decision. Poll that, get the focus group out and figure that one out, where the American people are going to be. They're going to be with the leadership. They're going to be with the Speaker. They're going to be with the majority leader in the Senate. They're going to be for making these investments. 
   And I just love, Mr. Speaker, how our Republican counterparts went way back to 1992, they went into the deep parts of the Republican library, the CATO Institute and everywhere else, and they pulled out the 1992 talking points, and they've dusted them off and everything's socialism and union bosses. And it's typical of why they're not in power.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. That's the God's honest truth of where we are. The force of the American people broke through in the election, but it is yet to penetrate the ideology of the Republican leadership and the Republicans in the House, many of them, and everything is coming down to priorities. It's all coming down to priorities. 
   And when Mr. Murphy and Mr. Pallone and yourself are talking about making this investment in the children's health care, poor kids getting health care, our friends on the other side are so void of any ideas on how to make America competitive in the 21st century that they have got to scream socialism, and I urge all of our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to go back to the 1930s and 1940s and 1950s and 1960s. The only argument our friends on the extreme right have is socialism. 
   We're talking about a bill that passed out of the Appropriations Committee with bipartisan support. The Members who are coming down here are extremists. They are the extreme neoconservatives who have implemented their policy over the last 6 years and have run this country domestically into the ground, have run our foreign policy into the ground, and now all they have is names to call us. 
   Well, go out, and when these millions of kids have health care, go to them and say, you know what, you really shouldn't get that health care because it's socialism, okay? When you go to college and you have an extra 700 bucks in a Pell grant or over the next few years it will be an increase of over $1,000 by 2011, from $4,050 to over $5,000, go to that college family, the parents that are struggling to pay for that, and let our friends on the other side say we have no business helping you with college; that's not the role of government, Mr. Speaker, that's socialism. And when we cut student interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, I urge all of our friends on the other side, go to all the millions of families across this country and say we don't want to do that, that's socialism; let the free market work. 
   These banks have been sucking off the government for years. We didn't raise taxes to do this. All we did was say the banks aren't going to make a big profit on the student loans. We're going to give it to the kids and give them a nice 3.4 percent rate so they can go get an education and go get a job and go create wealth and go start a business and hire people that are going to pay taxes to keep tax rates low for everybody. 
   They're void of ideas, and this is the best investment. I mean, this is great. We get to go, over the course of the next year, and campaign on this? This is good stuff.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Can I make a point because I think this is so important. There's not been a tax increase here. This is not where the President can say, I'm going to veto this bill because the Democrats increased taxes on someone. 
   What we did is we shifted this money that was going to the banks and allowed them to charge students 6.8 percent. It was basically corporate welfare, and we're saying that that same amount of money that went to them is going to go to more students for cheaper loans, less interest rates, 3.4 percent instead of 6.8 percent, just a shift in the money, shift in priorities. 
   So what the President's basically saying is I would rather have the banks make the profit than expand student loans to more kids and more parents. Now, that's just reading the facts. Ignore our rhetoric.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Ratified by the Democratic Caucus. 
   But what I think is interesting about all of this is that when you look at today we passed the minimum wage bill. Historic. Look at what we have been able to do with the 9/11 Commission report; what we were able to do with ethics reform; what we are going to do with negotiating drug prices; what we are going to do with stem cell research. When you look at what will be done in just a few weeks, the light of government and the power of government over the past 10, 12 years has been used really to take and help the top 1 percent of the people in the country, whether it was for tax cuts for millionaires or corporate welfare for oil companies or energy companies, whether it was for corporate welfare for the pharmaceutical industry, but the resources and the energy of this body were being used and the levers of government were being used to help that very small percentile of the American people who had the ability to invest in stocks, who have the ability to move their investments abroad to China and other countries and ship their goods back here and who take advantage of the tax cuts and make money off of corporate welfare. They just benefitted in every single way. 
   But if you look at what we have done and what we are going to do in the next couple of days, we raised the minimum wage, which will affect millions of Americans, 3 1/2 million women and children, lifting them out of poverty. And you can pull all the stats you want, but the bottom line is that people who make minimum wage are going to make more now in the United States of America. And that is not saying we have done anything tremendous. That should have been done years ago. 
   When you look at what we are going to do with student loans, cutting the rates for student loans in half for both students and parents, loans that have come out. Cut the interest rate in half. That will save the average person who takes out a loan $5,000 over the course of the loan. 
   So now you have an increase in the minimum wage, now you have a reduced loan payment because the interest rate has been cut in half and you are going to save money on that, and then, if you are parents or grandparents, like Mr. Delahunt, and qualify for Medicare, there is going to be less money out of your pocket to spend on prescription drugs because we are going to use the ability and the power of this program to reduce the cost of drugs for our senior citizens.  
   I will be happy to yield, but just in those three things, those three areas, Mr. Delahunt, average people are going to benefit, and we have only been here 2 weeks.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. What I thought was funny today, or yesterday, in one of the local Capitol Hill newspapers, Roll Call or The Hill, the financial sector, the folks who lend money to the students were squawking, and it was blatant right in the article, because they are going to have reduced profits. Well, I am sorry, we are not here to make sure that you get good profits. We are here to make sure that students in the United States of America can afford to go to college and that they can go out and make good profits. This is not an enterprise here for you to tap into and let the money come shooting out. 
   And I am happy to yield to my colleague, Ms. Wasserman Schultz.

We are not petering around the edges. I think the people out there that wanted us to be bold, they are seeing bold.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. This is not just Democrats. I have not talked to a Democrat yet who thinks that escalating this war is a good idea, and our new direction is not just continuing down the same war with more troops. But I just want to share a few quotes that I did some research on and pulled out that I think are indicative of what's going on here. 
   Colin Powell, as my friend from Florida said earlier, quote: I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work. That is Colin Powell, who basically led us into this mess that we are in. 
   Oliver North said, quote: A surge, or targeted increase in U.S. troop strength, for whatever the politicians want to call dispatching more combat troops to Iraq, isn't the answer. Adding more trainers and helping the Iraqis to help themselves is. Sending more U.S. combat troops is simply sending more targets. That is Oliver North. I found that in Human Events online. 
   Major General Don Shepherd, United States Air Force retired: I would not even consider increasing troop strength in Iraq. Shepherd, who works as a CNN military analyst, offered this analysis of what should be done next after he was briefed by members of the Iraqi Study Group. He wrote, quote: I would not even consider, again, I would not even consider increasing troop strength. 
   And I will give you one more, as we are going through this. Michael Vickers, former Special Forces officer, who  said the security situation is inextricably linked to politics. If you can solve some of the Iraqi political problems, the security situation becomes manageable. 
   If you cannot, all the forces in the world aren't going to change that, and I found that on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer on PBS of December 12 of 2006. 
   So this is coming from Republicans. This is coming from Democrats. This is coming from people all over the country.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. While we were down here, you were probably running through bingo halls and bowling alleys; and Mr. Altmire, who is just across the border from me in western Pennsylvania, I think the impact that you have already had on Congress, you have all spoken on the floor. You all did and have done numerous press events representing our party, and I think you have done a tremendous job. So it is good to have you here with certain expertise, whether it is health care or labor, whatever the issue may be. We have got a very talented freshman class. 
   The reason we are still down here and we just did not quit when the elections were over is that this is about more than just the 100 hours, and we are going to hammer this 100 hours home and get it through and do what the American people asked us to do. But kind of the new energy and spirit that you guys bring is going to move us well past that 100 hours into something that is going to be very special. 
   So I would be happy to yield over to my friend from Pennsylvania right across the border, the same media market.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I just want to make a point, and we try to distinguish our party from what the previous party has done in that we are getting some feedback from the other side, that we are phasing this thing in and it is not immediate, and we are not doing everything that we could possibly be doing. We are doing a heck of a lot more than they have done. We have done more in the last 3 hours today on the House floor than they have done in the previous 14 years in running this place for average students. 
   So we are not going to take it. We are doing more than they have done, and you know what, if they did not have us at a $400 billion deficit, we would be doing a heck of a lot more. The only constraints we have are the fiscal mess that they left us.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate you being so gracious with your time. You mentioned the number 356-71. 71 people in this Chamber voted against cutting student loan interest rates in half. That is the extreme of the extreme in politics today, and that is why I guess you two gentlemen are here joining us, part of the reason anyway, is because that is the kind of extremism, Mr. Speaker, that was running this Chamber for 14 years, and we brought just a wee little bit of sanity to this place. 
   And then a beautiful segue into what we are going to do tomorrow: Tomorrow we are going to start repealing the Big Oil subsidies that have been doled out by the same Congress, and I would guess that you are probably going to get another 70-some Members on the other side that are going to be against repealing these major subsidies tomorrow. Major leases that these folks were getting, one of them gave, Conoco-Phillips gave $106 million back in 2005 as it enjoyed profits totaling $13.5 billion. 
   So you are voting against cutting student loan interest rates in half. You are the ones who plugged in the super wealthy and the super plugged in into a Tax Code that is going to save you $106 million when you are making $13.5 billion. 
   So I am excited about what is happening here because this is a great time where the American people are starting to wrestle back the power that the American people have given us, and we are doing it on behalf of them. 
   I want to yield to the young new Irish Member of Congress.

   Tomorrow is going to be another stellar performance on behalf of Speaker Pelosi and the leaders of the Democratic Congress. Tomorrow we are going to close tax loopholes for oil companies. We are going to close a loophole that gave ConocoPhillips $106 million in 2005 when it got profits of $13.5 billion. 
   Profits of $13.5 billion. They didn't, you know, take it in and then have to dish it out. That is their profit. 
   We stepped up and had the guts to say, and I would like to take more because they are making so much money, but we are going to take $106 million and pay for student loans and health care for young people. We are going to move forward on this agenda. 
   There are a lot of other things that we are going to be able to do. We will do the tax loophole thing. We will roll back the energy bill tax breaks for geological and geophysical expenditures. These are things that may get too technical, but the bottom line is this: The bottom line is that the American people are going to get the kind of representation they need. 
   If you know you are going to go and dig, if you know you are going to go and drill and you know you are going to make enough money, no tax incentive is going to make you want to do it, especially when you are drawing down profits of $15.5 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, $100 million of public subsidy is not going to make that happen. 
   And then you get into the five royalty relief provisions, this is beautiful, from the 2005 energy bill. This measure will strike the energy bill provisions, suspending royalty fees from oil and gas companies operating in certain deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 
   The interesting thing about this is, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), a great Member of this body, offered an amendment to strike this provision on April 21 of 2005, and it was defeated by 203-227. We have been trying to do this, and tomorrow is our day where we get to step up and actually deliver on behalf of the American people.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Thank you. Yes, right over the border from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
   As I was listening to you talk, and everyone kind of mentioned some different issues. But if you are the average person sitting home and you have all these politicians, Mr. Speaker, making all these political promises and then actually delivering, that in and of itself is a monumental occasion for many people to celebrate. 
   But as I was listening and just thinking, if you are home, it is not just that we have accomplished this, but what the actual effects are when these legislative acts get put into law and signed by the President, if the President, in fact, signs them. He said maybe he was going to veto the minimum wage and the Medicare, but just look at what we have done. 
   We have raised the minimum wage. That is maybe a couple thousand dollars raise for most people. We can talk about the student loan issue, whether it is $2,000 over the course of the loan or $4,000 or $5,000 over the course of the loan, depending on when you get in school. You are talking about maybe $5,000, $6,000, or $7,000 a year that the average family is now going to have at the table that they didn't have a couple years ago when they were trying to  do the math and trying to work out their checkbook. 
   Then there is the prescription drug bill. Once that gets implemented and we actually reduce the cost of prescription drugs, that is going to have another significant impact. So they may be working a minimum wage job, or someone in the family may be working a minimum wage job to contribute. You are going to have the student loan rate lowered, and then a reduction in the cost of prescription drugs. That is significant. 
   It is great that we actually did what we said we were going to do, Mr. Meek, and I couldn't agree with your eloquence any more. But the act itself, right down to the kitchen table, Mr. Speaker, this is making a difference.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It is making a difference to average families. 
   And over the King holiday, the great thing is to go back and start reading some of the old speeches and the letter from the Birmingham jail where he talked about a sense of urgency. You know: Don't ask us to wait. What are we going to wait for? You go wait. 
   Well, I think that is the attitude Speaker Pelosi and our leadership took, and we didn't wait; we actually implemented this stuff. And when it is all said and done, I think no matter where any of our careers end, whether it is in the next term or retirement or some higher office, we are going to be able to see in our scrapbooks that my Aunt Rita keeps for me, I have a little Aunt Rita who cuts out my clippings and puts them in a little book, but we will be able to look back at all we have done throughout our careers and say, I was here when this all happened. I was in the United States Congress when this all happened. That is special, and that is why we are all so very excited.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It is not just the President. It is enough Members of Congress on the Republican side primarily that are standing by the President. They have to go to the voters next year and say, in my last term in Congress, I stood by President Bush. The thing is that when you talk about the war funding, the waste, the no-bid contracts, the Pentagon losing billions of dollars and nobody knows where it is, you don't hear our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, come up and pitch a fit about that. But if you want to talk about $1 billion or $2 billion more in health, education, job retraining, all of a sudden the sky is falling. All of a sudden the party that raised the debt limit five times and borrowed $3 trillion under President Bush is now concerned with a shift in funding to college education, Mr. Meek, to community health clinics, Mr. Altmire, to Head Start, to these fundamental programs that this country has stood behind. And the kicker is SCHIP, $35 billion over 5 years, and the President says that's too much spending so we can't provide health care for 10 million kids, poor kids, but we can just turn  around without a blink of an eye and ask for $200 billion to keep the war going in Iraq, without any kind of deadlines or timelines or any kind of shift in the focus. That's the frustrating part. 
   Before I yield to my friend, I would just like to say there has been a pattern here. On September 11 or after September 11, Mr. Murphy, it was go shopping. And then during the whole SCHIP debate, it was, well, they can go to the emergency room, these kids. Then during Katrina it was, ``You're doing a good job, Brownie,'' consistently these flippant remarks that the President tends to make that lacks an understanding of the seriousness of some of these situations. 
   So it is frustrating as we are trying to make some investments into the United States of America, into this country, and the President consistently, with a small band of Republican supporters, is able to veto this, and unfortunately, we don't have enough votes in the House yet to override these vetoes. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It's interesting, and I think you made the right point. It seems like the President has one priority, and one and only one, and that is the funding of the war. What is interesting is when you look at the Labor-HHS bill, some of the other bills we are trying to pass that increase the Pell Grants and some of the other things, we are not getting the level of support we should. 
   These vets need those programs. These veterans that are coming back, it's not like they are making a lot of money, many of them with their kids they are trying to send to college. So why wouldn't this apply? The vets aren't just fighting for the Defense appropriations bill that passes out of the House or the VA benefit package that passes out of the House. The veterans are fighting for America. They are fighting for a strong country that does research and development. Veterans have family members who get cancer. So they are very concerned, I would think, Mr. Speaker, with investments at NIH to continue cancer research. They have kids that may need health care. They have kids that go to school. They may have a kid that wants to participate in a Head Start program. In each instance, Mr. Altmire, our fearless leader in this 30-Something group tonight, these vets are fighting for what makes America great, and that is freedom, that is investment, that is a strong economy. Those are the kind of things we are investing in. 
   So to say your only priority is the war and spending what is now projected by the end of the year $1.3 trillion in the war. The President says, and a small group of recalcitrant Republicans say here in the House: We can't fund it because we don't have the money to put in the health care and everything else.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to be here once again to continue the discussion of the 30-something Working Group. We want to thank Speaker  Pelosi for the honor to be on the House floor. 
   We actually had one of our newer Members, Mr. Speaker, make page 3. He is still a freshman, but he made significant advances. This is Jason Altmire, Mr. Speaker, from western Pennsylvania. His district abuts mine. His picture, name, pressing our leadership to make sure that we increase funding in the CR for veterans, to make sure that we did not accept any pay raise until the American people get their pay raise through the minimum wage. So we already have young leaders stepping up to bat contributing in their first term here. 
   I have got to say, Mr. Speaker, it has just been I actually think in many ways pathetic to listen to the debate here today over the continuing resolution. We all know the political situation over the past, you know, 14 years, Republican control in the Congress, and their inability in the last several years to govern at all. And they have locked out the Democrats for years and years and years. 
   Votes in the wee hours of the morning on the prescription drug benefit, on the energy bill, on budgets, which raided student aid money for students all across our country; and then, on top of all of that, they leave the new Democratic majority an absolute budget catastrophe for us to deal with. 
   Over the course of those 14 years, the Republican Congress and the Republican President borrowed more money, more money from foreign interests than all of the previous Presidents combined. So now we are going to get lectures from the Republican majority on how to run the budget process. Now we are going to get lectures from the most incompetent, ineffective Congress in the history of this institution, Mr. Speaker, the history of this institution. 
   This party will not be lectured about veterans' benefits, we will not be lectured to by the Republican minority about how to balance a budget, and we will not be lectured to about investments in this country. 
   You look at this CR and you look what we put in. We are not going to be lectured to by anybody. We made promises and accomplished more in the last few hundred hours of this Congress than that Republican majority has in the last 14 years. We implemented PAYGO so we will balance the budget. 
   We made some difficult decisions with the CR so we can move forward, and we are not going to be lectured to. Because we have made promises, and we have delivered. 
   Now just look at the first hundred hours, Mr. Speaker, just the first hundred hours. We cut student loan interest rates in half. Once fully implemented, it will save the average person taking out a loan almost $5,000. 
   We raised the minimum wage. We allowed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices on behalf of the Medicare recipients. We repealed the corporate welfare to the energy companies that that majority, Republican majority put in place; and we are taking that money and investing it into alternative energy sources. We are doing things positive for the American people. 
   And we are going to inherit this budget, which we already have, that has borrowed more money from China, borrowed more money from Japan, borrowed money from OPEC countries, incapable of executing FEMA to address natural disasters and emergency situations in the United States. We know how to run Government. 
   When the Democrats passed the budget in 1993 with the Democratic President, created 20 million new jobs, we had surpluses as far as the eye can see. So we are cleaning up a mess here that we have inherited, and we are going to move forward and continue with our agenda, and we are proud. 
   We are going to move forward, and we have an agenda. We have moved on it. We promised it. We acted on it. And we are going to continue to move on it. 
   I will yield to our young, new rising star from western Pennsylvania, Mr. Altmire.

   The funny part watching the debate today was that the other side, because they had the opportunity for so long to pass so many of these pieces of legislation and to get them through the Senate and get them signed by the President and they didn't take advantage of it, that they have very little credibility in dealing with the issue of the fact that we are actually doing this stuff.

That is why I think they have lost a lot of credibility with the American people, Mr. Speaker, is because there is no consistency with their argument.

   As we close, because I know we just have a few minutes left, and I want to yield back to my friend from Florida, I think it is very interesting what we are seeing happening already. We talked a lot in the last couple of years about oversight and that when the Democrats were in charge, Mr. Speaker, we were going to provide oversight. 
   Now, we start seeing things open up in Iraq, with all these contracts, from all these big corporations who were getting all these big government contracts, all of the sudden you are starting to see come out of these committee hearings exactly what has been going on. Now you are starting to see maybe the administration was strong arming some scientists to spin global climate change data. You are starting to see this all percolate up. 
   I think one of the other things we said we are going to do is execute our constitutional obligation to provide oversight, and we are seeing that, and we are seeing the results of that with the global warming, with the war in Iraq, things happening, that didn't happen in Katrina, all starting to rise up. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from the Pittsburgh area and the gentleman from Connecticut, my two favorite people from Florida. I want to thank you and I yield to Ms. Wasserman Schultz for her closing remarks.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman, and I appreciate you coming down here and anchoring the 30-Something hour. 
   I think it is important as we are talking about the financial issues just over the last couple of days, and I think you laid it out pretty well, a 500-point drop and then a 100 or so increase, and then a 450-point drop today, these are markets that are so destabilized that we are losing companies that were established since before the Great Depression. The only financial house that seems to be left is the Department of the Treasury. And this has been because of the lack of regulation on the markets, period, dot. 
   It may be convenient, Mr. Speaker, to say we need to deregulate. You need law and order in order to build a capitalistic system. The capitalistic system doesn't come first. The magic with capitalism was that we had courts in place and regulatory bodies in place to make sure that contracts could be enforced, to make sure that investments were sound, not necessarily the decision that each person in the country would make would be sound decisions, not that every loan that they would take out would be sound, but there were precautions in place to make sure that this whole operation was stabilized and regulated. 
   And you look at what happened to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s, and you look at what is happening now; it is because there wasn't the proper watchdog in place. 
   I think putting the Republicans--as you stated earlier, there may be a difference between some of our friends on the other side of the aisle a few years back and the ones today--it is like putting a drunk in charge of the liquor cabinet, putting the Republicans in charge of Wall Street. I mean, let's be honest. Total deregulation. 
   The whole answer was, well, we will deregulate everything, and we will have competition. In Ohio, it was deregulate energy, and it led to an increase in prices. That's what has happened. 
   So we have this destabilized market here in the United States now, not knowing what is going to happen from one day to the next, losing businesses that were around since before the Great Depression. A long history of stability has been destabilized by the Republican agenda. 
   Now, look at all of the different things that have happened. I think this is the issue, the point. In 2000 the Republicans controlled the House, the Republicans controlled the Senate, the Republicans controlled the White House, and look at what has happened. Look at what has transpired in the past 8 years with President Bush. 
   The only sign of any movement in another direction is when the Democrats took over the Congress a year and a half ago, with issues getting vetoed by President Bush. But look at what has happened over those years. 
   My point is, before I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, is that we don't have to think about what America would look like with a neoconservative Republican agenda. We know. It has been implemented. And for all of our friends on the other side of the aisle to somehow erase history like you can erase your computer memory and think that the American people don't remember that they were in charge for all of these years and implemented their health-care policy, their energy policy, their education policy, their foreign policy, and where we are today on all of those issues, you don't have to believe me, you don't have to believe Nancy Pelosi, Mr. Speaker, you don't have to believe JASON ALTMIRE, these are two diametrically opposed philosophies on how to govern. 
   As you stated, in the 1990s with the Democrats in charge of the Congress and the Presidency, it passed a budget that led to the greatest economic expansion in the history of the country, 20 million new jobs. And you look at what President Bush did with the Republican Congress: Took us right off the cliff. 
   We were talking about in the Clinton years what we were going to do with the surplus. One of the debates that President Clinton pushed forward was save Social Security first. So he was going to take this money and put it into the Social Security fund so we didn't have all of these IOUs for all of these years. 
   Now the question in Washington and in Youngstown, Ohio, and in Georgia and in western Pennsylvania, here is the question: What if the Republican Party had their way when they wanted to privatize Social Security? Imagine, with everything that is going on in the market today, if President Bush and Senator McCain and all of the House Republicans who were down here on the floor fighting for a Republican privatization scheme for Social Security, imagine if that last base security system that you have in place here, the American people have in place, was all in the stock market today? Just think about what a radical idea that is.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. The point I want to add to what you're talking about is, what if this would have happened? 
   It seems like we always have people in Washington, if something major happens, like a major insurance company or a major investment company or a major bank, it's like Washington, D.C. will step all over each other as to who's going to help them first, who's going to bail them out, who's going to give them something to make everything all right. And I don't want this to sound like we don't understand the ripple effect of what could happen if some of these entities aren't helped. We understand that. 
   But when it was the average person who made a mistake with their housing loan, hey, you're on your own. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. 
   Well, Lehman Brothers, you pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Merrill Lynch, you pull yourself up by your bootstraps. 
   I'm not saying you don't need to take responsibility for your actions because you certainly do. But when we needed to help 10 million kids get health care through the State Children's Health Insurance Program, President Bush says we don't have the money. $35 billion over 5 years. We spend $10 billion a month in Iraq, but the President and a small group of radical Republicans in the House said we don't have the money for this. It's too much. It would be 3 1/2 months in Iraq. 
   But if something like this happens where we have all this, a big major financial company, something happens, well, here we are, all of a sudden we've got more money. 
   Think about what the Republican Congress and Republican President did to our financial situation, not just how they destabilized the markets. I don't know if you got into this, Mr. Altmire, before I got here or not. But think about what they did. They raised the debt limit five times. Maybe six. I may be missing one. Five times. They borrowed $3 trillion from China, Japan and OPEC countries. 
   Now you want to talk about putting the next generation behind the eight-ball, go borrow $3 trillion from our biggest competitor in China and watch them wipe out manufacturing in Pennsylvania, in Ohio and all over the industrial Midwest. 
   Don't regulate the markets. Don't invest in education. Make tuition costs go up 8, 9, 10 percent a year all over the country. The Pell Grant was almost meaningless. Student loans were 6.8 percent last year. 
   All of these issues add up to saying they weren't paying attention. Their philosophy of government just doesn't work. That's what this whole thing says. 
   We're joined by the gentleman from Colorado, the host of the Democratic National Convention. I yield to Mr. Perlmutter.

And sad to say, here we stand, here we sit in America thinking, you know, the stock market is under 10,000, unemployment is up again. We borrowed $3 trillion. President Bush and the Republican Congress have borrowed more than any 
   previous administration in Congress, combined. Still $10 billion a month in Iraq, and no end in sight with what's going on. It's getting to the point where we can't recognize what we're doing, and it's critical what's happening to this country. It's sad what they have done.

That is the Republican agenda. 
   We, with the 30-Something Working Group, started to fight President Bush's Social Security privatization scam. The first time I walked on this floor to speak was 4 years ago or 5 years ago when President Bush wanted to 
   start the Social Security privatization, and then-Minority Leader Pelosi asked Kendrick Meek and I to come here and to combat it. 
   Now, can you imagine if they had won that battle down here, that monumental battle? Your parents' and grandparents' Social Security would now be sitting in Wall Street in a deregulated market that looks like the Wild West with a Starbucks, is what it looks like.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I agree. And there are so many different aspects for us to talk about here, but I think our friend from Cleveland has hit the nail right on the head; this is about us competing as a country. This is about us only having 300 million people in the United States, many of them poor, many of them living in your community, my community, Congressman Meek, Congressman Murphy, our communities. And what we're saying is, if we want these kids to be able to compete against 1.3 billion people in China, 1.2 billion people in India, you're not even going to get on a field unless you're healthy. And we're saying that this is a modest investment. This is $35 billion over 5 years. This is 41 days in Iraq. Now, when you think of it that way, and this has been the contrast of this whole debate; the President, over the past 6 years, has raised the debt limit for our country to go out and borrow money five times and increased the debt by over $3 trillion; $9 billion a week in Iraq; no end in sight; borrowed more money than every President before him combined, from China, from Japan, from the OPEC countries. And now, all of a sudden, in the early days of October he says he is going to, and he does, veto a bill that provides children's health care for a few million poor kids. Now, I know when I go back to my district and I talk to constituents, they cannot believe it. 
   And we have our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, telling us that this is socialism. It wasn't socialism when a Republican Congress in the 1990s put this law into action, signed by President Clinton. It was a Republican Congress controlled by Newt Gingrich, a Republican Congress.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Meek. So now, all of a sudden the same program that they helped create is now all of a sudden socialism because the Democrats control the Congress. And I think it's an absolute shame, shameful, that we would have Republican Members of this Congress come out here for ideological reasons to try to score some political points with their base with the blatant disregard of providing health care for all these kids. 
   Now, you can argue all you want, but the bottom line, Mr. Murphy, is that there are millions of kids who will not get health care because the President all of a sudden found the courage. You know, we all went to school with people like this, they pick on the little kids. Well, the President has this big military budget. He won't shrink that. He's got all these tax cuts that the wealthiest people in our country are getting. He won't touch that. But he's going to be a big strong guy and come in and take it on the backs of these kids. Shameful, Mr. Speaker, shameful that he is willing to do this, and that the Republican Congress, the Republican Members of the House, a fringe group, enough to prevent a veto override, will help this President sustain this veto. I find it shameful that we can't take 41 days of spending in Iraq, Mr. Murphy, and help provide some health care for these kids. 
   And I say this because we all know that these kids need it. I was watching Chris Matthews, and Pat Buchanan was on. And Pat Buchanan said, I think these people need to pay for it themselves. Well, if they could pay for it themselves, we wouldn't be doing this. We would be doing something else.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. These kids, these families. And we should get the quote for tomorrow, we should get the quote and we should have it out here, but these kids, these families should pay for it themselves. And they can't. And so we've got to make a decision as a country whether we're okay with that, whether we're okay with them not having the wherewithal to pay, and then no one is willing to help them. 
   But we have made the decision, in the Democratic Caucus, and many of our friends on the Republican side, excluding the President and a small group of fringe Members on their side, that somehow they're going to stand on principle here. They sat here for 6 years and didn't squawk one time about excessive spending. The President didn't veto one bill that came from this House, Republican-controlled, and a Republican-controlled Senate, but now, all of a sudden. But the American people, and I know the people in my district, see right through it, and they understand what we're trying to do and how in the long term this will be very helpful. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Can you imagine? I mean, this is just what is mind boggling. It is 2007, we're a couple of months from 2008, and the President of the United States of America says to the poorest kids in our country, you can go to the emergency room.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I mean, are you kidding me; to not have the understanding that we would save money if we gave these kids antibiotics before they end up in the emergency room 2 weeks later with pneumonia, that that doesn't save us tens of thousands of dollars, then you have no business vetoing this bill.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And the question is, what does it cost if you don't pay the $3.50 a day? You're probably paying tens of thousands on the other end. And that kid is going to end up in the classroom, Mr. Meek, with your son and your daughter and is going to end up getting them sick. Then where are we? 
   I yield to our friend from Cleveland. I know you had a point to make.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If I may, I think if you have to deficit-spend, if you have to borrow money because you need to make an investment, the Federal government's decision should be based on  the same kind of principles that a family would base the decision on. By borrowing 
   this money, are you going to yield more value down the line? So a business will buy a machine and go into debt so they have the machine, but they know long-term if they make enough widgets out of the machine that eventually they'll pay it off and they'll actually increase the value of the company. Families borrow money, like for school and for college because they know that they may have to borrow 20 or $30,000, but your son or daughter that has a college degree will be able to pay that back and have a higher standard of living throughout the course of their life. 
   So if we are borrowing money, if we are going to deficit-spend, it seems to me it would make sense that we want to invest into our own health care or education. But this President has spent and borrowed over $3 trillion, as my colleague from Miami has pointed out so eloquently. Where is the return? Where is the return on the $700 billion we have spent in Iraq? Where is the return? Lower oil prices? Lower gasoline prices? No. It has only aggravated the problem that we have in the global economy now. And when you look at what we have been trying and trying and trying to do, not with the help of very many Republicans on this particular issue, Ray Lahood, Steve LaTourette and a lot of our friends have been very helpful with this issue. But when you look overall on what we have been trying to do, we, as Democrats since Speaker Pelosi took over, we are trying to make good investments. 
   We increased the minimum wage so that average people will have a few more bucks in their pocket. We made sure that we invested billions of dollars into the Pell grant so that you will have almost $1,000 more in a Pell grant in the next 5 years. We invested money that was going to the bank so that they could make a profit loaning money to students, and we took that money and we gave it to the students and reduced the interest rate that is paid for college loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, so when you go out to get a loan, the average person will save $4,400. SCHIP. These are investments into the health of our kids. Community health clinics. We put a few hundred million dollars more, starting in the CR and then in the 2008 budget so that we can open up more health clinics so that poor families who don't have health care can at least have a first stop before they go to the emergency room. They may go earlier and will start preventing. 
   My point is, before I yield to my friend, these are all investments, Mr. Meek, Mrs. Tubbs Jones, Mr. Murphy, that are going to save the taxpayer money in the long run. They are going to make this country more competitive. They will lead to a stronger, more secure America. We are entitled here. This body has proven over the last 6 years that money is going to get spent. It's either going to the oil companies as corporate welfare and subsidies, it's going to the military-industrial complex through the war, it's going in tax cuts, primarily to the top 1 percent. I am not saying that we want to tax people. I think the corporate tax needs to be fixed. There are a lot of changes that need to be made. But the overall point is, we are making investments that are going to yield value to the country and make us stronger and more unified and more prosperous as we move into the 21st century. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Can I say something that I just find funny? I can't wait to hear you. When we walk out of here, Kendrick, it is the same thing. My mom will call me and Kendrick's mom will call and we will be like on the phone, and my mom will say tonight, I guarantee you, ``I just love Stephanie.'' That is what she will say. So I have to make sure I am quick here. 
   But the bottom line is, we are not saying that we don't want to support the military. All of us have. Mr. Meek and I sit on the Armed Services Committee. We are supportive. These are the kinds of things that we have to support, and we have to make sure we have a strong military. 
   But to your point, Mr. Murphy, no one, no one thinks wasting money is a good thing. So it seems to me that our friends on the other side have literally become a caricature of themselves. They think that the American public, Mr. Speaker, has somehow forgotten and their brain was like a computer that was erased. Like the American people's brain over the last 6 years has been completely erased, and they don't remember the $3 trillion they borrowed, they don't remember the runup to the war, they don't remember Katrina, they don't remember the FEMA fiasco, they don't remember the passports. 
   These are the guys that know how to run government? They can't even distribute passports, and they are going to give us a lecture on how we need to run our government.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I want to make one final point. Those of my friends who are in this Chamber, those people who we work with who are in the business community, when you look at this from a purely economic standpoint, what would a business person do if they were here? Would they put a little bit of the money up front and try to prevent all of these other problems from happening? Or would they say what the President said: We'll get them in the emergency room. What would a business person in 2007 do? I would guess that they would want to put the money up front. 
   Now as we end, because we only have a few minutes left, before I yield to my friend from Florida, I'm going to brag. Because on Saturday there was a middleweight title fight, and Kelly Pavlik from Youngstown, Ohio, is now the middleweight champion of the world, WBO/WBC. He had a rough second round. He went down, got back up, and was a little wobbly. But about half of the fans in Atlantic City were from Youngstown, from the Mahoning Valley and cheered him on. He came back and in the seventh round knocked out the champion. And he knocked him out. 
   We are all very proud of Kelly Pavlik. He is a great kid, 25 years old. Humble, speaks well. Just a great kid. I want to congratulate him and his family and his mom. 
   I have a great story. When he won a fight a fight or two ago, I called his house just to congratulate him. His mom answers and says, ``Who is this?'' 
   I said, ``This is Congressman Ryan.'' 
   And she said, ``Yeah, and I'm Queen Elizabeth. Who is this?'' 
   He is a great kid, and I want to congratulate him and his mom and dad and his grandmother and his little baby daughter and Jack Loew, his trainer. Just great people who represent Youngstown, Ohio, and the Mahoning Valley very well.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to once again start our 30-Something hour. We will be joined later by Congressman Meek from Florida to talk about the issues of the day and how what has been happening here in Congress affects what is going on to young people, but not limited to just young people in the 30-something bracket, but also to young people in college, young people in their 20s, young people trying to figure out how they are going to make their way in the American economy in the 21st century. 
   As we know, Mr. Speaker, we have been given many challenges over the past few years here in Congress dealing with many of the issues that face Americans. 
   Since Speaker Pelosi took over a short time ago, we have been committed, since this Congress was taken over by the Democratic Party, we have been committed to push initiatives that are consistent with the values that we hold dear in the United States of America. We hear a lot of rhetoric about values in this country, but if the policy initiatives that come out of this beautiful building in Washington, DC do not reflect our values, then we are in the wrong business. 
   And I am proud to say that since we have taken over here, we have shifted course from policies that many Americans believe have taken us in the wrong direction. And many of us still believe, even those of us here think we have made a shift in policy, but it has been difficult with the President to try to get a complete pivot out of the months and months and months and years and years and years of bad policy. 
   So I think it is important before we talk a little bit about what we have done is to go back and think about what we are trying to come out of, some of the challenges that this country faces. I think it is important to recognize politically that from 2000 until 2006, the Republican Party controlled the House, controlled the Senate, and controlled the White House. They had an opportunity to implement their policy--the neoconservative foreign policy, the conservative domestic policy, the conservative energy policy, the conservative higher-ed policy in America, the conservative ``compassionate conservative'' agenda on poverty and inequality--has all been implemented. 
   So when we talk about what will it look like if the conservative agenda is implemented, I think that is a false analysis of what will it look like. I think we know. I think what we are living with here today is the implementation of the conservative Republican agenda. They controlled the House, they controlled the Senate and the White House. The Bush tax policy, the Bush energy policy, all of these things that I have already mentioned have been implemented. 
   And if you want to know what it looks like, all you really need to do is go to the gas tank. You need to get your health care bill and see what your premium and the costs look like. You need to pull out the stub of your child's tuition. All of these things are the end result of the Republican domestic agenda being implemented here in the United States of America. You may not like it. I know a lot of Republicans, Mr. Speaker, who don't like it, but that is where we are. 
   And if you look at the financial situation that this country has been put in, the straightjacket that we have been put in that a lot of the changes that the Democratic Congress wants to make that we are at this point unable to make because of the financial position that we have been put in as a country and as a Nation, the fact of the matter is this: President Bush, Mr. Speaker, and the Republican Congresses that were under his watch borrowed more money from foreign interests than every President and Congress before President Bush combined. 
   Now think about that. In just those few years, President Bush and the Republican Congress borrowed more money from foreign interests than every President and Congress before them combined. The Republican-controlled Congress and President Bush raised the debt limit five times and borrowed $3 trillion primarily from Japan, China, and OPEC countries. 
   Now you want to talk about a scam going on and a shell game, we have a situation where we are borrowing money from oil-producing countries to basically give us money to go out and buy their oil, or to borrow money from oil-producing countries and from China so we can fund a war at $12 billion a month and put it on the credit card. Now that seems to me the definition of insanity, Mr. Speaker. Three trillion dollars, and this is as simple as your house payment or your car payment. You borrow money and you have to pay interest on it. 
   So countries like China will get the interest that the United States is paying on the money that we have borrowed, and the Chinese will take that money and they will sink it into developing and industrializing their own economy. And they are putting up nuclear plants so they have nuclear energy. And they are building roads, bridges and industrial parks. And they are funding their military and their navy. That is what they are doing with money that the United States is borrowing from them. And we take the money and we get ourselves into this war in Iraq at $12 billion a month, that is soon approaching a trillion dollars for the cost of the war, and some economists are saying at the end of the war, the grand total will be $3 trillion. 
   Now from Youngstown, Ohio, and Niles, Ohio, and Akron, Ohio, the folks that I represent are not really comfortable with the United States taking their tax dollars and paying interest on money they are borrowing from the Chinese so that the Chinese can build manufacturing facilities and manipulate their currency and ship the products back to the United States and put American workers out of work.     
   Now, there's something ironic about what's happening there. And there's really something sick, Mr. Speaker, about what's happening here. And when you look at the polls and you hear people say that 70 percent of Americans think that we're going in the wrong direction, the President has an approval rating of 28 percent, and the other 72 percent do not approve of the job that he is doing, you have to ask yourself, what is wrong? What is wrong? What is going on to have this dramatic breach in the American body politic? 
   And so, when Speaker Pelosi, and when we ran our elections in 2006 to come and take over Congress in 2007, it became imperative for us to try to pivot and shift this thing in another direction. So one of the issues is make sure that we pay for programs that we have here in the United States. No deficit spending. 
   Now, we've had problems, especially with the war, because we're committed over there. And it's been very difficult. We've tried to get out. 
   The President has vetoed every attempt we've ever tried to make. But we're trying to establish public policy in the United States of America that represent our values. 
   And if you look at what we have pushed coming out of this body, I think most Americans would agree, these are some pretty basic steps that we want to take. First thing we did when we got in is raise the minimum wage. For the first time since 1997, the American worker got a pay raise. It wasn't much. It should be a lot more. But we did what we could. And we said, this is a priority for us. 10 years without an increase in the minimum wage, but health care and energy and all of these other costs are going up for folks. Let's try to lift some people up, reward work. And we did that. 
   We have switched and tried to repeal the oil subsidies, corporate welfare, many of us know it as corporate welfare. Everyone hates welfare if we're giving it to poor people. They should go to work. They should work. This is America. We should not give welfare. That's the rhetoric that you hear. 
   But behind the scenes, our friends on the other side and President Bush are  very happy to give the oil companies 14 or $15 billion in oil subsidies, in energy subsidies. 
   Now, can you imagine, and today when you go to the gas pump and you pay $3.50, $3.75, $4 for a gallon of gas. You think you're frosted just filling up the tank. Think about the fact that President Bush said that he will veto any bill that comes out of this House that repeals the $15 billion that's going in corporate welfare to the oil companies. 
   Now, can you imagine, in this day and age, where Exxon's profits are through the roof, that the President of the United States says he will veto a bill that strips the corporate welfare out? 
   They're making tremendous profits. And what we have tried to do on the Democratic side, and Speaker Pelosi has tried to do, is to take that 14 or $15 billion away from the oil companies, away from the energy companies, and invest that money into alternative energy research; into wind, into biomass, into solar. 
   Now, we all know that these alternative energy forms, there's not one silver bullet. There's not one project or product that's going to come out and save us all and be a panacea for the entire United States of America and the world. We know that. 
   But Americans invent things. Americans make things better. Americans take a challenge and a problem and they fix it, and they solve it. They put the best and the brightest people that we have in this country, and they set a goal. 
   I'm not going to go do the research. President Bush certainly isn't going to go do the research. We've got a couple of rocket scientists that belong in this body that have been elected by their constituents here that may be able to actually do some of the research. But, for the most part, our job here is to set the public policy and provide the resources and the leadership for the country. And that's what we're trying to do is to say, invest into the Department of Energy, partner with energy companies. 
   We know you're not going to get rid of oil overnight. Many of us believe nuclear has a major role in what's going to happen here. But the bottom line is, let's make an investment into the United States, into the people, into the human resources that we have here to figure out what we're going to do, and then get the private sector and private enterprise to partner with us to get this thing kicked off. 
   It is crucial for us to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, crucial because we can extract ourselves from a lot of these political situations that we find ourselves in. In a lot of the global politics that we see and read, if you read between the lines and you think for yourself, you will see that there is some kind of energy component behind this, behind the politics that are going on, the geopolitics that are going on. And if we can become dependent on the Midwest instead of the Mideast, I think this country will remove itself from a lot of the problems that we have had, and we could help move this country forward. And that's what we are committed to doing here in the United States. 
   And just today, or yesterday, out of the Education Committee, George Miller, who's the Chair of the committee, they passed an authorization, I think, of $6 billion, if I remember correctly, to help schools, new schools. There'll be a formula to make sure that the school is green. So now, you're providing some leadership for the companies that will provide the products for a school or a building to become green. There'll be a little bit of a stimulation. 
   And I want to tell one quick story that I found interesting. We have a gentleman here in Congress, his name is Jim Oberstar, and he's the Chair of the Transportation Committee. He's been here since the late 1970s. 
   And I may miss a few of the facts here, but the point can be made that in the late 1970s, when he was a Member of Congress, and President Carter was in, he was trying to--the solar panel, there was some money put into the Department of Energy to research and develop alternative energy sources. And something popped out of that, it was called the solar panel. 
   And Mr. Oberstar had a piece of legislation that said we need to retrofit all Federal office buildings in the United States with solar panels. And by the Federal Government coming in and buying the solar panels, it will stimulate the solar panel market because the Federal Government is such a big consumer, and just like buying pens and everything else, and it will drive the cost down of the solar panels. So that was in 1977, 1978. 
   In 1980, when President Reagan came in, he completely eliminated that part of the Department of Energy that was providing that research and, basically, nothing happened. And he has now went from a rank and file member; Mr. Oberstar is now the Chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. So he now has this bill that he reintroduced, told his staff to go back and get his notes from 30 years ago about what he wanted to do with solar panels. 
   Now, can you imagine how far behind the 8-ball we are? When you look at production of solar panels, it used to be an industry that the United States excelled in and that we had a great share of the solar panel market in the early 1990s. But now, we have been surpassed because we have not made the investments. 
   And I'm not here, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Meek, to say that government somehow has all the answers. But we do have a role to play in stimulating the economy, Mr. Meek. And when we do that, we will allow the private sector to come in. 
   So we need to do what we need to do with alternative energy research. We need to do what we need to do with high speed rail. We need to do what we need to do with broadband access. These are the things that government has a role in, infrastructure, education, health care. These are the things that we need to invest in. And that's what we've been trying to do in the area of health care. 
   One of the things that, I mean, you can't really find a better example or illustration of a difference in values from Speaker Pelosi and President Bush on this one issue. It's the issue of state, the State Children's Health Insurance Program. When we came in, one of Speaker Pelosi's priorities was to provide leadership and resources for the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   This is a program that would provide health care, Mr. Meek, for 10 million children of modest income, didn't quite qualify for Medicaid, middle class kids, middle class families struggling to provide health care. This was to fill that gap. Bipartisan support here in the House, and in the Senate, tremendous support. 
   So it passed the House, passed the Senate, President Bush vetoed it. Now, can you imagine where your priorities are when you're willing to spend $12 billion a month in Iraq, and you won't sign a children's health care bill to provide health care for middle class citizens at $35 billion over 5 years? 
   But you'll spend 12 billion a month in Iraq and not even ask a question as to where the money's going. There's billions of dollars that are lost in Iraq, nobody knows where they are, Mr. Speaker. Nobody knows where that money is. 
   And we struggle to find $35 billion to provide health care for modest income families. That investment that, at the end of the day, will probably save us billions of dollars because these kids won't go right to the emergency room. They'll have some preventative care. That will save us money in the long run. And the President vetoed it. And he vetoed it. 
   And in the Senate, 80 Senators overrode the veto. But in the House, we could not override the veto because a handful of Republicans on the other side were committed to support the President in his position. 
   Now, can you imagine that? In the wealthiest country in the world, the dominant super power, we can't scrape up $35 billion over 5 years to provide health care for middle class kids? 
   And the President thinks he's taken a stand on this issue and saying he's fiscally responsible, after running up $3 trillion in debt, borrowing it from Japan and China and OPEC countries? 
   When you're deciding on where your philosophies are, what your values are, this is the issue. This is the defining issue. Health care for kids, $12 billion a month in Iraq. Tax cuts for people who make billions of dollars a year, health care for kids?  
   This is clear. And our job, as representatives of the people, Mr. Meek, and I'll kick it to you here in a second, is to make sure that we bring some equity into this system. 
   And I will say this. The investments that we have made, or tried to make on SCHIP, the minimum wage, alternative energy, the fact that we did pass, and the President did sign a $1,000 increase in Pell Grants over 5 years, for students, and we cut the student loan interest rate in half, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. So if you are going out trying to borrow for your kids, your interest rate is cut in half. 
   Those are the priorities that we push every day here on this House floor. Those are the priorities that are going to lead to an expansion of our economy. 
   We only have 300 million people in this country, Mr. Meek. There's 1.2 or 1.3 billion in China, 1.2 or 1.3 billion in India. We only have 300 million. And the philosophy of our party is to make sure that we invest into those 300 million people, to make sure they're educated and they're healthy. And I feel like if we make sure our kids are educated and healthy, that most everything else will take care of itself.     
   That's where we are. That's the agenda we're pushing. 
   Mr. Meek, I appreciate the fact that you're taking time away from your busy schedule and family to come down here, and I would like to yield to my very good friend from Florida.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. When you look at what the Speaker has been asking the President to do now for weeks, possibly months, to suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we have this reserve in the United States that a certain amount of barrels of oil go in a day. And this is to make sure that in case of a crisis, we have oil for national defense purposes and so forth. This is oil that's going in every day. 
   The Speaker, based on the history and what the experts and the economists are telling us, is that if you divert that oil that's going in to the petroleum reserve and you allow that oil to be purchased on the market, that it will drive down the cost of oil.     
   And this will lead to a savings at the pump of about 25 cents per gallon because there will be an increase in the supply of oil in the market and it will drive the cost down. 
   Now, we're not sitting here saying that this is the magic wand we're going to waive and everything's going to be fine. But what we are saying is, when you implement this and you take some of the pressure off, you can save almost $6 a barrel and 25 cents at the pump. So if you are a truck driver, Mr. Meek, 25 cents, when you're putting 20 or 30 gallons in, adds up when you're spending your life driving. And throwing the kids in the back of the mini van or filling up the truck and going back and forth, this is a significant savings. And the Speaker has been pressing the President to make this move and put this oil back into the market, Mr. Meek, but hasn't had any success at all. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Absolutely. And I think you've made some great points, Mr. Meek. 
   I just would like to say that, if you listen to some of our friends on the other side talk about gas prices, here is a party, Mr. Speaker, and an administration for 6 years--and the President and the Vice President being oil men--not doing a thing on energy, dependence on foreign oil, so on and so forth, to somehow accuse the Democrats of not addressing the issue, and completely oblivious to the fact that we're the ones passing legislation to crack down on price gouging, Mr. Meek. We're the ones that are passing legislation to hold OPEC accountable for price fixing. It's the Democratic Party that's repealing the subsidies to Big Oil so that we can take that money and invest it into alternative energy sources. It's Speaker Pelosi that's calling on the President to take the barrels of oil that are going into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and put those in the market to drive down gas by a quarter, that's something easy we can do. But it is the President and the Republican Congress, Mr. Speaker, that have consistently vetoed these bills or put the kibosh on them in the Senate, blocking lower prices every step of the way. 
   And if you look at what we have done here, pushed by the Speaker, to have fuel efficiency standards being raised for cars and trucks, we will reduce oil consumption by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2020. This is forward-looking. This is something that will save consumers between $700 and $1,000 at the pump in 2020. 
   Now, we know that's not addressing the issues today. We're talking about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We're talking about cracking down on OPEC. We're talking about cracking down on price gouging that may be going on in the United States and our local communities. These are the short-term issues. And each one has been opposed by the Republicans and has been opposed by the President of the United States. 
   So when you ask the folks at home, Mr. Speaker, what the Congress has done, the answers are here. And if anybody wants to know what they are, they can go to the Speaker's Web site. Trying to stop price gouging at the pump, price manipulation from OPEC, divert the oil that's going into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, that's what we're trying to do here. Repeal the subsidies for Big Oil and put that money and invest it in alternative research. Mr. Speaker, these are the policies of the Democratic Congress. And each one of those has been opposed by the Republican Party and opposed by the President of the United States, period, dot, Mr. Meek; period, dot. 
   So let there be no mistake, when common sense tells you we have a couple of oil barons running the executive branch, Mr. Speaker, and the Democrats are trying to push these initiatives to provide some relief for the common good and the common folks that we represent and it's opposed by the Republicans and opposed by this administration, it's important for us to set this record straight, Mr. Meek. 
   So as we begin to wrap up here, Mr. Meek, I would like to yield to you.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, I appreciate that. And you brought up those who are serving here. And I think it's worth noting that the veterans measure, another initiative that the Democrats have tried to push for a new G.I. Bill, for free college for our vets, opposed by Defense Secretary Gates, opposed by the administration. This is an opportunity for us to thank those men and women who are serving our country to say, when you get out, you're going to have free college tuition anywhere in the country. And I think that's a small gesture.     
   And once again, I think the President and our friends on the other side are out of step with what the American people think we should be doing. It's one thing to wave the flag, and it's another thing to put your money where your mouth is. 
   So, Mr. Meek, I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you here on this beautiful Thursday evening in Washington, D.C., and I look forward to coming down here with you next week and continuing to make the case for the programs that Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer and Mr. Clyburn and Rahm Emanuel and John Larson are pushing in our caucus. These are the issues that we care about and we're going to continue to push.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here for another session of the 30-something Working Group. We have had a very interesting week in Congress this week, and we want to share some of that with our fellow Members of Congress and those people paying attention for the record on the week of sunshine in the United States Congress. 
   In the past several days we have, as Democrats, continued to honor our pledge to try to open up government, knowing that the more information that we share, the more information that we have about the inner workings of government, the better off we are all going to be. 
   I think we have all seen over the past several years how a very closed, secretive government rules and what the end result may be of a very closed and secretive government. We are trying to fix that problem. 
   As you watch the news, Madam Speaker, as you watch the news every single day, it seems like we continue to hear stories about problems that we knew about many, many years ago, but we never did anything about it because you are not allowed to admit you make mistakes. 
   What we have tried to do this week is try to prevent the kinds of situations we have had with Walter Reed, try to prevent the kinds of situations we have had with Iraq, and try to prevent the kinds of situations we have had with Hurricane Katrina. All of these things were happening behind closed doors, and the people involved at the Pentagon or the Department of Defense, or whether it was in FEMA, the problem was people in the organization or in the agency or in certain departments knew things weren't going well or knew there wasn't a plan or knew we didn't have the proper people in place to execute whatever the exact role was of that agency, but nobody was allowed  to tell anybody or talk about it. And if you talked about it, you were fired. 
   We saw Hurricane Katrina on TV. We continue to see the war on TV, and we see what has happened at Walter Reed. Can you imagine people knew about what was going on at Walter Reed and didn't say anything? And then getting up in front of the TV cameras and say: We are for the troops, and you're not. That is a problem. 
   The new Democratic majority has begun the problem of fixing that problem this week. We are restoring accountability. This week we passed whistleblower protection and other government reform bills so that those people involved in the agencies who know how the agencies need to be run will not be subjected to the political whims of the day. 
   We want them to share with us what the problems are. We want them to share with us how we fix the agency or the department or the execution of the mission of a specific department. And I think it is important politically. As I am joined here by my good friend from Florida, Mr. Meek, I think it is important that we recognize what has happened since the Democrats have taken over. 
   Now we are not here to just say we are the only political party in the country and we are the best and this and that. We had a political situation in this country since 2000 where the presidency was Republican and for the most part the House and the Senate were Republican the whole time, and the Republicans have controlled this Chamber for 14 years. And a culture of coverup happened, to where the Republican majority in the House would not oversee or provide the proper oversight to what was going on in FEMA, in the war, and a lot of these other agencies. 
   And what has happened when the Democrats took over Congress and the American people said we need to bring a little balance to this situation, just look at what has happened. Walter Reed, who knows if that would have ever come up if the Democrats weren't poking around saying what is going on with veterans' health care?     
   All of the issues in Iraq. Today we passed a supplemental to begin to put the framework together to get our kids home from Iraq. And look at what is going on with Katrina and the oversight we are providing for that. 
   These are things that are happening because the American people put balance back into the government. And we want to continue to honor the pledges that we made previous to the last election. We want to make sure that it is not just the whistleblower protection, but it is the 67 hearings that we have already had, Democrats have already had on Iraq. Sixty-seven. No, it's even more.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Yes. And it is a shame that a company that gets that much public tax money would pick up and leave the very country that they get their money from to have their corporate headquarters. 
   But it is important that we are living up to our commitment. We are providing the oversight, 104 committee hearings. We are restoring accountability with the whistleblower protection; Presidential library donation; FOIA requests, where you can actually access documents in the government, freedom of information. So a lot of sunshine came down on the Capitol this week. 
   And I couldn't be prouder of the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn and Rahm Emanuel and John Larson, our leadership and the Chairs of our committees for really applying the pressure and really trying to fix things and make things better. 
   I yield to my friend from Florida.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If the gentleman will yield, there is no better way to support the troops than this supplemental bill that just passed out of our committee, and it will be on this floor next week. If you want to talk about sling-shotting the troops in, what we have done, and the Democratic leadership, and Mr. Murtha, Mr. Obey has been absolutely phenomenal as to what we have been able to do; $1.7 billion more than the President's request for defense health care. I don't know how you could vote against us; $450 million for post-traumatic stress disorder; $450 million for traumatic brain injury care and research; $730 million to prevent health care fee increase for our troops; $20 million to address problems at Walter Reed, and almost $15 million for  burn care; another $1.7 billion in addition to the President's request for veterans health care, $550 million to address the backlog in maintaining VA health care facilities, which has been a huge problem; $250 million for medical administration to ensure sufficient personnel to support the growing number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who are coming back so that they can have the level of service that they need. 
   Now it's one thing to say you support the troops and then you turn around and you vote against a bill that has $4- or $5 billion in it to support the veterans and the troops coming back. It seems quite apparent to me that this is something that we need to do. 
   Believe me, nobody wants to get out of war faster than me. I want to be out this afternoon, tomorrow morning. Let's come back. This has been foolish to begin with, but there is a certain reality on logistical needs and diversity in the country of how we should do this. 
   So what we have done today was create a real framework for our kids to come back home, to let the Iraqis stand up, and put these benchmarks. I just want to talk for a minute about what these benchmarks are. Some people say, well, you are tying the President's hands, you are trying to micromanage more. We are not. That is not true. 
   The facts of the matter are these, the President and the Pentagon have benchmarks. So how many Iraqi troops need to be trained, what does the political situation need to look like? Have they achieved their political and military benchmarks that have been set by the President? All we are saying is that you have to show some progress towards those benchmarks by July. 
   Now, granted, we have already been in this war longer than we were in World War II. So by July you better show some progress as to meeting the benchmarks. If you are not showing progress, we will begin to redeploy out. 
   But if by July you are showing some progress, you will then have until October to actually meet the benchmarks. If you don't meet them by October, we redeploy. If you do meet them by October, we redeploy, because you have met the benchmarks. 
   This is just bringing this war to a reasonable end. What we have done today, I think the end is in sight.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Ohio. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I look forward to the old team being back down here. And I just want to continue as to what we are doing to try to fix this problem. 
   As I said, with the benchmarks and making sure the Iraqi soldiers stand up, but a key component of this, as Ms. Wasserman Schultz has just mentioned is that we are saying that our troops can't leave here, the United States, and go to Iraq if they don't have the requisite level of equipment and training. And I don't think there is anybody in the country who would want to send one of our soldiers or lots of our soldiers off to war knowing, and the legal term is mense rea, you know, with intent, send kids that don't have the proper equipment and training. 
   And the training part is something that Ms. Wasserman Schultz was just talking about. We have a readiness crisis in the Army. We are not capable now of handling another situation, military situation. 
   Now, I think if you would ask the American people are we overstretched, they would all say yes. And if you talk to the military families, they say, yes, we are overstretched to the point where we have kids in battle who don't have everything that they need. And that is unacceptable. And so in our supplemental bill, we are saying that if you don't have the training and the equipment and the proper amount of rest, you are not going. 
   Now, we put a waiver in there so that the President could waive it if there is a national security interest involved. But we don't like it. I know I don't like it. I shouldn't speak on behalf of everybody. 
   But the bottom line is, the President is the President. He is the Commander in Chief. He won the election in 2004. So we are left to deal with the situation. 
   And if you look at some of the polling in the country, 76 percent of Americans favor requiring U.S. troops returning from Iraq to have at least 1 year in the U.S. before being redeployed. That is a Gallup poll. Seventy-seven percent favor requiring U.S. troops to come home from Iraq if Iraq's leaders fail to meet promises to reduce violence there. And 76 percent of the American people don't think the Bush administration has done everything they could reasonably be expected to do to care for the needs and problems of veterans. 
   But the bottom line is the American people want accountability, and the American people want to change course. You don't see the kind of tidal wave election that we had in November without a message that comes with it. And the message is, we need to change direction. And the Iraq supplemental bill that passed out of the Appropriations Committee today and will pass  off the floor next week is that change in direction. 
   Is it everything all of us want? No. Are there things in there that we don't like? Yes. But we have to change direction in this war. It is not going well. 
   And you talk to the families and, you know, as a Member of Congress, I have made the phone calls, other Members of Congress have made the phone calls to parents. We have been to the funerals, and it is not good. And quite frankly, I don't want to go to any more. But I found out yesterday that I have got to go to another one. 
   This war has got to end, and it has got to stop. And what we are doing is the quickest way for us to go about bringing a reasonable, thoughtful end to this war, and that means getting our troops out of the middle of a civil war in Iraq. 
   There are only 2,000 al Qaeda members in Iraq. The war on terrorism needs to move back to Afghanistan, the country that harbored Osama bin Laden. And in this bill there is 1.2 billion additional dollars from the President's request to focus back on Afghanistan, because now Afghanistan, we are starting to lose our way in Afghanistan now because of the lack of focus. 
   So I think it is very important that the American people recognize what is in this bill. There are benchmarks there that the Iraqis need to meet. And if they don't begin to meet them and show some progress, we start moving out. 
   We have had 4 years for them to get their stuff together. And for whatever reason, they haven't. And 
   think, contrary to what some of my friends on the other side have been saying, and the President has said, and people who have kids and everything realize this, this is very basic, that the President is saying, well, if you give them a benchmark, then they are just going to wait us out, and then we leave, and then they will take over, like everything is great right now, and then it will get bad. But it is bad right now. 
   What we are saying is if we communicate to the Iraqis that we are going to stay there indefinitely, then they will never get their stuff together because they are always relying on us. And what we are saying is, we are not going to be there indefinitely; you better start getting along with each other. 
   And I hate even saying that because I didn't want this war to happen in the first place. Now we broke them and now we are saying, get your stuff together. 
   But the bottom line is this, we are where we are, and they need to get together. And the political and religious factions need to get together. And if they don't, we need to leave. And if they do, we need to leave. 
   I think we have spent enough money, 400, going to be $500 billion in Iraq. $500 billion. And 3,100-plus lives, 20-some thousand soldiers who have been amputees, brain injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder. Enough is enough. Enough is enough. It is time to bring this war to an end. And that is what our supplemental ultimately does. 
   And so, in closing, I would just like to say, Madam Speaker, that the last 3 weeks we have had hearings in our Labor, Health and Education Subcommittee, and we have had great people testifying on health care in the United States, education in the United States, very interesting stuff. But there are two things that have really hit home to me as I was sitting through these committees with all these experts. 
   And we had the education experts saying to us that this may be the first generation of Americans who will not have the standard of living or improved standard of living, compared to that of their parents. That was one hearing. 
   And then the next hearing came in and it was the health care experts. And the health care experts were saying that this generation may be the first generation of Americans that do not exceed the life expectancy level of their parents because of the crisis that we are having in health and obesity in the United States. Literally, your parents may, if you are a kid, your parents may live longer than you live. First time. 
   And when you look at the money that we are spending to destroy and to kill, as opposed to the money that we spend to create and to build up, it is tragic. It is tragic. And I hate voting for this stuff, but we have to because we have got to get out of there. 
   But the bottom line is this, we are spending hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, and the Head Start program that helps kids get off the ground is being cut by $100 million in the President's budget. We are going to fix that. That is not going to end up that way. 
   But when you look at we are spending hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars and flatlining funding on programs like Gear Up and TRIO that help young kids get into colleges and that we are not covering enough kids with children's health care, I hope we all remember this when we get through this war and it is time to make the proper investments in our country. 
   We only have 300 million people in this country. China has 1.3 billion. India has 1 billion. We need everybody on the field playing for us. 
   Let's put this war to an end. Let's bring our kids home with dignity, and make sure that when they get home these veterans have the proper health care that they need and that they deserve, and then let's start making some investments into this country so that we can be the best that we can possibly be. 
   Madam Speaker, you can e-mail us at 30somethingdems@ mail.house.gov, or visit us at www.speaker.gov/30something and comment. All of the charts that were seen here are on display on the Web site. 
   And with that, we conclude our 30-something for the week, and we will see you next week.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I appreciate all your  work on this particular piece of legislation that we have a lot more work to do convincing our friends on the other side of the Capitol to act on this. 
   But what I find interesting is we're just standing here. You're from Kansas; I'm from Ohio. This is not a border State issue where we're directly across the border from Mexico. This is an issue that affects all of us all across the country. So, whether it's manufacturing in my district or, you know, in someone else's district across the country, this is an issue, as you said, that represents America. 
   We sign a lot of these trade agreements, and many people don't even know what's in the fine print, and here we find out 15 years later about this little program that's going to go on that really, I think, does several things. 
   One, it's a real threat to U.S. jobs in the trucking industry. And then as your bill pointed out, why it is, I think, such an important piece of legislation, and Mr. Speaker, this is the Safe American Roads Act of 2007, H.R. 1773, sponsored, pushed, advocated for by the gentlelady from Kansas who's been such a strong advocate on this issue. But basically, what we're trying to do from our vantage point is put some responsibility into this thing, to make sure that there are certain standards that are met. 
   And I know that was the key impetus for this whole piece of legislation from the beginning is let's have some standards, Mr. Speaker, where if you want to compete in the global economy, we're all playing by the same rules. 
   Now, all of the sudden we have American truckers who have drug testing and there are certain standards for the trucks and certain training that needs to happen and equipment and on and on and on down the line. Now, all of the sudden they're going to be competing with folks who just don't have to abide by the same rules.

We care about all these things, as we'll continue to talk about tonight, Mr. Speaker, but the bottom line is this. We have unsafe trucks that will be coming in that are now through the pilot program, will continue to come into our country, lack inspection, lack the safety standards that we're accustomed to in the United States. That puts those kids who are riding in cars in the other lane, or in front or behind or whatever the case may be, in jeopardy. We have certain standards in the United States.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. You brought up the immigration issue, and I think it's important is we have put through the homeland security bill and a variety of other bills, more border patrol on the border, Mr. Speaker. We're trying to continue to try to make sure that people who come into this country come in legally, and that is a major issue. 
   But because the resources that we are trying to provide are going down to the border to try to prevent illegal immigration, at the same time we do not have the resources to provide the kind of oversight and to make the kind of investments given the history of corruption in many of the industries and in the Mexican Government that lack oversight. 
   So here we are saying, well, we're going to let you come into our country, but they are not providing the oversight. We don't have the money to provide the oversight with the budget deficits that we're running now. So this is a critical, critical issue. 
   And like I think most issues of globalization, things happen too quickly, where the infrastructure is not in place in many countries for labor, for health, for the kind of protections that we want. 
   We like having our truckers in safe trucks. We like knowing they've got the proper amount of sleep. We like knowing the proper environmental advances are going to be made so the air is cleaner. Those are good things. I like clean air and clean water. I don't think I'm really out on a limb on this one. 
   But what we are saying is, if you want to do business in our country, you have got to come up to our standards. And for too long, we've been dropping ours to meet everybody else's, especially wages, which is a whole other Special Order that we could talk about.

But at the end of the day, you don't have a system in place in the Mexican domestic government, the civilian side, to monitor this to say that every truck that comes through or at least minimize. Now, we have truck accidents in this country. You are probably never going to be able to eliminate all of it. But, at the same time, we have these strict enforcement mechanisms. And we all deal with trucking companies in our district; they have got to go through a lot, logging miles and hours and sleep.

But at the end of the day, we decided as a country we would rather have safer roads. These trucking companies do not want the insurance payments if they would cause an accident, so they are inclined to abide by it. So all we are saying is let's lift everybody up and let's all play by the same rules, and we would be happy to do business with you.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And the concern for a lot of us is that this administration does not really have a very good track record of being open and honest with the Congress through a variety of issues. We go all the way across the board from the Iraq war, whether you were for it or against it or wherever you ended up; the actual execution of unbid contracts and lack of oversight and not getting the kinds of answers we need. 
   Katrina, we have the same kind of deal. The President goes down, Mr. Speaker, and says everything is doing great. Good job, Brownie, we are doing everything we can. Then you find out over the course of several days, several weeks, several years that it wasn't going well at all. There was no infrastructure in place; there was no civil coordination. We had all kinds of problems. 
   And I think it is so important that the gentlewoman, Mr. Speaker, from Kansas has brought this issue to the Congress and made it a priority, not only for her but for the whole Congress, passing legislation with 410 other Members other than herself, is that we need to make sure that, if we do it, we do it right and we get it done, and we make sure that we have the safety standards in place, the drug testing, the sleep, the caps, the traditional safety standards that we have here, Mr. Speaker. 
   This is important stuff. And it can't be you say one thing today, and we find out a year later that it is not going as well; everybody passes, we completely implement the program, and we find out a year later. Now we have 5,000 trucks on the road coming from Mexico, and none of them are safe, or 50 percent of them are safe. That is too risky for I think our tastes. 
   So it is important that we continue to push the other side of the Capitol to pass this piece of legislation, talk to our Senators, talk to the people we work with to get this thing done. This is important for the American people, a priority for you, a priority for me, and a lot of our other colleagues to the tune of 411 of us. We can't agree on anything with 411 people, but we agree on this issue.

And let me just say to you, Mr. Speaker, and any of the other Members who may be Buckeye fans, not only was the game horrible, a complete whooping, but then I woke up this morning and the first thing I did was I called Mr. Meek, and I said, ``Mr. Meek, I had a terrible dream last night. It was awful. Let me tell you about it.'' And he reminded me that it actually happened. And then our first meeting this morning, I ran into Ms. Wasserman Schultz, who was in her beautiful outfit that she has on now but also the University Florida Gator glasses, and her Coke this morning had a little cozy on it that was also blue and orange. So she is very humble about her victory last night. And the only thing I can say is that the coach of Florida is an Ohioan, born just a few miles outside of my district. That is all I am hanging on to.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman is right. Last week during all of the Speaker ceremonies, one of the things was a mass up at Trinity College where the Speaker went to college. There were two pictures up on the altar. One was a picture of a kid in Darfur and the other was a kid from Hurricane Katrina. There were pictures of these kids from New Orleans and Darfur all over. I think that kind of symbolized where this Speaker is taking this House of Representatives, that is, we are going to act in the best interest of those kids to protect them by implementing these recommendations. 
   I think the frustration we see on the other side of the aisle, and there is always a level of frustration because you are in power and then out of power, but the one level of frustration from the other side of the aisle is this stuff isn't brain surgery. We have been waiting years to implement some of this stuff. The minimum wage, 10 years. The 9/11 Commission report has been out for a long time. Some of these other things such as negotiating drug prices, we are actually going to get this stuff done in the first 100 hours of legislative business we are doing here. I think there is a level of frustration on their side because some of them wanted it and it couldn't get through, or they don't want it and we are implementing it. But this agenda has the support of the American people. 
   In some ways, these are broad parameters for us. But take the PAYGO rules. We are going to make sure that we are only spending money that actually comes into the Treasury. We are not going to go out and borrow from China. I know our friends who were here before were talking about we are going to get rid of all of the tax cuts. We are going to implement middle-class tax cuts, and we are going to ask some of the people who have been making millions, if not billions, of dollars over the past couple of years to pay more. If you are making millions of dollars a year, we are going to ask you to pay more in taxes. And the reason we are going to do that is we are either going to ask you or we go and we borrow it from China. You are benefiting a great deal from the economy that we have here, from the political system we have here, and we need your help in balancing our budget. 
   Now, there is nothing that has more of an effect on average people than increased interest rates. As we borrow money and borrow money, money becomes scarce in the market, and interest rates go up. If you try to buy a house or car, interest rates have gone up and you are paying more. We are going to keep those tax cuts for the middle class, and we are going to ask the wealthiest to pay a little more. And by balancing the budget, we are going to try to reduce interest rates, and that will lead to another economic boom like happened in 1993 when President Clinton and a Democratic Congress balanced the budget. That is the way it is going to be. 
   We are proving to the American people, and this is the exciting part, I think the American people took a leap of faith on us. In the last few days, we have actually done what we said we were going to do. Later this week we are going to continue to do what we said we were going to do, and next week we will do what we said we were going to do. And when the President gets here to give his State of the Union, he will have a Democratic agenda lying on the table to have to discuss, and that includes the war in Iraq.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. When you talk about PAYGO, and we were talking earlier about the college loan interest rates and in cutting these interest loans in half for both parent and teachers, the bottom line is we are going to cut those interest rates and make college more affordable. You are also talking about the minimum wage and the stem-cell research which we want to talk a little bit about tonight. We are talking about bread-and-butter issues, investing in science and cutting interest rates in half, making sure the bottom is lifted up. I think we have a lot going on.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, just to be fair, these numbers have been shifted and I have seen different numbers for China, India and the United States. But the bottom line is no matter which ones you are looking at, they have a significant advantage on some of these. You look at our math and science scores, they have gone up a little bit, I think in the fourth grade range, but not nearly where we want them to be. We still have a tremendous gap between the wealthiest and poorest districts. We have a tremendous gap between minority districts and white districts. We have got a lot of work to do. 
   The No Child Left Behind Act is coming up this year to be reauthorized and hopefully funded at the levels. Hopefully we can make the kind of changes that we always hear about on the campaign trail when it comes to education, teachers grabbing us about No Child Left Behind. We have a brutally competitive world out there waiting for us, and these changes need to happen, and some of them need to happen in the first 100 hours.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Cheers, brother. I couldn't agree with you more, and we want to thank you too for your leadership. We have had a good couple of years where one of us is inevitably tired and cranky, maybe hungry, and the other one has said, we have to go. We have to go do it. We have to keep going. 
   But when you look at what we are able to do, and I was just glancing over at the minimum-wage stuff, 13 million people would likely benefit from the increase. 7.7 million women, 3.4 million parents, and 4.7 million people of color will benefit, with an average family of three getting $4,400 more a year in their pocket. That is why you do what you do. That is why you get into public life. 
   You start looking at some of the funding streams for community health clinics and safe and drug-free schools, and the Pell grants, and we are not going to be able to wave a magic wand, because we are in a heck of a hole, so it is going to take us a few years to get out of this, but we are going to start bringing some balance to this process. And I think average people are going to start being represented here under the dome. 
   We are not perfect. We will probably make some mistakes along the way, but I think they are going to be mistakes of us trying to do the right thing and make things happen. This is an incredibly complex system we run, with 435 Members from different walks of life, different States and different regions to try to make things happen. Then to go across the hall and try to agree with 100 people from 50 States, and balance that off the President and the executive branch is difficult, but I think we are laying down some good framework here that we can work in the next few weeks and hopefully in the next few years that will affect average people's lives. 
   So, cheers. And now to my Gator friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Very diplomatic. I want to make one final point before we close up here. 
   If the elections didn't go the way they were supposed to, or the way they did, I should say, and this was still a Republican-controlled House and a 
   Republican-controlled Senate, just to put all this in context, what would have happened is the President would have said that we want to put 20,000 or 30,000 more troops in Iraq, and this Congress would have got out the rubber stamp, and it would have been a done deal. And in several months there would be a $100 billion supplemental and there would be 30,000 more troops in Iraq, and we would be further down the line. There would be no question that that is exactly what would have happened. 
   So the power and the force of the American people in their statement that they made basically says we are going to have a discussion about this. Now, how this ends up, we don't know. But I know from a personal perspective there is going to be some strong resistance to adding any more troops, and we are going to have a discussion about money and everything else. 
   Now, we don't have a caucus position, but the bottom line is this: there is going to be a discussion. And that is what is great about this country, and that is what is great about the elections. It is not just going to get rammed through this House, and the American people are not going to feel helpless. They are going to feel like they are here. 
   I know we are ready to wrap things up. Mr. Meek, great game last night. You are actually a Miami of Florida fan.

<DOCNO>Mr. RYAN of Ohio. (THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP: THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I think what is happening now highlights a lot of what has already been going on in a lot of areas around the country. I think when you start to look and see people are talking about the downturn in the economy and jobs and what is happening now: Unemployment rate going up, people not having the disposable income. When you look at a lot of areas, and it is not just Niles, Ohio. It is not just Youngstown, Ohio. It is not just Akron, Ohio. It is in Des Moines, Iowa. It is in Waterloo, Iowa. It is in Detroit, Michigan. It is in all of the industrial Midwest where, quite frankly, globalization has had a negative impact on a lot of the communities there. 
   So this stimulus package, I think, as you have been talking about over the past 30, 35 minutes or so, it needs to be targeted to those families that are going to spend the money to stimulate the economy, those small businesses, I think, that are going to reinvest back whether it's in a machine shop in Streetsborough, Ohio, or wherever the case may be. But make that money available. 
   But I think it's also important for us to talk about what we've been doing since we've been in the majority to affect the long-term growth of the economy. And I think, you know, one of the past Federal chairman's said that they're just too many bubbles, you know. That was the problem that we have had here. 
   We had the tech bubble in the 1990s and the low interest rates and the housing bubble, and now we are looking at that bubble bursting. 
   Just to give you an example on how this ripples throughout the economy, we have an aluminum extrusion manufacturer in Gerard, Ohio, 300 pretty high-paying jobs that's going to close down because they supply the aluminum for the housing market, not commercial but the housing side. 
   So this downturn, this bubble busting has this ripple effect throughout the economy, and that's why I think you see us in the position that we are in today. 
   But if you look at what we are doing long term, for long-term stimulus, what we've tried to do with stem cell research here in the Congress, that opens up whole new vistas of opportunity in the health care field. That opens up opportunity for research and development in a growing field. 
   If you look at what we are trying to do with alternative energy, you will see that these investments that we are making into the research and development of a lot of these alternative energy technologies, those are investments that are going to yield great benefits for us, because long term, you know, someone has got to make the windmill. Someone's got to make the hydraulics for the windmill. Someone's got to make the blades. These things need to be trucked around. These components need to be assembled. 
   That is a direct investment once this technology is purchased or at least improved and able to produce some sufficient amount of energy, that's going to be American manufacturing. If you look at solar panels, that could be a potential opportunity for American manufacturing. 
   So before I kick it back to you, it's important that we recognize some of these long-term investments that we are making here. And one of the ones that we saw, if you were looking at some of the economic indicators from the summertime when the wage was passed and implemented, there was actually an increase in consumer spending. It shouldn't be much of a surprise because if you put more money in the pockets of these folks, that's what happens. 
   Finally, before I give it back to you, it's important to recognize for the American people that this stimulus package, what we are seeing here is going to stimulate the economy, is what we have been arguing about here since President Bush came in with his lopsided tax cuts for the top 1 percent. 
   Now, if you give somebody who makes millions and millions of dollars a year--and God bless you if you do. We want you to make money. We are not against you. We understand the importance of people investing in business in our country. But that person is not going to take a couple hundred thousand dollars that they get in a tax cut and go out and spend it. What are they going to spend it on? When you have that money, you have everything that you need. You are not going to go out and say, ``Well, I got a couple hundred  thousand dollar tax cut. I'm going to go out and buy a new pair of shoes now.'' 
   You have everything that you need. So that cut does not have the economic stimulus, and if it is getting invested, let's be honest. That is getting invested in Asia. If you are looking to make money and put it in the market or you are looking to buy a particular stock, you are going into a certain area, and it would behoove you to put that money somewhere in Asia. 
   So, having said that, the tax philosophy that we have here that you should give middle class tax cuts to folks, if it stimulates the economy now, if it is good for the economy now, it should be a good fiscal policy.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. The point, too, is the decisions that you make, I think, and so articulately explained here, the decisions that you make have long-  term ramifications. If you make bad decisions, as we have seen, now, regardless of where you were on the war, what your position was before it started, or when it started or how your vote was, we now have to calculate and figure out $1.3 trillion was spent on this war that we elected to go into that now has been proven time and time again that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11. Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. 
   As policymakers, we need to look back and evaluate whether or not this was a good decision; $1.3 trillion at the end of next year, or at the end of this year will have been spent on this war. We look all across our country, and has it helped reduce gas prices? No. Has it helped create stability around the world? No. Did it decrease the number of terrorists around the world? No. It actually increased the number, and every intelligence report from all over the world will tell us that. 
   We need to understand that as we make these decisions, whether it is on the stimulus package, whether it is on our Tax Code, whether it is on the investments that we are going to make in this country, these are big decisions, because the ramifications are pretty big when you look 5 or 6 years down the line and could be as costly when you get into an elective war as $1.3 trillion. 
   These are the kinds of decisions that we are making here, and I think it is very important for us to recognize, as we make them, that these have long-term ramifications. The tax cuts, you combine the war and the tax cuts. When our friends were in charge of this body for 6 years, since President Bush was in, and President Bush was President, a Republican-controlled House and Senate, $3 trillion was borrowed from the Chinese, the Japanese, to increase our debt. So our debt went up by $3 trillion. They raised the debt limit five times. So when you combine the Bush tax cuts with the war, some very immature policy decisions were made.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. You mentioned bipartisanship. I think, as we are closing out here and as we had the vote today on the SCHIP bill, that it's important for us to recognize how far away the President is from bipartisanship on some of these issues. Here we have the SCHIP, State Children's Health Insurance bill. This was a program that was started by Newt Gingrich and President Clinton to invest money into the health of poor and middle-class kids. The program was $35 billion over 5 years. It passed this House in a bipartisan way with many, many, many Republican votes, mostly Democratic, but many Republican. 
   The President vetoed this bill twice. So a bipartisan bill drafted by Newt Gingrich, signed into law by President Clinton is vetoed a couple of times by President Bush. His reason is it costs too much money. It's $35 billion over 5 years. 
   This is the same President that raised the debt limit five times and ran up $3 trillion in debt and turns around days later and asks for another $200 billion in Iraq, but he doesn't have and doesn't see the sense in the investment of $35 billion over 5 years for kids' health care. So when you hear ``bipartisan,'' you have got to be skeptical. 
   Now I want to kick it to who we very affectionately refer to as our ``mother'' here in Congress, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who, I know I saw her on TV at the Presidential debate the other night, Madam Speaker, and I think Mr. Meek, and you were there too, that it seems like Mrs. Jones may have gotten more TV time than Hillary Clinton got during the Presidential debate.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate the gentleman giving me an opportunity to share a few words. I think yourself and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek), my good friend, and other Members of this body agree, it has been a long year. It has been a long slog, and I think there have been in many ways a very complicated political scenario where in some instances where we are trying to pass children's health care, we have 80 votes in the Senate, enough to override a Presidential veto, but a rabid group in the House would back the President's veto and not allow us to override. 
   Some of our Republican friends were standing in the way of us getting SCHIP. My point is it is a very complicated political situation. I think within that context we have a tremendous amount of success. I think that as these bills begin to hit and get signed into law and the investments are made, I think the American people will begin to realize there has been a change in the direction of the country. 
   Believe me, we are nowhere near where any of us want to be. Nobody is happy, but we are satisfied to some extent that a lot of the programs that we have pushed forth will be signed into law, and have already in some instances been signed into law. 
   And those people who are in our congressional districts who are feeling the anxiety of globalization, of trade, of the economy, of the squeeze that is being placed on the middle class, I think we will see next year, if they are trying to put their kids through college and they go to take out a loan, and they recognize that last year when they took out the loan it was 6.8 percent and next year it will be 3.4 percent for college, they will recognize that something happened there, that it was the Democratic-led Congress who allowed that to happen. 
   When they go and apply for a Pell Grant and there is a few more hundred dollars that they qualify for, a thousand more over the next few years, those families will recognize that it was the Democratic-led Congress under Speaker Pelosi's leadership that allowed that to happen. 
   When you are working for minimum wage, whether it is two or three jobs, trying to piece your family together, you will recognize it was the Democrats who came in and made that happen. 
   When you see the auto industry begin to transform because of the amount of pressure that was put on them, CAFE standards and some other issues that we were able to work out to allow the auto industry to move forward and make these investments, that is because of the Democratic-led Congress.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think you make some great points because, you know, we have the veterans piece, the education piece, but I think you touched upon something when you started talking about the NIH and the energy research and investment that we're making in alternative energy. What we're trying to do, people are struggling. You know, people in our districts are wondering, especially in the Midwest in the manufacturing areas, what are we going to do? And what we're trying to do, I mean, you can't just give a job and the government hires everybody. But what we're trying to do, which I think Ms. Wasserman Schultz has said, make these strategic investments in alternative energy, green-collar jobs, solar panels, I mean there's a lot of opportunity here. And in the health care field, the more research we do in the health care field the better off we're going to be, the more efficient the system, the more medical devices, the more research our scientists can do. There's a lot of opportunity here. So not only are we trying to raise the minimum wage, increase access to education, make sure our veterans are taken care of, which are all substantial accomplishments but, at the same time, make these long-term investments, where we're prying open different sectors of the economy.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We are moving in a new direction. We pushed and pushed and pushed with this AMT to get it paid for--$50 billion. And what we were going to do is close down loopholes where hedge fund owners and hedge fund operators are putting money offshore and basically hiding it. And the Democratic Party, Speaker Pelosi, our Blue Dogs united, liberals, Democrats, conservatives, all of us united saying pay for this. If not, the tax is going to tax people making 50, $75,000 in New Castle and Scranton, PA and Youngstown and Florida, so we wanted to pay for it. 
   The Republican Party opposed us paying for this by going after hedge fund managers period. You can read all the articles. Read all the analysis of what happened here. 
   So they sided, Madam Speaker, with hedge fund managers who are making billions of dollars a year. 
   Then we tried to repeal some of the issues dealing with the oil companies and making sure they're paying their fair share. The most profitable industry in the country is getting subsidized. And we're saying, no. We need to take some of that money and we need to invest this in alternative energy. 
   Again, in the Senate the Republicans stood strong to make sure that that did not happen. So in two instances, whether it was with hedge funds managers or with the oil companies, we were trying to make sure we brought some equity into the system and paid for making sure that our middle class doesn't get a tax increase.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think what we've done, and I think what the Speaker has done and STENY HOYER and JIM CLYBURN and JOHN LARSON and our leadership team have done over the past year is, you know, we've heard for a decade about family values. And I think what has happened here is our legislation has embodied what families need, the minimum wage community health clinics, education funding. We, I think, have spoken through our actions here, and I think that's very important.     
   In addition to that, when we talk about staying out here and continuing the message side of this, part of politics is to communicate with the American people. But what's important is anyone who's watching this debate, we're telling you our side, they are saying their side, and there are the facts, and the American people get to listen. 
   We wanted to make sure that the hedge fund managers were not hiding money in offshore accounts. That was something we ran on, and we tried to do it and continue, but we don't have a big enough majority now to handle some of these in the Senate and here. 
   We were the ones who wanted to pull the corporate subsidies. We were the ones who actually succeeded in the education and the health care and the energy and all these other issues, not nearly again as far as we wanted to go. But for us to come out here and continue to pitch our accomplishments, what we've done, what we're going to continue to do, the fact that we're not happy, there are still jobs leaving many communities across our country that need that growth, that investment in alternative energies, that's what we are trying to do, trying to accomplish. 
   We're not satisfied. So to the people back home listening to us, we're not satisfied. We're not done. We're going to continue the good fight. 
   And so I'd just like to say to everyone here, thank you. Happy holidays. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Happy Kwanzaa.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think on behalf of us, I think we're very lucky. We had a great freshman class that has had a tremendous impact. 
   Mr. Altmire, I know, has passed a couple of pieces of legislation through the Small Business Committee that has really, I think, redefined what government investment and what the Small Business Administration needs to do, angel investor funds, venture capital funds, to invest in these new start-up communities. So communities like ours who are trying to convert from manufacturing, advanced manufacturing, from manufacturing in auto and steel and rubber to some kind of high-tech business, we now have an SBA bill that would allow those young companies to get venture capital money that would match. I mean, just a lot of innovative things.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. This is about making our country more competitive, period. This is a moral issue. This is an issue that needs to be handled, and needs to be addressed. But as our friend from Cleveland was saying, this is about those kids in Cleveland and Youngstown and Miami becoming more competitive because they are healthier, they go to school healthier, they are not getting all the other kids sick, and therefore everyone in the classroom is at a better starting point to learn. 
   When you talk about competing with China, you talk about competing with India, 1.3 billion people in each country, and we only have 300 million, we need to get everybody on a level playing field. That is what this Children's Health Care Program does. 
   Mr. Speaker, look at what the President would do by not signing this bill. Our bill will cover all of these kids. It is a bipartisan bill, the congressional bill that passed; 3.8 million additional kids. Now if the President gets his way, in his budget 840,000 children will lose their SCHIP coverage, because health care costs are going up, more kids are going into the system, the poverty rate is going up. So this is about making us more competitive by making sure that the poor kids, middle-class kids in our country, have an opportunity to get a little bit of health care.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. If you can get in. For many of the kids, you sit there and wait for hours and hours and hours, if you can even get in; and the cost, and this is the point that we are trying to make, we are trying to save the taxpayers money. There is a reimbursement that goes back to these emergency rooms when they cover charity care when people go in without health insurance. 
   Mr. Speaker, now, many of us can go, and you talk to the CEO who runs a hospital, and I have one in mind in my district that I talk to all the time, where he tells me at every meeting we are at, whether we are talking about giving money to build another hospital or expand their facilities, or anything else, he always brings this up. I would rather give these kids a prescription for $20 or $30 than to see them two or three weeks later come into the emergency room with pneumonia, and it costs $20,000 or $30,000. 
   This is what this bill does. This saves us money, not to mention the fact that the kid will miss school, the kid will go to school and get other kids sick. But to have a President of the United States in 2007 lack the sensitivity of what these families go through who do not have health care, to say, well, you can go to the emergency room. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President doesn't have to go to the emergency room when he goes to a fancy Navy hospital. Many of us, we don't have to go to the emergency room. Many families who have health insurance, they don't have to go. But there is a segment of our population that is forced as a last resort to end up in an emergency room because they have nowhere else to go.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. How about the fact, before I go to my friend, my good friend, how about the fact that we want to help these kids before it's an emergency. You're saying to go to the emergency room. Mr. President, we don't want to wait. Mr. Speaker, we don't want to wait for it to be an emergency, for God's sake.     
   Now, we understand that the way things have been run by this executive branch over the past 6 years, everything does seem to turn into an emergency. There is always a crisis going on with these guys. But this is about preventive care, saving the taxpayers money, and making very smart, prudent investments with the hard-earned money that people send here.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. One of the arguments we get from what is a shrinking minority of Members of the House that aren't helping the override proceedings is that this is socialized medicine. And Bush is saying that this is somehow socialized medicine. 
   When this bill passed in 1997, there was a Republican House and a Republican Senate and a Democratic President. So what you are saying is Newt Gingrich and friends during the 1990s were for socialized medicine 
   because they started it. It is an inaccurate argument. 
   The government is not taking over anything. You are still going to go to your doctor and find out where you want to go, kind of like Medicare. But this is about providing children that are poor with health care. The President is trying to say that he wants to clean it up and he is trying to say that he wants to negotiate. This is different than the House bill that passed. This is the Senate version. The Senate has enough votes to override the veto. As the gentlewoman from Ohio said, there are all these Republican Senators. We have a bunch of Republican House Members. And the other day when we were debating it, there were very few Republican House Members that even wanted to come down here and make the argument about what is going on here. 
   We continue today, and we will next week and the following week continue to urge the President. But we need the American people to stand up and say can't Congress at least agree on health care for children. And the only roadblock is the President's veto pen and a group of Republicans in the House. 
   Before I yield, I want to be sure to say that the socialized medicine argument is a red herring because the Republicans created this bill in the 1990s, signed by President Clinton, but in a Republican-controlled House.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think the debate, too, has gotten a little bit off  track, and I quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, find this shameful. 
   One of the statements made by the President: Democratic Members of Congress are putting health coverage for poor children at risk so they can score political points in Washington. 
   Now, that's a shame that that kind of rhetoric's coming out of the White House at this point. When you look, as Mrs. Jones has stated earlier, all of the Republicans that are supporting this bill, this is a bipartisan bill. But there is a small fringe group in this House and the White House that will not allow this bill to pass. 
   Score political points? We're trying to provide health care for kids. This is not where we have a debate and everyone gets little debating points as we go along, and there are a lot of Republicans in this House and in the Senate that want to support children's health care, and for the executive branch to make these kinds of statements I think totally poisons the debate. 
   Here's another thing that some of our friends are saying on the other side, that SCHIP is incremental steps to a government-run health care program. That's just not true. These are children who are now eligible for the program but there's not enough money in it to actually cover them, we're trying to put the money in to cover them. They will go to private doctors and they will get private health care. They're not going to go to the VA, the government-run veterans hospitals. They're going to go to private docs. They're going to be involved in private health care plans.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I want to say that the most important point that I'd like to highlight before we leave, because I know time is running out, all of the waste over the past 6 years under this administration, with the nonsense with FEMA and trailers sitting in Arkansas somewhere that have rotted, the billions of dollars wasted in Iraq where unbid contracts, Halliburton wasting money, losing hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, the tax cuts that went primarily to the top 1 percent, corporate welfare that goes to the oil companies, $14 or $15 billion, we are starting to rein all that in and the President picks children's health care to draw the line in the sand and say we're spending way too much money? 
   That is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. That is unacceptable. All of these opportunities wasted, and now you pick these people? You don't take on the oil companies. You don't take on the top 1 percent 
   billionaires who got tax cuts. You're going to take on little kids? That's the message? That's your legacy? God bless you.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate a couple of points, because we seem to be having this debate every week. It seems to be on the same issues we have always been talking about. But I find it not necessarily enjoyable, but an obligation, to get up and communicate to the American taxpayer and the citizens of this country that over the last 6 years, the Republican House, Republican Senate, Republican White House, borrowed $3 trillion. They asked the Treasury Department to raise the debt limit five or six times to allow them to go out and borrow more money. 
   You borrowed it from China. You borrowed it from Japan. You borrowed it from OPEC countries. On and on and on and on. All of a sudden, 5 or 6 months into this year, before we have even passed a budget, you are lecturing us on fiscal responsibility. 
   I want the taxpayers, Mr. Chairman, to keep their forms from this year and compare them to their tax forms next year. They will see absolutely no increase in their taxes whatsoever. None. Zero. So, there is not a tax increase in this 2008 budget. 
   Now, let's talk about what you are proposing to cut with this amendment. 
   Superfund sites. Okay, you want to cut the Superfund site program that is going to clean up the most toxic sites. In many of the old industrial areas like mine, the gentleman knows very well, they were polluted in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. We can't develop the local economy because where we have water lines and where we have sewer lines, they are contaminated. 
   Quite frankly, the city of Youngstown and the city of Warren do not have millions of dollars to put into this because their tax base has eroded. If you want us to contribute to the tax base like we did in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when, quite frankly, a lot of that money that was taken out of Youngstown, Ohio, was used to develop the West and to develop new water lines and sewer lines in the South in many of your districts, all we are asking is for a little bit of help.     
   Help us clean up the brownfield sites. 
   How about your cutting the methamphetamine prevention and treatment program? I am sure you can't wait to get back to your districts and tell that to your constituents. How about those of you in the West fighting wildfires? You are going to cut that program. 
   Mr. Chairman, many will say there are not any cuts in this bill. There are cuts in this bill: $193 million cut from construction account, it eliminates $31 million for landowner incentives; $39 million cut for the EPA Mexican border program; $24 million cut from the EPA Alaska Village setaside; $24 million cut from the Indiana land consolidation. There are cuts in here. We are not raising taxes. We are making investments into our community. 
   Just because, Mr. Chairman, the minority party raised the debt $3 trillion, just because the minority party is ashamed, quite frankly, of their behavior over the past 6 years doesn't mean that they can displace all of their shamefulness on the new Democratic majority. I wouldn't want to admit that I borrowed $3 trillion from Japan and China either. I would run from it as fast as I could. But that doesn't change the facts. 
   So I think we should vote down this amendment. There are great investments for local communities all over the country in this bill, and I think we should keep it.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, in the city of Akron, which I represent a part of, their obligation for the EPA is $400 million in the city of Akron. Our friends on the other side are saying that there is no role for the Federal Government to play. 
   You have communities like Akron, you have communities like Youngstown that have lost significant industry over the past 20 or 30 years; and if we want to bring industry back, if we want to grow industry, we can't have brownfields all over our cities. 
   This is an investment. This is going to clean the site up. This is an opportunity for us to redevelop sites in our communities. 
   Now, 30 years ago when the steel mills were pumping, when the rubber industry was pumping, a lot of our tax dollars were going to many of your communities to help lay down roads, build the interstate, rail lines, water infrastructure, all of these things. What this bill does is it tries to reinvest back into some of these communities. We want to be self-sufficient, but we don't have the local tax base. There is a role here for the Federal Government. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask my friends, why would you want to prevent us from cleaning up brownfield sites in the old industrial areas? We don't need it forever. We just need to clean them up, and then we will have a tax base there and have more taxpayers to pay taxes and keep the tax rates low for everybody, because we will have more. But if we can't develop these sites, it becomes very, very difficult for us to grow our local economy. 
   We need the Federal Government to make these investments, and that is exactly what this bill does.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I just want to respond to the gentleman from Georgia who said the individual taxpayers can spend their money better than government. The taxpayers in my district can't clean a brownfield, go out with 50 bucks and clean a brownfield. This is something we need to do collectively as a community and as a country, to clean that up. Individuals can't do that. 
   Individuals couldn't build the interstate highways and the railroads and the Panama Canal and all the great infrastructure projects that we have had. We need help to do this in some communities so we can be self-sufficient, and individuals can't do that.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman. And part of what you were saying, some of those initiatives, the manufacturing extension program and some of these initiatives that we have had in this country that have really been able to help small businesses kind of retool themselves, where this budget is cutting them we have had to fight over the last few years to get the levels up. These are budgets we need to not only not be cutting, but we need to be probably doubling the size of the budget because of the kind of value that they yield and the kind of businesses that they help. 
   When you look at what has happened over the past 5 years, we have had economic growth, but wages are down 3.2 percent. We are not arguing that the economy is not growing. We all know it is. We all see the same statistics. What we are saying is that it is not benefiting everybody. And what does our response need to be from the President, from the Congress as to how do we close that gap between the rich and the poor? And some of the initiatives that are being cut are going to further harm and aggravate and exacerbate the problems that we have now that we are trying to fix. 
   So a couple points that I want to make here, and I want to thank you guys for being down here, that the President just doesn't even address. Here they are: Updated by Tom Manatos, one of the go to guys in the Speaker's office. Here we have the new charts for the budget, 2008 budget authority. 
   Interest payments on the debt. That in the red is the interest payments. We are talking about $230-some billion of what we are going to spend. That is what this country will spend just on interest on the debt; not paying the debt down, just paying the interest payments from the people we are borrowing the money from. 
   This is what we are going to pay in education or spend on education, and green what we are going to spend on veterans. This is what we are going to spend on homeland security. So the American people, Mr. Speaker, know quite clearly that we are spending too much of our money on paying down the interest. 
   Now, it is an important point to be made that this President, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, and the previous Republican Congress borrowed more money from foreign interests in the last 5 years than every President in Congress previous to them combined. 
   So I find it very interesting that we hear our friends talk about how when they owned a small business they had to balance the budget. We know that. But when you got into this institution, this is what you did. So please spare us the lectures on fiscal responsibility.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. So not only is the government not making the investments to keep tuition costs down, not making sure that we try to invest our money to reduce the cost of health care and Medicare and Medicaid, SCHIP, and some of these fundamental programs that we all believe in. We are  not only not making those, but here is the critical components because, as you said, you get the additional burden of the interest rates going up for credit cards and everything else that ripples throughout your own than personal life. 
   Here is the kicker. Of that red graph there, that red bar of net interest that we are paying interest on the debt, where are we getting the money? That is the question that we ask. Where do we get the money to close the budget deficit? Here it is, ladies and gentlemen: Foreign debt held doubled under the Bush administration to over $2 trillion. 
   So we are not only spending money we don't have, we are not only giving millionaires tax cuts. But in order to close the gap, we are borrowing the money from the Chinese, OPEC countries, the Japanese in order to close this gap. So our kids are going to be paying the Bank of China and the Bank of Japan and the countries from OPEC, which is totally, totally ridiculous as to what our priorities need to be. So we need to get this budget balanced. 
   I want to make one final point before I kick it back to you guys. We are going to ask people who make millions of dollars a year to pay more in taxes, because they have benefited from this system. Here is our option: We either go back to the Chinese and we borrow more money from them, or we ask people who have made millions and hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars to help us close this budget gap.     
   Now what would you do if you were in our position? Do you ask a millionaire to pay a little bit more in taxes or do you go borrow more from the Chinese and ask middle class kids and lower middle class kids to foot the bill? 
   There is not a decision to be made. We have got to ask the wealthiest in our country to be responsible citizens of the United States of America. You benefit from our military. You benefit from the stability of our markets. You benefit from our public education. You benefit from our public infrastructure. You benefit from the water lines and sewer lines, clean air and clean water. All we are saying is we have to ask you to contribute so that we do not have to borrow money from the Chinese in order to fund it. 
   We cannot be afraid. We do not want to stymie small business. We do not want to take away tax incentives from small business people to reinvest back into the economy. We want to keep things like that intact, but we do need to ask the wealthiest in the country to pay their fair share.

That budget would become law in the United States of America. The only thing standing between that budget and the American people is Nancy Pelosi and HARRY REID, or that stack of paper would become law, and the wealthiest in the country would continue to get tax cuts. We would continue down this road, borrow more money from Japan and China and OPEC countries. There would not be an investment in S-CHIP. There would not be all the stuff that Mr. Altmire listed. It is interesting to just say, hey, the American people did make a point to put us between that budget and their everyday lives.

   Included in our analysis of that document are going to be hearing upon hearing upon hearing. I have seen the schedule. We are going to get into the nuts and bolts of that to figure out how we can make these programs run better, how we can make S-CHIP with the same amount of money or more money cover more people, how does it get executed, the same with what we need to do with FEMA. Obviously, we saw that in Katrina. 
   Mr. Murtha's having hearings and Mr. Skelton in the Armed Services Committee about the war, and how do we make that mess go away and make it work better, the execution of war and what we are trying to do, how do we make this thing work better. 
   So this is not just about writing bigger checks. This is about making this whole system run better and more efficiently and more effectively and serve more people.

We often hear in these debates how, you know, a certain party wants to spend money and waste money on this or that, and we are not saying that there is not waste in government, and we certainly want to address that. Our friends, our Republican friends, have done absolutely nothing to try to improve that. In fact, they borrowed more money from China to help fund the inefficiencies. 
   But what we are saying here is here is a program that covers poor kids. It gives health care coverage to poor kids. So they don't go to school and cough on your kid and get your kid sick, not to mention the humanity of trying to make sure that they have the proper amount of health care.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I find this an appropriate time, as we are wrapping up, I think, we only have a couple of minutes left, to remember what happened here in the first 100 hours that is in contrast to that document there. Of all the things we talked about in the last 55 minutes or so, 45 minutes, we should make note of that in the first 100 hours the Democratic Congress raised the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour. We cut student loan interest rates in half that will save the average family $4,400, so you get a pay raise. If you have a kid in school that is taking out loans, we will save you $4,400. 
   We allowed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate down drug prices so our seniors will have less cost to bear for their drug prices, and then we repealed the corporate welfare and invested that money in alternative energy and passed a stem cell research bill to open up two new sectors of the economy for job growth. Compare the first 100 hours and who we helped, and you take that document there that cuts health care for poor kids. That is the difference between what the American people did in the last election, and what we had to deal with within the last, between 6 and 14 years, depending on how you are counting. 
   Now I get to do this again, show you guys how to do this.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And one of the issues that was brought up today by the President that we want to discuss--and I very much appreciate you making the presentation as to the other side of the debate that our friends made over the last hour. But a couple of the points that were made on the other side is that, well, if we go offshore, you go into the Outer Continental Shelf region, it's deep water, it's going to cost $2 billion just to maybe get into the well. Well, when you look into the profits from 2007 for the oil companies, $123 billion in profits last year. So the reason they give that they have to increase the price is because it is expensive to get into some of this deep water; no one is disputing that fact.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Much of this money has already been spent in the surveying and the geological work. So now you have, last year, $123 billion in profits. That's what you get the money for because you say it's expensive to get in there. So you're making all the profits and not necessarily going in to get the oil. 
   And then another comment earlier was made, well, it may take 7 years. Well, if you go to ANWR, you're not going to get a drop out for 10 years. And in 20 years--and I love how this ANWR has just become the silver bullet. If you go into ANWR today, or  even if you did go into ANWR in 1995, Madam Speaker, that will only save you, after 20 years of, when ANWR gets to peak production, it will save 1.8 cents per gallon of gas, period, at peak production. 
   ANWR is not a silver bullet. And if ANWR were the silver bullet, the gentleman from Pennsylvania and I would be standing on top of this Capitol waving the ANWR flag saying, this is all we need to do in America is to go to ANWR and pull out this oil that's there. And so I think it's misleading, Madam Speaker, for the President to come before the American people and say that this ANWR is a major component of us reducing our dependency on foreign oil.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And we're not getting this information, unlike has been proposed in some places that this is all coming from the Sierra Club, that all this information is coming from the League of Conservation Voters or some left-wing, liberal political group that doesn't care about energy and wants us all to move to a commune and then we'll all be fine. This is coming from the Department of Energy. These ANWR statistics are coming from the Department of Energy. And the Department of Energy is the executive branch, which is run by George W. Bush. These are the President's own people telling us from the Energy Information Administration of what exactly the numbers are. We are not making this up. 
   So on one side he comes out and says, ``We need to drill in ANWR. That is a major component of our energy policy.'' And his own energy people are saying, ``In 20 years it will save you 2 cents a gallon.'' Now many of our colleagues here have said, ``We are Americans. This is America.'' Well, the America that I know doesn't say, ``We are going to really do it and save 2 cents a gallon in gas 20 years from now.'' That is not America. That is not America. America is saying, ``We are going to be energy independent.'' 
   The problem with our friends and the disagreement that we have with the President and with our friends in the Republican Party is the basic idea that we can drill our way out of this problem. Because we can't. We have 1.6 percent of the known oil reserves in the world in the United States. And we consume 25 percent of daily oil consumption, my friend, and that means that no matter how much we drill, if we just keep drilling and drilling and drilling, we will still have to import oil. We will still be dependent on the Middle East. We will still be caught up in these political games that we are in right now in the Middle East. And we will still be in this tenuous web of dictatorships and who's got the oil and what are the supply lines and how do we keep it safe and how do we get to the market. We will still be involved in all of that. 
   But what the Democrats are trying to do is to take this money and invest it into alternative energy research and development. This should have been done years ago. And some of our friends on the other side and the President comes out today, it was like the President hasn't been around for the last 7 years. You control the House. You control the Senate. You control the White House. Republicans were controlling the whole capital in Washington, D.C. when I first got down here in 2002. The President got here 2 years before. Why aren't we drilling in ANWR? They said Clinton vetoed it in 1995. Why didn't the President pass it through? Why didn't the President move us forward with the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate with Trent Lott and Tom DeLay and all the other leaders that were down here? 
   That is failed leadership. We are here to clean up the mess. And now look where we are, at over $4 per gallon for gas.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And if the President wanted to have short-term impact on the cost, we have got to deal with the speculation in the commodities market. Period. Now economists are saying anywhere from 10 percent to 100 percent of the increase is from this speculation, so put that all together, and it is 40 or 50 percent of the increase. But if we take care of the speculation and the President would show Presidential leadership and come to Congress and say let's do something with the commodity prices and the futures speculation and Congress passed something on this so we can have short term, I would say, ``You know what--there's some leadership.'' Let's get that done. Let's get it through Congress. Get it through the Senate. Let's have him sign it. And let's try to reduce this cost by 40 or 50 percent. That would get us under $100 a barrel if we  could reduce the increase that has happened because of the speculation. 
   But he did not do that because a lot of what comes out of the executive branch today, Madam Speaker, is political. And you go back to the war, and you remember ``greeted as liberators,'' you remember that ``we're going to use the oil for reconstruction,'' you remember all the promises that were made. That is what this administration has said. And then it came to the economy: ``Well, you know, as long as we cut taxes for the top 1 percent of the people, the domestic economy is going to take off. It's going to be a stimulant. We're going to take off. It will be good for the middle class.'' That hasn't worked. 
   And then you look at the fiscal policy where he said, the administration said, ``Trust me.'' And we have raised the debt limit in this country. All of us. And the Republicans were leading the House, the Senate and the White House at the time, but this is America's money. They raised the debt limit five times and borrowed 
   $3 trillion, $1 trillion of it from foreign interests including OPEC and China. 
   The President said, ``Trust me.'' Now he comes out today and says, ``If we only drill more in the United States, then we will solve this problem.'' But we have got to keep drilling and drilling and drilling. And you and I are here saying, ``Fine. Go ahead and drill.'' There are 68 million acres. There are 8,000 leases. There is 80 percent of the oil that we know that we have in the United States on those 68 million acres. Drill and go get it. But when you only have 1.6 percent of the world's oil, and you consume 25 percent, you can drill until the cows come home. We're not going to drill our way to energy independence. That is just not going to happen. 
   So as leaders in this Chamber and as leaders in the Congress, we have got to come up with a better solution. And that is what we have done. We took the $14 billion that was going for subsidies to the oil companies and moved that into alternative energy research so that we truly can be energy independent. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. I don't feel bad for the oil companies. They want to go drill here and we won't let them. There is a reason. Why wouldn't we want to let them go to ANWR if it were going to be this big major solution? 
   Here are the facts of the matter. The green are areas of land that are open for leasing for oil offshore. Open for leasing is the green. What is closed is the red. They have all of this to go ahead and drill in. Go ahead. Drill. Drill to your heart's content. It's already open, the EPA permitting, you're ready, set, go. Go and do it.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Now here, does drilling lower gas prices? Okay. So the red here are drilling permits that have been issued from 1994. The blue are the wells that have been drilled. So you see that the permits have increased, especially in the last few years. The red are the permits. The blue are the wells that have been drilled and the wells that have not been drilled as to the permitting. So with all of this going on, the price of gas has skyrocketed, commodities issues and a lot of other things going on here. But what we are saying is, you have all of these permits to drill where the executive branch, President Bush's executive branch, is telling us that this is where the oil is, and the oil companies have found the oil there and got the permits and did the studies as you have pointed out earlier. And they have all this room here to dig, to drill, to pull the rigs up and to do everything that they have to do. And this is where you could pull out where these leases are, 4.8 million barrels of oil a day. In ANWR, it is how many barrels of oil a day?

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It would be very little impact. I tell my constituents this all the time when we are chatting, if there is a politician that has one silver bullet, if we just do this, that all of these problems are going to go away, be very, very, very skeptical.     
   We grow up learning, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The oil companies are spending a lot of money, I'm sure, through Internet traffic, through advertising and TV about how they're going green. So ExxonMobil, Mr. Speaker, has spent--the industry totally--$52 million on advertising about how they're going green and everything else. ExxonMobil, of their $40 billion in profits, has spent $10 million on alternative energy research and development. That is not the direction. So, when we say that it is important for us to shoot the Moon like we did in the 1960s and get into the alternative energy, that's why. That's what we have to do. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. So that's what we're saying, and that's what the whole new direction of Congress has been about, which is, when you're making these decisions, you have to base your public policy decisions on the facts. When the facts say this, that no matter how much you're drilling and you're not keeping up for whatever reason and you only have not even 2 percent of the total oil in the world that is in the United States, 1.6 percent, and you're consuming 25 percent, any businessperson who is sitting in our seat here, looking at these facts, would say we've got a problem. We can't keep drilling. 
   You know, maybe we need to drill now and do what we can in the short term, but this is no long-term solution. This is clearly a problem that we have for our country. So, nuclear, biodiesel, wind, coal to liquid, whatever the case may be, those are the directions in which we need to move. 
   Now, a lot of folks are talking about refining capacity, so I think it's important to realize that our refineries are currently running at 88 percent. We are not at full capacity with our refineries. Everyone keeps saying, ``Build more refineries. Build more refineries.'' In 2005, there was a 50 percent tax credit for any company that wanted to build a new refinery, and they have not. All of the big dogs over the last 20 or 30 years have said we have no interest in building a new refinery. They're making $130 billion in profits a year. Now, all of a sudden, we feel bad for the oil companies? 
   The President basically came out today and said I know we're running down a dead end, but let's run faster. Let's put the juices on. Put on your new tennis shoes. You know, put on two pairs of socks so you don't get any blisters, and keep running down the wrong road until you just smack your head right into the wall. 
   What we're saying is we know how that movie ends. We know. We don't have enough oil to drill our way out of this thing. That's how that ends. 
   So let's, please, go in another direction, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, we have other illustrative charts here. This is the Outer Continental Shelf: The acres that have been leased and the acres producing. So this is in the Outer Continental Shelf already, 44 million acres, and only 10.5 million acres are being utilized. That's in the Outer Continental Shelf. It just helps. You read it, but it helps. These are statistics that are coming from the Energy Department. These aren't things that we're making up.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I'm sure the oil companies spent a good deal of money to identify the area. They hired a lot of geologists whom, I'm sure, they have working for them. They spent a lot of money and used a lot of technology to identify this. 
   But this is the area that is underdeveloped, and the President comes out and says ignore all of this, and go to ANWR or do this, which is not even being done now, and then go to ANWR. There are 4.8 million barrels of oil that would come out of this per day at maximum production and, in ANWR, 800,000. This is the Outer Continental Shelf and this is onshore. It's the same kind of situation: 47 million. Only 13.2 acres that are actually in production right now. Again, there is the number of permits. 
   It's interesting because we kind of went through this a few years back. You'd hear testimony from executives, and you'd hear about supply and demand. Then with the situation dealing with Enron, all of a sudden, it was not supply and demand. All of a sudden, it was all this manipulation that was going on. 
   Our job here is to oversee what is going on in the markets and figure out how we can make sure that everything is above board, that everything is legal. 
   Now, a few weeks ago on a Friday, the increase in the cost of a barrel of oil was more than a whole barrel of oil cost 10 years prior to. Something funny is going on here, and I think we need to move with the commodities issue. We've already done the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We've already passed out of the House that which deals with the cartels. These are steps that we are taking, but if we don't move into the  alternative energy category, we're going to be sitting here 10 years from now, dealing with the same, exact issue that we're dealing with today.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think it's important that we realize that this is not going to be some kind of very narrow solution to the problems that the country is in now. The point is that when President Bush came into office, there was a pretty good economic forecast, a lot of things were stable, it was time to make some key investments. That did not happen, and the situation got dramatically worse. 
   The middle class has continued to get squeezed, whether it was energy costs, health care costs, tuition costs, everything in the 6 years in which the President was pushing all of his agendas. I've said this more than one time on this House floor. There is no need to wonder about what the neoconservative Republican agenda would look like, because we are living in it today. 
   All you have to do is go to the gas pump, get your health care bill, pay your kids' college tuition, deal with the global environment, look at the foreign policy of this country, the destabilization of the Middle East, unable to deal with China. We deal with a lot of trade issues, with China, with Wheatland Tube that has a facility in my district, a facility in your district, in imports coming in from China. 
   It's tough for us to advocate the administration to be hard on China, to take a firm stance on China, because the administration at the same time is borrowing money from China to finance the $12 billion a month for the war in Iraq. 
   So the foreign policy of the United States has destabilized the region where a lot of the oil is, and that has not helped the situation. Our domestic problems continue to exist because we are living under the President's current economic policies. The debt burden that has been placed on our children and grandchildren over the next generation was put in place, the $3 trillion borrowed, this is the conservative Republican agenda currently implemented. 
   We are trying now to take the Congress in a new direction and to move into alternative energy so we don't have this dependency which would relieve the pressure for a lot of the foreign policy issues that we are dealing with, to use PAYGO to pay for what we are spending here in Washington D.C., to try to repair this debt and eventually pare down the debt so that we can have a firm negotiating stance with China, these all fit together. We can't continue to go down this same road. At every instance, the New Direction Congress has changed course from the current administration. 
   But that did not stop the President from coming before the American people today and asking the American people to continue to go down a road that is a dead end, and that's drilling. 
   It's amazing to me, whether we are dealing with the supplemental, or dealing with the regular order of business here in Congress, when we try to push an agenda of helping the soldiers, for example, we are trying to get the GI Bill, which would pay for 4 years of college for our soldiers who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, for free. They have served this country. We need an economic recovery, we need brain power. These young men and young women should have 3, 4 years of college. 
   But the President says, we don't have the money and turns around and asks for $140 billion in the supplemental to continue the war at $12 billion a month. 
   Now, I don't think anyone is saying tomorrow, we are going to be able to pull out of Iraq. I think everyone knows that this would be a process. But what we are saying is why do we always have money for war, and then when our soldiers come back and we want to put them through college and reward the effort, all of a sudden the President says we don't have the money when he has just got done borrowing $3 trillion. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I just want to share, because this is third-party validation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask to have this submitted for the Record, all these quotes in order. 
   Vice President Dick Cheney: 
   ``Oil is being drilled right now 60 miles off the coast of Florida. We're not doing it. The Chinese are in cooperation with the Cuban government.'' That was June 12. 
   Minority Leader BOEHNER: 
   ``Right at this moment, some 60 miles or less off the coast of Key West, Florida, China has the green light to drill for oil in order to lower energy costs in that country. Do Congressional Democrats really trust the Chinese that much more than Americans?'' That was from June 11 of this year. 
   Minority Whip ROY BLUNT: 
   ``Even China recognizes that oil and natural gas is readily available off our shores; thanks to Fidel Castro, they've been given a permit to drill for oil 45 miles from the Florida Keys. U.S. energy producers can't go there, and that's because our Congress won't let them.'' That was also on June 11. 
   But then, as you stated earlier, Congressional Research Service says, facts, third-party validator, nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: 
   ``While there has been some concern about China's potential involvement in offshore deepwater oil projects, to date its involvement in Cuba's oil sector has been focused on onshore extraction in Pinar del Rio province through its state-run China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec).'' 
   From the Miami Herald, they had a quote from Jorge Pinon, an energy expert at the University of Miami: 
   ``China is not drilling in Cuba's Gulf of Mexico waters, period.'' This gentleman, from Miami's Center for Hemispheric Policy, who supports oil and gas exploration, said he met with several congressional offices Wednesday about the China-Cuba connection. He said he told them: ``If you guys want to use this as a scare tactic to lift the moratorium on drilling off the west coast of Florida, at least be factual, be correct. They didn't do their homework.''  
   Republicans Use Scare Tactics To Promote Failed ``Drill & Veto'' Energy Policies of the Past; GOP Claims China Is Drilling for Oil Off Florida's Coast Proven False 
   American families and businesses are struggling to keep up with skyrocketing gas prices--now averaging a record high of $4.06 per gallon across the country. Instead of working with Democrats to pass legislation addressing high energy costs and moving America to energy independence, Congressional Republicans are spreading scare tactics and proven falsehoods to push their failed ``drill and veto'' energy policies of the past. 
   Republican leaders--including Vice President Cheney--have recently claimed that China is drilling for oil off the coast of Cuba ``60 miles off the coast of Florida.'' But the facts show China does not have a deepwater drilling contract in Cuba.  
   From the Congressional Research Service:
   ``While there has been some concern about China's potential involvement in offshore deepwater oil projects, to date its involvement in Cuba's oil sector has been focused on onshore oil extraction in Pinar del Rio province through its state-run China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation. (Sinopec)'' [CRS, 2/29/08] 
   From today's Miami Herald:
   ``China is not drilling in Cuba's Gulf of Mexico waters, period. .....,'' said Jorge Pi&#241;on, an energy expert at the University of Miami's Center for Hemispheric Policy. ..... 
   ``Pi&#241;on, who supports oil and gas exploration, said he met with several congressional offices Wednesday about the China-Cuba connection. He said he told them: `If you guys want to use this as a scare tactic to lift the moratorium on drilling off the west coast of Florida, at least be factual, be correct.' They didn't do their homework.'' [6/12/08]  
   The New Direction Congress is committed to bringing real relief to those feeling the pinch from high gas and diesel prices and ensuring the needs of families and businesses are put before the interests of Big Oil. The American people deserve the truth and a cleaner, greener, more energy efficient future. 
   Republican Scare Quotes:  
   Vice President Dick Cheney: 
   ``[O]il is being drilled right now 60 miles off the coast of Florida. We're not doing it. The Chinese are in cooperation with the Cuban government.'' [6/12/08]  
   Minority Leader John Boehner: 
   ``Right at this moment, some 60 miles or less off the coast of Key West, Florida, China has the green light to drill for oil in order to lower energy costs in that country ..... Do congressional Democrats really trust the Chinese that much more than Americans?'' [6/11/08]  
   Minority Whip Roy Blunt: 
   ``Even China recognizes that oil and natural gas is readily available off our shores; thanks to Fidel Castro, they've been given a permit to drill for oil 45 miles from the Florida Keys. U.S. energy producers can't go there, and that's because our Congress won't let them.'' [6/11/08]  
   Rep. George Radanovich (R-California): 
   ``Florida, for example, has objected to U.S. oil exploration off its coast. But China, thanks to a lease issued by Cuba, is drilling for oil just 50 miles off Florida's coast. America's offshore drilling policy amounts to a government handout of U.S. natural resources to foreign countries in the name of environmental protection.'' [6/10/08]

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. That's exactly correct. That lets the facts speak for themselves. That's why we always have third-party validators and, as we stated earlier, go back to the war. Now you  have the President's former press secretary talking about what really happened: 
   ``We're going to be able to use the oil for reconstruction.'' 
   ``We're going to be greeted as liberators.'' 
   ``We had nothing to do with outing a CIA agent.'' 
   ``If we just keep cutting taxes for rich people, the middle class will at some point benefit, and we will stimulate the whole economy.'' 
   ``The tax cuts lead to more revenue.'' 
   Is that why we borrowed $3 trillion over the last 3 years? 
   And now it's if we just drill more, we're going to reduce the cost of gas, which is not the case. Or if we just drill in ANWR, we're going to significantly reduce the cost of gas. Then it was in the last week or two, China's right off the coast of Cuba stealing it from us. We should be there. Not true. 
   All of these have not been true, and now the same gentlemen who provided all of those arguments and used the bully pulpit to provide all those arguments are now saying, let's just keep going down the wrong road. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Absolutely. One of the issues is we have in this country only 300 million people. We are now competing in a globalized economy with China and India and a variety of other rising economic countries. So we have to make a point that all of our 300 million citizens, a major disadvantage in human capital, are educated. 
   You've probably had a similar experience as I have had dealing with interns and staff members and people you have met back in the district. The benefits that a soldier brings to your organization, because of the discipline, the focus and the organizational skills, the ability to deal with situations that are very challenging, and you add to that a college degree or a master's degree or a Ph.D. or a law degree, you are talking about someone who is prepared to really contribute value to whatever organization they are joining, whether it is government or business. There can't be a better investment to make. 
   And why is it that we have enough wherewithal to borrow the money for the $12 billion a month, but when these soldiers come back, the President says I'm going to veto that bill. We don't have the money for that bill. 
   I think of all of the issues that you mentioned earlier, it is important for us to recognize that last year under a Democratic Congress, led by Speaker Pelosi and HARRY REID, we made the largest increase for veterans' benefits in the 77-year history of the VA because as Democrats, we are committed to the soldiers. Whether you are on one side of the war issue or another, we all say we are behind the soldier. And when the soldier comes home, you will have the health care and the benefits you deserve. And we want to add onto that this GI bill. So we have made that commitment and will continue to push for that commitment for this GI bill so we can reward the soldiers. It is important for us to deal with this issue. 
   All of these posters with all of the information can be found on the Speaker's Website, the 30-Something Website that we have. You will be able to find, you will be able to get all of these. All of these are available for Members to look at and analyze and to get a visual of what we have been talking about over the last few minutes.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It has been said a couple times here today about money in people's pockets. And I would suggest that under the leadership of the Democrats and the Republicans, who have been great, on the Appropriations Committee, we are putting money back in the pockets of average American people. 
   Only half of the people in my congressional district got a tax cut. Only half. And the ones that got it only got a couple hundred dollars. So when you look at the big tax cuts that supposedly went to people who live in Youngstown and Akron, Ohio, that was a couple hundred dollars, and you compare that with what we are doing with the Pell Grants, an increase of $500 or $600, that is going to people in my district. So we are already $400 ahead of the tax cut that the Republicans were so generous to give. 
   When you look at cutting student loan interest rates in half, saving $4,000 over the course of a loan, that is money in the pockets of people who live in most of our congressional districts. 
   And I am thankful for the concern for the American families, but I wish our friends on the other side, at least most of them, were around when we tried to give them a pay raise and increase the minimum wage. They are talking about taking money out of their pockets. We are trying to put money in their pockets. That is what we are trying to do here. 
   And as the gentleman from New York made the point a few minutes ago, we are funding 2,800 cops. We can't pass police and fire levies in my district because the cities just don't have the money, and we don't have the local economy. 
   The Federal Government does have a responsibility to make our streets  safer. That is what this bill does. That is what the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee have done. And that is why this amendment needs to go down. This is not the time to start cutting police officers going to our streets to make our communities safer so that we can grow our local economies.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It is very interesting and we need to continue to point this out: We had a measure within the first 100 hours we were here to cut $14 billion from the oil company subsidies, and my friends on the other side couldn't find the courage to vote for that, but they want to do it on the back of these COPS programs in our local neighborhoods. Ninety billion dollars' worth of tax shelters, they didn't vote for that, but yet they want to cut COPS programs in our local communities. They had the opportunity to stop funding these huge tax cuts and subsidies to the oil companies, refused to do that for fear of alienation, and now they choose to do it on the backs of these programs.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think it is funny that we got the socialism talking points back out, Mr. Chairman. Dusted them from 1992 and 1993, and now they are back out. But this is exactly right, Mr. Israel. This is about putting agents, cops on the street. This is about national security. This is about protecting our country. 
   Now, I think it is important that we get a little bit into the details on a couple of these programs that the gentlelady's amendment is going to cut and that the previous two amendments were going to cut, too, because I think it is easy for us to say you are going to cut cops and cut the FBI. It doesn't sound like a whole lot. 
   But as the gentleman from New York stated earlier, there has been a decrease in FBI criminal agents by 29 percent from 6,200 to 4,400 agents. So what the committee did, in all its wisdom in a bipartisan way, said we need to hire more people. For what exact programs? Well, why don't we take a look here. 
   National security field investigations is one of the programs that would be cut under this amendment. Now, many of our friends on the other side of the aisle say, what, is the world going to end if we cut this by 0.5 percent? Is the  world going to end if we cut this by 1 percent? Is the world going to end if we cut this by 3 percent? Let's look at exactly what you're cutting. Just in this one little program, national security field investigations, the committee wants to hire 245 positions, 150 agents, 95 support personnel to increase the level of field resources dedicated to national security investigations. This amendment will cut agents from being on the street protecting the United States of America. 
   Let's look at another one, surveillance. This committee wants to hire another 50 people, 50 positions under the surveillance program to provide additional resources for the FBI to conduct surveillance in support of priority national security investigations. Do you think this isn't going to affect anything? There are going to be less agents investigating. There are going to be less agents listening to the terrorists who already may be in this country. This amendment will ensure that these agents don't get in the field, they don't get hired, and that they don't listen to what the terrorists are saying and hopefully protecting the United States of America from the next terrorist plot. 
   This is a dangerous amendment that puts this country's security in jeopardy.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, we had an opportunity within the first 100 hours to cut $14 billion from going to the oil companies. We supported it. Our friends on the other side of the aisle rejected that approach; they would rather take it out of security. So I think it is important we go back. 
   My friend from Tennessee said where do we slow the growth. Well, we tried to slow it from going to the oil companies and we tried to slow it from going to corporations who harbor themselves in these far-off distant lands to avoid paying taxes. Our friends choose to take it out of security. 
   Let's look at a couple more of these programs because sometimes the details hurt. Crimes Against Children, which is a program we have, the committee wanted to have an increase of 14 positions to provide a coordinated investigative, operational and intelligence effort to combat crimes against children and to address child abduction, predators who sexually assault children, and child prostitution. There will not be 14 positions to protect our children if this amendment passes. 
   How about this one, weapons of mass destruction directorate. Sounds like a pretty good idea post-9/11, and in a bipartisan way it passed out of committee. Here is what it will do. The committee wants to hire 146 positions, 29 agents, 69 support personnel, to develop the essential baseline capabilities to build a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program designed to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the threat of weapons of mass destruction. If this amendment passes, we are going to have less agents trying to find folks who are in our country trying to unleash weapons of mass destruction. 
   How about the Data Intercept and Access program; 41 positions, 6 agents, 35 support to provide the technical expertise, training and necessary equipment to execute lawfully authorized electronic surveillance of data network communications facilities trying to protect us. This bill has some essential components to it. 
   This committee went to great lengths to make sure that they would make the proper investments. This is very well thought out. I think we would be hard-pressed to find any American who would read this and say no, you know what, we should not hire that many agents. We should give that money to the oil companies. I don't think there are many Americans who would say that. 
   One more before I yield back. Render Safe Mission, the RSM program; nine positions, three agents, six support personnel to address the White House directive, the White House directive, giving the FBI the mission to respond to devices involving weapons of mass destruction within the United States and its territories. Within the United States. This is not about Iraq. This is not about Afghanistan. This is about funding nine positions in this one specific field, people who are experts to keep this country safe. 
   I think the more we get into these programs, the more ridiculous some of these amendments seem. The American people would not support a 0.5 percent decrease in these programs, not a 1 percent decrease in these programs, not a 3 percent decrease in these programs. These are essential. 
   When you look at the money, Mr. Chairman, that has been wasted in Iraq on unbid, no-bid contracts, no oversight provided at all, when you look at the $14 billion we tried to get off the oil companies, that makes sense. Get that money. Don't get it on the backs of FBI agents who are going to be operating surveillance operations here in the United States.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I would like to continue the math analogy and the math equation here. 
   What do you get if you have a weapons of mass destruction directorate program that has 146 positions, and you cut that budget by .5 percent or 3 percent? Well, we won't get into the details, but you get less than 146 positions. That is a cut. 
   What do you get if you cut the Render Safe Mission program that wants to hire nine people, and you cut that by 1 percent? You're going to get less than the nine people. 
   Stop cutting national security.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I just want to go through a little bit of the details here and some of the logic and some of the facts. 
   There's been an increase in crime. There's been an increase in methamphetamine use. So the committee said, as Mr. Obey stated, in reaction to that, we're trying to, we'll do the southwest border and methamphetamine enforcement program, hire eight positions, four full-time equivalents, in order to attack a poly-drug-trafficking organization located along the southwest border by increasing DEA's intelligence gathering, detection monitoring and surveillance capabilities. Most of the methamphetamines coming into our country are made in California or in Mexico, out West, very close to the gentlewoman's district. 
   What this program does is it hires people to try to address this problem, and basically there's been a DEA hiring freeze.     
   We want to increase this. We want to spend money, invest in this program, one, because we will allow the DEA to hire more agents to address this issue that is growing, so you need to grow the agents that are going to address the issue. 
   But, two, this is going to save us money in the long run. When Mr. Obey says the price of everything and the value of nothing, that's what we're talking about. Why wouldn't we want to make this small investment to try to prevent the long-term consequences of these young people with drug treatment, in prison, with insurance claims, this has a long-term ripple effect that will cost us 10 times the amount of money. 
   Finally, the gentlelady said, I hope you don't mean to say that we don't want to address this issue, or this issue isn't important to us. I think it's important to note that the President's budget, when he submitted it to the Congress of the United States, terminated this program. He cut it completely. He zeroed it out. 
   I hope our friends on Capitol Hill will take a walk down Pennsylvania Avenue and let the President understand the kind of importance that this program has and ultimately the amount of money that will save us. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Musgrave). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman. 
   I would just like to make a couple of points. The gentleman from Texas mentioned entitlements. I think it's important for the Members to recall that it was the Republican majority that passed a trillion dollars in spending on the Medicare part D program and had zero, zero ability for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate down drug prices to keep them under control. 
   And my good friend from Ohio made the point about families, this family in his district, a middle-class family. This new Congress raised the minimum wage which will help that middle-class family. This Congress in the Labor-H bill passed an increase of $600 or $700 million in the Pell Grant. They're trying to send their kids to school. That  will help. And we cut student loan interest rates in half. So that same family who has to borrow money will have to pay back $4,000 less over the course of the loan. 
   We're helping that family, and I'm glad we can agree on that.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, that's twice in the past 2 days that our friend from Georgia has admitted being on the fringe. In response to the claim that I am on the fringe voting for this bill, I would just like to say I joined his colleagues, every Republican on the Labor-H subcommittee from all over, conservative Republicans, in support of this bill. 
   The gentleman from New York; Mr. Regula, the gentleman from Ohio, these are balanced, fair investments. 
   As the gentleman from New York stated, we are not raising taxes. Check, keep your forms from last year, your tax forms, and compare them to next year. There will not be an increase in your taxes. 
   What we are doing is we are not spending the money on the banks, we are spending it on the kids. We are not giving it to the oil companies, we are giving it to the kids for education and health care. 
   It's a difference in priorities. There is not a tax increase in here, and the bottom line is we make investments into the future of our country.  
   I find it offensive and staggering that the minority leader can come here, along with our friends, and talk about leaving the country in better shape than they found it, or that we have that obligation. Three trillion dollars in debt under your watch, Republican House, Republican Senate, Republican White House, $3 trillion. 
   The gentleman from Ohio wasn't here, but this Congress asked the Secretary of the Treasury to raise the debt limit five or six times so they could go out and borrow more money from China, more money from Japan, more money from OPEC countries. So we don't need lectures on how to leave the country better off than we found it.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Chairman, we believe we do have a fringe four or five here in the Congress. And it's not, when the gentleman refers to me or the gentleman from New York or the chairman, you're talking about a  bill that passed out of the committee with unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans. You will see on the floor it will pass with Democrat and Republican votes. This is a bipartisan bill. 
   But we have a fringe group in the House that consistently wants to try to find out and try to figure out how to make things work. And what this bill does is it invests in our future. And the bottom line is this. We're now competing with 1.3 billion people in China, 1.2 billion people in India, competitive global economy. 
   And over the last few years, we've seen for the average American people, and the gentleman from Georgia said, well, we want people to keep more of their own money. So do we. But they haven't been over the past few years. 
   There's been a $3,200 increase in their energy costs, a $1,200 increase in their health insurance, a 40 percent increase in college tuition. Wages for college grads in the last 4 or 5 years is down 5.2 percent. 
   Gas prices, the fastest growing part of the budget has been the interest payments on the debt. But our bill addresses middle class family wages, down $1,669 over the past 2 years. So the American people have not been able to keep more of their own money. And so our agenda, through this bill and other bills that we have passed addressed that issue. 
   How do you reduce the cost of energy? You make investments in research and development, and that will yield us benefits down the line. 
   How do you help families send their kids to schools? You invest money into the Pell Grant. You cut student loan interest rates in half. And the difference really has been with the student loan interest rates, we're not spending any more money. What we're saying is that money is not going to go to the banks. That money is going to go to the kids and the students, and we're going to cut the student loan interest rates in half and increase the Pell Grant. 
   We have money in here for our community health centers, so kids can get preventative care, so they end up they can get treated for a cold, instead of ending up in the emergency room for a much higher price to the taxpayer. So we're making significant investments. And this bill will help secure a strong future for the United States of America. 
   We need to get more kids in college. We need to invest in foreign languages. That's what this bill does. And I'm proud of this bill, on a bipartisan basis. 
   And I think it's important for the people, Madam Chairman, who are listening as this goes into the Congressional Record. What do they want? They want an investment in their future, and that's what this bill does. It makes that investment to secure our future and make us strong and move us in a new direction.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman. 
   And since my friends on the other side of the aisle have embraced their fringeness, I would like to just point out to you from the Roll Call today, around the Hill there is a festival, 11-day play, this weekend. I know many of you go home, so many of your staff may want to attend this, it's the Capitol Fringe Festival. So you may be able to attend and completely embrace the fringeness. 
   But again, as the gentleman has said, Madam Chair, when we first got in the majority in January, we tried to pass out of this House, in our Six in '06, provisions that we passed, campaigned on and then passed. One of the provisions was to strip $14 billion from the oil companies. And our friends, who are now wanting to take this money from Pell Grants and investments in education, investments in health care, voted against stripping the oil companies of $14 billion. And this is what we're talking about. 
   This bipartisan committee passed out of the committee unanimously, on support of the Republicans on that committee, with the support of the Democrats on this committee, well thought-out pieces of legislation, well thought-out amendments in the committee, supported unanimously by both sides. And what we're saying is, we have to make these investments. 
   And there is no tax increase in this year's budget, none, zero, that's it. You can't point it out. In 2007, keep your forms, 2006, or last year's forms, and compare them to next year's, and there will be not one dime of an increase. All we did was we took that money that our friends were giving to the banks and we invested that money in the kids. The $14 billion that was going to the oil companies at their times of highest profits is going into health care and education now and alternative energy. 
   As I said earlier, this is very simple. We're in a globally competitive market, and we need to make investments into our kids and into our future. That's what this bill does. 
   Now what you're saying is, with tuition costs going up 40 percent, health insurance going up $100 a year, and energy costs going up $3,200 a year, that the solution to that problem and every other problem we have in the country right now is a .5 percent cut that would put additional burdens on families who are trying to send their kids to school, would reduce the money that we're making into making our citizens healthier and community health clinics so that at the end of the day would allow us to prevent people from ending up in the emergency room and costing us billions and billions of dollars more. 
   These are good investments, voted on in a bipartisan way, and will secure the strength of our country in the future.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Chairman, I hate to interrupt this beautiful debate going on, but I think it is important for us to make a point. We offered our friends in the fringe an opportunity within the first 100 hours we were here to strip $14 billion from the oil companies, corporate welfare that they were getting from the United States taxpayers, and you all voted against it, or at least most of you did. You had a chance for $14 billion from the oil companies. But you choose to come here now and take it out of the hide of the students and the middle-class families who are trying to make ends meet. 
   That is the difference. This is a change in priorities. You had a chance for $14 billion from the oil companies. You were silent. Now you choose to do it for programs that are going to make us stronger in the long run. 
   So I thank the gentleman, I thank the Chair, I thank the ranking member for putting together such a great bill here, and I think we should leave it as it is and not ask the people who have had increased energy costs, a 40 percent tuition increase, now to say wait a minute, we don't want to help you with that. We want to cut that by .5 percent, too.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Chairman, I would like to just say, I have voted for the ban on partial birth abortion. I consider myself a pro-life Democrat. 
   But I will say that this amendment will increase the number of abortions that are performed. Fifty percent of abortions are performed on women who live within 200 percent of poverty. If they don't have access to prevention, they will end up getting an abortion. And I believe that if we truly want to prevent abortions from happening in the United States of America, we have an obligation, a moral obligation, to fund programs like this and prevent unintended pregnancies. Those are the poor women who end up going to abortion clinics and having abortions. 
   Let's prevent the number of abortions from increasing by rejecting this amendment. And the more money we spend on prevention, that will mean we will continue to reduce the number of abortions. 
   And I want to thank the gentleman for working on this with us.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Remember the beginning of this Congress that we gave an opportunity for every Member of this House to vote against paying the  oil companies about $14 billion in oil subsidies, and a lot of our friends, who are now voting against the SCHIP for fiscal responsibility reasons, voted to make sure that we could not take that basically corporate welfare that we were giving to the oil companies. They voted to sustain basically that corporate welfare that was going to the oil companies. 
   But it's important for us to recognize that Members of the Republican Party, the same Members who were voting against SCHIP, voted against the Democrats pulling the money from the oil companies and putting it back into alternative energy, to health care, to education, all these. You had this opportunity to do this, and they refused to do it.     
   And to say now that you are going to draw the line in the sand, Mr. Altmire, you are going to draw the line in the sand on children's health care after raising the debt limit, as the gentleman from Connecticut just mentioned, five times they have asked to borrow more money from China, from Japan, from OPEC countries. Now you are going to draw the line in the sand on children's health care? 
   Now, people are sitting at home saying, I don't know a whole lot about politics, Mr. Speaker, but my goodness gracious, you are picking this battle now on the backs of children. And I don't know, I didn't get to hear your whole argument on socialism. But my question is this. If everyone is saying that this is socialism, that this is somehow a socialistic step towards national socialized medicine, why are you negotiating it in the first place?

Go in to private hospitals, private doctors, there is no question that this is privately administered. But here is the question. If we peel it back $1 billion or $5 billion, is that all of a sudden not socialism anymore? I mean, at what number do we get to where it stops becoming socialism and it starts becoming a private, some kind of health care system? 
   The arguments, the strawmen, the red herrings that have been put up on this debate are absolutely ridiculous. And I can't believe the President would draw the line in the sand and just have no arguments to back it up.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I just hope our friends who are opposing this bill to cover children's health care because of the cost of it, which we are paying for, will scrutinize the Iraq spending as it starts to come up over the next few weeks and few months. As we went over already, one day in Iraq, $330 million would cover 270,000 kids for a year for this program. That is one day. And if you go through 1 week, $2.3 billion would cover 1.8 million kids. And less than 40 days in Iraq would cover all of these kids that we want to cover, 10 million kids, for 1 year. Forty days in Iraq. And all we are saying is our priority is this. 
   Now, I just want to take a minute here to just go over what has happened over the past 8 or 9 or 10 months here in Congress, what we have done, how we have shifted the priorities. We have the same Members who are voting against this bill who voted against the minimum wage increase. We have the same Members who are going to vote against the children's health care bill are the same members who voted against us increasing the Pell Grant and cutting the interest rates for college loans in half, the same group of folks. 
   When we wanted to invest all this money in alternative energy research, we took it from the oil companies, corporate welfare, put it into alternative energy research. The same group of folks that voted against this SCHIP bill, children's health care bill, voted against that, too. And all of these issues come up. The only thing we can get them to agree on is probably the veterans spending, which was the largest increase in the history of the VA. 
   So what we are saying is there is a pattern, Mr. Speaker, there is a pattern of behavior of a certain fringe group of people who are here that even very conservative people have agreed with us on this issue, and we can't get enough to override the veto. 
   I don't know about you guys, but I have got a little restaurant I go to back home called Vernon's Restaurant, Vernon's Cafe, great Italian. But when you are sitting there and you are eating and you are talking to your friends who go through everyday life, they are talking about their student loans, they are talking about health care, they are talking about what are we going to do to stimulate the economy? Why are we so dependent on foreign oil? And we all have our own little Vernon's in all of our communities. We are trying to address these bread and butter economic issues, and I think we have in this Congress. And the one that lays before us here is children's health care. For God's sake, Mr. Speaker, God help us if we can't pass children's health care.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, the one thing that is important too, I mean, a lot of people would say that, you know, well, my kid has insurance and we're fine and everything else. You know, but if your kid's sitting in a classroom with a kid who is sick that does not have health care because they don't  qualify for Medicaid, they're going to get your kid sick. And I think this kind of ties the whole argument together that we are in this together. You know, we have to make very sound, prudent, targeted investments in certain areas that are going to yield a lot of benefits. 
   These are the same kids we're asking to go off to college and get a degree in math and science. But if at a young age these kids don't have health care, where they can, if they get sick, have something, and I find it completely outrageous that in 2007 we would have a President of the United States say, go to the emergency room, or these kids can go to the emergency room. I mean, that's just ridiculous. That's just ridiculous. You don't have to be a Philadelphia lawyer to figure out that it's going to cost everyone a lot more money if this kid that has a cold ends up two weeks later in the emergency room with pneumonia or something worse and spends two weeks in the hospital. 
   I mean, that costs us hundreds of thousands of dollars, as opposed to a prescription that would cost 20 or 30 bucks. I mean, this is some pretty basic stuff here. And the fact that the President has drawn the line in the sand on this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 
   So in closing, I want to thank everybody, Mr. Speaker, for being here and for participating in the 30-somethings. But I also want to say that it's been a very enjoyable week for those of us who are baseball fans in northeast Ohio. Those folks who may happen to be in, say, Pittsburgh or like Florida, or like New England for example, who, baseball season ended a long time ago for some of you, and others who are not faring as well, our sympathies go out to you. But in Cleveland, northeast Ohio, Youngstown, Akron, it's been a great week, followed up by a great week we had a few weeks ago. And many of you may not know, Mr. Speaker, that the new WBO/WBC middleweight champion of the world, Kelly Pavlick, is from Youngstown, Ohio, too.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate how the gentleman has been focused on bipartisanship over the past several weeks since we have been here. 
   I agree with my friend from Florida on several issues. Just to go back a few seconds, to talk about what is going on in Iraq and what really the President's plan has been, and I think it is important that we remove this from any kind of partisanship. 
   As we have shown in the past couple weeks here, I mean, the votes that we have passed here have consistently been passed in a bipartisan way. Minimum wage, student loans, Medicare and negotiations, all of these have been passed in a bipartisan way. So the tone that Speaker Pelosi has set in this House has been a tone of bipartisanship. 
   The concern that we have in Iraq at this point with the troop surge is that this President does not have the support of the American people. He does not have the support of the Democratic Party. He is losing support among the Republican Party, and the former Chair of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, John Warner, has now come out against the President's proposal. The military, for the most part, is against this proposal. It seems like almost everyone who was in the Bush administration who had been in the military under this Commander in Chief and has left is now against what the President is saying. The Iraqi leadership is against it. 
   The only people who are for this is the administration, and I think it is important for us to recognize that we need to get out in a way that makes sure that we retain our dignity and that we redeploy. No one's talking about cutting and running, but redeploy in a responsible way and getting our kids out of harm's way, because this has been botched from the get-go. 
   But I think it is important, and I appreciate you consistently focusing. We have talked for 3 1/2 or 4 years about if we get in charge we are going to do it in a bipartisan way, and we have been able to maintain that over the past couple of weeks, and I think it is important that we continue to go down that road. 
   If you look at, and I do not want to talk too long because I know my friend has an interest in joining, I want to look at the, Mr. Speaker, first 100 hours, at what we have been able to. 
   Okay. This has kind of gone in two different directions. Pass the minimum wage, reduce student loan interest rates, cut them in half, and allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate down drug prices. So if you are an average family, those are three major steps forward where you are going to make more money, if you have a minimum-wage worker, where you have less student loans to pay because the interest rate is going to be cut in half, and the prescription drug prices that your parents and grandparents are paying will be a lot less. So  that is going to be significant savings in the short term. 
   But now we have our long-term program, and if you 
   look at where the Democratic Party and Speaker Pelosi is pushing our agenda, we have investments into stem cell research, which is something that we passed in this Chamber just a few days ago, that we are going to invest into this new and great and vibrant industry and new sector of our economy that is not only going to reap tremendous health care benefits for our citizens but also provide jobs for our scientists and our researchers and funding the research and development and partnering with private sector people. 
   That is going to create an economic boom in the United States of America because once we pass it, if we can get it past the President, that is going to be a heck of a move on our part. I think it is going to be great for the American people, and it is going to be great for the next generation of people coming out of college and coming out of medical school and getting their Ph.D.s. We are going to have a whole other sector of the economy. 
   In addition to the repealing of the corporate welfare, which I know you had talked a lot about on this floor the past couple of years, repealing the corporate welfare that we gave to the oil companies and the energy companies and putting that money into research for alternative energy sources, creating and pushing a whole other sector of our economy so that we do not depend on the Middle East for our energy, we got it right in the Midwest in the United States of America. 
   So we are stabilizing. We are taking care of people today. We are giving the American people a pay raise, cutting student loan interest rates in half, reducing the cost of prescription drugs now, and then in the future moving into these two major growth areas of alternative energy and stem cell research and into the health care industry. 
   I think Leader PELOSI and Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Clyburn and Mr. Larson and Mr. Emanuel have all set an agenda for the Democrats in the House to do some good in the short term and then to open up these other areas of the economy in the long term. 
   So with that I would be happy to yield back to my good friend, my dear friend from Florida (Mr. Meek).

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Well, I appreciate that. This is something you mentioned about being bipartisan and working in a bipartisan way. I think what has happened here has been very successful, and I think this kind of illustrates it. 
   A couple of the things that the Democratic leadership and the Democratic Caucus, with some help from the Republicans on the other side, have been very successful. This is what has happened just in the first 100 hours, should this all become law. 
   You look at the minimum wage being raised. It means $4,400 a year for the average minimum wage worker. So over the next 5 years, the average person will make another $22,000 because of what happened here in this Chamber, led by Speaker Pelosi in a bipartisan way with a handful of Republicans who were able to do that, 80 or 90, I think. 
   College loan interest rates cut over 5 years will save about $1,473. Total earnings and savings for a family over 5 years will be $23,473. 
   This is bread and butter stuff. This is what will be implemented if we can get it through the other side and signed by the President. This is good stuff. This is what we can do in a bipartisan way. 
   So, I think this kind of stuff is important to move the country forward. When we do that, I think we open up a lot of opportunities for a lot of people around the country, and really around the world, because of the opportunity that we would provide here. This is the kind of bipartisan agenda that we want to continue with. 
   We are joined hereby a rising star already making a name for himself down here in Congress, our good friend from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks. The President only has a couple years left, Mr. Speaker, and I hope he really uses this as an opportunity to try to reengage Congress and reengage the American people and have some bold initiatives too. And not just the rhetoric. Because we went through and our staffs went true and were comparing everything that the President had said in previous State of the Union addresses and then what the reality is, and you can pick an issue, and we will give you the Web site and you can go and check it all out. So a very skeptical Congress will be here listening tonight. 
   But I hope in regards to health care that we can really focus. Of course, we want everyone covered. But if you think about it, we actually have a universe health care system right now, but it is just run through emergency rooms. It is run in the most inefficient, ineffective way that you could possibly set up a health care system. So it is really not even a system, but it is just health care kind of. 
   What we need to do is try to get some of this investment on the front end, make sure our kids through SCHIP have access to health care, and that we are reaching out and communicating and pulling in people who may qualify for some of these programs but don't actually sign up for them. What is the outreach going to be? Because as we are competing a global economy, as we have talked 1 million times on this floor, we only have 300 million people in the United States of America. We are now competing against China, who has 1.3 billion, India who has a billion, and everyone else on the globe. We only have 300 million. 
   So we have to make our best efforts count, because we need all 300 million on the field playing for us, especially these young kids who are coming up through the ranks. That is why I think it is important when we are talking about the minimum wage and we are talking about making sure that student loan rates are cut in half so we can have more kids go to college, and then we pass the stem cell bill, so we are creating not only a compassionate kind of research that is going to go on and save people's lives and improve their quality of life, but that is creating jobs in a whole new sector of the economy that right now we are not doing exactly what we should be doing. 
   Then we also repeal the corporate welfare and we take the 13 or 14 billion and we are going to pump that into alternative energy, create a whole other sector for alternative energy sources. 
   So you put all this stuff together that we are able to do that, that is bold leadership. These are the kind of initiatives that we really need in the country, and Speaker Pelosi has provided us with that leadership. 
   So I hope in regards to health care, we get some bold tax credits. How about a bold program where all Americans are going to be covered and where we are going to put the money, instead of managed disease, prevent diseases from happening and investing in these young people so that they are healthy, educated and then create opportunity for us.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate that, because that is exactly what happens is you don't have the money, there was no pay-as-you-go in the last several Congresses, runaway spending, borrowing money from China. What does that mean? Well, here is our budget priorities for 2007 prior to Democrats taking office, budget into the billions of dollars. This red bar here is just interest on the money that we borrowed. This is not paying it down; this is just paying the interest on it. You know, you get your mortgage and you get your car loan and you open it up and you have got a 5 or $600 payment. You see $300 of it is actually going to the payment and the other stuff is interest, and it breaks your heart. 
   This is what the country is doing. But compare that to what we are doing, this is education, homeland security and veterans. This is going back to China; this is going back to some of those other countries. 
   And then you look and you see China says the test they did in space does not signal an intent to militarize space. You can't get the real facts on China's military budget, but they are buying a ton more ships. That is where that money is going. 
   I think it is important to make that point because it is not just money that just goes and floats out and the Federal Reserve tries to find it somewhere. It is going to China, it is going to the Middle East, it is going to OPEC countries. 
   And then we are funding both sides of the war on terror because we are buying all the oil, making them money. It gets back to the terrorists. And then we have a war in the Middle East and we pass almost $500 billion already that we are spending from our side already on the war in Iraq.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. One of the issues, you know, the more you talk, the more you see how all this just really ties together. This is health care costs and tying in a way to the minimum wage. The average family health care premium in 2005 was $10,880; and the salary of a full-time year-round minimum-wage worker was less than that, $10,700. So you will work as a minimum-wage worker 40 hours a week for an entire year and not even be able to pay for your full health care bill. 
   Now, in the United States of America, there is something wrong with that. There is something wrong with the wage of the minimum-wage worker, and there is obviously something wrong with the cost of health care in the United States because of this kind of backward system that we now have that just basically treats diseases and is not focusing probably like it should in preventing a lot of these things from happening. 
   And I think the more we reach out through the SCHIP program to make sure that these families who are qualified for children's health care know that they are qualified, to get them signed up, because at the end of the day it is the right thing to do, it is the compassionate thing to do, but at the end of the day it is going to save everybody a lot more money, too. 
   If we can get these kids at a young age and make sure they are treated, evaluated, they know the direction that they are going in, they know the medical history of both parents so that they can be treated accordingly. 
   I appreciate what you are saying and I appreciate you bringing up the issue of health care. 
   I know we are running down here; the clock is ticking, Mr. Meek. I would be happy to yield to you in order to get us down the road here of wrapping things up. I appreciate all the comments that have been made here, and I appreciate our young friend being here with us, who is probably older than me. 
   I yield to our fearless leader from Florida.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate what you are saying, and there are a couple of points I would like to add. 
   When the President says he is going to veto the supplemental bill, he is going to veto a $1.7 billion understand increase for veterans. We have seen Walter Reed and heard the stories from across the country. We know we have more veterans coming back. He is going to veto a $1.7 billion increase from his recommendation. And then he is going to veto a $1.7 billion increase for defense health care for our troops, not yet veterans but still needing access to care. And $500 million is for  post-traumatic stress disorder. And $500 million is for brain injuries. 
   Those of us who have been to Walter Reed have seen these veterans who are more affected than any of us. They are the ones that are hurt. They are the ones with the brain injuries, and we get in and we try to put in $500 million in addition to what the President wants for brain injuries, and the President threatens to veto it. 
   That is $500 million for post-traumatic stress disorder, and the President threatens to veto it. We put in this supplemental bill, Mr. Speaker, rules that the Department of Defense and the Pentagon say we need. That if you don't have the proper equipment, you shouldn't go off to war. If you don't have the proper rest, you shouldn't go off to war. If we can't put the proper armor on your Humvees when you are on patrol in Baghdad, you should not go. The President said he is going to veto that. 
   So the President is saying he is okay with sending our American troops to Baghdad to drive in a Humvee that is not up armored, to send the soldiers out in the field without the proper body armor, and to sending kids back when they have only been home for a few months, sending them right back. That is what the President is saying he is going to veto, Mr. Speaker. 
   I am not okay with that. And the Democratic Congress is not okay with that. And the Senate is not okay with that. And the American people are not okay with sending our troops to Baghdad to ride in Humvees that don't have the proper armor on them. Period. That is the debate. That is what the President says he is going to veto. 
   Let's be very, very clear about what the Democratic Congress has passed and put in front of the President and what he is threatening to veto. Now, we have even given him a few months to get done what he wants to get done. Many of us want our troops home now, I'm one of them, but I recognize there are a lot of us here, and we need to have some level of compromise. 
   All we are saying is if there is not progress by July, we start bringing our troops home. The war has already been longer than World War II. If you haven't done it by now, it can't be done. Bring them home. 
   But if there is progress, we will give them until October. If they don't meet the benchmarks that the President set out, Mr. Meek, in January, and these are the President's benchmarks. These aren't the Speaker's 
   benchmarks or Senator Reid's benchmarks; they are not Kendrick Meek's benchmark. They are not mine. These are the benchmarks the President of the United States set out in his speech of January 10. 
   All we are saying, is you have been able to say one thing and not live up to it. You have certain goals, and then not get there, and we just all go on our merry way. What we are saying, is you've got to be accountable for the benchmarks you have set out. If they don't meet those benchmarks, we are coming home. We are bringing our troops home. 
   So I think it is very important that the American people understand what is going on. You mentioned Katrina. Everybody wants to talk about there is pork in this bill and this and that; the majority of this goes to the troops, and the next biggest chunk goes to Katrina relief. We are trying to free up money to rebuild the gulf coast. 
   And the hold-up the whole time has been that the President and the Republicans want a 10 percent match from a local community in order to draw down 90 percent of the Federal money. And we wonder why the coast isn't getting rebuilt, it is because the towns have been completely destroyed. They don't have the 10 percent match, Mr. Speaker. They are wiped out. They don't have police, they don't have fire, they don't have roads, sewer, anything. 
   And the former leadership in our last Congress was so ideological they said no, you have to have your 10 percent match, and then billions of dollars did not get down to the gulf coast. That is what the President is also going to veto. I feel strongly about this.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Here is the difference we are starting to see. When Members turn on the television, Mr. Speaker, and they see what is happening with the Attorney General's Office, when they hear about $10-12 billion in Iraq that nobody knows where it is, and now all of this information that is coming out, hearing about the gulf coast, hearing about Halliburton. If a truck blows a tire, Halliburton puts in for another truck instead of putting a new tire on the truck.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Yes, just moved to Dubai. You would think that with all of the taxpayer money they get, they would at least stay in the country. 
   But all of this is not just coming out by coincidence.     
   There have been 104 hearings related to the Iraq War. Oversight and accountability. One of the key responsibilities of the United States Congress is to provide oversight to the executive branch agencies, and we did not hear about any of this stuff for 6 years when the Republican House and the Republican Senate sat on their hands while all of this was going on. This is not stuff that is on the news. This is not stuff that just happened. This is stuff that happened when the Republican Congress was in charge. 
   Now, I understand that we are all loyal to our political parties, but at some point, when it begins to hurt the American people, you need to provide the oversight of their tax money and the kind of inadequacy that has been going on in Iraq. 
   Now all of the sudden they want to change course. Now all of the sudden  the commander in the Middle East is running around saying that we do not have time. You know why they do not have time? Because we are putting the heat on them to get things done. 104 hearings on oversight. That is our responsibility.

That is what is exciting about this is that next year at this time, all of us are going to be able to go back home and campaign about how many thousands of kids in your congressional district now have access to health care because of what we are going to do through the SCHIP program.     
   All of are going to be back home. We are going to be able to talk about the increase in the Pell Grants, and how many more kids have access to higher education. We are going to be able to go into the VFW and the American Legion and talk about the highest increase in the history of the Veterans Administration, who supports the troops. I am excited about the opportunities that we are going to have over the next year to go out, and as our Speaker said, this is a movement of hope for the American people.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. You know what I have heard? Do you know what I have heard from folks around the Capitol, people who don't make a lot of between, $100,000, between $50,000 and $100,000. Do you know what I heard them say? I don't mind paying taxes. But if I am going to pay taxes don't give it to the oil companies and corporate welfare. If I am going to pay taxes out of the $50,000 I make a year, living in D.C., very expensive town, don't spend $2 billion of it a week in Iraq. I don't mind paying, but if I am going to pay, give it to the poor kids who need health care. Make college more affordable. Make investments in our economy. You know, I think most people recognize they have got to pay their own fair share. But what they get frustrated about is where it goes. 
   Now, are you telling me Halliburton is going to get billions and billions and billions of dollars out of a guy or a woman who makes $50,000 a year, who is paying those taxes? And then that same company moves off, out of the country? No respect for anything. But I want to make a point here as we begin the wind down. 
   Mr. Speaker, many people have made comments on this floor over the past several hours that our budget somehow raises taxes on the American people. 
   Now, we are big on third-party validators here. I am going to give you three, this is the Hamilton project at the Brookings Institution. ``The budget would not 
   raise taxes.''

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. We have one more. This is the Concord Coalition. This is the gold standard of the budget hawks. This is bipartisan, this is deficit hawks, Republicans, Democrats. In an issue brief of March 28, quote, ``Thus, to be clear, the budget resolution does not call for or require a tax increase.'' That was three, separate, third-party validators. 
   I am just going to make this statement, and I am going to kick it to one of my friends. The same people that are saying we are raising taxes are the same people that said we would be greeted as liberators. They are the same people that said, you know, we use the oil money for reconstruction, the same people that said it would only cost us $50 billion to run the war in Iraq, the same people that said we are in our last throes, the same people that said mission was accomplished, those are the same people that are saying that the Democratic budget is going to raise taxes, which three third-party validators have not say. All I am going to say is this. Let's ask the American people to reserve judgment. 
   Next January and February, when you file your taxes, you compare them to the taxes you filed this year, and you will see that the Democrats have not raised your taxes. Reserve judgment, keep your sheets, keep your forms from this year, and you will see next year that we have not done it, and that will be one more that you could add to the list of inaccuracies that have been levied towards the American people.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Exactly. Budgets are priorities. They are blueprints for what you stand for and what you believe. And the Democrats and the Democratic budget is something that I think really is going to invigorate the country. It is not going as far as a lot of us want it to go, but the fact of the matter is we are left holding the bag of a Republican-led Congress and President that added almost $3 trillion in debt to this country, and we have got to deal with that. That is the stark reality of the budget situation. 
   But, again, I would like to say this. This President has threatened to veto the supplemental bill that adds an additional $1.7 billion for veterans, an additional $1.7 billion for defense health care, $500 million for post-traumatic stress, $500 million for brain injuries. That is what the President is going to veto when he says he is going to veto the supplemental. 
   The American people are way ahead of us on this war, and the national intelligence estimate said that the war in Iraq has created more terrorists and has made the terrorist situation worse, Mr. Meek. This war has created more enemies for us, has created more terrorists that are gunning for the United States. So to say that by coming home that that somehow is going to make us less safe is inaccurate and inconsistent with the national intelligence estimate and the basic common sense of most Americans. 
   So as we move forward in a new direction in Iraq and the budget blueprint that we have that is going to move the country in a new direction domestically, without raising taxes, as the Concord Coalition said, the Democratic budget is not raising taxes. And the Center on Budget and Policy is saying the Democratic budget is not raising taxes. I will say, and another third-party validator, the Brookings Institute, says the Democrats are not raising taxes in their new budget. 
   I want to repeat this. I am asking, Mr. Speaker, for the Members of this House who know the facts, who will vote on this bill, they know we are not raising taxes, and that is why we are going to get broad support on it. 
   But for the American people to compare this year's tax returns that they get, reserve judgment on the Democratic tax policy, compare this year's to next year's, and you will see that your tax rates are the exact same, the exact same. And you will have one more piece of evidence to put in the column of we will be greeted as liberators, the same thing, the same column as we are in the last throes, the same column as mission accomplished. You will be able to put the Democratic budget and the Democratic tax policy in that same list.

   Mr. RYAN OF Ohio. Just to share a little bit, Mr. Speaker. We were up at Walter Reed on Monday. And you want to talk about the issue of war smacking you right in the face, when you see someone just a few years younger than we are without legs, traumatic brain injury. You hear stories from parents who say, ``I got a call from Iraq, and my son or daughter, all they told me was he had a brain injury, and hung up the phone,'' and they don't hear back for 4 days. 
   I mean, when you put all these stories together, that one particular mom waiting there 4 days not knowing, the unknown of whether or not your kid is going to live or die; or you hear the stories about the soldier we had in Batavia, Ohio, where you didn't know; the body was missing, you couldn't find it, and then you find it. 
   When you add all of this stress up and you put it into our families and you put it into the soldiers that are there, and you talk about the long-term health care costs of this war, not to mention what is happening there day-to-day there now, but the long-term effects when at some point this is all settled hopefully, one way or the other, at least our portion of it is and our troops are back home for the most part, the effects are still going to be left with us. And I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to see, Phil Donahue has this new documentary out called Body of War, and it is all about the actual physical injuries that these families are going through. And I think it is important for us to remember that. And when you hear and read in the paper that 10 or 15 civilians or four troops, those are real people. And those kind of situations, when you have all these civilian deaths in Iraq, from a very practical standpoint, one is they are civilians and that is a whole other issue, but from a very practical standpoint it makes it very difficult for us to solve the political problems over there when everyone who is a part of the government are losing brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles who are getting killed by these bombs that are going off over in Iraq. It makes it very difficult.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I was also watching our friends who were here before, and they were saying things like: We have been so unproductive in this Congress. We haven't really done anything; and the things we have done, they are all bad. And I wrote the quote down. They are all bad. 
   Is this bad? Is this piece of legislation that we passed to make sure that our soldiers get at least looked at for traumatic brain injury, is that bad? We can give the gentleman an opportunity to come back here and maybe correct his statement, because I am sure he didn't mean it. 
   But to inject the kind of politics that some folks have on this floor over the course of the past few years into this debate has really poisoned it; and these are things that have been successful. 
   The largest increase in veterans spending in the history of the VA. Was that bad? Increasing the minimum wage. Was that bad? The education funding, more funding and more expansive, and the most investment this country has made since the GI bill and the education. Was that bad? Cutting student loans. Was that bad? I don't think so. 
   So we are trying to have these debates here very civilized in a bipartisan way and talk about how we can improve the situation for our soldiers. 
   I didn't mean to interrupt.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. You were mentioning the troops and how complicated things have gotten. 
   One of the things you mentioned was what was happening in Iraq, and Mr. Meek mentioned how we got in. I think it is important to recognize, and there was a great article today in the Washington Post, what is happening with our troop strength, where we are getting to the point, we have all of these troops who go for 15 months and come back for a year. We are hearing from psychologists and psychiatrists at Walter Reed that they are not getting enough downtime. It is intense, urban warfare. They are not getting enough downtime, and that is contributing to a lot of the psychiatric problems that our troops are coming back with that need to be addressed. 
   What people are saying now in the military is that it has to be a year on or 15 months on, and 2 years off. Can you imagine if that is the recommendation. The recommendation is 15 months and then 2 years. Or it may even be 1 year. No, they are asking for 1 year on, 2 years off; and then if they have to go back, send them back. Can you imagine, that is the recommendation. 
   For them to now say you wonder what the issues are going to be when it is 15 months on, 1 year off and back again, the psychological effect on our soldiers and the cost long term to our VA health care. I think that is important. 
   I wanted to highlight this. This is General Richard Cody, Army's vice chief of staff who was testifying yesterday, and was talking about basically troop strength. Mr. Meek, you sit on the Armed Services Committee. You know how critical this is to where our country needs to be in case there is another conflict somewhere in the world that we have to react to. 
   Right now what the military leaders are saying is that we do not have the capability to react to that. Now can you imagine putting this country in that position, that we can't handle two separate fights going on at the same time when that has been the golden rule from the military for years. And what Cody said was that ``I've never seen our lack of strategic depth be where it is today. The Nation needs an airborne brigade, a heavy brigade, and a striker brigade ready for `full spectrum operations' and we don't have that today.'' 
   Now if anybody wants to make a judgment, it is not the Democrats  making a judgment against President Bush, this is the Army vice chief of staff who happens to be retiring in the next couple of months and maybe feels a little freer to say the kinds of things that need to be said, but if we don't recognize what position we are in, and then to have some folks saying we need to be there another hundred years, how are we going to possibly sustain this?

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. That's the real deal. 
   Another quote, ``There has been little, if any, change of the stress or tempo of our forces,'' calling the current pace of operations ``unsustainable.'' That's where we are. 
   To quote Cody again, ``Where we need to be with this force is no more than 12 months on the ground and 24 months back.'' 
   It is critical that these soldiers get the kind of rest that they need. When you look at the cost now, saying the projection, when you factor in the health care, and we are close to a trillion dollars for this war, and the projections, when you factor in the health care costs over time, this war is going to cost us $3 trillion. 
   And we have Members of this body who stand up and want to slash out an earmark for $250,000 to help a local community that doesn't have any money put in an EPA-mandated sewer and ignore the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the middle of the room. It is a shame. It is a shame that the debate has gotten that messy. 
   If we stay focused on what we have been trying to accomplished in the past few years, focus on the veterans, focus on making sure that there is an assessment for their mental health, making sure that they have their money, which we put up, the highest investment in veterans' health care in the history of the VA, those are the kinds of things that we need to focus on as a country in a time of war. 
   I would just urge all of our colleagues to have this debate be civilized and not taken to the lowest recesses of political dialogue, which is sometimes I think where we end up.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I think it is important for us to recognize as we have this debate in Congress, we recognize where we are at right now.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. It is a free country, and I am an American so I am going to say what I want. 
   Our friends on the other side, this alternative budget, alternative this, alternative that, I think it is important for us to recognize if you want to know what the conservative, neocon-servative, right-wing government looks like, all you have to do is open your eyes, read the paper, go to the gas station, pay your health care bill, pay your tuition bill, and you will know that philosophy implemented is the reality we are living in today. They deregulated the financial markets, deregulated the energy sector, gave billionaires tax cuts. You see this every day. Increased tuition, energy costs going up double the rate of inflation, milk going up 26 percent, eggs going up 40 percent. And $3 trillion in war over the course. And you put all of this together and you say that's the alternative? That's what you want us to go back to? 
   We spent the whole year just trying to get back to ground zero, raising minimum wage, cutting student loan interest rates in half, investing in alternative energy, implementing the 9/11 report, making sure that our veterans are taken care of. We are still digging out of a hole. Can you imagine, these folks raised the debt limit five times to the tune of $3 trillion, borrowing it from China, Japan, and OPEC. 
   And the mortgage crisis, the anxiety people feel, that is the conservative Republican agenda implemented. We don't have to look anywhere; we are living it now. Now. So we don't have to look too far. 
   The other day the President said if the Democrats repeal the $18 billion in corporate welfare for the oil companies, I will veto any bill that has that in it. Now can you imagine how screwed up the situation is. Consumer protection, toys, pet food, food coming over, medicine coming over from China without the proper folks checking the stuff out, mine safety has gone down so we have mining accidents because there wasn't the proper oversight. We know what happened with Hurricane Katrina and FEMA because we put political hacks in jobs. All of this happened under the conservative Republican agenda. 
   So I just would like to say we are working very hard to balance the budget, make investments in education and our vets, take care of the environment, and make these investments in alternative energy so we can have green collar jobs replacing the blue collar jobs we have been losing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman. And I appreciate, I caught bits and pieces of the debate here, and I think you all have illustrated points that need to be made, and we need to keep making them here if we're going to have any headway. 
   And I remember sitting in the meeting with the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) where the politicians were talking about this trade unionist who was trying to organize a plant, and the next day or two days later, he's beheaded. Now, we think labor politics are tough in the United States, which they are, but I don't think they come anywhere close to that level. 
   And it is a pleasure for me to be here with my partner in Summit County, Ohio, Akron, Ms. Sutton. 
   I just want to make a broad point and then talk a little bit about a bill that I have introduced with Duncan Hunter on currency. And the first point I want to make, and I think everything that you were talking about is saying, we need to represent our values here in the United States of America, not just here when we hear about family values, and we need to have values and we all agree with that. But put it in our actions. And I think that's what we want to do, and the trade agreements that we sign consistently, I think, go against it. And when you look at what the results are, and Sojourners had a great magazine; I may have sent it to some of you. 
   Two percent of the world owns more wealth than the other 98 percent. Now, that's unbelievable. Two percent of the world own more wealth than the other 98 percent combined. That signals to us that the models that you were talking about, Mr. Speaker, are not sufficient for shared growth for all people. 
   And we're not saying that if you go out and you start a company and you take a risk and you take out a loan, that you shouldn't be able to make money. God bless you. Make all you want. But recognize that you're a part of a bigger system here that we're all a part of that, investments in education, the minimum wage which we finally were able to get passed, college tuition; all of these things matter, health care in the grand scheme of things. And what we want to do is start exporting some of these values that we hold dear. 
   And when you say, well, you can make something in China and there are no labor laws, no environmental laws, no this, well, what's the alternative? We go back to those days? And I've been to China. You may have, too. Dumping waste in the rivers, like we had a problem up in Cleveland a few decades ago where the Cuyahoga River caught on fire. Now we don't want to go back to those days, where thousands and thousands of kids got asthma because we didn't have clean air regulations. We don't want to go back to those days. 
   So we are now in a unique period in history, because in the United States, we're the consumer. We're the ones buying right now. Now, that may not be the case 10 years from now, but we are now, and so let's leverage our power as consumers to make some of these changes. 
   And I hope that what we're doing here tonight, and Mr. Michaud and Ms. S&#193;NCHEZ and Ms. Sutton, what we're doing here tonight is going to help push those things along. 
   The China currency bill that we have introduced here basically tries to get China to comply with international law. And international law says you're not allowed to subsidize your goods. 
   Well, China is subsidizing their currency, which is kind of a little more complicated than a government saying, okay, you make this widget, we're going to fund you; we're going to subsidize you so you can sell it cheaper in another country. 
   What China's doing with their currency is basically subsidizing it so that every product that they send the United States is between 25 and 40 percent cheaper. 
   I have a company in my district called Wheatland Tube. And it's also in Mr. Altmire's district in Western Pennsylvania. They make tubing. The final product that arrives on the shores of the United States from China is the same price as Wheatland Tube's raw materials before they even start the process. That's the kind of advantage China's getting with their currency. 
   And I know you all are supportive of this bill, and I think it's something that we can, not talking just about trade, but this is something that I think free traders and fair traders and Democrats and Republicans and people from all over the country are agreeing on. And I know Mr. Levin and Mr. Rangel want to move on a bill that does something with China, and I hope that this is a component of that, and I'm confident it will be.     
   But those are the kind of things that we need to stand up and talk about. And if we don't, no one will, because there is a certain amount of people that will benefit from the current system, and they are the ones who want to keep it just the way it is. But it is important for us to come here, 700,000 constituents, 700,000 constituents, 700,000 constituents, it adds up if we unify and organize and do what I think  made all the great social movements in the country great, was organization, traditionally the Democratic Party, the unions, the churches. 
   And I will make one final point that I know I have made to you guys already. It is so important for us to bring in the church communities. I am Catholic, and I think the Catholic Church has an obligation. They speak out on so many issues that I think have less relevance than this issue on average people's day-to-day lives. And I hope that they step up and talk about this issue with the same passion that we hear them speak out on a lot, and the evangelicals we just need to pull. 
   Sojourners Magazine with Jim Wallace did a terrific job a couple of issues ago. But if this does not become a moral, value-centered movement, we are going to continue to struggle. We have the environmentalists and we have the trade unionists, and we have some of us in the Democratic Party. But if we don't pull in the church community, I think we are going to continue to fail. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to be here with you.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I know that our friend from Minnesota is here, but I just want to tell one story because I heard it a few weeks ago from my cousin who worked for Delphi Packard. 
   The plant used to be 15,000 and now they are down to maybe 1,000 because of the global economy, trade deals, China, the whole nine yards. He worked there for probably 10 years, and many people worked there for 30 and made a great living. He is now taking the machines off the ground, taking the bolts out of the ground, helping move these machines, and they are shipping them to China. Now, let's talk about some dignity. This guy is taking out the machines and shipping the machines and his job off to China. 
   That is where we are at. And we have got some work to do. We are not saying build fences and don't compete. But investments in education, what we talked about early on with stem cells and alternative energy, let's create the new wave of jobs that need to be created for our people to work. It is not just trade and exporting. It is making investments in the U.S. and creating new jobs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment and first want to thank Mr. Miller for what he has been able to do with this piece of legislation, and also thank the gentleman from New York. And congratulations on the New York Giants' victory in the Super Bowl. 
   This is an issue that is near and dear to many people's hearts in this Congress, the cost of college education. 
   When you think about what a lot of these kids have to go through, application fees, lab fees, parking passes, meal tickets, rec center fees. You get a bill from the bursar's office, and you don't even know what it is for, but it is for $150. 
   And one of the key factors in the increase in the cost of a college education is textbooks. You buy a textbook for $100, you use it for the semester, and you bring it back and they say, We will give you a dollar for it. So you end up keeping it. 
   This amendment creates a pilot program across the United States authorizing $50 million over 2 years to allow pilot programs for book rentals. There have been programs across the country, several here or there, that have showed savings for students up to a third of the cost of the textbooks. This pilot program gives the Secretary of Education great discretion to start up to 10 pilot programs where they can begin to share books, rent books, put them back into circulation and save students some money. 
   This is an opportunity for us to figure out what pilot programs work, what is best for a big school, and what is best for a smaller school, but give us an opportunity to figure out how we can save these students money. 
   We talk about being competitive in a global economy, we talk about investing in education, but if we continue to have these kinds of barriers for our students, we are not going to get the entries that we need, and we are not going to get the production of diplomas that we need in this country to continue the kind of economic growth we need. 
   I think this is a good amendment that gives a lot of discretion to the Secretary of Education to make sure that we try to figure this out and do it the right way. 
   I would appreciate support for this amendment. I know that the chairman supports it. I think it is a good thing to add onto this bill. I think it is good for the country, and it gets us into an innovative mindset as we try to address the cost of college education. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to thank the gentleman and appreciate the bipartisan support of this amendment. Funding education, trying to reduce the cost of college is not a partisan issue. This is something that we need to do as Americans if we want to stay competitive. 
   You can't fund your military without a growing economy. You can't have a growing economy without investments in education. 
   This particular amendment has taken the advice from the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance that was started a couple of years ago, offered this as a suggestion. We're taking that suggestion; we're working with it. 
   Colleges in Ohio, my alma mater, Bowling Green, is now, through this program, offering books for 35 percent of what the book should cost. So a $100 book, through this program at Bowling Green is 35 bucks. That's a significant savings for our students. 
   So I want to thank the bipartisan support, thank Speaker Pelosi, and thank Chairman Miller for their help with this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, as we approach the final day of the debate on this resolution, I have enjoyed the debate thoroughly. I have found it humorous at times. Our friends on the other side have tried every argument they could possibly muster. They have talked about President Clinton, they have talked about Vietnam, they are trying to bring up Israel, and my friend from Indiana also mentioned the issue of consistency. And I find it funny that the pro-life, self-proclaimed pro-life party is the party that wants to keep extending the war. I find it ironic that all of the great budget hawks in the Republican Party want to throw $8 billion a month to keep going and going and going as we borrow the money from China. 
   But I have also found the debate, at times, disappointing, where Members of the other side have questioned our side and they have said, whose side are we on? And how can we say that we support the troops, and that we are, somehow, unpatriotic. 
   And I would just like to say that when the Republican Party and this President didn't send enough troops, we didn't call you unpatriotic. And when you sent our young soldiers over there without the body armor, we never called you unpatriotic.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, we never called the other side unpatriotic when they sent our soldiers over without enough body armor. And when they didn't send enough up-armored Humvees, we never called anybody unpatriotic. And now, when the next batch goes over without the proper jammers or up-armored kits, we don't call you unpatriotic. 
   Now we have called you incompetent. We said you are incapable, and we said you are derelict of your oversight responsibility. But never, Mr. Speaker, have we called anyone in this House unpatriotic. 
   Now let me speak to the resolution. This is very simple. It says two things: We support our troops and we do not support the escalation. It is very simple and here is why. We have already done this, Mr. Speaker. We have already done this. We have already tried the escalation and it has not worked. From November to January of 2005, we escalated by 18,000 troops, boots on the ground, and the number of daily attacks increased by 17 percent. From June to October of 2005, we increased by 21,000 boots on the ground, and the number of daily attacks increased by 29 percent. And from May to November of 2006, 17,000 more boots on the ground, and the number of daily attacks increased by 80 percent. 
   This escalation has not worked and it will not work. The number of insurgents have increased from 5,000 in 2003 to between 20,000 and 30,000 to October of 2006. So this is very simple. 
   And I want to make just a few more points, Mr. Speaker. One is this. With the last vote for the war, regardless of what party you were in or how you voted, we assumed that the President and the Secretary of Defense would send our troops over there with the proper equipment. But with this escalation, Mr. Speaker, we know that the 21,500 troops that are going to go over there will not have the proper Humvee kits, the up-armor for their HUMVEES. They won't have the proper jamming devices or enough of them, and they won't have the number of trucks that they need.     
   You now know it. So if you vote against this resolution, you are voting to send our troops over there without the proper equipment before it could be excused because we trusted the President, assumed, but now we know. 
   And, finally, Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot over the last couple of days about the American Revolution and the Civil War and World War II. Well, Mr. Speaker, our President today is not Washington, he is not Lincoln, and he is not Roosevelt. So I think our Republican colleagues should take the advice of the Secretary of Defense, and that is you go to war with the President you have. You don't go to war with the President you wish you had.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, it is entirely possible and welcomed under the Constitution of the United States to have disagreements about how we need to handle troops deployments, how we need to handle our situation in different wars. And it is not to be said that because one party or one group of people have a different philosophy and a different strategy, that somehow they are not supporting the troops. 
   Now, your party and your President, the Republican Party, Mr. Speaker, and the Republican President are the ones who sent our kids to battle without armor, without body armor. And it took JACK MURTHA months to uncover it, and then to finally get it paid for and distributed. It was the Republican Party, Mr. Speaker, who sent kids into battle without up-armored Humvees. 
   Now, nobody questioned the Republican Party's patriotism, and nobody asked them if they supported the troops. Again, we called you incompetent, we said you were incapable, we said you were derelict in your duty, we said you should have provided oversight and you didn't. But we never called you unpatriotic.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I thank the gentlelady. 
   I just want to make a comment. The money will not change; there is not going be an increase or a decrease with regard to the amendment. This is about where the money is going to go, and there are 20 countries at least where we are not able to get contraceptives to women and men in these countries who need it. This is n ot about increase or decrease. This is about getting the money to where it needs to be. 
   The gentleman before me stated, how can we support coercive abortions. There are many prolife Republicans and prolife Democrats who voted for trade with China, to increase investment in China. We all don't have to rehash what China does with their pro- abortion policy. So the coercive argument needs to at least be consistent. 
   I just want to share with my friends, I am a prolife Democrat, but I believe that this w ill reduce the number of  abortions around the world. This is the only way to do it. 
   The example I want to share with my colleagues is Ghana, where abortion is illegal. The oldest and the largest family planning organization in Ghana previously provided a third of the contraceptives in the nation with no abortion services. It has received no U.S. assistance for family planning, which has decreased access to contraceptives by 56 percent. 
   This has led to an increase of almost 500 abortions in Gh ana because we were not providing prevention. The abortion debate in the 21st century needs to be about prevention. That is exactly what this bill does, this amendment does, and what Ms. LOWEY is trying to do. 
   I also want to share with our colleagues, because we seem to get mixed information, prevention and family planning does reduce the number of abortions. We have many countries where we have implemented this, and it has worked. 
   In the last two decades, in the last two decades, there have b een significant declines in abortion rates in a number of countries like Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, Russia and Turkey. In Russia the abortion rate declined by 61 percent between 1988 and 2001 because of an increase of 74 percent of preventive and contraceptive use. 
   We know prevention works. If you want to reduce abortion, we need to provide the prevention. Mrs. Lowey just went to great lengths to say we are just shipping the product. This is not money; this is not funds. We are going to ship the product, and then those organizations will be able to take the money they save and buy more contraceptives, not provide abortion, especially in these countries where abortion is already illegal. 
   I want to support the amendment from the Chair.

   Mr. Chairman, I just want to make one point. We heard the word ``fungible'' and ``fungibility'' more than once today. I just want to apply that logic to China because we've heard about China today. 
   According to the logic of money being fungible, all of the money that our friends on the other side over the past 6 years who have borrowed from China, allowed China to make money on the interest, and therefore use that money to have forced abortions in China, that's fungible. 
   Mr. Chairman, I wish the other side was as concerned about forced abortions in China when they were busting the budget over the last 6 years.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I just would like to end this debate to say that we all have the same goals here. We all want to reduce the number of abortions. Nobody wants to celebrate it. I'm a pro-life Democrat. I voted for the ban on partial-birth abortion and I'm proud of my vote. But we do have an honest disagreement on how we reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. And to me it is clear that if we do not provide contraception to these poor women in these poor countries, then we will have more abortions. The statistics bear this out, the facts bear this out, and that's why this amendment needs to go down and we need to pass the chairwoman's language here, because I believe that if this amendment passes, there will be more abortions, not less. 
   And one final comment to the gentleman from New Jersey, we were not pressured to support this position. We came to this position by honestly looking at the facts. No leadership pressured us, me and Mr. Langevin and those of us who have a different voting record than some people over here. So this is our choice. Please vote down this amendment and let's reduce the number of abortions.

   Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I cannot let that go unanswered. We are not promoting abortion. We are trying to reduce the number of abortions by providing contraception. 
   The fact of the matter is the Republican party has no plan on reducing the number of abortions, none. There is only one way to do it, and you provide contraception to poor people. That's what we are trying to do. 
   You're right. It's not about who's getting; it's about who's not getting. There are poor women who are not getting contraception and contraceptives. We are trying to provide it. 
   I commend what you are trying to do. We are trying to reduce number of abortions, and all the explicit details of an abortion procedure are exactly why we are trying to do this.
