<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I first want to address the underlying bill. There is a great deal of misinformation coming from some State Departments of Transportation. Curiously, those who have done the most transferring money out of their bridge account for other purposes, then come back and complain that they don't have enough money to repair deficient bridges. 
   The language in this legislation, by determination of the Congressional Budget Office, is not a mandate. There is no intergovernmental or private sector mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, first. 
   Secondly, the bill requires States to inspect structurally deficient bridges and fractured critical bridges annually. And to do that work, they can use money out of their bridge account to pay for bridge inspectors and to undertake the inspections. There is no limitation. The only limitation is if you have a structurally fractured critical bridge in your bridge inventory, fix it first before you transfer money for some other purpose. 
   Now this pending motion to recommit was rejected in our committee when we initially considered it in another piece of legislation. It is really special interest legislation because the company that would operate the LNG facility would be a principal beneficiary. 
   To explain the specifics of that intricacy, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR MIDWESTERN FLOOD VICTIMS -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 657, a resolution to express sympathy for the victims of the thunderstorms that caused severe flooding during August 2007 in the States of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. 
   I rise once again, as I did in May in the wake of devastating forest fire in the Gunflint Trail area in my district and again in August after the tragic collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis, to express my heartfelt sympathy to our fellow citizens in Minnesota, and in surrounding States, in the aftermath of the destruction. 
   These severe floods serve as another reminder of the millions of men and women who serve this nation as police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel who place themselves in great danger every day in order to protect each one of us. These well-trained, highly-skilled individuals are truly on the front lines in preparing for, responding to, and mitigating damages from a variety of hazards. They deserve our deepest thanks and respect. 
   Twenty-four hours a day, every day of the year, all over this country, when any type or tragedy enters our lives, from a medical emergency to a large-scale natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other incident, our Nation's emergency responders are the first on the scene to provide professional services, expert help, aid and comfort. These heroic, selfless individuals will tell you they are ``just doing their job''. 
   We rise today to also acknowledge and praise the support of local businesses, the American Red Cross, Catholic Charities, the United Way, and the Salvation Army who contributed to the local relief effort. Their boundless generosity and caring are just one of the pillars of recovery on which we have come to rely. 
   While we can never adequately express our gratitude to the organizations and the brave men and women who serve as our first responders, this resolution is a fitting tribute. 
   I strongly support this resolution and urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3068. This bill represents an important step in ensuring the safety of Federal employees and all those who work in and visit our Federal buildings. 
   I thank the Delegate of the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, for bringing this issue to the attention of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and for quickly developing and advancing, in a bipartisan manner, a remedy. 
   On April 18, 2007, the committee held a hearing entitled ``Proposals to Downsize the Federal Protective Service and Effects on the Protection of Federal Buildings''. The hearing probed the Department of Homeland Security's plans to cut the presence of Federal Protective Service, FPS, officers nationally. The reliance on contract security guards to protect Federal buildings is a troubling trend. 
   H.R. 3068 prohibits the award of contracts to provide guard services under the contract security guard program of the FPS to any business that is owned, controlled, or operated by an individual who has been convicted of a felony. The bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to promulgate regulations within 6 months to implement the provisions of this act. 
   This bill offers a common sense way to ensure that security contracts that provide an essential service are awarded only to contractors who are ``capable, responsible, and ethical'' as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 
   I support this bill and urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I am here to address the contribution of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act. 
   We begin with the Department of Energy, itself, by providing funding to build a photovoltaic solar wall on the south wall of the Department of Energy. It was built without windows or doors to accommodate a solar application, but the funding was never provided over the last 12 years. The project will pay for itself in less than 18 years and then begin sending excess energy into the local power grid. 
   We continue with the U.S. Capitol. We require the Architect of the Capitol to undertake feasibility studies on installing photovoltaic roofs on two buildings, Rayburn and Hart, and also a feasibility study to capture, store and use carbon dioxide from the Capitol power plant. 
   We spread these efforts further across the Nation by requiring the General Services Administration to install energy-efficient and renewable energy systems, including compact fluorescent bulbs and photovoltaic systems on Federal office buildings and U.S. courthouses across the country. We also prohibit the Coast Guard from using incandescent light bulbs unless they determine they are necessary for their mission. 
   The bill also establishes critical targets for GSA and other Federal civilian agencies to cut energy use by 30 percent and fossil fuel use 65 percent within a decade. Within 25 years under provisions in this bill, all fossil fuel use in Federal buildings will be eliminated. 
   Transportation. We authorize in law a Center for Climate Change and Environment under the Department of Transportation, which has existed by administrative action but has not been effective. It will be under this legislation. 
   We increase the Federal share for congestion mitigation and air quality improvement highway funds to 100 percent for incentives for States to use funds to finance alternatives for people driving alone. 
   We authorize $40 million for short line and regional railroads to buy green locomotives, $200 million for track improvements to encourage movement of goods by rail, and a new short sea shipping program to move goods by more efficient means. Short sea shipping is short-haul movement of goods by water to avoid congestion areas. Widely used in Europe, they have a vast network of short sea transportation routes. The bill will promote use of such shipping opportunities on the Great Lakes and on the saltwater coast of the United States, using the Capital Construction Fund, building ships in the United States, including in the State of Wisconsin, to build short sea shipping vessels to avoid congestion in places like Chicago. We make a real, solid contribution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Manager's Amendment to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (NASA Reauthorization), offered by the gentleman from Tennessee, Representative Bart Gordon, Chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology. I commend Chairman Gordon for his work on this important bill, which provides approximately $20 billion in funding authorization for fiscal year 2009, including approximately $853 million for aeronautical research, which is vital to commercial aviation. 
   The Manager's Amendment includes two revisions to the base authorization bill to reflect previous agreements between the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Science Committee on provisions that were part of H.R. 2881, The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, which passed the House on September 20, 2007. The Manager's Amendment revises Section 305 of the bill, to require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator, in coordination with NASA and the United States Climate Change Science Program to establish a research initiative to assess the impact of aviation on the climate and to evaluate mitigation approaches. In addition, this section, as amended, requires, within one year of the date of enactment, the participating federal agencies to develop a plan for a research program dedicated to aviation's impact on the climate. 
   The Manager's Amendment also amends Section 306 of the bill to require the FAA, in consultation with other agencies, to establish a research program on ways to improve the confidence in and timeliness of certification of new technologies for introduction into the National Airspace System. In addition, this section, as amended, requires the FAA to develop a research plan, and to contract with the National Research Council to conduct an independent review of the research program plan, with a subsequent report to the committees of jurisdiction, including the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 
   Madam Chairman, I support H.R. 6063, as amended by the Manager's Amendment, and urge my colleagues to do so as well.

   We move today on a somewhat unusual procedure to take up the Senate bill, S. 294, as amended, and use that vehicle to move us in going to conference with the other body on The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, the Amtrak reauthorization bill. The procedure we are using will allow us later today to move to go to conference with the Senate on their bill which is before us now, and our bill, H.R. 6003, that passed the House by a vote of 311-104 on June 11 of this year. 
   In that context, I just want to express again my great appreciation for the partnership we have had with Mr. Mica, whose constancy and, I should say, stirring initiative on behalf of intercity high speed passenger rail has been very, very, reassuring, encouraging, and is moving us toward that goal. And when we get this legislation enacted it will be more than a goal. It will become a reality. 
   And toward that end, the enormous amount of the success and of the movement in the direction of high speed passenger rail will go to the gentleman from Florida for his constant effort in that direction.

   Suffice it to say, 52 years ago, I traveled to Europe for a graduate study program, traveled from Minneapolis to Chicago on the Milwaukee 400, 400 miles in 400 minutes. You can't fly there in 400 minutes today. In Europe, I traveled from Paris to Brussels in 6 hours by train. Today, that's an 80-minute trip. If we can close the gap between Minneapolis and Chicago to 80 minutes, from Chicago to Cleveland in 2 hours or so, and New York to Washington, in the vision of the gentleman from Florida, in under 2 hours, then we will have accomplished something truly significant for today, for today's generation, for future generations. 
   And we will do that when we get to the conference on this bill and we will produce a meaningful and lasting benefit for America.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I welcome the gentleman's motion to instruct. The Buy America provision in Amtrak is comparable to the Buy America provision that I authored, got enacted in the 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act, to require all steel in the Federal Aid Highway Program to be made in America, American steel. And we extended that to the transit program subsequently, and to the Corps of Engineers program. 
   The situation with Amtrak is that there are two Buy America laws. The first was established in 1978. It requires Amtrak to buy U.S.-sourced equipment, U.S. materials, U.S. supplies for purchase in excess of $1 million. 
   As time went on, there was concern that there was a good deal of equipment manufacturing moving offshore because our domestic rail transit, rail passenger transit systems were in decline. There was little funding for them, and manufacturers were drying up in America, and the new sourcing was coming from foreign manufacturers. So the Appropriation Bill of 2002 required Amtrak to comply with the Buy America for procurements under $1 million, pursuant to Amtrak's grant agreements. 
   Our bill would require Buy America to apply to purchases of $100,000, being very specific about it, $100,000 or more. So this motion instructs the managers  to insist, and we are happy to insist on those provisions. 
   I thank the gentleman from Nevada for his motion.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I appreciate the thoughtful presentation of the gentleman from Nevada, very structured and supported by documents and references to specific facts. 
   The energy issue really consists of three elements; supply, demand, and a regulatory function. We need to deal with all three of those. 
   On the supply side, one of the elements we're supplying is the Maglev project that was authorized in the current SAFETEA legislation that the gentleman from Alaska and I worked on to connect Los Angeles with Las Vegas. I know that's of great interest to the gentleman from Nevada. And I'm very hopeful that we will see that project take root and go into operation. It will be a great addition to our surface transportation system and will reduce energy costs. 
   I heard the gentleman's reference to the electric car. There is a small, family-owned firm in my district that's making a very small electric car, selling for under $120,000, maybe $115,000. It's not an Escalade, but it's a very nice vehicle. It can get people from one point to another very efficiently for about the cost of what it takes to run your refrigerator for a year. So there is progress being made in all of these arenas. 
   In Amtrak, we will be able to make an enormous contribution, an alternative to air travel, intercity passenger rail more fuel efficient than car and air travel, consuming less energy than a car or airplanes.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself an additional minute. 
   And with the new energy-efficient equipment that Amtrak and the freight rail network are using, we will see more fuel-efficient switching locomotives, more energy-efficient auto train vehicle carriers, and the regenerative braking system with Acela. 
   We need to move ahead with this legislation and make our contribution in our little corner of the world in transportation through accelerating the work on Amtrak, which has been a bipartisan product of our committee.  
   Section 221 of the bill requires Amtrak to comply with the Buy America Act, and the regulations thereunder, for purchases of $100,000 or more. 
   Amtrak is currently subject to two separate Buy America laws. The first was established in 1978 and requires Amtrak to procure U.S.-sourced equipment, materials, and supplies for purchases in excess of $1 million. The second was established in the appropriations bill of 2002 and requires Amtrak to comply with Buy America requirements for procurements under $1 million, pursuant to Amtrak's grant agreements in effect with the Department of Transportation. 
   Our bill ensures that Amtrak would be subject to one set of Buy America requirements for procurements of $100,000 or more. 
   This motion instructs the House managers in the conference to insist on the provisions contained in Section 221 of the bill. The Senate-passed Amtrak reauthorization bill does not contain a similar Buy America requirement for Amtrak. We feel this provision is important, so we support the motion.  
   Energy Benefits of Amtrak 
   Amtrak and intercity passenger rail helps fight global warming. Our transportation sector produces one-third of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions (and one-twelfth of the world's). The average intercity passenger train produces 60 percent less carbon dioxide emissions per passenger mile than the average automobile, and 50 percent less carbon dioxide emissions per passenger mile of an airplane. 
   Amtrak and intercity passenger rail reduces highway and aviation congestion. Gridlock is becoming a shared experience for tens of millions of motorists every day, which impacts communities across the country. Over the past decade alone, travel growth on the nation's highways has averaged 2.2 percent annually. In 2007, congestion forced Americans to waste 2.9 billion gallons of fuel and cost Americans a staggering $78 billion. One full passenger train can take 250 to 350 cars off the road. Further Amtrak as a whole removes 8 million cars from the road and eliminates the need for 50,000 fully-loaded passenger airplanes each year. In conjunction with metropolitan transit systems, the city-center to city-center service offered by intercity passenger rail can also support dense, transit-oriented development in downtown areas, helping to reduce highway travel demand for both local trips and intercity trips. 
   Amtrak provides an alternative to air travel. Intercity passenger rail is competitive with air travel of 500 miles or less, and more than 80 percent of all trips exceeding 100 miles in length are less than 500 miles. For example, Amtrak service controls 56% of the air/rail market from Washington, DC to New York City and 43% of the air/rail market from New York City to Boston, MA. 
   Amtrak and intercity passenger rail is more fuel efficient than automobile and air travel. The Department of Energy's Transportation Energy Data Book reports that intercity passenger rail consumes 17 percent less energy per passenger mile than airlines and 21 percent less per passenger mile than automobiles. 
   Amtrak and intercity passenger rail consumes less energy than automobile and air  travel. Amtrak's British Thermal Unit, (or, ``BTU,'' standard unit of energy) per passenger mile was 2,650 in 2006. This compares to the 3,264 BTUs for air travel and 3,445 BTUs for highway travel in 2006. New energy efficient equipment is further improving conservation (e.g., in addition to Acela Express trains' regenerative braking system, Amtrak has acquired new more energy-efficient Auto Train vehicle carriers and is evaluating more fuel efficient switching locomotives). Amtrak's BTU per passenger mile improved from 2,800 in 2003 to 2,760 in 2004, 2,709 in 2005, and 2,650 in 2006. 
   Amtrak is taking steps to further reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. After Amtrak restored electrified service to the 104-mile Philadelphia-Harrisburg line in October 2006, it replaced 9 diesel powered roundtrip trains per weekday with 12 roundtrip trains powered by electricity. Today, most of the electric power Amtrak uses between New York and Washington is generated from non-fossil fuel sources.

   Ensign DeCarol Davis was the valedictorian of the Coast Guard Academy, Class of 2008, the first African American to graduate as valedictorian of the Coast Guard Academy. But this is not the first time that Ensign Davis graduated at the top of her class. She was valedictorian of Forest Park High School, Woodbridge, Virginia, in 2004. 
   Ensign Davis is a very impressive young lady, a Truman Scholar. She won the 2008 Connecticut Technology Council Women of Innovation Award. She is a standout basketball player. She was a 2006 Arthur Ashe, Jr. Women's Basketball First Team Sports Scholar, and she was selected to the ESPN The Magazine Academic All-District I College Women's Basketball First Team. 
   She's now a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard. Ensign Davis will join 41,000 men and women wearing that unique color of blue, enforcing the Nation's laws on our waterways, making the waterways safe as well as secure, and has chosen to begin her career in the Coast Guard Marine Safety Program. I'm delighted to see that future leaders of the Coast Guard value that program. 
   I was at the Coast Guard Academy just 3 months ago, met with the Commandant of Cadets and the director of the academic program at the Coast Guard Academy, met with several of the cadets and sat in on one of the classes. And I must say each time I do, each time I hold a session with the Coast Guard, and each time I meet the cadets, I have enormous confidence in the future of the Coast Guard and its service to boating, to maritime safety, and to the future needs of the Coast Guard and our country.

   That is an extraordinary academic record. It is an extraordinary career that she has led in the Coast Guard Academy, both in the classroom, on the field of play, and in the community. She is a talented, gifted young woman and will be an officer of distinguished service to the Coast Guard, but a role model for other young women, and I hope especially African-American women, to serve in the United States Coast Guard. I wish her continued success as she embarks on a remarkable journey with the U.S. Coast Guard.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very obvious support of H.R. 6493, the Aviation Safety Enhancement Act of 2008. 
   I consider this a first or, say, initial legislative step in reversing the complacency over safety regulations that has set in at the highest levels of the Federal Aviation Administration. 
   At the outset, I want to express my appreciation to Mr. Mica, the gentleman from Florida, the ranking member on our full Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Ranking Member Petri from the Subcommittee on Aviation, and Chairman Jerry Costello from Illinois, chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee. All of us have worked diligently on the hearing that we held on aviation safety and on the legislation that we bring to the floor today. 
   For years, the FAA has earned and held the distinction of the ``gold standard for aviation safety'' in the world. Other countries come to the United States to emulate the practices of the FAA in overseeing safety and setting standards for safety and maintenance of aircraft, engine and airframe. And it is, indeed, the charter of the FAA, in the very opening paragraph of the Organization Act of 1958, that created the Federal Aviation Administration from the old Civil Aeronautics Agency, quote, ``Safety in aviation shall be maintained at the highest possible level.'' Not the level airlines choose, not the level they can afford, but the highest possible level. 
   Safety in aviation must start in the corporate boardroom and permeate all through the organization. It is the responsibility of the FAA to set minimum standards and expect that not only airlines will meet them, but exceed them. 
   And there has been, over the years, a partnership in safety between the manufacturers of aircraft--whether it's Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Cessna, Cirrus, Piper, or these days Airbus in France--with the FAA in establishing standards, seeing that the standards are met, and then ensuring that in the course of operation of aircraft and the maintenance of aircraft safety is maintained at that highest possible level. 
   Over the last few years, we've seen a slippage with the FAA from that high standard. And following information we received from whistleblowers in the committee staff, and it came to my attention immediately, we found that there was a change in attitude at the FAA, a shift away from insisting on those highest standards, a move from a partnership to a customer service initiative in which the FAA directed its principal maintenance inspectors to treat airlines as though they were customers. I've never heard that term used in aviation in my 25 years of involvement in oversight of and setting standards for aviation safety. If there is a customer, it's the traveling public, not the airline. And if the airline is your customer and the customer is unhappy with the service he is getting,  then that customer can complain. And that's what one of the airlines did, complained to the FAA about the principal maintenance inspector being too rigorous, overseeing too vigorously. And that PMI was removed from that position. Until the FAA found out that our committee was investigating a range of practices that strayed from the standard of vigorous oversight of and enforcement of aviation safety, then they brought the person back. Well, we found that one carrier with FAA complicity allowed at least 177 of its aircraft to fly with passengers in revenue service in violation of FAA regulations, the most serious lapse in safety I've observed in 23 years. 
   The investigation the committee launched led to the discovery of other instances in which inspections were not properly conducted and repairs were not properly made. The result, after we brought this to the attention of the FAA, and to the public in a statement that we released about the situation in preparation for our hearings, numbers of aircraft, hundreds, 972 aircraft were grounded by not only the airline in question, but other air carriers as well. Thousands of flights were cancelled. Serious questions were raised about whether high-ranking officials in the FAA were carrying out their safety responsibilities toward the industry and toward the traveling public.     
   Since the hearing we conducted on April 3, the investigative staff has been approached by individuals from other maintenance providers of other carriers alleging serious breakdowns in FAA's regulatory oversight. As a result of the rigorous investigation and the intensive hearing conducted in committee, there has been a shift in the FAA. The pendulum swung too far to the cooperation side and is now moving back to the middle with a more balanced relationship with airlines instead of the carrier-favorable relationship previously. 
   On June 30, 2008, the Inspector General of DOT issued a report entitled ``Review of FAA's Safety Oversight of Airlines and Use of Regulatory Partnership Programs,'' observing that the IG made several recommendations to the FAA to strengthen its oversight of air carrier safety. Specifically, the IG recommended the FAA periodically rotate its flight standards safety inspectors and establish an independent investigative organization to examine safety issues found by FAA employees. 
   The FAA said it did not agree with the recommendation to rotate inspectors. It said it only partially agreed to implement the recommendation to establish an independent organization to investigate employee complaints, FAA employee complaints. The FAA's response has been to implement a Safety Issues Report System that duplicates existing hotlines, does not provide for independent review outside of FAA's Aviation Safety Organization, which in the past had a long and successful and effective record of responding to complaints filed by whistleblowers. Well, I think FAA's response has been wholly inadequate. 
   This legislation will move us in the direction of correcting the problem and putting aviation safety back on the highest level, the gold standard, that has been characteristic of the FAA in years past. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The issues at stake in the hearing that we held relate principally to two major issues of aviation safety: One was hull inspection, and the other was inspection of the power control unit on 737 aircraft that regulate the movement of the rudder onboard those aircraft. 
   Both of these air worthiness directives and Federal air regulations that govern oversight of maintenance performed on high-time aircraft and on aircraft that have this unique power control unit resulted from accidents that involved loss of life. 
   The 737 of Aloha Airlines en route to Honolulu lost 18 feet of its hull in the air. The flight attendant was pulled to her death. Passengers strapped in suffered rapid, severe decompression injury but no other loss of life. The investigation that followed showed that there was extensive corrosion and metal fatigue and perhaps also improper technology used in putting the plates together in the hull of the aircraft. 
   There followed a worldwide conference on aging aircraft, which I was the lead speaker. We gathered aviation manufacturers, airline operators, and aircraft inspection agencies from every nation in the world that had commercial aviation operation.     
   And out of that conference resulted a number of recommendations which we crafted together in a bill that my then partner on the Aviation Subcommittee, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Clinger, and I moved through subcommittee, full committee, to the House floor and through to enactment. 
   The language reads: The administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations that ensure the continuing airworthiness of aging aircraft. The regulations prescribed shall at least require that the administrator make inspections and review the maintenance and other records of each aircraft and air carrier used to provide air transportation that the administrator decides may be necessary to enable the administrator to decide whether the aircraft is in safe condition and maintained properly for operation and air transportation. 
   The air carrier shall at least demonstrate that as part of the inspection, maintenance of the aircraft's age, sensitive parts and components has been adequate and timely enough to ensure the highest degree of safety. And work performed under this section shall be carried out after the 14th year in which the aircraft has been in service. 
   That was not just a happenstance. It was a very specific directive dealing with high time aircraft, a very specific directive to the FAA and to airlines to undertake this rigorous inspection. The FAA failed to maintain that level of vigilance. The air carrier failed to maintain its level of vigilance. And on some of those aircraft, there were found to be small cracks. But it's those small cracks that led to failures, the small cracks that led to life lost. 
   In another instance, the power control unit on 737 aircraft, something happened to an aircraft to cause the flight deck crew to lose control of that aircraft when the rudder made an uncommanded movement. And 137 people died in Pennsylvania. In the investigation conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board pursuant to the accident, it was found that this very small unit, this big, had failed. Up to that time, there had been 93 million hours of operation of 737s, and Boeing Company said, we haven't had any failures. But when the NTSB looked back in the record of other unexplained accidents, they were traced to this power control unit which was subsequently redesigned and retested under the extreme conditions that aircraft fly at high altitudes and rebuilt and reinstalled and a vigorous airworthiness directive put in place to require periodic inspections of the power control unit. Those inspections were missed. And the airlines involved, having missed the deadline, had to go back, take those aircraft out of service and inspect those parts. That is what we're talking about, vigilance at the highest possible level. 
   And I have seen a situation where in safety, a very comfortable relationship can exist between the overseer and the practitioner of safety. To say, as we do in the Congress, to say as we do about other members of the executive branch, that you must move around from one position to another in the executive branch, and we say to those who leave service, leave the Federal public service, ``you cannot come back and lobby the Congress for a period of time'' is an already established practice. To say that in a period of 2 years, a person who leaves the FAA to go work elsewhere outside of government, is not to say to that person that your service is not valued. We just want to make sure you're not using it to a contrary purpose to that which the person had served for all those years. 
   We only in this language prevent that person from working for the carrier they once oversaw. I think that is a reasonable step. It is one recommended by the Inspector General. I think it is in the best interest of safety to do this. It is in the best interest of safety to continue the Air Transportation Oversight System, ATOS, where airlines and manufacturers are engaged in developing trend lines, by watching these trend lines where we know and see certain things happening and take action before there is a failure and before there is a catastrophe, to prevent a tragedy. ATOS is a very good system. But it should not be transformed into one in which the airline is in the command position. There is a proper balance. And I think this legislation will  bring the FAA back into proper balance. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself the balance of our time. And I will not take all of whatever time remains. 
   An observation, and I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman from Florida, committing himself and the committee as a whole to vigorous oversight of safety. It is a good record, as the gentleman said, in air carrier safety over the last few years. What I have learned in my experience with safety in aviation, highways, railways, waterways and airways, is that that safety is just around the corner from the next accident. And while it may have been an inconvenience for passengers for the airlines to pull aircraft out of service, it's a horrible inconvenience to be dead or injured because of an airline accident. Had the airlines been conducting their inspections appropriately, vigorously and in keeping with the airworthiness directives in the time frames envisioned, it would not have had to pull these aircrafts out of service to do major inspections in blocks, as was done this spring. And as the gentleman from Florida said, this legislation, enacted, carried out by the FAA, will make sure that aviation stays on a steady path of constancy in oversight of aviation safety. That is what we want. That is the objective of this legislation. It is the continuity of inspection and of oversight of the air carriers who have the prime responsibility to maintain their aircraft in safe, airworthy condition. 
   And that is what we will achieve when we get this legislation enacted into law. I'm very hopeful that the other body will act promptly on this legislation, that it will be signed and carried out vigorously by the FAA and reestablish its standing in the world community, which looks to the United States to set and maintain the gold standard for aviation safety.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, here we are. We started on this journey with this legislation in subcommittee and full committee on the initiative of Mr. Taylor of Mississippi, Mr. LaTourette of Ohio, Mr. LoBiondo of New Jersey, Mr. Kagen of Wisconsin, a whole host of Members who live along the water, whose districts encompass water-based recreational activity, alarmed by constituents that something serious was about to happen as a result of a decision of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California, that guys and women with little motor boats are going to have to go through a ballast water discharge system. 
   Well, the ramifications would have brought forward a regulatory scheme that would have been extraordinarily and unnecessarily burdensome on weekend recreational boaters. Every weekend I travel throughout my district, and I look longingly out on the lakes at those who are using their boats and wish I could be out there with them. I am doing other things, most of them meetings indoors. 
   I know from hearing from my constituents, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) has, that incidental discharges, as covered by the court ruling, deck runoffs, laundry, shower and galley waste from 13 million State-registered recreational boats could wreak havoc in this sector that is a multi-billion dollar part of our national economy and vital specifically to local economies and vital to individuals who seek respite from their workaday life by getting out on a boat on the weekend and kicking back and enjoying the water and the water environment. 
   In the aftermath of the court case, Northwest Environmental Advocates, our committee closely reviewed the issue of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, to use the technical term, including the implications of both recreational vessel discharges and commercial vessel discharges, and we decided it was appropriate to retain a limited exclusion from the national pollutant discharge elimination system that will allow requirements for discharges incidental to the normal operation of a recreational vessel. We restore the status quo in this legislation that existed prior to the California court decision. 
   Just one word of explanation for the procedure here. We were ready to bring our bill weeks ago. We got a message from our counterparts in the other body to wait and give the other body time to move its legislation because with all of the procedural limitations and hoops they have to jump through in the other body, wait until they could move a bill. And we waited and we waited and we waited. We were ready to move our own bill. I said this is it, we will bring it to the floor this week. We aren't going to wait any longer. Well, I won't characterize any further the other body. It might go beyond the decorum of the House in this matter. 
   And suddenly, the trigger went off and the other body moved with its bill and brought it to the floor. If we act today on this legislation, we can just send these bills directly to the President for his signature, and that is what we ought to do in the best interest of boating and in the best interest of comity between the bodies. 
   I express great appreciation to the gentleman from Ohio for his patience and for his cooperation and participation, and to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) for also being very patient on the issue. And for all of my other colleagues who have wanted us to take this action, we are doing it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I also want to include in the list of distinguished Members who supported this legislation, and, from the outset, Mrs. Miller from Michigan. Candice Miller has been a strong advocate for this legislation. 
   The gentleman from Ohio referenced the other body arising from its slumber. I think that is a passage from scripture, from the Old Testament, that concludes, in the last stanza, ``A new day is dawning.'' This is a new day of dawning, for boating, for recreational boaters. 
   As I was up the north shore of Lake Superior on Saturday dedicating a new McQuade Road Harbor of refuge, there was, indeed, an open water kayak, a 20-foot kayak that put into the Harbor of Refuge. I thought of this legislation, and I told the folks gathered that we are going to make boating safe and easy, comfortable again, thanks to a partnership. Although there wasn't a boat in the carload, for the gentleman from Ohio, I brought his name up saying it's wonderful to have this kind of partnership and participation in legislation for the common good and common interest. 
   I will observe further that today is the gentleman's birthday, and I promise not to break into song, but I do promise that we deliver to the gentleman an appropriate remembrance of his day in the form of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, briefly, to describe the purpose of this legislation, which was vigorously supported by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor); the gentleman from Alaska, our former chairman, Mr. Young; Mr. LoBiondo from New Jersey; and, of course, the very distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. LaTourette; by Chairman Cummings, who gave his full support and initiative to this legislation. 
   This is a 2-year moratorium for discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain commercial vessels other than discharges of ballast water. It also directs the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct additional studies on the implications of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. 
   We developed this legislation in similar fashion to the previous bill in recreational boating on the initiative of the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) and the other Members that I mentioned previously. 
   We also worked across the way with the other body, the Committee on Environment and Public Works and various individual Members of the other body. It took a little while to get their commitment, get their attention, to release the bill from holds over there, which are a quaint practice, not practiced in this body. Again, we were prepared to bring this bill to the House floor and had it scheduled for the suspension calendar this week out of exasperation with lack of progress across the way. 
   But I know those 200 meters that separate the two wings of the Capitol are very difficult to traverse. Sometimes it can take as long as the Old Chisholm Trail to move from one end to the other, but that movement has been made. I will include in the Record the specifics of the legislation, the legislative history which is necessary to establish the legislative balance and the factual construct within which we bring this bill to the floor.  
   Mr. Speaker, S. 3298 provides a two-year moratorium for discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain commercial vessels, other than discharges of ballast water, as well as directs the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') to conduct additional study on the implications of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. 
   This legislation, which was developed in close coordination with the two lead co-sponsors of the House companion bill, H.R. 6556, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette), as well as our counterpart in the Other Body, the Committee on Environment and Public Works, and several individual senators. I applaud the work of all of my colleagues, in both chambers, for resolving their differences, and moving this legislation (S. 3298), and S. 2766, the ``Clean Boating Act of 2008'', in tandem today.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. To the list of encomiums that have been expressed on the floor during this discussion, I add that of Mr. Mica, who has participated all through the process in partnership, as we do on our committee, in crafting the approach, agreeing to separate tracks for the two bills, to patience waiting for the other body, and I greatly appreciate the support of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), our ranking member. 
   To all Members who have given so much of their time and energy and pointing out, as several have done, that if we don't act, as we are doing today, if we don't act promptly, come the start of commercial fishing season, there could be a shutdown of the entire industry with calamitous economic consequences, and we don't want that to happen. 
   So we are here now to bring this bill to conclusion, a 2-year moratorium, give the regulated users, boaters, time to evaluate to provide public comment on EPA's draft vessel general permit. 
   We also caution EPA to use this 2-year period to work with the vessel owners within the context of that court ruling and address technical or practical implementation issues raised in this entire context. There should be plenty of time for EPA to complete statutory obligations under the Clean Water Act and other statutes, and address vessel discharges at the end of this moratorium period so we don't have to have another crisis situation again. 
   And I know that all those who are engaged in the commercial boating activities will appreciate the dispatch with which we have acted. And I assure one and all that we would have acted weeks ago had it not been out of respect for the other body and the procedural problems encountered in moving bills over there. 
   Again, I thank all those who have given so much of their time and energy and early morning meetings, yes, to resolution of this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, we stand on the threshold of a transformational moment in the history of intercity passenger rail service in America. 
   There was an earlier such moment. That was Amtrak, the creation of the Passenger Rail Corporation in 1970 when the freight rail interests of America gradually had been abandoning passenger service, discontinuing lines, discontinuing less-than-carload service, discontinuing the overnight railway Post Office service aboard intercity passenger rail. And as the RPO was discontinued, the passenger portion of the  rail service became unprofitable and the railroads one by one appealed to the Interstate Commerce Commission for discontinuance authority, to discontinue service on that portion of the line. And gradually, passenger rail service disappeared from the landscape until finally the Federal Government was left holding the bag, if you will, and created, through act of Congress, the passenger rail service we know today as Amtrak. 
   But over the intervening years, Amtrak was never given the funding it needed to improve the track, the rail bed, to improve the rolling stock, and to operate independently from freight rail service on the lines and corridors where passenger service operated. And especially over the last dozen years, we have seen declining investment in Amtrak's operations, and in the last 6 years we have had at least one bankruptcy budget submitted by the administration, candidly stated so by the Secretary of Transportation. But with a combination of Republicans and Democrats looking to the future, we have been able to just keep Amtrak's nose above water during these intervening years. Today, we change that model. 
   With passage of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act, we will transform the future of intercity passenger rail in America. 
   We heard all this morning from the one-minute speeches, the price of a gallon of gas breached $4 a gallon for the first time in history. The American Automobile Association says gas prices have gone up more than 10 percent in the last month and a dollar in the past year. Those prices are reverberating across the Nation, changing people's travel patterns and habits and causing them to look more to transit, and transit across the country has exploded in its growth. 
   Last year we added more than a million new passengers to transit services a day across this country for 375 million new transit trips last year. Amtrak has similarly experienced enormous growth. 
   Our airlines are cutting back. Eight airlines since December of last year have shut down. One filed for bankruptcy, largely because of rising fuel costs. Fuel now represents 40 percent of the airline industry's expenses. A small increase in gas prices, and I know that a dollar a barrel increase in the price of oil for Northwest Airlines causes an increase in cost to that airline of $42 million. You can increase that by 50 percent more for Delta, and double that for United and American. That means less competition, less mobility, and higher prices for our fellow citizens. 
   The Department of Transportation says vehicle miles traveled in March fell 4.3 percent from last year. That is the first time we have seen a drop in miles traveled on public roads in over 30 years.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself an additional 2 minutes. 
   The Center for Housing Policy says that working families in large metropolitan areas spent nearly a third of their income on transportation. That means families are not able to buy homes, they are not saving, they are not investing in their children's education, they are spending it on transportation. 
   People are beginning to realize, just as they did in the days after September 11, that Amtrak service to move people from one city to another, is vitally important. One full passenger train can take 250 to 350 cars off the road. Intercity passenger rail removes 8 million cars from the highways every year and eliminates the need for 50,000 fully loaded passenger airline trips each year. 
   Amtrak in the Northeast corridor has 56 percent of the air-rail market between Washington, D.C. and New York City, 43 percent of the market between New York and Boston. And now we come to the American public, perhaps 20 years too late, but just in time with the legislation before us today that will upgrade passenger rail intercity service. 
   There is $14.9 billion authorized in this bill to rebuild Amtrak, construct high-speed rail corridors across the Nation, and I won't go into the specifics of it. 
   At this point I simply want to express my deep appreciation to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) who extended his hand of cooperation, his enthusiasm for rebuilding passenger rail service in this country with some innovative ideas and a willingness to join hands and bring a truly bipartisan bill to the House floor, and to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown) the Chair of the Rail Subcommittee who has been Amtrak's most vigorous cheerleader and advocate.

But it must also be added that in the bleak years of those starvation budgets for Amtrak, the gentleman from Ohio was out front with Ms. Brown and myself advocating for increased funding for Amtrak. 
   If you look at the New York Times today, the gentleman referred to the price of fuel. Every increase in the price of fuel, already up 84 percent compared with last year, increases pressures on airlines. We have to pump 7,000 gallons into a 737 and 60,000 into a 747.

   So airlines are doing a whole host of new initiatives including washing their engines frequently. They get grime out of the engine which increases efficiency. And they're cutting back on a whole host of things like less water onboard aircraft for the lavatories, and they're trying to cut the paper manuals for the pilot and copilot in half to save weight onboard the aircrafts. It's all reported in today's New York Times and are things we've known on the committee.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And again I express my great appreciation for the many hours of consultation that we have had between the distinguished ranking member, the gentleman from Florida, and myself, and with Mr. Shuster and myself, and with Ms. Brown. Mr. Mica has been a vigorous advocate for high-speed rail passenger service with changes, with changes in the way we conduct the business of passenger rail service in America. And as he said, this wasn't easy. But if it were easy, they wouldn't need us. They wouldn't need Congress if things were all easy. 
   But the point of the legislative process is to be open, to be receptive, to think constructively, to trust that the ideas advanced by one or the other side are set forth in earnest pursuit of a valid public purpose goal. And that has been a long tradition of this Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the principal reason that we have succeeded over so many years in being the building committee of the Congress. 
   The gentleman from Connecticut said that there weren't reforms or deplored the lack of significant reform in this legislation. I just want to say we have management improvement. It is requiring a financial accounting system for Amtrak operations and a 5-year financial plan monitored by the Department of Transportation's Inspector General, an overall assessment being to be done by the Inspector General, progress made by Amtrak management and by DOT in implementing the provisions of the bill. We direct the Secretary of Treasury, and there has been  a consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and Amtrak, to negotiate restructuring of Amtrak's debt. We include a corporate governance provision restructuring Amtrak's board, expanding the board to ten persons serving 5-year terms and requiring that the President consult with Congress to ensure balanced representation of regions served by Amtrak in that board, and to have rail transportation or business background among those members. 
   In consultation with the Service Transportation Board and Federal Railroad Administration, Amtrak is required to develop standards for measuring performance of quality of intercity train operations, including cost recovery, on time performance, ridership per train mile, on board and station services and interconnectivity of routes and requires the DOT IG to evaluate performance and service quality of intercity passenger rail service and identify the five worst performing Amtrak routes from which then IG will recommend a process for the DOT to consider proposals for competitive service by the private sector to Amtrak on that route. 
   Those are significant reforms. And I invite the attention of the gentleman from Connecticut, and I will send him the specifics that I just mentioned. 
   We are ready to move ahead with the balance of this bill. This is an exciting opportunity. This is the beginning of the transformation of passenger rail service in America. It is not going to lead us tomorrow to the Grande Vitesse, the TGV of France, or the Talgo of Spain, or the ICE of Germany, or the Shinkansen of Japan, or the 220-mile-per-hour train service between Beijing and Shanghai in China. But it will put us on a course to get there, to achieve those speeds over those distances. 
   When I traveled, as a student, to begin graduate studies in 1956 at the College of Europe, from Paris to Brussels, the trip was 6 hours. Today that trip is 80 minutes. There is no air service, no commercial air passenger service between the capital of Europe, Brussels, and the Capital of France, Paris. But there is a train leaving every 3 minutes in each direction with 1,100 passengers on board traveling at 184 miles per hour, all day long from 6 in the morning until midnight. 
   We should be able to achieve that kind of service on the east coast. We should be able to achieve that kind of service in the Southwest, as was referenced by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). We should be able to do that in California, as was referenced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa), and in the Pacific Northwest and in the Southeast of the United States. And this bill will put us on a track to do that.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   The manager's amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study on ways to streamline compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act requirements for Federally funded rail infrastructure projects. This issue was raised in committee by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, the ranking member, Mr. Shuster, for himself, for North Carolina and for Alaska. I felt that we needed to explore the matter further, so we scheduled a hearing on the issue because this matter had not been raised previously. 
   We heard from the Alaska Railroad, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the National Trust For Historic Preservation and the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. 
   At the conclusion of that meeting, it was obvious we weren't going to be able, in the course of the hearing, to reach agreement. But we saw a path toward agreement. And I directed the parties and the staff to work through the weekend to develop a compromise proposal, which they did, and we have reflected that understanding in the manager's amendment. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble), and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster) for bringing this matter to our attention, and to Mr. Mica for participating and working out what I think is a reasonable approach. 
   I also what to thank colleagues who had amendments that were proposed to the bill for agreeing to incorporate those amendments into the manager's amendment to expedite consideration. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri), the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Berry), and Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), from Delaware (Mr. Castle) Mr. Cuellar and Mr. Hinojosa from Texas, Mr. Weiner and Mr. Blumenauer, from New York and Oregon respectively. 
   The Arcuri amendments ensure that the financial contributions and in kind services provided by commuter rails are taken into account in developing a standardized formula for Northeast Corridor commuter cost allocation. 
   The Berry-Cohen amendment requires a feasibility analysis on extending south central high-speed rail service to Memphis, Tennessee. The Castle amendment ensures that all proposals for high-speed rail on the Northeast Corridor plans to allow station stops at or in close proximity to the busiest Amtrak stations. The Cuellar-Hinojosa amendment requires a feasibility analysis on extending South Central high-speed rail to a location in south Texas to be determined by the Secretary. 
   The Weiner-Blumenauer amendment authorizes intercity passenger rail grants for bicycle access on rolling stock and bicycle racks on trains. And the amendment also provides that none of the funds may be used to employ workers in violation of section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act and makes a number of technical corrections in the reported bill. 
   There are other items of a bipartisan nature included in the manager's amendment, and I think we have worked these matters out satisfactorily. 
   I urge all Members to support it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Chairman, a distinguished member of our committee, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley), intended to be here and had actually requested time to be heard on general debate. But, unfortunately, he is home in his district, probably handling sandbags to deal with flooding in Waterloo. Late yesterday, the flooding washed away a Union Pacific Railroad bridge over the Cedar River in downtown Waterloo and our committee colleague is back home with his constituents, as he rightly should be. 
   I also want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. BRALEY), who I know wanted to be here during consideration of the bill. 
   Regrettably, he is home in his District to help his constituents deal with flooding in Waterloo. 
   Yesterday, the flooding washed away a Union Pacific railroad bridge over the Cedar River in downtown Waterloo. 
   I include a report from the local newspaper on the tragedies in Iowa. 
   Update: Railroad Bridge in Downtown W'loo Collapses; CF Orders More Evacuations   
   Waterloo, June 10.--One-third of the Union Pacific railroad bridge parallel to Sixth Street over the Cedar River in downtown Waterloo has washed away in the flood waters. 
   The third of the bridge adjacent to the east bank of the Cedar River washed away at 2:45 p.m. 
   Roger Verch saw the bridge section give way. 
   ``We were actually standing on the 18th Street Bridge'' downstream when it gave way. It struck the 18th Street Bridge. `` We really felt the vibrations,'' Verch said. A portion of it remained lodged in the 18th Street Bridge and another portion of it washed down river. 
   The bridge is used by the Iowa Northern Railroad to serve John Deere's East Donald Street Tractor Works, and Deere tractors are transported by rail over that line to Cedar Rapids. 
   Iowa Northern general manager Mark Sabin said the railroad is assessing the flood's impacts all along its line and had not yet had an opportunity to assess the effects of the bridge washout. 
   We will provide more details as they become available. 
   Also, the city of Cedar Falls has now expanded its area of evacuation. The mayor has ordered an immediate evacuation of everyone in the following areas: 
   --On Franklin Street from Sixth Street to the north; on Sixth Street to the east toward Main Street; on Main Street from Ninth Street to the north; and all downtown areas from those streets toward the river. 
   Unauthorized vehicles will be removed beginning at 3 p.m. 
   People who are evacuating are urged to turn off their power, utilities, water and gas. Security will be provided for the area to safeguard property by the Cedar Falls Police Department and the National Guard. 
   Volunteers may remain in this area if they are assisting with the sandbagging efforts. Volunteers will be needed throughout the night. It cannot be emphasized enough that volunteers are needed and must report to the north parking lot of the UNI-Dome to assist with sandbagging. Volunteers must not travel downtown or go near the levy. Transportation will be provided to volunteers.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have all spoken to one another as colleagues about the work that we have done and the time we have invested to bring this legislation to the floor in the shape that it is in, which is remarkable. But we stand on the shoulders of skilled, dedicated professionals who make our work possible and make it effective. 
   On the full committee, our Chief of Staff, Dave Heymsfeld, Ward McCarragher, Jen Walsh and Erik Hansen. On the Republican side, Jim Coon and Amy Steinmann. 
   On the subcommittee, our very dedicated Jennifer Esposito, John Drake, who has filled in for Jennifer while she was raising a new passenger for Amtrak, Rose Hamlin, Niels Knutson and Nick Martinelli of Chairwoman Brown's staff. On the Republican side, Allison Cullin and Joyce Rose, whose distinguished service and experience contributes enormously, and Mike Meenan and John Brennan, who Ranking Member Mica mentioned has left the committee staff to take an operating position with a railroad. 
   The Office of Legislative Counsel has been of enormous help, Tim Brown. And at CBO, Sarah Puro. 
   All of whom have made their unique contribution without whose wise professional guidance we couldn't be at this point. And, believe me, I know. I served on the staff for 12 years in this body, and I know what hard work it is.     
   I know what hard work it is. All the digging is done there, and I thank them, the staff. 
   The gentleman from Pennsylvania cited one of the cornerstone breakthrough provisions of this legislation, and that is opening up an opportunity for competition from the private sector to demonstrate whether private sector funding, financing, management, expertise, can operate passenger rail routes successfully, and I welcome that opportunity. 
   I know that for good friends in the railroad brotherhoods it initially caused a great deal of concern, but I recall the words of President John F. Kennedy, who said we should never fear to negotiate, but we should never negotiate out of fear. There is nothing to fear in this proposition. 
   There is an opportunity for us to expand the horizons. We are going to have to do this in the surface transportation authorization next year, inviting private sector investments in key elements of our national transportation system. 
   To open Amtrak to that kind of investment, that challenge of expanding the horizon, is necessary, and I welcome that opportunity. We will monitor it very closely, we will have a very careful evaluation step-by-step of how these provisions will proceed. But I think, net, it will be a benefit to our passenger rail service in America. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of our time and ask for a favorable vote on the manager's amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my metropolitan Washington colleagues, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis), the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen), and the Majority Leader (Mr. Hoyer).  
   This amendment authorizes the Secretary to make grants to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (``WMATA'') to finance capital and preventive maintenance projects included in the agency's Capital Improvement Program. 
   The amendment will also require that all local payments for the cost of operating and maintaining the area's regional rail system--known as the ``Metro''--be made from dedicated funding sources. 
   This is especially important in light of the fact that WMATA is currently the only transit system of its size that does not have a fully dedicated source of State or local funding. 
   The WMATA transit system is one of the busiest in the entire country, providing over 415 million passenger trips each year. Each day, more than 800,000 people ride Metro trains, and over 150,000 ride Metro buses. 
   Only the New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles transit systems produce more yearly transit passenger trips than WMATA in Washington, DC. 
   Further, the Federal workforce relies heavily on the reliable and efficient service that the WMATA system provides. More than 165,000 Federal employees, or one-third of Federal employees in the region, are currently enrolled in the transit benefits program with WMATA. 
   According to a study by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the service that WMATA provides to our Federal employees helps keep an additional 15,500 automobiles off the roads in the National Capital region, and saves those commuters over 8.2 million gallons of gas each year. 
   The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is an important part of our Nation's strategy to provide commuters efficient and reliable transit options, thereby allowing them to reduce their transportation-related emissions, energy consumption, and reliance on foreign oil. 
   Regarding the specific language of this amendment, it is important to note that these new grants will be subject to the same labor, environmental, Buy America procurement, diversity contracting, and other requirements applicable to all transit projects funded under Chapter 53 of Title 49, United States Code. If this amendment is adopted, in conference on H.R. 6003, 1 would like to further clarify the specific terms of Chapter 53 which may be inconsistent with the purposes of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentleman. Commuter rail certainly is one of the fastest growing modes of transportation in the public sector. We had over 461 million trips by commuter rail last year, and that is a 5.5 percent increase over the previous year. 
   The amendment offered by gentleman directs Amtrak to engage in good-faith negotiations with commuter rail entities and public transportation authorities to move more efficiently the maximum number of intercity rail passengers, especially during peak commuter hours. 
   As the gentleman from Pennsylvania said, it is a good, commonsense amendment, and I urge support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith). 
   Commuter rail is one of the fastest growing modes of public transportation in this country. In 2007, Americans took 461 million trips by commuter rail, a 5.5 percent increase over 2006. As a result, many commuter rail operators are seeking to expand their services while contending with other rail traffic. 
   In response to these challenges, this amendment directs Amtrak to engage in good-faith discussions with commuter rail entities and public transportation authorities operating on the same track to efficiently move the maximum number of commuter, intercity, and regional rail passengers, especially during peak commuter hours. It also directs Amtrak to work with these parties toward the expansion and enhancement of commuter rail and regional public transportation service. 
   This amendment helps ensure that Amtrak is doing everything it can to not only maximize the efficiency of its operations but also ensure the maximum growth possible for other rail services. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. We had a thoughtful, constructive discussion about the gentleman's proposal in the Rules Committee on Monday, and the gentleman is very sincere and very genuine in his proposal. However, we have a number of provisions in this bill to improve Amtrak's operations, to reform the way Amtrak conducts its business, to get at the lowest-performing routes. 
   We specifically direct the Amtrak board of directors to implement a modern financial accounting system to save money, improve operations, and increase revenue. 
   In section 204, we direct Amtrak to report on projected revenues, expenditures and ridership over a 5-year period to promote improved financial stability and how best to allocate the resources we provide to Amtrak. We direct Amtrak to work with the States to institute a nationwide methodology for allocating, operating and capital costs, to standardize financial support of Amtrak to the States and the Federal Government to ensure each is contributing their appropriate and fair amount, and to address specifically the performance of poorly performing routes, and they may be different from the one that the gentleman has in mind at this particular moment. 
   We further direct the inspector general of DOT to evaluate performance, service quality of the five worst performing Amtrak routes and recommend a process for DOT to consider proposals by Amtrak and other operators to provide service both on under-performing Amtrak routes and routes not served by Amtrak. 
   So the gentleman is proposing that Congress make a preemptive strike and direct dropping a route when we have in place with the enactment of this legislation a process by which we are going to improve these processes. It would be better to look and reexamine at the end of that process rather than at the beginning and prejudge the outcome of these sincere efforts that we are making to improve all of Amtrak's operations. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

Where they are removed in an experimental basis there have been fatalities or incidents or accidents, and where the train horn has been reinstated, lives have been saved. But technology can lead us to better train horns that don't intrude on the daily lives or nightly lives of citizens alongside railroad tracks. 
   So I reserve the balance of my time, and I appreciate the gentlewoman's amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment.  
   This amendment expresses support for expanded commuter rail service on the rail line between New Haven, Connecticut, and Springfield, Massachusetts, and encourages Amtrak to work cooperatively with the States of Connecticut and Massachusetts to enable expanded commuter rail service on the line. Further, this amendment directs Amtrak to report to Congress and the States on the total cost of uncompleted infrastructure maintenance on the New Haven--Springfield rail line. 
   Commuter rail is one of the fastest growing modes of public transportation in this country. In 2007, Americans took 461 million trips by commuter rail, a 5.5 percent increase over 2006. Since 1990, New England's highway traffic has increased two to three times faster than its population and commuter rail is a critical transportation link in the Northeast. 
   According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Connecticut has one of the nation's longer average commute times (24.5 minutes) in the nation, and 80 percent of Connecticut commuters drive themselves to work. The State of Connecticut is seeking to provide additional transportation alternatives to its commuters and is hoping to expand commuter rail service to address its congestion. 
   This amendment will help Connecticut understand the capital costs needed to better develop its commuter rail infrastructure as it works to develop its passenger transportation systems. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I rise in support of the Murphy amendment. I feel the amendment is an important contribution to the work of this bill.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy), the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Schwartz), and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt).  
   This amendment directs Amtrak to evaluate the passenger rail service between Cornwells Heights, Pennsylvania, and New York, New York, and between Princeton Junction, New Jersey, and New York, New York, to determine whether to expand passenger rail service by increasing the frequency of stops or reducing commuter ticket prices for the route. 
   Until a few years ago, Cornwells Station was the primary SEPTA and Amtrak station for service into New York City from the Bensalem Township. It has direct access to Interstate 95 and Pennsylvania Route 63, with the largest parking lot on the SEPTA network, making it an ideal terminal for commuter service into New York for many people in the surrounding region. 
   However, Amtrak recently reduced the number of trains serving the station each day by one-half, while greatly increasing the ticket prices for the service. As a result, ridership has plummeted, leading Amtrak to consider dropping service to the station all together. 
   This study has several potential benefits. For one, the Bensalem region is enjoying an economic revitalization, which could be enhanced by increased Amtrak service to Cornwells Heights. Increased Amtrak service would allow for better mobility in the region as well as help relieve local congestion. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, this is only a halfhearted attempt. If it were a wholehearted attempt, the motion would have included soybean oil and ethanol and it would have included the word ``forthwith'' and we could have accepted it. In fact, if the gentleman had come to the committee, both the Republican and Democratic side of the committee in the course of consideration of the bill, if he were serious about this matter, we would have included it in our section 219, Locomotive Biofuel Study. There is no reason we couldn't include all of what the gentleman is saying, plus additional items. But I think by using the word ``promptly,'' clearly this is just another gesture, a political gesture, to sidetrack the bill. Sending it back to committee simply delays the benefits of Amtrak. 
   We have worked diligently over the better part of a year-and-a-half, Republicans and Democrats together on the committee, and fashioned a wide-ranging proposition for the future of inter-city passenger rail in America, introducing extraordinary reforms that have not been considered or have been rejected in the past. We have included those in this bill. 
   We include a locomotive biofuel study. We require locomotive testing. We require a report. We require it to be done in a very specific period of time. We also require a study on the use of bio-based lubricants for Amtrak to use.     
   In fact, soybean-derived fuel is being used by the freight rail sector in what is known as Green Goat technology, Green Goat locomotives and freight rail makeup switchyards with great success. 
   The Green Goat technology using soybean-based fuel is reducing particulate emissions in rail makeup yards reducing noise and also reducing cost of maintenance of locomotives because the fuel also provides lubricating quality to a locomotive engine. 
   Furthermore, to insist that we move on this amendment--I think an earlier version I saw would have required implementation immediately--Amtrak has warranties with General Electric, who produces the P42 locomotives for Amtrak's fleet. That's the backbone of their diesel locomotive fleet. 
   To force Amtrak to rush into applying some not-yet proven technology would vitiate the warranties, would increase the cost, would subject Amtrak having to absorb all the costs instead of GE, the locomotive engine producer, absorbing the costs. 
   Again, I say we are very accommodating on this committee. We want good ideas. We would have welcomed the gentleman's ideas in the fashioning of the legislation. In fact, if this had been a forthwith motion, we could have accepted it with an amendment to include biodiesel fuel, soybean-based fuel. 
   But the way it's fashioned simply sidetracks the very good bill, the extraordinary progress we have made with bringing passenger high-speed rail service to all of America. This is a transformational moment, this Amtrak legislation, a transformational moment in American transportation to bring our country into the first world of intercity high-speed passenger rail service, to make changes in the way Amtrak operates, to invite the private sector in to be a partner in fashioning a future for Amtrak. 
   Don't sidetrack it with this frivolous motion that comes way late in the process and is not serious at all in its purpose. If it were serious at all in its purpose, it would have come to the committee, we would have done something about it, we would have included this language earlier on in the bill. 
   Oppose the motion.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 845, as amended, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the Everglades National Park. 
   Former Florida Governor Reubin Askew once stated, ``We must build a peace in south Florida--a peace between the people and their place, between the natural environment and man-made settlement, between the creek and the canal, between the works of man and the life of mankind itself.'' 
   Indeed, the natural areas surrounding and encompassing Everglades National Park represent the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States featuring slow-moving freshwater. The Everglades are naturally unique and provide tremendous benefits to south Florida in many capacities, but the park is also one of the most endangered national parks in our country. 
   The Park totals more than 1 million acres, and the Everglade ecosystem itself encompasses 3 million acres of wetlands. More than 1 million visitors come to the Everglades each year, learning of the Everglades environmental importance while igniting the State's tourism industry. 
   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has a long history of oversight of the Everglades restoration. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007, P.L. 110-114, authorized the first three projects in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project--Picayune Strand, Indian River Lagoon, and the Site 1 Impoundment Project. Support for provisions like these was so strong that this Congress overrode the President's veto of the bill by a vote of 381-40, an overwhelming majority of the House of Representatives. 
   We must continue to take action to preserve and protect this treasured wetland. This resolution reminds us of this precious natural resource, and I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to the resolution.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 354, recognizing the year 2007 as the official 50th anniversary celebration of the beginnings of marinas, power production, recreation, and boating on Lake Sidney Lanier, Georgia. 
   Lake Lanier is named after Sidney Clopton Lanier, a poet and musician who was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1842. After participating in battle during the Civil War, and being captured and imprisoned in Point Lookout, Maryland, Mr. Lanier contracted tuberculosis, which would affect him for the rest of his life. 
   Mr. Lanier's life was one of practicality and beauty: while he practiced law to support his wife and four children, he was also the first flutist in the Peabody Orchestra in Baltimore, Maryland, and an accomplished poet. The Lake was named after Mr. Lanier because of the way he positively portrayed the Chattahoochee River in his poetry. 
   In fact, Lake Lanier itself is a symbol of both practicality and beauty. It provides crucial flood control, protecting approximately $2 billion worth of property in the surrounding area. Similarly, on June 16, 1957--50 years ago this week--Buford Dam began producing power for the first time. Hydropower continues to flow from these waters to this day. 
   Although the lake is one of 464 lakes constructed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it has won the annual award for ``best operated lake'' for three separate years: 1990, 1997, and 2002. 
   While the flood control, water supply, and power production role of Lake Lanier may be critical to the continuing livelihood of the communities in the surrounding area, the lake also provides beautiful scenery and recreational opportunities that local citizens and visiting tourists enjoy. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that more than 7.5 million people visit the 692 miles of lake shoreline each year. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in recognizing the 50th anniversary of Lake Lanier.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2011, a bill to designate the Federal building and United States Courthouse in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, as the ``George Howard, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse''. 
   Judge George Howard, Jr. was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, on May 13, 1924. He began his service to our Nation at the age of 18 when he was drafted into military service during World War II. Judge Howard served with distinction in the United States Navy with the Construction Battalion--or the ``Seabees''--in the South Pacific. 
   After completing his military service, Judge George Howard, Jr. returned to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and re-enrolled in high school to complete his high school education. Upon graduating from high school, Judge Howard attended the pre-law program at Lincoln University in Missouri and graduated with honors. Judge Howard subsequently attended the University of Arkansas School of Law. He was the first African-American student to live on campus in the newly desegregated campus dormitories. He earned his law degree in 1954. 
   After graduating from law school, Judge Howard began a long, illustrious, and trailblazing legal career in his home State of Arkansas. In the 1950s, Judge Howard started a private law practice and devoted his energies to representing those whose voices would not otherwise be heard. He subsequently served on the Arkansas State Claims Commission, the Arkansas Court of Appeals, and the Arkansas Supreme Court. In 1980, President Carter appointed Judge Howard to the U.S. District Court, Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas. Judge Howard was Arkansas' first African-American Federal judge. 
   Through his pursuit of legal and racial equality, and his exemplary career in public service, Judge Howard helped to pave the way for other African-Americans to pursue careers in law and public service. From his time as a private attorney, to his service as President of the State Council of Branches of the National Association of Colored People, NAACP, Judge Brown's judicial ideals were grounded in the fundamental belief of justice for all. 
   Judge Howard passed away on April 21, 2007, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, at the age of 82. In honor of Judge George Howard, Jr.'s outstanding contributions to the State of Arkansas, the Federal judiciary, and his distinguished legal career, it is both fitting and proper to designate the courthouse located at in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, the ``George Howard, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse''. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2011.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume 
   For me, today is a very fulfilling, as well as nostalgic, moment to move this bill to designate the Federal building and the U.S. courthouse and customhouse in Duluth for Judge Gerald W. Heaney. 
   He was appointed judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on November 3, 1966. He took senior status in December 31, 1988; finally retired last August after 40 years on the bench. But that is only part of the story. 
   Gerald Heaney was born January 29, 1918, in Goodhue, a rural community in southeastern Minnesota. He grew up in a farming community, learned the values of rural America, went to my college which I attended many years later, College of St. Thomas, where he graduated and went on to the University of Minnesota where he got his law degree in 1941, but then started a new chapter in the life of Gerald Heaney. 
   He enlisted in the Army in World War II. He was trained as a United States Army Ranger, and he was on the landing craft at 6:30 in the morning on Omaha Beach in Normandy. 
   I interviewed Judge Heaney for the Library of Congress project on World War II veterans. They are attempting at the Library to get the personal views of those who participated in World War II, and he told this story: 
   ``We were all herded into the landing craft. At 6:30 we arrived close to the beach. We could not quite get into the beach because of the obstacles that the Germans had placed under water and also had proximity bombs that would blow up ships. They were having trouble getting the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then,'' said Judge Heaney, ``that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, and I looked up and said, we are not going out that door; everybody over the side.'' 
   How many lives he saved we will never know, but they got into water that was too deep for them to touch the bottom. They tried to swim. They were sinking. They all cut off their backpacks loaded with their food and supplemental ammunition and made it to the shore. 
   I was privileged to be in the group of Speaker HASTERT on the 60th anniversary of D-Day and stood at that beach, at that shoreline, and looked up at where the German gun implacements were located. It is an awesome crossfire site, fearsome. 
   Men were cut down right and left as they crawled and inched their way up. By 3:30 in the afternoon, they had made progress of just about a mile, circled around the German guns, which was their objective, and with hand grenades and other explosives, explosive packs, took out the German gun implacements, making that segment of the beach safer for more landings. 
   By then they were out of ammunition. Judge Heaney said, I said to my men, and there were only a few of us left, we will go back to the beach; they will have landed supplies, and we can be replenished. So they turned around, and he stopped and choked and said, and that is when I saw the carnage, thousands killed. 
   But they returned, got supplemental ammunition, went back up that beachhead, and their job was to then circle around La Pointe du Hoc, which is a straight, rocky cliff. Rangers are going to scale La Pointe du Hoc from below, and Heaney and his Ranger group were to distract the Germans, take out the gunnery and make it safe, and they did. They attacked. They took out powerful German machine gun implacements and long-range artillery. 
   For that heroism at La Pointe du Hoc, Judge Heaney was awarded the Silver Star, the second highest award our Government gives to our military personnel, but that was not the end. They continued all across France and into Germany. 
   By 1945, they had gotten to the Elbe, and there the British units, Russian units and American units met, but they postponed the formal meeting until the following morning where they would have a flag-raising ceremony. And as Judge Heaney said, he looked over, and the Russians had a flag, the British had a flag; he said, where is ours? They did not have a flag. No one had thought to bring a flag. They just fought their way courageously across Europe. 
   So Judge Heaney, Gerald Heaney, by then Captain Heaney, went into the village nearby and bought red, white and blue cloth and found seamstresses in the village who could sew that into an American flag with 48 stars at the time. He still has that flag. He brought it with him for the Labor Day celebration this year at Park Point in Duluth, and there was not a dry eye in the crowd. 
   That is the man, that is the courage, that is the strength. He went on to be appointed a U.S. circuit court judge by Lyndon Johnson, and displaying the same courage that he showed for his country in defense of liberty and freedom, he presided over the case to desegregate the St. Louis school system. He wrote the opinion and has written a book about not only the opinion, but the 20 years that he presided over the continuing desegregation of the St. Louis schools in his capacity as circuit court judge. It is entitled, ``Unending Struggle. The Long Road to an Equal Education in St. Louis,'' with Dr. Susan Uchitelle, who was a law clerk for Judge Heaney. 
   He writes, Our involvement in the St. Louis public school case over a period of 18 years convinced us that, after  having recused ourselves from further participation in the case, that we should write a history of education in St. Louis. Much has been written about education during the slave years, 1820 to 1865. No one has attempted to pull together the rich material written over the period from 1820 to the 1980s. 
   It is all compiled in this remarkable document of how one court case changed the lives of children, of generations of children, of an entire community, made life better for not only African Americans but all citizens living in St. Louis.     
   I know that as I have traveled to that city from time to time to meet people, Gerald Heaney is nearly revered. He is enormously respected. His courage and standing and his steadfastness, just as he pursued the German forces across France and Germany, he pursued justice in the name of all of our fellow citizens as a sitting judge. 
   It is most fitting that we should designate the courthouse where he spent a great deal of his office hours. Although his cases were heard in St. Louis, in the courthouse there, his office hours were in the Federal building and the courthouse and customhouse in Duluth, a venerable facility that was built during the Depression years and, like Judge Heaney's work, will withstand the test of time for generations to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I want to say, once again, what a great privilege this is to author this legislation, bring it from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which I have the honor to chair, and bring it to the House floor and pay tribute to a truly great heroic American who served his country in war, in peace, on the bench and in the hearts of our fellow citizens.  
   In addition to my statement on the Floor today, I want to include in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD this passage from ``Unending Struggle: The Long Road to an Equal Education in St. Louis'' by Judge Gerald W. Heaney and Dr. Susan Uchitelle:   
   Unless additional resources are provided to the St. Louis public schools, they will fail, leading to a demand by some parents for alternative educational opportunities. . . 
   Excellent public schools are essential in a democracy. Experience has demonstrated that urban city schools educate and will continue to educate most school-age children. Moreover, public schools have an obligation to educate all children--rich and poor, black, brown, and white, gifted or special. Unless children are well educated and well trained, they will be unable to take their place as full participants in our vibrant democracy. 
   Segregated housing, a long history of discrimination in education and employment, and the historic lack of opportunity for African Americans to participate fully and equally in all aspects of life make the task ahead a challenging one.   
   This is but one simple passage from the works of Judge Heaney. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 187. 
   H.R. 187 is a bill to designate the federal building and United States Courthouse located at 515 West First St., Duluth, Minnesota as Judge ``Gerald W. Heaney Federal Building and United States Courthouse and Customhouse.'' Gerald Heaney was appointed Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on November 3, 1966. He took senior status on December 31, 1988, and retired on August 31, 2006, after over 40 years of distinguished service to his country and the citizens of Minnesota. I rise in strong support of this bill. 
   Judge Heaney was born on January 29, 1918 in Goodhue, a rural community in the southeastern part of Minnesota. As a child growing up in a farming community Judge Heaney learned the value of a close family, honesty, and hard work. These qualities have marked not only his personal life but also his life as a public servant. He was educated at the College of St. Thomas, St. Paul, and received his law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1941. 
   Gerry Heaney is a decorated WorId War II veteran. He was a member of the distinguished Army Ranger Battalion and participated in the historic D-Day landing at Normandy. He was awarded the Silver Star for extraordinary bravery in the battle of La Pointe du Hoc in Normandy. He also received a Bronze Star and five battle stars. 
   At the end of the war Judge Heaney returned home and entered private practice in Duluth. During that time he was instrumental in improving the state education system, and served on the board of regents for the University of Minnesota. He was instrumental in helping develop for the Duluth school system the same pay scale for both men and women. 
   In 1966 he was appointed by President Johnson to the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals. In that capacity he has been a champion in protecting the rights of the disadvantaged. He was devoted to making sure that every person had an equal opportunity for an education, a job, and a home. He firmly believes the poor, the less educated, and less advantaged deserve the protection of the Constitution. 
   As a hard working, well prepared, and fair minded jurist he left his legal imprimatur on school desegregation cases, bankruptcy law, prisoner treatment, and social security law. 
   His public service is discerned by industry, brilliance, and scholarly excellence. His compassion and dedication to those of us who are the most disadvantaged is unparalled. 
   Judge Heaney is most deserving of this honor. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill will repeal a prohibition on the use of Federal transit funds for tunneling in certain areas for construction of the San Fernando Valley Metro Rail project in Southern California. 
   Many of us can remember the tragedy over 20 years ago caused by an explosion due to the buildup of methane gas, which ignited after accumulating over a long period of time, on the Third Street Corridor in the Wilshire-Fairfax District of Los Angeles. It just rocked the entire area. The explosion damaged a building structure, injured 22 people. A preliminary investigation pointed to the ignition of underground pockets of pressurized gas. 
   The incident raised a great many safety concerns related to tunneling in the area to build the Metro Rail system. The Los Angeles City Council created a task force at the time to investigate the explosion to determine the cause of the accident, to make recommendations to avoid further incidents. 
   The results of the investigation identified two methane risk zones to assure that the safety concerns on construction of that segment of the Metro Rail were fully addressed. A provision was included in the fiscal year 1986 transportation appropriations bill to prohibit the use of Federal funds until safety concerns had been properly addressed. 
   The gentleman who took that cause to the committee, to the House, the gentleman from California, my colleague, we were elected in the same year, 1974, Mr. Waxman, has been vigilant on this issue and vigorous in his pursuit of safety for the people of Los Angeles County. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman).

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself 4 1/2 minutes and rise in strong support of H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. 
   It has been a long time coming to this point. We have labored within the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for at least 11 years, maybe just a few months longer than that, to bring forth a bill to replenish the State revolving loan funds so that municipalities can continue the work of aggressively expanding their capacity to handle wastewater, treat that wastewater, return it to the receiving waters in good quality. 
   We have been delayed over the last 6 Congresses, not by unwillingness within our Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, but because of external factors within the House. Now that those external factors have been removed, we are bringing this bill to the floor with good and sustained bipartisan support. I appreciate very much the support of Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer scheduling this legislation early on in the session; and I particularly appreciate the participation and cooperation of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), our ranking member, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources for the long participation that we have had and the splendid agreement and working relationship we had between our staffs on the Democratic and Republican sides, with one notable exception that will be debated at length here and which we debated extensively in subcommittee and full committee. 
   I especially want to express my great appreciation to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson). For years now, she has worked as our ranking member on the Water Resources Subcommittee, learned the issues, mastered the subject matter, and is now Chair of the Water Resources Subcommittee and has played a leading role in bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   The bill started out as $20 billion to replenish State revolving loan funds; but due to concerns by the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office, we scaled the legislation back to a $14 billion bill, paying for it through an additional revenue source, as within the authority of this committee. The CBO has said that municipalities in raising municipal bonds that are tax exempt will cause a loss in revenue to the Treasury, and, therefore, the revenue in this bill has to be offset by another source. We have done that in a bipartisan agreement, and this bill is at $14 billion, fully paid for. We will not have the debate that we have had on two other bills that were extraneous to the subject matter because we have covered this issue. 
   Unfortunately, the administration has steadily reduced funding for the State revolving loan fund over the past several years, and in the budget request for 2008 has a $200 million reduction, down to $687.5 million. That is totally unacceptable. 
   There was a time when we were investing $6 billion a year in Federal funds, matched by State and local dollars, to build sewage treatment facilities, raise them to tertiary treatment, removing nutrients, adding oxygen, returning clean water to the receiving waters. We are not doing that any longer. We are not keeping pace with the pressure on the Nation's water and wastewater systems nor our sewage treatment systems. 
   The only debate that we really have is, What shall be the wages paid to those who work on building these facilities? And I listened with great interest and concern to the debate on the rule. The manager of the rule said that cities will start looking to Washington for these projects to take care of their water system needs. That is almost the same language that Dwight Eisenhower used in 1960 to veto the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments when he said: Pollution is a uniquely local blight. Federal involvement will only impede local efforts at cleanup. 
   That was wrong then, it is wrong now, it was wrong when Richard Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972. 
   We have had a partnership of State and local government. They have invested billions of dollars at the local level. We need to continue that partnership into the future. This bill will do that. 
   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

And I appreciate the gentleman's kind words about my service. 
   I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak).

   Madam Chairman, I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished Republican leader on the committee, Mr. Mica. Mr. DeFazio was referring to a mandate upon cities to improve their sewage treatment facilities, not to a mandate in this act. 
   Secondly, in our committee report, the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says H.R. 720 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on State, local, or Tribal governments. So I can only assume the gentleman is making a statement of hyperbole, rather than a fact.

   Again, I express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the ranking member on the full committee, and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker), who I have the greatest respect for, and I recall his distinguished and authoritative presentation during the committee tour post-Katrina at Baton Rouge where the gentleman had a mastery of the facts of the issues at hand, and we stood in solidarity and we do stand in solidarity on this legislation. 
   We have one difference of opinion. That is why we have a legislative body and a process through which to work these issues out, and as the late Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, said very thoughtfully many years ago, something like 60 years ago, We can agree to disagree without being disagreeable, and that is the manner in which I hope we will continue to conduct issues before our committee. 
   I just think back to the time when I worked, when I was in college working in construction jobs, and I was working as a truck driver and cement puddler for 50 cents below what was a union wage, below what was a standard wage, because this wasn't a unionized job, and I don't want to see that happen to anybody.

   Twenty years ago, March 3, 1987, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Clinger, the Republican ranking member on the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, which I had the privilege of chairing, and I held a hearing on this very subject, on the U.S.-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. We observed the agreement was signed in 1972 and renewed in 1978. 
   It continues in perpetuity, but we observed, while progress has been made, while the Cuyahoga River no longer catches on fire, the bad news is that a great deal of that improvement is due to economic decline in the steel industry. Industries that formerly dumped waste are no longer operating. 
   Fish are able to survive, but now they are surviving with cancers. Some areas of the lakes where birds are deformed because of Toxiphene and Dieldrin. Mr. Clinger and I both observed the real test of our commitment is yet to come. Will we break out of the planning and research cycle, which we have failed to do in the case of acid rain, and begin to implement protective measures which would strengthen the laws and effective remedial programs. 
   Some of that has been accomplished in the ensuing years. The gentleman's proposal would move us further along during this Great Lakes week that we are celebrating on Capitol Hill with our colleagues throughout the Great Lakes States. The amendment would require the Administrator of EPA, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the governor of Canada, to identify problems with the wastewater infrastructure on both sides of the Great Lakes, develop recommendations for increased notification of overflows and increased cooperation. Those are all good and valid and important initiatives which we have pursued in a bipartisan effort within our committee for, as I said, over 20 years. 
   The gentleman's district is the bridge between the upper Lake Superior and the lower lakes. The St. Mary's River moves 130,000 cubic feet per second, and he is astutely vigilant over water quality. 
   I think accepting this amendment will move the purpose of intergovernmental cooperation further along, and I assure the gentlemen on both sides, I will work with the Committee on Foreign Affairs to fashion this bill, this language further as we go to conference with the other body.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   This is an issue on which there is a genuine disagreement on both sides of the aisle and within the committee, and a deeply felt view on each side. 
   I think it is instructive, however, to look at the history of Davis-Bacon, which originated, actually, in 1927, on Long Island, a district represented by Congressman Robert L. Bacon, Republican of New York, who said wages are fair, and there has been no difficulty in the buildings grades between employer and employee for quite some time. But he was upset when a contractor came to him who had bid on construction of a federally funded hospital on Long Island and noted that the contract was awarded to an Alabama firm that came into Long Island with low-wage workers, whom he housed in tents on the property and underbid local contractors. 
   He said, that's not right, you have to help us stop these underbidding contractors from coming in and taking away local jobs. He, Bacon, introduced legislation that did not inflate wages, as he said, artificially, but assured that government respects the existing local standard. 
   A few years, a year later, the Secretary of Labor, James Davis, supported that bill. By March 3, 1931, Davis had left labor, got elected to the Senate, and the two of them authored this legislation. It was signed into law March 3, 1931, by President Herbert Hoover.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   In 1930, as the Davis-Bacon language was being shaped and debated in the Senate and in the House, Senator Davis of Pennsylvania, a Republican, and Congressman Bacon of New York, a Republican, said: The essence is this. Is the government willing, for the sake of the lowest bidder, to break down all labor standards and have its work done by the cheapest labor that can be secured and shipped from State to State? 
   When the bill was taken up at the Senate, Robert LeFollette, chairman of the Committee on Manufacturers, the Republican chairman of the committee, noted that practices were not only disturbing to labor but disturbing to the business community as well and urged that this measure be speedily enacted. It does not require the government to establish new wage scales; it merely gives the government power to require its contractors to pay the prevailing wage scales in the vicinity of the building projects. 
   Now, the prevailing wage scale in the vicinity of building projects in Louisiana, for example, an average common laborer gets $7.86 an hour. That is the prevailing wage. I don't know how you save any more money by going lower than $7.86 an hour. The average well driller in Louisiana is paid $11.40 an hour. I don't know how you get much lower than that in order to save money. 
   This Davis-Bacon provision is prevailing, not union wage. If I could, I would support in law the union wage, but we are not doing that. It is the prevailing local wage. I urge defeat of the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chair, this language reinforces or adds an additional provision to section 305(b) of the act before us today. Section 602(b) reaffirms the deadlines, goals and requirements of the Clean Water Act, fishable-swimmable water goals. Section 603 deals with the affordability. And we have already prioritized in the basic legislation targeting funds to lower income communities to ensure that they get their fair share. This language will just take that affordability language one step further and impose on States the requirement to give full, fair consideration to projects that deal with immediate needs rather than adding capacity before you consider adding capacity.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, the gentleman's amendment would include an additional requirement on State revolving loans on authorities not previously part of the State Revolving Loan Fund Program. The provision of section 204(a)(6) of the Clean Water Act is a longstanding title II construction grants requirement. We don't have construction grants any more, since 1987, that does require ``full and open bid competition for the construction of publicly owned treatment works.'' 
   The gentleman's amendment would prohibit financial assistance recipients from including bid specs that contain proprietary, exclusionary, discriminatory requirements, other than those based on performance. 
   I have asked the staff to review and I, myself, have reviewed the Federal acquisition regulations which are generic to the Federal Government. These requirements for full and open bid competition are in place. They do generically apply to provisions of the Clean Water Act. 
   However, I think it is appropriate and is not confusing, nor is it in opposition to the Federal acquisition regulations, to include the gentleman's amendment. Therefore, we accept the gentleman's amendment.

   The amendment would implement the change to the elevation pool before completion of the environmental assessment. 
   We have the Water Resources Development Act ready, I think, to move within 2 weeks or so. I would like to join with the gentleman in  ascertaining from the Corps the status of that environmental assessment and then determining, depending on where they stand with it, we could either dispense with the EIS and include the gentleman's provision in our WRDA bill, or if it is ready to go, if the EIS is completed, we will not have to take that action. 
   But I assure you, one way or another, we will find a way for the gentleman's, the language to be included in WRDA before we bring it to the House floor.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   And, again, I want to reaffirm my colloquy with the gentleman, that we will work with him and with the gentleman from Louisiana and the gentleman from Florida on shaping appropriate language to include this study provision pilot project for the Lake Barkley initiative as we move forward with WRDA. 
   Madam Chair, as we come to the conclusion of this legislation, I want to express again my heartfelt appreciation to Ranking Member Mica, who has worked with us on all the measures, including how we would shape the debate on Davis-Bacon, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker) who has been most forthcoming and accommodating. We have, again, reached agreement on major provisions on this legislation. The gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) who has devoted years of her service on the committee to this issue, is now the Chair. 
   But those who really bear the burden of the work are our staff: Ryan Seiger, Beth Goldstein, Rod Hall, Mike Brain on our side; John Anderson, Jonathan Pawlow, Geoff Bowman, Tim Lundquist on the Republican side, and our full committee staff, our brilliant leader, David Heymsfeld, our chief counsel, Ward McCarragher, Sharon Barkeloo, Jen Walsh, Erik Hansen, and on the minority side, Jim Coon, Charlie Ziegler, Fraser Verrusio and Jason Rosa.     
   We also greatly appreciate the work from Legislative Counsel's Office, Dave Mendelsohn and Curt Haensel. Dave Mendelsohn has been here almost as long as I have, and he is really good. 
   We have a superb staff. They have worked together diligently on this legislation. We owe them a deep and longstanding debt of gratitude for their superb work, especially Ryan Seiger, who stayed up many late hours at night fashioning all the responses to the many questions I have had on this legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, after a very thoughtful, productive, and constructive debate on the bill and the amendments thereto, I yield back the balance of my time.

In this case, this language was not available to our majority members on the committee until just prior to when it was offered on the floor. 
   I inquire of the offeror his explanation on page 2, subsection (4), ``A crime listed in chapter 113B of title 18,'' what is that language? Can the gentleman read me the language of the U.S. Code?

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time. Reclaiming my time, the gentleman has not been able to answer my question. 
   I was the author in our committee of the Port Security Act, along with the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young). We had carefully crafted language that set standards for security clearance for maritime workers. We did not have any reference to chapter 113B. The transportation security workers card has not yet been issued. The readers for that card have not yet been put in place by the Transportation Security Administration. 
   The standards, apart from this provision that the gentleman lists here, generally are covered in the background checks required in our Port Security Act for maritime workers. 
   But this is very vague language in number (4). It is specific to a provision of U.S. Code, but the gentleman cannot explain to me what it is. 
   And then ``(5), A crime involving a transportation security incident,'' dropping down to subsection ``(A) is a security incident resulting in a significant loss of life,'' we don't know where that language comes from. 
   Mr. Speaker, we should not amend the Port Security Act on 30 seconds notice. There may be very good and valid provisions of this motion to recommit that we might very well be in support of, but only in due course, only in a proper forum. To come up here 30 seconds before the motion is offered and lay on the body this language without having the backup for it I think is inappropriate, and I object to the process. I object to the procedure that has been followed, not perhaps to the substance of it. 
   Our committee is fully prepared to deal with this issue in due course and give it full and thorough consideration, but not here, not in this context.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is a national memorial to a fallen President, one of the most loved, respected, and admired Presidents of our history. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was initially proposed as a national cultural center during the tenure of President Dwight Eisenhower. It moved its way through the legislative process and took firm root and forward progress during the brief tenure of President John F. Kennedy and then sprang forward under President Lyndon Johnson. It has become an extraordinary cultural center for the Nation. 
   Our committee has had the good fortune to hold jurisdiction over the physical facility of the Kennedy Center and of its operations, and we have managed that responsibility very thoroughly and very effectively through the tenure of many previous Chairs of this committee. In particular, in the current context I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), who is the Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, for her leadership on this bill as well as our ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Mica, and the subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Graves, and Mr. Petri who is here today managing the bill on the Republican side, for crafting what has historically been in our committee bipartisan legislation dealing with the operations of the Kennedy Center. 
   Since opening its doors September 8, 1971, the Kennedy Center has continued each year to gain national and international renown for its performance arts, programming, and for the education programs at the Kennedy Center that reach out across the Nation so that high schools, colleges, and universities can participate by satellite and live performances or recorded performances at the Kennedy Center. 
   The center has crossed the threshold in the last couple of years by performing over 3,000 performances, hosting millions of theater-goers, visitors, tourists. But of all of those accomplishments, none matches the international outreach of the Kennedy Center under President Michael Kaiser. In the aftermath of the Iraq war, Michael Kaiser personally traveled to Iraq to meet with the musicians of the Iraqi symphony who were, in many cases, without instruments or had somehow sheltered them from the post-invasion trauma, and secured instruments for them and secured funding to travel the Iraqi symphony to the Kennedy Center to perform jointly with the National Symphony Orchestra, an extraordinary gesture of international brotherhood and sisterhood of the arts. 
   President Kaiser has traveled to Africa, to the Far East, Japan, China to mobilize interest in the arts, joint initiatives with the Kennedy Center, and has actually established programs of arts management in countries well beyond our shores to help particularly Third World countries where arts have fallen well below the threshold of national concerns where people are more concerned about starvation and disease than they are about the arts. President Michael Kaiser has raised the threshold, raised the vision of arts managers in other countries, and created a great future for the arts wherever he has traveled. 
   Over the past decade, a great deal of work at the Kennedy Center has focused on life safety and accessibility projects. Many of those are completed. The Kennedy Center's capital building plan, which was updated earlier this year, emphasizes facility infrastructure. Over the next several years, the Kennedy Center will focus on replacing mechanical and electrical systems that consist of original equipment that is well beyond its useful life or should be replaced by more efficient equipment, and we provide authority for that work to continue to prevent failure or breakdown of essential equipment. 
   The bill before us today authorizes appropriations for maintenance and capital projects of the Kennedy Center for fiscal years 2008 to 2010. For maintenance, repair, and security, the bill authorizes $64.5 million over 3 years. For capital projects, the bill authorizes $56.2 million through 2010. Those are numbers derived from the Kennedy  Center's 2006-2007 Comprehensive Building Plan, which has worked its way through the administrative review process within the administration and the Office of Management and Budget. 
   The bill also authorizes the center to study, plan, design and build a photovoltaic system on the four-acre main roof of the Kennedy Center. That is 140,000 square feet of roof space. A preliminary estimate shows that a photovoltaic system would cost $6 million to build, but would save $10 million over the next 25 years. It is part of the plan of this committee to redirect the energy consumption of our portfolio of Federal civilian office space, for which this committee has responsibility of some 367 million square feet of Federal civilian office space that we can cut down on the electricity bill of $5.8 billion a year at those facilities. We could save the taxpayers a lot of money, and we could save the environment an awful lot of damage by converting to photovoltaic use. A good place to start is with the arts and with the Kennedy Center and with the Department of Energy building in the recently House-passed version of the energy conservation bill. 
   So this initiative that we require would in itself be a tribute to President Kennedy's longstanding well-known views of environmental protection. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This legislation will ensure that the motor coach accessibility regulations promulgated by Department of Transportation under the Americans with Disabilities Act are vigorously monitored and actively enforced. A leader in this initiative was our committee colleague, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio). His leadership on this initiative is of long standing, his commitment to the handicapped community is well known, and he has been a forceful and vigorous advocate, as has Mr. Petri, who is the ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee, and served previously as Chair of the Surface Subcommittee. He is well familiar with the issues presented to our fellow citizens saddled with disabilities.  
   Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the DOT was required to adopt a final rule, which they did in 1998, requiring vehicle modifications for intercity buses, charter buses, tour buses, to accommodate individuals with disabilities. 
   But regulations have to be enforced to be effective, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has interpreted the motor carrier statute in a way that limits the agency's ability to assess compliance with over-the-road bus accessibility regulations. 
   That's not acceptable. We have had quite some discussion about that issue. And, in fact, a new version of the American with Disabilities Act was introduced earlier this year by our majority leader, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) and cosponsored and co-initiated by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) who has long been a strong advocate for legislation supporting the needs of the handicapped community. 
   Relying simply on Department of Justice enforcement authority, the FMCSA felt it couldn't take action on violations of its own regulations by over-the-road bus companies. In the U.S. Court of Appeals case, Peter Pan Bus Lines and Bonanza Acquisition, the court rejected the claim that the agency does not have discretion to interpret the law to allow consideration of compliance with ADA. The case was sent back to FMCSA for further review in February of this year. 
   But again the agency dragged its feet. After 8 months of failure to act, the FMCSA responded to the court in October, but only after Chairman DeFazio and I expressed our intent to legislate a solution if the agency did not provide its own plans to comply with ADA requirements. 
   In the decision, FMCSA defends its position that the agency does not have the authority to enforce the American with Disabilities Act and said, ``If Congress intended to expand the fitness criteria to include compliance with additional DOT regulations such as 49 CFR part 37, it presumably would have said so.'' 
   Well, we are saying so today. If that's what they think they need, then we are going to make sure they have the authority to do it. There is no excuse for any further delay. 
   Specifically, the pending bill amends section 13902 of title 49 of U.S. Code to prohibit the Federal Motor Carrier Administration from granting registration authority to motor carrier providing over-the-road bus transportation where that carrier is not willing or able to comply with the accessibility requirements under subpart H of part 37 of title 49, CFR. 
   This bill will allow DOT to put compliance with ADA on a par with compliance with safety requirements, further clarifying in this legislation that the Secretary may suspend, amend or revoke a motor carrier's registration in the event of willful failure to comply with ADA. And bill further requires DOT and the Justice Department to enter into a memorandum of understanding to clearly define each department's roles and responsibilities in enforcing the provisions of ADA. This was not a new initiative. Some years ago when I chaired the Economic Development Subcommittee and the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. Klinger, and I required similar memorandum of understanding among three departments who were failing to carry out their responsibility on transportation overlaps. 
   So what we are doing here in this legislation has precedence of over 20 years ago in a similar issue of transportation. 
   ADA was enacted 17 years ago. We need to keep our vigilance over its enforcement, make sure that the agency is doing its responsibility to oversight and that the carriers are complying with their responsibility to all members of the traveling public. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will raise the retirement age for commercial airline pilots from age 60 to age 65. For more than three generations, pilots have been required to retire from commercial aviation when they reach age 60. There have been a number of changes in both the medical condition, the medical examination of pilots, recurring, more intensive medical reviews, that argue for a longer period of time for the age of retirement of commercial pilots. There have been  changes in the economics of aviation that have rearranged the retirement plans for pilots in midstream, in some cases wiping out retirement plans altogether, in other cases totally restructuring them, which two factors argue for a change in the retirement age. 
   We responded to those changed circumstances in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, which moved from our committee through the House on September 20th. It was our hope that the other body would move ahead with an FAA reauthorization bill. That hasn't happened. 
   As time went on and the other body continued to be locked in whatever difficulties they encounter, there were increasing appeals from pilots, from airlines, from the traveling public, frankly, to separate out this provision from our reauthorization bill. I was very reluctant to do that, in hopes that we would use this provision, among others, as leverage and as part of our integral package on FAA reauthorization. Clearly, the other body is not going to even move a bill through committee in the waning days of this session. It then became clear to me there was no reason further to delay action on this matter of justice for commercial airline pilots. 
   Furthermore, the FAA forecasts an increase in airline travel to more than 1 billion passengers in the next 7 to 8 years, and retirements among airline pilots are up 173 percent. We are seeing almost every day five or more of the most senior experienced pilots retiring. We ought to provide this relief. We ought to separate this provision out from our House-passed bill and provide a measure of justice and economic relief for pilots. 
   In the reauthorization bill, the provisions that we included for this age relief are drawn out and included in H.R. 4343. One, pilots who have reached age 60, to serve beyond that time frame, must have a first-class medical certificate renewed every 6 months. Second, they must continue to participate in FAA pilot training and qualification programs to ensure acceptable levels of skill and judgment. Three, they must submit to a line check every 6 months. That assures that pilots who are continuing to serve beyond age 60 will meet all the threshold requirements of skill, capability, alertness and responsiveness to their ever-increasingly difficult challenges. 
   In addition, our bill requires international flights leaving the U.S. to have at least one pilot under the age of 60. That applies international standards in the flight deck. This requirement would terminate if the international standard were changed. 
   The increased pilot age limit is not retroactive, however, and does not allow pilots who reached age 60 prior to enactment to serve as commercial pilots unless they are employed by an air carrier as a required flight deck crew member, or are newly hired on after the date of enactment without credit for prior service. 
   I believe that moving this legislation now, if we can also get it through the other body in quick order, will have a profound and personal effect on the lives of thousands of pilots who otherwise would be forced to retire. We have had consensus within the committee on this issue. The question is whether we should take it out at this time or leave it in the House-passed bill for consideration later in conference with the other body. 
   Clearly, as I said earlier, we are not going to get to that point, and Mr. Costello has advocated strongly that we consider at an appropriate time moving the legislation separately, and he is the Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee. Mr. Mica has been a strong advocate for early action on this legislation, apart from our authorization bill. Mr. Petri, the same, and other pilot members of our committee have similarly advocated. 
   So I think we move ahead with a broad consensus measure that should pass the House readily and hopefully the other body as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I do want to join Mr. Mica in sending compliments to Mr. Hayes, a member of our committee, who has been a strong advocate, even before we began our reauthorization legislation, for changing the age. But he along with other pilots on the committee, Mr. Boswell, Mr. Salazar, formed a united front and a bipartisan front well before we began our work on the FAA reauthorization bill. So we give them joint credit and appreciation for their support from this initiative. 
   It is our hope in passing this bill today that the other body will act quickly on it without much ado. That would be a great initiative, a great sign of progress at these penultimate hours of the first session of the 110th Congress.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself such time as I may consume to express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Wisconsin and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica). Mr. Petri has been wonderful to work with on this issue and to acknowledge an extraordinary achievement that the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) has spelled out in such graphic detail, and well said. 
   Barrington Irving did something truly extraordinary in flying around the world. But more important than the flight was the inspiration he has served and has become for young people, young people younger than him, or his age, who are fascinated with aviation and with aerospace itself. 
   Mr. Irving established a nonprofit educational organization, created a travel blog for the purpose of empowering young people and encouraging minorities, in particular, to pursue careers in aviation. His around-the-world trip earned widespread community support and sponsorship, but more importantly as an inspiration for young people to aspire to something greater than themselves for the future.  
   The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) cited the initial investment in the college program that stimulated young Barrington's interest and facilitated his skill in aviation, and appropriately mentioned our former colleague, Bill Lehman, who served as Chair of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, and that brought a very touching memory back to me as I worked with then-Chairman Lehman in my capacity as Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee to resolve a number of complex issues in aviation. He was always gracious and caring and helpful and astute. I appreciate the gentleman's reference. 
   And let us move quickly to enact this legislation to acknowledge Barrington Antonio Irving's contribution to aviation, an inspiration to young people.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding time rather than turf. And the gentleman is quite right. I greatly appreciate the participation that we had, the partnership between our two committees. And I want to compliment the gentleman from Massachusetts and the Chair of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert), and the Republican members on our committee who have all worked together to see to it that this critical piece of legislation dealing with addressing the housing needs still outstanding, 18 months after Katrina and Rita devastated the gulf coast, to see that they can be carried through, that we can deliver the needs of the people in the entire gulf coast area. 
   We have worked out some concerns that we had on our side through the jurisdiction our committee has over FEMA to address the problems of people to ensure that we provide new assistance and speed up the help from the existing programs, make sure that that money flows more vigorously to the people and readily. 
   I have been engaged with FEMA since the mid-1980s when the then-Reagan administration proposed to revise funding under, what we now call FEMA was then Civil Defense, as to reduce to zero the Federal support for almost every disaster except a very few, and then there would be only 25 percent Federal support. 
   With the help of a Member of Congress from Pennsylvania, a Republican, and the ranking Republican on my Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, we exposed this failing to the public. We rallied support, created the framework which is today FEMA, and that Member of Congress from Pennsylvania then introduced a bill we developed in committee. We got it enacted. And many years later, he was selected by President Bush to be the first Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge. So bipartisanship on this issue goes back very deeply to the very beginning of this issue. 
   And one of the things I wanted to talk about that was initiated through our committee and with the Clinton administration was the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, critical funds that help get homes and properties out of storms' way, saving properties, saving lives. Over $7 billion has been invested under FEMA in the mitigation program to over 1,000 federally declared disasters. 
   An independent study of the Institute for Business and Home Safety found: ``Mitigation produces significant net benefits to society as a whole, to individuals, States and communities in reduced future losses and savings to the Federal Treasury in future reduced tax revenues and hazard-related expenditures. For every dollar spent on mitigation,'' the study found, ``the society saves an average of $7.'' 
   After the 1993 Mississippi River floods, Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds removed homes, removed entire communities from the flood zone. After tornadoes, Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds created tornado-safe rooms in what is known as ``Tornado Alley.'' We have used those funds to great benefit. 
   Unfortunately, the Bush administration, early on, proposed to terminate hazard mitigation funds. We restore that authority in this and previous legislation and will do so in subsequent legislation. But this is not the last bill in the House to deal with the devastation caused by Katrina, and I hope by the end of next week we will bring the Water Resources Development Act to the House floor from our committee, some nearly $14 billion in flood control, navigation, environmental restoration projects. Of long standing, over 6 years we have waited in our committee to bring this bill to the floor. We passed it three times. It has never gotten through the Senate; never gotten to conference over it and, again, a bipartisan bill. But it will begin reconstruction of the coastal Louisiana flood plain and of the Mississippi area flood plain. It will authorize construction of the Morganza Flood Control Project in central Louisiana to protect people from flood damage and from future hurricanes. It will close the Mississippi River gulf outlet that the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Jefferson) well understands caused salt water intrusion and destruction of the marsh land that was the buffering and protective entity against floods that came from Lake Borne in and overtopped St. Bernard Parish, washed homes away. We will close that off and rebuild it. 
   So I would cite those few things. This bill is critically important. It deals with very specific aspects. All of us have to continue working together to craft the needed protection, both by restoring wetlands and putting in place the structures of flood control and wind surge damage to the gulf area and particularly to the New Orleans area. I have been there many, many times; and I can say that it is disheartening to see how slow the progress is coming along in certain areas of that city, those that desperately need it. 
   This bill, and I take my hat off to the chairman of the Financial Services Committee and to the gentlewoman from California for leading the charge and making a powerful statement that we are going to address these needs, this bill will effectively do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (SAVING ENERGY THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6052, the Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act of 2008. 
   The purpose of the bill, very simply stated, is to promote energy savings for all Americans by increasing use of public transportation throughout this country, a fact that has been a need, let us say, that has been driven home dramatically by $4 a gallon oil and gasoline prices since Memorial Day, and I thank the Speaker and majority leader for making time for us to bring this bill to the House Floor. 
   Basic law of economics is that the price of gas is a two-part equation: Supply and demand. Demand is a critical factor in the cost of oil, and decreasing demand is one of the most immediate ways we can attack the high cost of gasoline prices. And our fellow citizens understand this. They are making choices. They have been making choices for several years. 
   Over the last 3 years, in particular, there has been growth of 1 million new riders a day on public transportation systems across America, for 375 million new transit trips nationwide last year, a total of 10.3 billion transit trips throughout the country. 
   There was a time when New York City accounted for 60 percent of all transit trips in the United States, but no longer. In the last 3 years, New York's share of transit ridership nationwide has slipped to 38 percent, not because New Yorkers are riding transit less; they are riding more. But more Americans have found their way to public transportation, and increasingly in droves since the skyrocketing price of gasoline. 
   Transit systems throughout the United States have found every new transit project, every new light rail project has more than tripled its original projections of ridership nationwide. 
   Innovative cities like Denver under then-Mayor Wellington Webb, said: Ride our transit system free in the center city. Keep your pollution out of the center city. Ride the transit system free. And it has been an enormous boost and benefit to the city of Denver. 
   I can and I will cite some very specific ridership improvements in my own State. In Minneapolis, the Hiawatha light rail, 20 years in the waiting, finally was constructed; ridership opened, and 9 months later, 10 months ahead of schedule, they achieved their 10 millionth rider. Dramatic improvements. 
   Seattle, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Francisco all have similar increases in transit ridership. The Charlotte Area Transit System recently opened a new light rail line. They have increased ridership 34 percent from February of last year to February of this year. 
   CalTran, the commuter rail line that serves the San Francisco Peninsula and Santa Clara Valley, set a record for average weekday ridership in February of this year with a 9.3 percent increase over last year. 
   The South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, my good friend, the ranking member, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) knows well, posted a rise of more than 20 percent ridership from Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach in March and April of this year as compared to last year. 
   Americans are making the choice. They have decided. We need to help them with that choice. And the bill before us will make a huge step in that direction. 
   This legislation provides substantial support for States and public transportation agencies increasing incentives for computers to make their choice to ride transit: 1.7 billion, 2 years for transit agencies that are reducing transit fares or expanding the services to meet the needs of growing transit commuters. We increase the Federal share for clean fuel and alternative fuel transit bus, ferry, and locomotive related equipment or facilities, helping transit agencies become more fuel efficient.     
   In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, the increased Federal share for these activities will go from 90 percent to 100 percent of the net capital cost of the project. 
   We also provide authority to extend the Federal transit pass benefit program which has operated over the past few years on a pilot basis in the National Capital Region and in a few selected areas throughout the country. After evaluating the transit pass program, the U.S. Department of Transportation recommended that it be expanded nationwide. We do that in this legislation. There was an executive order signed by President Clinton in 2000 that launched this initiative. It was supported in the SAFETEA legislation. The 3-year pilot program under our legislation would be substantially expanded nationwide. 
   The Department of Transportation says that expanding this program will implement their own department recommendation by giving more Federal employees incentives to choose transit options. And we also create a pilot program to allow the funding expended by private providers of public transportation for van pools to acquire the vans to be used as their non-Federal share for matching Federal transit funds in five community pilot projects. Under current law, only public funds can be used as the local match. This pilot program will induce private funds to participate in the van pooling initiative. 
   I would observe we had a very successful van pooling program in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in the mid-1980s when companies like 3M, Control Data, and Minneapolis Honeywell bought the vans for their employees and provided a fuel subsidy and encouraged their employees to join together. The vans were full. The program was successful. It cut down on congestion in the greater metropolitan Twin City area, and reduced cost for all of the riders. We should do that nationally, and we provide further authority to make that change and to take that initiative.

It is about moving people more efficiently with lower costs and lower energy consumption. I think we do ourselves service by sticking to the subject matter at hand.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   The gentleman made a thoughtful observation, and I'm sure the gentleman is aware that there already is a tax exemption in Federal code for private sector employers and employees. But that doesn't apply to the Federal government or to other governmental agencies because they don't have a tax. So the transit benefit for Federal employees is a matter that we could do within the context of the current bill. 
   In the longer term, next year, when we consider the longer-term authorization, the gentleman's suggestion would be an appropriate matter for consideration. We will have better figures which we're requesting now from public agencies for those matters.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I listened with great interest to the gentleman's ruminations on a wide range of subjects. I won't comment on those that reach beyond the subject matter at hand, our transit bill. I do reaffirm my appreciation for his partnership in bringing this bill to the floor. 
   This is an important piece of legislation. In the larger scheme of the billions of dollars, $125 billion a year, that we need to be investing in all levels of government in our surface transportation system, this $1.7 billion is a relatively small step, but it moves us in the direction of a mode shift in transportation to 10 percent of all trips by transit. If we made just that little step in America, we would save the equivalent of all the oil we import from Saudi Arabia. That is what we can do. It's within our grasp now. We don't need a research program. We don't need a man-on-the-moon program. We just need the funding to invest in what is already at hand: solid, responsible, reliable, effective transportation systems for the public to use instead of getting in their private vehicle.     
   Had the administration in 2003 concurred in a $375 billion transportation program for the next 6 years, as its own Department of Transportation recommended, and as Mr. Young, then-chairman of the committee, and I introduced, we would have been far better positioned today than we are now. 
   Instead, that administration proposed only a $5.5 billion funding flat out over the 6 years for transit. We wound up with $10 billion in the SAFETEA legislation over the 5 years of the legislation. But we have to do far better than that, and this bill moves us in the right direction.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The amendment clarifies that transit agencies may use these new grants to offset the increased cost of fuel to transit agencies. Every penny additional to the cost of diesel and gasoline fuel, public transportation faces a cost of $7.6 million. 
   The amendment clarifies that intercity bus service is an eligible activity under the bill. The intercity bus provision was included in the version of the bill that passed the House last year, but through a drafting error, was left out when we reintroduced it. We correct that mistake. 
   Many transit agencies, rural and small urban centers alike, contract with intercity bus providers for more mobility. So it's important that these services are eligible for the new grants created by this bill. 
   We clarify that transit agencies may use the new transit grants to offset the increased cost of maintenance as they struggle to cope with recordbreaking ridership increases. I have been to transit agency maintenance centers and found very skilled workmen welding new pieces of steel in the support structures of buses that have rusted out over years of use. 
   Transit buses are now, on average, 12 to 14 years. They should be replacing them every 7 to 8 years. We are seeing a million miles of ridership on a bus a year. They need to upgrade and improve and continue their maintenance. 
   Many transit agencies are reporting surges in ridership and, at the same time, difficulty maintaining existing services because of higher fuel prices. So we are providing funding to all those transit agencies to respond to their current needs. 
   I want to thank several of our colleagues for agreeing to have their amendments incorporated into the manager's amendment to expedite consideration of the bill: The gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) whose amendment helps transit fleets become more fuel efficient by providing more funding for clean fuel or alternative fuel vehicle-related equipment or facilities; the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) whose amendment creates a national consumer awareness program to educate the public on environmental, energy, and economic benefits of public transportation; and the Jackson-Lee amendment that clarifies that public transportation stakeholders should engage and involve local communities in the education and promotion of public transportation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I do so simply to express my support for the amendment, on which Mr. Mica and I have agreed, but also to point out that in the body of the bill there are protections and safeguards for the proper use of the transit pass authority provided in the additional funding increase in the monthly limit for the transit benefit. There have been reports of abuse of transit passes in the past year. An investigation by the Office of Inspector General revealed that there are some abuses. 
   We have provided protection against such abuses in the base of the bill underlying this legislation. I wanted to point that out for those who may have been concerned to assure that the committee has taken appropriate steps to assure that transit passes are used by the person for whom intended and for the purpose for which intended.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington was very thoughtfully expressed and explained, and I commend the gentleman on his statement, very thoughtfully done, to increase the Federal share for parking facilities that serve commuter bus routes. 
   The Transportation Research Board has addressed this issue and evaluated the accessibility of transit services to suburban commuters, and they have found that acceptance and use of transit services are clearly influenced by the availability, convenience, and cost of commuter parking at transit stations and park-and-ride lots, quoting from the report. 
   States that have successful long-distance suburban-to-central business district commuter bus operations found that increasing the use of commuter bus services and park-and-ride facilities is directly influenced by the availability of those park-and-ride services. 
   Increasing the Federal share to 100 percent would create additional incentives for transit systems to build more of these facilities to serve the communities, and I really appreciate the initiative of the gentleman. 
   In his reference to Microsoft, I know that Microsoft in past years has purchased in the range of 13,000 fares a year for its employees to ride the Sounder and other transit options in Seattle. It is very commendable of a company to engage in that kind of service to its workers, to encourage them to get to work in a better frame of mind, to help the environment, and to serve the public need.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I rise in support of the amendment which I am certain arises out of the experience of the New Hampshire Department of Transportation which has a program helping commuters find alternatives to riding alone. The State of North Carolina has created RIDE NC to do the same thing. 
   I just want to observe that this bill pending before the House now is the 110th bill reported from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to the House, 110th bill in the 110th Congress. We have completed action on 63 bills and resolutions including 29 bills enacted into law; in addition to that, eight concurrent resolutions and 26 House resolutions. That's a remarkable record of bipartisan participation for which I express my appreciation to the gentleman from Florida. On all of these, we've had bipartisan support.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Then the gentleman is not serious about this motion, and this is a sham motion. 
   Under the language ``promptly,'' we would not be able to consider this legislation again until well after the 4th of July recess of the Congress, which the gentleman fully understands. 
   The substance of the motion is well-intentioned. However, under title 23 and title 49 of the U.S. Transportation Code, school buses are specifically not eligible for public funds out of the Highway Trust Fund, nor would they be under the provisions of the bill that is before us. 
   Since the gentleman from Oregon objects to accepting his language and making that change in Federal law to make school buses eligible, then I would suggest that he come back to the committee at an appropriate time, we're going to continue hearings--we've had 22 hearings already in the Surface Transportation Subcommittee last year and this year on the future of transportation--and make the case for such a provision to be included in the authorization that we will have next year. We would certainly be delighted to hear the gentleman's case for this provision and to perfect it. But as it stands, this ``promptly'' simply kills the transit expansion funding that we provide in the underlying bill. 
   Therefore, because the gentleman objected to my unanimous consent request, I say the motion is not offered in good faith, not offered with good intentions. It is a sham motion, and we should defeat it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I thought we spent most of last night on amendments to kill the operating account of Amtrak and then kill the capital account of Amtrak. The only thing that wasn't offered was burial funds for Amtrak. But now comes the dismemberment amendment. 
   This route is part of a national passenger rail system. It's the only route connecting California to the Southwest, to the gulf, and on to Florida. This route touches one-third of the Nation's population. Many of the people living in those communities along this route have no other passenger transportation, mass transportation alternative than the Sunset Limited. 
   The gentleman from Texas talked about the time it takes to traverse that route. What he didn't say is that most of that time is spent by Amtrak on sidings waiting for freight rail trains to pass. Now, if you give passenger rail priority consideration on those routes, those trains would pass very quickly. We could cut a substantial, maybe a third or more of the time out of their passenger service. 
   What's happening here is, going back to the origins of Amtrak, when freight rail companies started as passenger rail service found they could make more money carrying freight than passengers, they were carrying U.S. mail on the overnight railway post office, they petitioned to the Interstate Commerce Commission to discontinue passenger service when U.S. Postal Service moved to carrying their mail by truck. 
   So one by one, they discontinued passenger rail service, dumped it all in the hands of the Federal Government. 
   We need to keep Amtrak servicing. Defeat this amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Without a great deal of enthusiasm, I oppose the amendment of the gentleman, although I supported it last year. But this year we have in place in our FAA reauthorization bill a process that will cure the problem the gentleman has brought to the House floor. 
   Frankly, the FAA has not been responsive to the gentleman from Florida. Worse, they have been dismissive. They have not consulted with him or with his airport or with the community that he represents. 
   In the legislation that the gentleman from Illinois, chairman of the subcommittee and I have fashioned with bipartisan support, we have a process in place. Once our authorization bill is enacted, that will require the FAA to consult with communities, with airport authorities, with the Members of Congress on these consolidation proposals and report back to the Congress. We'll get another crack at it. We'll do it in due course and due appropriate process, not the way FAA is proposing to do it, certainly not with a base-closing commission approach that the administration offered to the Congress. 
   Just today the gentleman from Illinois held a hearing on the wretched conditions in a great many of our air traffic control facilities, which the FAA is ignoring under the guise of modernization of air traffic control system. 
   Well, come on. That's not happening for another 5 to 10 years. Meanwhile, people have to sit there and suffer through mold and rain and mildew and, in northern Minnesota, in my district in Duluth, snow coming through the windows, or flies in the air traffic control tower in the winter.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia metropolitan area has the most complex air space in the United States; that means, the most complex air space in the world. Four of the Nation's five airports reporting the worst on-time performance are Newark, LaGuardia, JFK and Philadelphia. Holding time is five times greater than any place in the country. 
   The percentage of flights that arrive in Newark over an hour late is 15 percent of all the fights. Seventy-five percent of the Nation's domestic and international flights are affected by delays and inefficiencies in the New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia air space, no matter where they're going. 
   You have international flights arriving from the transatlantic corridor. You have flights arriving from Canada, flights arriving from South America, flights arriving transcontinental from the United States on the east coast merging into this area. Sure, there are awful noise impacts upon residents, but the redesign will save noise to some 619,000 people, shifting it elsewhere, shifting it away from other people. FAA has held over 120 public meetings since they began the process of the air space redesign. This will save 20 percent of delays and 12 million minutes a year. This is important to the Nation, not just to this region.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, has worked tirelessly on the issue of cross-border trucking in this Congress and I commend his determination in probing the details of the Administration's plans to open the U.S.-Mexico border to truck traffic. 
   While I strongly support this amendment, I am at the same time extremely disappointed that Congress must take yet another step to compel the Administration to do the right thing and protect the safety of the American people. 
   Members of Congress face growing frustration with the Administration's clear desire to  open the U.S.-Mexico border at any cost, with minimal regard for the safety of the traveling public, and little attention to the concerns raised by the House and Senate. Today's amendment is the culmination of a mounting effort to ensure safety and to hold the U.S. Department of Transportation (``DOT'') accountable as the Department reveals its plans for opening our nation's southern border. 
   On February 23, 2007, Secretary of Transportation Peters announced the start of a one-year pilot program to grant 100 Mexico-domiciled trucking companies unrestricted access to U.S. roads, beyond the commercial zones at the U.S.-Mexico border. DOT has acknowledged that this pilot program is the first step to full border opening. This announcement had generated a groundswell of opposition. 
   Since February, Congress has tried to shed some light on this pilot program. On March 13, 2007, the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit held an oversight hearing on the pilot program. Chairman DeFazio and I have asked the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation to review the proposed pilot program for compliance with all applicable motor carrier safety and hazardous materials laws and regulations. 
   On March 29, 2007, Representative BOYDA introduced H.R. 1773, the Safe American Roads Act of 2007, of which I am a proud sponsor. This legislation limits the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to unilaterally open the United States-Mexico border to truck and bus traffic under the ruse of a hasty pilot program. Instead the bill provides the U.S. with an opportunity to test, evaluate, and learn from the impacts of allowing Mexico-domiciled trucks on our highways, but only once a strict set of prerequisites are met and only under a specific set of conditions. 
   At the beginning of May, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure ordered the bill reported to the House by a vote of 66-0. The House passed the bill on May 15, 2007, by an overwhelming vote of 411-3. 
   The message to Secretary Peters has been clear: proceed with caution and do not open the border to Mexico-domiciled trucks until sufficient checks are in place to ensure that they meet U.S. motor carrier safety laws. Yet, DOT opposes the safeguards included in H.R 1773. It continues to charge ahead, and intends to start the pilot program as early as next month. 
   The agency seems to have little regard for what findings or shortcomings may come to light in the reviews required to date by Congress. DOT has been unwilling to make changes to its plans to bring the proposed pilot program in line with the strict criteria strongly supported by the House. As a result, we must take this action today to bring this program to a standstill. 
   I continue to question whether DOT is truly ready to open the border, and whether adequate systems are in place to make sure Mexican carriers meet our strict federal safety requirements. It is well-established that Mexican law does not require many fundamental elements of highway safety that are required for U.S. vehicles and drivers, including hours-of-service restrictions, drug and alcohol testing, and commercial driver's licensing requirements. Data collection issues and tracking violations of Mexican drivers while operating in the U.S. also remains a challenge. 
   The United States is bound to live up to its commitments under the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA''). However, nothing in NAFTA suggests that we must allow Mexico-domiciled motor carriers to operate throughout the U.S. if they pose a safety hazard to our citizens. 
   Launching a cross-border pilot program represents a major shift in transportation policy. It is the responsibility of DOT to ensure that any program that allows trucks from Mexico to enter the United States must be conducted with the safety of the American people as the highest priority. We must not forget this in a rush to open the border. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the DeFazio amendment

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Parking facilities are eligible under a number of our surface transportation programs, funded out of the Highway Trust Fund. In the SAFETEA-LU legislation, we authorize funding for parking facilities to encourage commuters to park their vehicles and use public transportation. 
   Congestion is a growing problem all across this country. It costs us $68 billion a year. The more cars we can get off the roadway and more people use public transportation, the better off citizens are in their drive patterns. And the parking facilities encourage carpooling, vanpooling and use of light rail and commuter rail and local bus transit operations. 
   Furthermore, because they're funded with Highway Trust Fund moneys, no fees can be charged at these parking facilities, so they're not revenue-generating activities. 
   Furthermore, we have imposed very strict standards for highway safety for long-haul truckers. Hours of service have been limited so that roadways will be safer, but those long-haul truckers, working long hours, need safe places where they can rest.     
   The hours of service limitation requires them to stay off the roadway before they become fatigued. That's why we have parking facilities to accommodate over-the-road truck drivers, as well as passenger vehicle drivers. 
   So the parking facilities we provide under the SAFETEA-LU national transportation program is in the best public interest, in the interest of public safety and in the interest of roadway safety, to the best interest of the driving public, reduces congestion, and we ought not to take this broad brush stroke and strike the spending. 
   No, we carefully considered these issues in the course of fashioning the SAFETEA-LU in the House and the Senate and conference and on this House floor. Let's keep existing policy in place and defeat this misguided amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, we are gathered here to commemorate two extraordinary events. Forty years ago, the Cuyahoga River en route to Lake Erie caught fire and galvanized the attention of a Nation and the action of Congress to strengthen the Federal Water Pollution Control Act resulting in the Clean Water Act of 1972. 
   You would have thought that the Nation had learned its lesson with the Cuyahoga River incident and the other tragedies that befell the Great Lakes over the years; the invasion of lamprey eel and subsequent nonindigenous invasive species, and other tragedies, such as industrial dumping, that nearly resulted in the death of Lake Erie. 
   But here we are gathered, 40 years later, to face a report from the Chicago Tribune that the regulators in the State of Indiana have given permission for BP, one of the world's largest energy companies, to release half more ammonia than they are and one-third more sludge into Lake Michigan each day. 
   The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) sprang to the defense of Lake Michigan, as have numerous of our colleagues that are gathered here with us today, and mobilized a resolution that we have under consideration today.

   We're not here reacting to and debating a newspaper story. The report of the planned dumping of highly toxic, highly residual elements into Lake Michigan has been documented. We will have a hearing in the Subcommittee on Water Resources in due course, but this is an emergency that called out and cried out for immediate action to lay a line down in front of the State of Indiana and British Petroleum to let them know that their proposed indifference, slap in the face, to clean water, this precious resource, will not be tolerated by the American public. 
   They will go ahead and build their refinery, but on that property, they have plenty of room for appropriate disposal of these wastes. They ought to know, they ought to understand, water is more precious than oil. 
   The slow flushing action of Lake Michigan, it'll be 300 years before water turns over in that lake. It means that whatever they put in that lake is going to stay there for generations to come. They know that. So does the State of Indiana. Protect that lake. 
   There are alternatives to dumping every colossal waste that industry can sum up into the lake. There are other alternatives. They have to explore those alternatives.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1137. This resolution acknowledges and celebrates Public Works Week, which this year is celebrated the week of May 18 through May 24. 
   We celebrate National Public Works Week for a full week each year during the month of May. This week honors the many public works professionals--those individuals who design, build, operate, maintain, and protect transportation systems, water supply infrastructure, sewage and refuse disposal systems, public buildings, and other structures and facilities that are vital to our Nation. H. Res. 1137 pays tribute to these professionals. 
   Public works do exactly that--they allow our public to work, and they keep our country safe. Our industries and communities rely on railroads, highways, airports, and public transit to travel, and our government conducts business in public works buildings across this Nation. 
   Towns and cities around the country are serviced by necessary systems for sewage and waste disposal, as well as water supply for our homes, businesses, and crops. Pipelines safely transport natural gas and hazardous liquids over millions of miles throughout the country. 
   It is appropriate to designate a week to recognize these entities and those who work for them and the public good. Public works are often not recognized until problems are encountered. As public works professionals work daily to coordinate, design, and maintain our public works, we must also work to fund our country's infrastructure needs, which our so critical to our Nation's economy and its citizens. 
   Last November, this Congress overrode a veto of the Water Resources Development Act (``WRDA'') of 2007 by an overwhelming margin (361-54), showcasing the desires of the American people for renewed investment in our infrastructure. In contrast to this action, President Bush failed to include any projects authorized by WRDA in the fiscal year 2009 budget. 
   The House of Representatives has passed three additional water infrastructure bills: H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act of 2007; H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007; and H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to promptly take action on similar legislation. 
   On August 1, 2007, on the same evening that the House passed the WRDA Conference Report, the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapsed during rush hour traffic in my home State of Minnesota. Of the 597,340 U.S. highway bridges, 73,784 are structurally deficient and 80,317 are functionally obsolete. This tragic event further highlighted the public works investment needs that our Nation faces. 
   Last week, the leadership of this committee introduced a bill to revitalize the Amtrak intercity passenger rail system. 
   I continue to vigorously support our country's public works, and I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (FEDERAL REAL PROPERTY DISPOSAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5787, as amended, and commend Chairman Waxman for taking steps to address Federal excess and surplus property issues. 
   H.R. 5787 authorizes the Administrator of General Services to obligate funds to pay for a variety of services that must be conducted before a property can be declared excess to the needs of the reporting agency. These services include title searches, site remediation, site security, and other activities necessary for a property to be declared excess. Further, the bill authorizes the General Services Administration to be reimbursed by the agency for these expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the property. The net proceeds are retained by the donor agency and can be used only for disposal-related activities. 
   I want to thank Chairman Waxman for recognizing the concerns of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure regarding the eligible uses of these net proceeds, and for working to address these concerns. The committee was particularly concerned that agencies, using this new-found source of revenue, would engage in real property activities that would otherwise need to go through the prospectus process and thus the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The version of H.R. 5787 being considered today specifically addresses the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's concerns by prohibiting the use of proceeds for activities or projects subject to the prospectus process and other requirements of section 3307 title 40, United States Code. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 5787, as amended, and support placing the General Services Administration back in a leadership role for property disposal activities of the Federal Government.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 309, authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run. 
   The District of Columbia Special Olympics is the premier event in this region that highlights the athletic accomplishments of children and young adults with disabilities. We all owe a special thanks to the tenacity to Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her family for exceptional work on behalf of persons with disabilities. 
   Law enforcement officers, who are part of the extensive volunteer network that support the games, carry the Olympic torch across the Capitol Grounds through the District of Columbia to Catholic University. The event will be open to the public and free of charge. The event sponsors will work with the Capitol Police Board to ensure all rules and regulations are followed. 
   These games are a wonderful expression of inclusiveness and a confirmation of individual contribution. I enthusiastically support this resolution and the very worthwhile endeavor of the Special Olympics. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (MOTORCYCLE SAFETY AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 339, as amended, a resolution that supports the goals of Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month and that brings much needed attention to motorcycle safety on our nation's roadways. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) and the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. GIFFORDS) for bringing this important issue to the forefront. 
   With warmer weather arriving, our nation's highways will once again experience a large increase in motorcycle traffic across the country. Motorcycles represent a valuable component of the transportation network in our nation. In 2005 there were over 6.2 million registered motorcycles in the United States. Motorcycles continue to grow in popularity each year with registrations increasing by over 60 percent from 1998 to 2005. 
   Motorcycles are a fuel-efficient and congestion-decreasing mode of transportation and are a valuable component of our transportation system. This increasingly popular mode of transportation also requires greater attention to the safety concerns associated with riding. Because of their smaller size, motorcyclists are often hidden in a vehicle's blind spot. Public awareness of motorcycle safety benefits everyone that uses our nation's roadways, not just motorcyclists, because it can lead to a decrease in car-motorcycle crashes. 
   The statistics on motorcycle fatalities and injuries each year further illustrate the importance of public awareness and the need for greater education of all roadway users. In 2006, motorcycle rider fatalities increased for the ninth straight year. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (``NHTSA''), between 1996 and 2006, there were 35,546 motorcyclist fatalities and 708,000 motorcyclist injuries on U.S. roadways. In 2006 there were 4,810 motorcycle fatalities and 88,000 injuries, up from 2,161 fatalities and 55,000 injuries in 1996. 
   Per vehicle mile traveled, motorcyclists are approximately 37 times more likely than passenger car occupants to die in a motor vehicle traffic crash and 8 times more likely to be injured. Further, an estimated 137,000 motorcyclists have been killed since the enactment of the Highway Safety and National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. A NHTSA-funded study--the ``Motorcycle Accident Cause Factors and Identification of Countermeasures Study''--found that in approximately two-thirds of fatal car-motorcycle crashes, the driver of the car was at fault. 
   Throughout Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month, riders are encouraged to become educated on the importance of following the rules of the roadway, being alert to other drivers, and always wearing protective gear such as a helmet. NHTSA estimates that helmets saved 1,658 motorcyclists' lives in 2006, and that 752 more lives could have been saved if the motorcyclists involved in fatal non-helmeted crashes had worn helmets.  
   Mr. Speaker, these striking statistics paint a very clear portrait of the need to decrease motorcycle crashes through licensing, rider training, education, enforcement, personal responsibility, and increased public awareness. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to the resolution, as amended.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF BICYCLING IN TRANSPORTATION AND RECREATION -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 305. H. Con. Res. 305 recognizes the important role bicycling plays in both transportation and recreation, and is an appropriate resolution to consider in May, which has been designated as National Bike Month. This resolution expresses the support of the Congress for a number of policies that would encourage cycling and advance our intermodal transportation network. I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for introducing this resolution. 
   Our transportation choices can play a key role in solving the serious problems of worsening congestion and air quality, the obesity epidemic that afflicts millions of children and adults, and the threat of global climate change. To achieve these solutions, our transportation planning must be refocused to accommodate users of environmentally-friendly and healthy modes of transportation such as cycling. My experience has taught me that people want to get out of their cars; they want to lead active and healthy lifestyles; and they want to do their part to protect our environment. By providing the appropriate infrastructure, we can give people the option to make smart travel choices. 
   H. Con. Res. 305 expresses the support of the Congress for a number of common sense approaches to increase bicycling and to protect cyclists, including: 
   Setting goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled, VMT, to increase the safety of cyclists, and encouraging and allowing people to bicycle for short trips; 
   Spending highway safety funds proportionally to the percentage of cyclist and pedestrian deaths; 
   Implementing ``complete streets'' policies that take into account the needs of all users when designing a road; 
   Providing flexibility for nonmotorized transportation project delivery while upholding environmental standards; 
   Creating bicycle-friendly Federal lands and developing a national bike route system; 
   Continuing and strengthening Federal programs that support nonmotorized transportation and increasing intermodalism; and 
   Building upon the ``Greening the Capitol'' initiative, which includes a bike sharing program  and sets an example for employers to be bicycle-friendly. 
   In 1994, the U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT, issued the National Bicycling and Walking Study, establishing a national goal of doubling the percentage of trips made by foot and bicycle while simultaneously reducing crashes involving the two modes by ten percent. It also created a now-defunct interagency task force to coordinate these efforts across Federal agencies. This resolution encourages DOT to re-establish this task force with representatives from all appropriate Federal agencies. 
   H. Con. Res. 305 provides a framework for some of the choices that the Congress will need to make in the upcoming surface transportation authorization legislation. The Federal Government has a long history of visionary leadership in the transportation field, and we need to again show the leadership necessary to encourage mode shift, reduce congestion, and create a cleaner and healthier society. We must work to build a transportation system that enhances our quality of life and gives users modal choice, and bicycle infrastructure needs to be a part of this. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (DESIGNATING A PORTION OF INTERSTATE ROUTE 395 LOCATED IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, AS ``CAL RIPKEN WAY'' -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3218, to designate a portion of Interstate 395 located in Baltimore, MD, as ``Cal Ripken Way.'' 
   Cal Ripken, Jr. was not only a remarkable baseball player, he was an outstanding role model for the youth of America. He exhibited the utmost in professionalism and sportsmanship in every aspect of his life. 
   Cal Ripken, Jr. was known to many as the ``Iron Man'' for tirelessly overcoming many minor injuries to always be in the lineup for his team and for the fans. He took the field for the Baltimore Orioles on May 30, 1982 and did not miss a game until September 19, 1998. On September 6, 1995, millions of fans worldwide tuned in to watch Cal Ripken, Jr. surpass Lou Gehrig for the most consecutive games played, at 2,131 games. He ended his streak having played in 2,632 consecutive games. 
   By the time he retired from professional baseball, in October 2001, Cal Ripken had played 21 seasons with the Baltimore Orioles. During that time, Mr. Ripken had broken the team's record for career games played, at bats, runs, hits, doubles, homeruns, RBIs, total bases, and walks. He is a member of Major League Baseball's exclusive 3,000 hit club. 
   Cal Ripken stuck with his team through the good years and the bad years with a level of professionalism rare in sports today. He was a favorite among fans and holds the record for most All-Star votes received by any single player. He was voted to play in the All-Star game 19 times, and won the game's Most Valuable Player, MVP, honor twice. On Thursday, July 26, 2007, Cal Ripken, Jr. was inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY, with the third highest percentage of votes ever received. 
   After his storied baseball career, Cal Ripken, Jr. continues to make a difference in his community an across the country. Along with his brother Billy, he formed the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation to give underprivileged children the opportunity to attend baseball camps around the country and to learn his beloved game. 
   Between 2001 and 2004, Ripken served as commissioner of the White House Tee Ball Initiative, in which he worked to promote the value of teamwork and volunteerism amongst young players. On April 9, 2007, Ripken announced a partnership with the recently formed ``Reviving Baseball in the Inner City'' program, with the donation of $1 million in cash and equipment from the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3218, to dedicate a portion of our Nation's highway system to commemorate the tremendous career and outstanding leadership of Cal Ripken, Jr.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (HONORING THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS, FIRST RESPONDERS, AND THE CITIZENS OF MINNESOTA FOR THEIR VALIANT EFFORTS IN RESPONDING TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE INTERSTATE ROUTE 35W MISSISSIPPI RIVER BRIDGE -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 606, introduced by my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON). I extend my gratitude for his work to introduce this resolution and bring it forth for consideration on the House floor. 
   On August 1, 2007, at 6:05 p.m., during the evening rush hour, the bridge on Interstate 35 W spanning the Mississippi River suddenly collapsed. The eight-lane, steel truss bridge span carried approximately 140,000 vehicles each day. This horrific catastrophe claimed the lives of 13 people; 123 other individuals were injured. 
   Visions of this tragedy and the destruction left in the wake of the bridge collapse remain etched in our memories. Yet the scenes of the damage have been softened by the touching images of the hundreds of fire fighters, police officers, including the University of Minnesota police, and emergency response personnel that rushed to aid their fellow citizens. The direct actions of these civil servants and citizens immediately following this tragedy are examples of extraordinary courage. 
   The brave men and women who were first on the scene, and remained working around the clock after the collapse, helped to minimize the toll of this tragedy and undoubtedly saved lives. The aftermath of the collapse has also been made easier to bear with the help from over 50 organizations and local governments and a national outpouring of sympathy and prayers. 
   A few months ago, the people of Minnesota suffered a different kind of catastrophe: a raging forest fire. The blaze began on May 5, 2007, in the Gunflint Trail area in far northeastern Minnesota, roared across the Canadian border, and then returned to Minnesota to devastate my district. It consumed nearly 76,000 acres and destroyed 140 structures. Many first responders heeded the call to this fire. The dedicated men and women of the Gunflint Trail Volunteer Fire Department were among the first to arrive on the scene, followed by firefighters and fire departments from across the region. In all, over 1,000 personnel assisted in fighting this blaze. No lives were lost, there were only 11 minor injuries, and 759 structures were saved thanks to the efforts of these responders. 
   The responses to these disasters are just two examples of the countless selfless acts that our Nation's first responders carry out every day simply by doing their job. Twenty-four hours a day, every day of the year, all over this country, when any type of tragedy enters our lives, from a medical emergency facing a neighbor to a large-scale natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other incident, our Nation's emergency responders are the first on the scene to provide professional services, expert help, aid and comfort. These well-trained, highly-skilled individuals are truly on the front lines in preparing for, responding to, and mitigating damages from a variety of hazards. 
   Across the country, the millions of men and women who serve this nation as police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel, including those in Minnesota, place themselves in great danger every day in order to protect each one of us. They deserve our deepest thanks and respect. 
   I stand with Congressman ELLISON in recognizing the outstanding work and effort of the first responders in response to the tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota and laud their unflinching dedication to duty. While we can never adequately express our gratitude to the brave men and women, this resolution is a fitting tribute. 
   I strongly support this resolution and urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND RESTORATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We are very pleased to have the Senate action on the conference report. We can restore to the highway trust fund money that was siphoned off 10 years ago. 
   The discussion of earmarks we have had a dozen times on the House Floor need not be repeated here; it is irrelevant to the issue at hand. We will deal with those matters next year in a subsequent authorization. 
   But the reality of why this legislation is needed is rooted in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century in 1998, when in this Chamber our then chairman, Bud Shuster, and I, as ranking member, negotiated with the Republican leadership of the House, the Speaker, the Chair of the Appropriations Committee, the Chair of the Budget Committee, the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, and with the Clinton administration, the President directly with their Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury, to put firewalls around the highway trust fund to assure that surpluses couldn't be built up as had been done every year since 1968 when it began under Lyndon Johnson, President of the United States, to hold money in reserve and make deficits of that and subsequent Presidencies look less than they actually were. 
   Until 1998, we had a $29 billion surplus in the highway trust fund, taxes paid at the pump by drivers all across the United States but not getting the benefit from it because those monies were held back to make deficits look smaller. So our resolve was to create firewalls around the trust so that couldn't happen in the future. 
   In order to reach that goal held by every private sector entity in the country, by State transportation authorities, and by Members on both sides of the aisle, we came to an agreement in which we had to yield that $29 billion surplus. $8 billion of it went for current account deficit reduction, and the other $21 billion went for long-term debt reduction. That happened on June 26, when President Clinton signed the TEA-21 act into law. I am sure everybody in this Chamber felt a great burden of debt lifted off their shoulders. But none of that money went for highway projects, for bridge projects, or for highway safety or transit needs of this country.     
   It went for long-term and short-term debt and deficit reduction. We knew then, and it was predicted by the Department of Transportation, by OMB, by the Congressional Budget Office that, in time, this would lead to a shortfall in the highway trust fund, and that shortfall will occur this fall, or with a little bit of luck, next spring. 
   The fix is necessary today to repatriate to the highway trust fund those revenues that were taken from it for general revenue purpose use for short-term deficit reduction. That was the folly. That was the gun at the head of the bipartisan leadership of the committee and of the Congress, that we had to make that step, take that step of shifting funds out of the highway trust, in addition to which, we had to agree that the Treasury would not have to pay interest on revenues paid into the trust fund. That resulted in further reduction in revenues in the highway trust fund. 
   So we are, today, repatriating funds back to the highway trust fund that were taken by force majeure of this governance from the trust fund to general revenue purposes, and bringing it back to keep faith with the drivers of this country. That's what's at stake here, and I want everybody to understand. I'm not stretching the truth. I'm just saying, these are the facts of budget life that we are dealing with. And Congress can keep faith with the traveling public by passing this conference report and restoring the trust to the highway trust fund.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time. We've been here before at this precipice, looking into the abyss of uncertainty--of Lockheed, of New York City's financial crisis, of Chrysler and of post-9/11 airlines, perhaps not all of us personally, but we, this body. And in each of those cases where great uncertainty shadowed over this body, we found a way to make the right decision. And in each of those cases, the government was called upon, the Federal Government, to help the private sector, or in the case of New York City, the city, and through it, the private sector. 
   And in each case, our good judgment was rewarded. Lockheed paid off its loan. Chrysler paid off its securitized loan from the Federal Government with interest. The New York City financial crisis was not limited to New York. It spread into every State of this country. And we saved each hometown bank by coming to the rescue of New York City. 
   And I stood here in the well of this House with the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), then the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, to ask this body to look over the horizon to what would happen on Monday if on Friday we didn't propose to rescue the airlines who had been shut down by the Federal Government in a national security interest and provide loan guarantees. 
   And while it stumbled, the proposal stumbled and faltered that evening, it was a commitment to come back the following week and to do it and to do the right thing. And in those negotiations, I remember very well Speaker Hastert.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 352, supporting the goals and ideals of National Public Works Week. 
   Our Nation's public works--which consist of transportation systems, water supply infrastructure, sewage and refuse disposal systems, public buildings, and other structures and facilities--help our country function in an efficient and effective manner. As our public works support our economy, our public health, and our communities' livelihood, we must support the many public works professionals who design, build, operate, maintain, and protect these systems and structures. National Public Works Week is observed for a full week in May each year. 
   House Resolution 352 pays tribute to public works professionals, celebrating their work the week of May 20 through 26, 2007. 
   Without our vast network of rail, highways, airports, and public transit, our industries would not have the global reach that they currently utilize each working day. Without these transportation systems, many tourists would not have the chance to experience the vastly different climates and cultures our Nation has to offer. 
   Without our water supply systems, or our sewage and waste disposal facilities. our communities would not be able to exist and thrive. Simple conveniences that we may take for granted--running water in our homes for cooking and cleaning, and water systems that feed our backyard gardens, as well as our agriculture, factories, and industry--would not be possible without the dedicated work of the public works professionals who keep these facilities moving on a daily basis. 
   Indeed, it is often only when our systems and facilities fail to work consistently that we appreciate their contribution to our daily routines. 
   Infrastructure keeps our country working, but in previous legislative sessions, we have not kept working on our infrastructure. In the ``2006 Status of the Nation's Highways, Bridges, and Transit: Conditions and Performance'' report prepared by the Department of Transportation, the Department confirms that investment in the Nation's highway, bridge, and transit infrastructure has not kept pace with demands on the system. 
   This Congress, we are working to reverse this unjustifiable trend. 
   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has taken our public works needs seriously. Since the start of the 110th Congress, the Committee has shepherded four critical water infrastructure bills through the House: 
   H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act of 2007; H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007; H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007; and H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   It is my hope that this Resolution will reinforce the necessity for our colleagues in the other body to pass similar legislation. It is critical for us to conference these bills without delay, and ask the President to recognize both the needs and the accomplishments of public works and its professionals. 
   I celebrate our country's transportation and infrastructure. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting House Resolution 352, to honor the professionals who provide the backbone for our transportation and infrastructure systems and facilities.

The winner in each of three age divisions wins a trip to the national race in Akron, Ohio. The Washington Soap Box Derby is supported by hundreds of volunteers and parents. 
   The principles of aerodynamics are combined with fun and excitement for all participants and their families in the Greater Washington area. It is an excellent opportunity for parents to have direct involvement in their children's activities. The derby's mission is to provide children with an activity that promotes technical and social skills that will serve them throughout their lives. 
   This year, the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby is scheduled for June 16.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 386, recognizing the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, and other boating safety organizations for their efforts to promote National Safe Boating Week. 
   National Safe Boating Week is really about educating boaters. In 2005, there were 697 boating fatalities in the United States. The leading cause of death in a boating accident is drowning. Of the 491 people that drowned in 2003, almost 90 percent were not wearing a lifejacket. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of these deaths could have been prevent by proper use of a Personal Flotation Device. 
   The Coast Guard Auxiliary, and its 27,000 members, are on our Nation's waterways every day conducting voluntary safe boating examinations and educating the public about safe boating practices. In addition, the Auxiliary conducts harbor patrols, assists in search and rescue and marine environmental protection, and conducts boating safety courses; volunteering more than 2 million hours annually to benefit their fellow boaters. 
   Boating safety organizations, such as the National Safe Boating Council, educate recreational boaters about safety issues. As the summer boating season begins, they have some simple recommendations for boaters: 
   Do wear a Life Jacket. They Float. You Don't. 
   Don't mix alcohol and boating. 
   Do observe the nautical rules-of-the-road. 
   Don't stand in a small boat. 
   Do check the weather forecast before getting underway. 
   Don't overload your boat. 
   Do keep a good lookout. 
   Mr. Speaker, this House should help educate the boating public about prudent safety measures that can help save their lives. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 386 and help bring more attention to the importance of boating safety.

   I also express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) for participating throughout the shaping of this legislation and working constructively for a reasonable counter to the administration's plan. The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) with his ever-judicial manner has helped us shape a very good balance to the allowing of Mexican trucks into the United States. 
   This cross-border pilot program the administration launched is not just a little initiative, something to let pass, it's a major shift in transportation policy. They were intent on opening the border with minimum public notification and at great cost to safety. 
   Despite serious concerns raised by the Congress, by safety advocates in the private sector, by nonprofit organizations, by States who were concerned about Mexican-domiciled trucks coming into the United States, this legislation limits the authority of the Secretary to open the U.S.-Mexican border to trucks coming into the United States. 
   It will not allow a 1-year pilot program as simply a gimmick, a ruse, under which they can allow the border to be opened unilaterally under terms and conditions that the Department or the administration might choose. Instead, we have a strict set of prerequisites, a strict set of conditions. A pilot program of 3 years, 100 motor carriers for Mexico, 1,000 trucks, does not provide blanket authority for 3 years. If the Secretary fails to comply with any provision of the act, the program terminates. 
   We also require the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation, concurrently, while the program is under way, to review and report back to the public, to the Congress, to the Department where there are failures and deviations, if there are any, from the program that we have set in place, especially if Mexican carriers do not meet strict Federal safety requirements. 
   This is not a run, operate, and evaluate. It is operate and concurrently evaluate what the Department is doing, what the Mexican trucks are doing. Are they, in Mexico, requiring fundamental elements of highway safety that U.S. drivers are required to submit to? Do they have hours of service requirements comparable to those in the United States? 
   Mexico does not have a single certified lab to test drivers for drug and alcohol compliance, as our drivers are required to be subjected to. The Inspector General has to verify that every requirement of section 350 of Public Law 107-87, the basic authority under which they propose to operate, has sufficient mechanisms in place to ensure safety, to enforce safety. 
   DOT has to also, under this legislation, provide the public with an opportunity to comment on issues of safety and cabotage, that the trucks that come into the United States and deliver goods to a destination point and carry goods back to Mexico aren't moving goods from one U.S. city to another U.S. city in violation of our cabotage laws. We don't allow it in aviation; we are not going to allow it in trucking. 
   We are living up to our commitments under NAFTA, but we have put in place requirements that are vigorous, protections that are important to protect travelers on our U.S. roads from failures in Mexico. 
   Now, the Department of Transportation has sent up their letter, their statement of policy, in which in one place there is a complaint that this legislation gives the agency ``only 5 days to take action necessary to address adverse findings or terminate the program.'' 
   That's a requirement on safety. If you find an unsafe condition, how much longer than 5 days do you want to allow it to go? How much longer do you want to have an unsafe condition existing on our roads? That's just dead wrong. 
   Then, in another provision, they complain that we, their language says, purporting to require the Secretary of Transportation to submit legislative recommendations to Congress. They submit legislative recommendations to Congress, every executive branch agency. Whether we want them or not, they submit legislative recommendations. We are saying the Secretary may submit. If there are some things they want changed, we invite them to submit their recommendations to the Congress. 
   I simply don't buy that. I think they are sort of a half-hearted statement. 
   This is good legislation, good sound policy. It protects U.S. drivers and allows us to keep commitments under NAFTA, and we will protect American roadways.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   It is very important to move this legislation. The former chairman of our committee, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), introduced this legislation in the 109th Congress, but for various reasons of logjams, legislative logjams, it just didn't make it to the House floor because of scheduling problems of the House. But it is very important for the Alaska Railroad, which is an entity of the State of Alaska, and the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) has several times talked to me about the need to move this bill. We had it all ready to go in the last Congress, as I said, and I am very happy we are able to bring it up early on in this session of the 110th Congress. 
   If looked at on its face, it would be a very simple matter to do, a 78,000 square foot parcel of real property in Anchorage, Alaska, needed for the Alaska Railroad's operations. But as we got into it, the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office raised some scoring issues. So in further review of the matter, we found a way to subject the transfer and the transfer of funds to the appropriation process. That removes the scoring issue. The Administrator of GSA will require the Administrator of the Railroad Corporation to pay fair market value of the property based on highest and best use by an independent appraisal, and that independent appraisal will be commissioned by the Administrator of GSA and will be paid for by the Alaska Railroad Corporation. Then that money will be deposited into the Federal Buildings Fund and the whole exercise will be subject to the appropriation process. That way the interests of the Federal Government are fully protected and the entire transaction will be totally transparent. It is a very good outcome. It benefits the GSA. It benefits the Public Buildings Fund of the Federal Government, and it benefits the Alaska Railroad and the State of Alaska. 
   I know that the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) is very pleased with the outcome, and I want to thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management for his participation through this process and bringing it to a successful conclusion and also the Chair of our subcommittee, Chairwoman Norton. 
   With that, I urge passage of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, Congressman Jim Leach was a very decent, distinguished and thoughtful Member of Congress. He was a learned Member of the body. He's a personal friend. 
   He served this country in many capacities. He began his service as a staff  member for then-Congressman Don Rumsfeld. He went to the State Department in 1968. He served as special assistant to director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. He served in capacities with the United Nations, with the U.S. Advisory Commission on International Education and Cultural Affairs. 
   He served in an advisory capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, rather well-rounded career before being elected to Congress one term after I was elected. 
   He chaired, at one point, the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the Subcommittee on Asian Pacific Affairs, and the Congressional Executive Commission on China. 
   He, along the way, collected a number of honorary degrees. He's the recipient of the Wayne Morris Integrity in Politics Award, the Woodrow Wilson award from Johns Hopkins University, the Adlai Stevenson Award from the United Nations Association, and an award from the Sierra Club, the Edgar Wayburn award. 
   He's now serving on the faculty of Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs as a visiting professor. 
   He's been ably succeeded by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack), and I really congratulate him and the entire Iowa delegation for so graciously and thoughtfully introducing and supporting this bill to honor one of Congress's most respected and well-liked Members. 
   There are rare people who pass through this body and leave with good feelings and with good memories by those of us who continue to serve, and Jim Leach is one of those. It is very appropriate to designate the U.S. courthouse at Davenport, Iowa, in his honor, in his name. 
   And, again, I really express my great admiration to the Iowa delegation for so recognizing this distinguished former Member of Congress. His service in no way takes away from the service of Mr. Loebsack who succeeded him, who is, himself, a distinguished professor, has distinguished himself in the arena of public policy during his college teaching career, and brings that same thoughtfulness and constructiveness to the public policy process that his predecessor did, whom we honor today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and respect the memory of Jim Leach.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 123, which authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run. 
   Thanks to the tenacity to Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her family, thousands of Special Olympians see their self-confidence, self-esteem, and health increase by participating in the Special Olympics. These games highlight the athletic feats of mentally challenged children and young adults. Confidence and self-esteem are the building blocks for these Olympic Games. Better health, coordination, and lasting friendships are the results of participation. 
   The Law Enforcement Torch Run for the Special Olympics is run nationwide by law enforcement officers, leading up to each state's and the national Special Olympics Summer Games. Each year, nearly 50 local and Federal law enforcement agencies in Washington, DC, participate to show their support of the DC Special Olympics. This torch relay event is a traditional part of the opening ceremonies for the Special Olympics. Law enforcement officers, who are part of the extensive volunteer network that supports the games, carry the Olympic torch across the Capitol Grounds through the District of Columbia to Catholic University. The Capitol Police, along with the DC Special Olympics, will participate in the torch run to be held on June 8, 2007. 
   Each year, approximately 2,500 Special Olympians of all ages compete in the DC Special Olympics in more than a dozen events. The event is supported by thousands of volunteers from the District and the region and is attended by thousands more family and friends of Special Olympians. 
   These games are a wonderful expression of inclusiveness and a confirmation of individual contribution. I enthusiastically support this resolution and the very worthwhile endeavor of the Special Olympics. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Con. Res. 123.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 343, commemorating the marinas of the United States and expressing support for the designation of National Marina Day on August 11, 2007. 
   There are more than 12,000 marinas in the United States. They provide services and access for millions of recreational boaters to the lakes, rivers, and bays of the United States. In my State of Minnesota, marinas provide boaters access to thousands of lakes and the headwaters of the Mississippi River. 
   Each weekend, millions of Americans take to the water from marinas to enjoy fishing, kayaking, sailing, and just cruising down the river enjoying the water. Marinas make all of this happen. They employ more than 140,000 people whose sole purpose is to help boaters enjoy their time on the water safely. 
   On August 11, 2007, National Marina Day will focus on the role marinas play as safe, family-friendly gateways to boating, and the invaluable service marina operators and owners perform as stewards of the environment. Activities include fishing tournaments, boating  safety demonstrations, water sports, and environmental demonstrations. 
   We also recognize that the role of the marina operator has changed since September 2001. They are helping the Coast Guard and others keep an eye out for suspicious activities on the waterways. Marina operators are on the water every day. They know what is routine--and what looks suspicious. They are keeping a lookout for aggressive behavior, unusual diving, suspicious packages on bridges or terminals, and other activities that appear out of place. 
   Members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure recognize the waterways of the United States as an important component of our national transportation system. However, these waterways also serve another important purpose: They allow people to have fun on the water. Marinas allow these types of recreational activities to occur. 
   I thank the gendeman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS) for introducing this resolution and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 343.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (CLIFFORD DAVIS/ODELL HORTON FEDERAL BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 753, a bill to re-designate the Federal building located at 167 North Main Street in Memphis, Tennessee, as the ``Clifford Davis and Odell Horton Federal Building''. 
   Odell Horton was appointed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee by President Jimmy Carter on May 12, 1980. He was the first African-American Federal Judge appointed in Tennessee since Reconstruction. 
   Judge Horton was born in Boliver, Tennessee. He grew up during the Depression and World War II in an environment he described as ``typically rural Southern and typically segregated, with all the attendant consequences of that.'' He was the oldest of five children to hard-working parents. During his childhood, he and his brothers and sister picked cotton to help support the family. 
   Horton graduated from high school in 1946 and enlisted in the Marine Corps ``as a vehicle to find a way out of Bolivar.'' Ten months later, he took advantage of an early discharge program designed to reduce the number of men in the military, and enrolled in Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, using Federal aid under the GI bill to finance his tuition. The Korean War was underway by the time he graduated in 1951, and he returned for a second tour of duty in the Marines. 
   During his second tour, he graduated from the U.S. Navy School of Journalism. After returning home, Horton entered Howard University Law School in Washington, D.C. He received his law degree in 1956 and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he started a private law practice. 
   In 1962, Horton became Assistant United States Attorney in Memphis. He remained in that position until his appointment to the Shelby County Criminal Court by Governor Buford Ellington. In 1968, Judge Horton ordered the desegregation of Bowld Hospital. A year later, he received the L.M. Graves Memorial Health Award for his efforts to advance the cause of health care in Memphis. Judge Horton stepped down from his Federal judgeship to serve as President of LeMayne-Owen College, a predominately African-American liberal arts college. 
   He returned to Federal service upon his appointment as reporter for the Speedy Trial Act Implementation Committee by the Western District Court of Tennessee. He later served as U.S. Bankruptcy Judge from 1976 to 1980. Judge Horton also served as Chief Judge for the Western District of Tennessee from January 1, 1987, until December 31, 1993. On May 16, 1995, he took senior status and retired two years later. 
   Judge Horton was a member of the American Bar Association and Chair of the National Conference of Federal Trial Judges. He also served as a member of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services. Morehouse College honored him with an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws. In 2000, the Memphis Bar Association awarded Judge Horton with a Public Service Award. 
   Judge Horton died February 22, 2006, at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and was buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis. 
   In honor of Judge Horton's outstanding contributions to the legal community in Memphis and his exemplary professional career, it is both fitting and proper to designate the courthouse located on 167 North Main Street in Memphis, Tennessee, as the ``Clifford Davis and Odell Horton Federal Building''. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  
   Mr. La TOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Don Rafael Mart&#237;nez Nadal was born in the city of Mayaguez on April 22, 1877. He received his college degree in Philosophy and Letters from the Provincial Institute of Secondary Education in San Juan. 
   He pursued studies in Barcelona, Spain, and Paris, France. He returned to Mayaguez in 1904 and began studying the cultivation of coffee. Simultaneously, he pursued his interest in media and politics and joined the Puerto Rican Republican Party. In 1908, he founded the political newspaper El Combate. In 1912, he obtained his law degree, and became one of the most prominent men of the Puerto Rican political arena. He was considered one of the most famous criminal lawyers in Puerto Rico of his time. 
   In 1914, he was elected as a member of the Chamber of Delegates for the city of Ponce by the Puerto Rican Republican Party. In 1920, he was chosen by the same party to serve in the Senate and was re-elected in the next five general elections. Nadal left the Puerto Rican Republican Party and launched a political movement that became known as the Historical Constitutional Party. Later, he founded the Republican Union, working to advance the cause of Puerto Rican statehood. In coalition with the Socialist Party, the Republican Union triumphed in the general elections of 1932 and 1936. In both terms, Martinez Nadal presided over the Senate. Before the election of 1940, because of a serious illness, he returned to his Guaynabo residence. He died on July 6, 1941. 
   In honor of Rafael Martinez Nadal's outstanding contributions to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, it is both fitting and proper to designate the courthouse located at 31 Gonzalez Clemente Avenue in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, as the ``Rafael Martinez Nadal United States Customhouse Building''.

In 1979, Judge Small was elected Judge of Superior Court of the First Judicial District and served as senior resident judge for 17 years. Judge Small is an active volunteer, serving on the Board of Director of the Albemarle Hospital and the American Red Cross. He has received numerous awards and honors from the Jaycees, the Boy Scouts, the Volunteer Fireman, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Rotary and Elks clubs. Further, Judge Small was a World War II veteran and served in the U.S. Navy for three years. 
   Judge Small is an outstanding mentor and volunteer. For more than five decades, he has been an exceptional jurist and civic leader. It is fitting and proper to honor his outstanding contributions with this designation.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (SAFETEA-LU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1195, a bill to make technical corrections to the surface transportation act, SAFETEA-LU. 
   H.R. 1195 makes technical corrections to the surface transportation act, Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), enacted in 2005. This is a non-controversial, bipartisan bill that is intended to correct drafting errors, make technical fixes, and clarify Congressional intent on several provisions of the SAFETEA-LU. 
   This legislation is very similar to the two bills that passed the House last year, but were never considered by the Senate. 
   Although H.R. 1195, as amended, only addresses changes to previously authorized projects, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, per my direction, has required Members of Congress to submit earmark disclosure certifications pursuant to Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives. In addition, the bill, as amended, complies with pay-as-you-go budget rules. 
   SAFETEA-LU has been very successful and effective. Building on previous surface transportation acts, SAFETEA-LU provides the programmatic framework and investments necessary to begin addressing the nation's growing surface transportation needs. However, as with legislation of this magnitude, there were inadvertent drafting errors. The changes in this bill are required to ensure that all policies, programs, and projects embodied in the authorization act are implemented as intended by Congress. 
   In particular, this bill makes critical fixes to the transportation research program authorized in SAFETEA-LU. Errors were made in the research program funding calculations that resulted in lower than intended funding levels  in several research programs. These technical fixes will recapture critical research funds for many essential programs, including: 
   The Future Strategic Highway Research Program, a concentrated, results-oriented research program focused on solving the top problems of highway safety, reliability, capacity, and renewal; and 
   The University Transportation Center Program which advances U.S. technology and expertise in the many disciplines comprising transportation through the mechanisms of education, research, and technology. 
   The bill also clarifies section 1928 of SAFETEA-LU regarding the Sense of Congress concerning Buy America requirements for Federal-aid highway bridge projects. Congress does not believe that the Federal Highway Administration (``FHWA'') is implementing the Buy America Act consistent with the statutory intent. Specifically, the ``additional cost test'' should be conducted on the basis of an entire bridge project, not on separate components of the bridge project. Regrettably, FHWA has applied the test to separate components of a bridge project if the project is broken into several components for contracting purposes. The original Sense of Congress, as well as the amendment included in this bill, is intended to clarify Congressional intent and to provide guidance to the FHWA in its implementation. 
   Finally, H.R. 1195 modifies the Repeat Intoxicated Driver Law to allow for the use of ignition interlock devices. This change gives States more flexibility to either continue with the current one-year license suspension requirement for repeat offenders, or permit a 45-day license suspension, after which limited driving privileges are reinstated provided an ignition interlock device is placed on the offender's vehicle. 
   Repeat offenders are a significant part of the United States drunk driving problem, representing about one-third of all Driving Under the Influence (DUI) arrests each year. It is estimated that between 50 and 75 percent of repeat offenders whose licenses have been suspended continue to drive illegally. An ignition interlock device prevents offenders who have alcohol in their system from operating their vehicle, but allows them to continue to drive to work, school, or an alcohol treatment program. 
    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1195. 
   Mr. Speaker, I submit the following exchange of letters between Mr. GORDON and myself regarding this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (MARITIME POLLUTION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I especially want to thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Affairs for his leadership, absorbing so quickly in such a short period of time the complexities under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. I also would like to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) for his partnership and working so diligently to bring this important legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an international issue. In fact, just moments ago, just before arriving to the floor, I had a meeting with a representative of the transportation ministry of the European Union. He is the deputy in charge of the Transport Ministry of the European Union, and we were discussing the MARPOL legislation and the need for international participation and cooperation on these issues. 
   In fact, the European Transport Ministry has established a new section dealing with maritime pollution issues which go beyond that of the subject of this legislation to include pollution at sea from accidents to maritime vessels, the first most serious of which was the Torrey Canyon disaster in the English Channel in 1967, which alerted all of the maritime sector to the need for double-hulled vessels, to the need for international standards on shipping. 
   We have moved beyond the water pollution issue, ocean pollution issue, which continues to be a matter of great concern, to that of air pollution, which is the subject of this legislation, the discharge of nitrogen oxides from maritime diesel engines, the sulfur content of diesel fuel, ozone-depleting substances, volatile organic compounds and standards for shipboard incinerators, fuel oil quality, platforms for drill rigs at sea. All of these are the subject of this legislation and of the International Maritime Pollution Convention. 
   At the beginning of next week, our committee will travel to Brussels to meet with members of the European Transport Ministry and members of the European Parliament Transport Committee to discuss this issue and other issues including emissions from aircraft at altitude, which are the subject of the ongoing discussions in the international community on emissions trading and steps that the international community together can take to reduce impact on factors that are accelerating global climate change. 
   This legislation, in other words, is not just a relatively noncontroversial matter that we attempted to accomplish in the last Congress; but for various reasons, we were not able to do so with the other body. But this is one step in a global issue of international concern that brings the United States and its maritime partners into cooperation on matters that involve air quality at sea. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland, the chairman of the subcommittee, for his diligent work, and Mr. LaTourette and Ranking Member Mica for their participation and working with us to bring this legislation to the floor. I hope that the other body will cooperate promptly and move this bill to the President. 
   We have incorporated recommendations by the administration in this legislation to accommodate their interests.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, although it has been discussed previously before I reached the Chamber, I just want to be sure to emphasize the important change to allow EPA to enforce the standards in addition to the Coast Guard. These are changes requested by the administration. The Coast Guard acknowledging that EPA has far more experience than does the Coast Guard on air quality emission standards. 
   It is important for EPA to develop standards jointly with the Coast Guard because, on the Coast Guard side, they have more knowledge and understanding and expertise in vessel safety issues that have to be incorporated into any air quality emission standards that may be promulgated. 
   I want to emphasize this role of EPA, an important step forward, and I am very pleased the administration was emphatic in asking for an EPA role, and Coast Guard similarly has been very insistent on including EPA in this process. I think this will, overall, strengthen the result of the legislation that we are considering today.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly support H.R. 802, the ``Maritime Pollution Prevention Act of 2007''. The gentleman from Maryland, Mr. CUMMINGS, and I introduced this legislation in February to provide the U.S. Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') with the legal authority they need to implement Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. 
   Global climate change is a critical issue, not only for the United States, but for every man, woman, and child that live on this planet called Earth. The international maritime community has recognized this problem and developed an international convention to help address air pollutants from diesel ships. 
   For many years, the International Maritime Organization, an organization of the United Nations, has been developing international standards to prevent pollution from ships that ply the world's oceans. The international convention is called the International Convention  for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973. The United States has implemented these environmental laws by enacting and amending the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (``APPS''). 
   On May 19, 2005, Annex VI of that Convention came into force internationally. Annex VI limits the discharge of nitrogen oxides from large marine diesel engines, governs the sulfur content of marine diesel fuel, prohibits the emission of ozone-depleting substances, regulates the emission of volatile organic compounds during the transfer of cargoes between tankers and terminals, sets standards for shipboard incinerators and fuel oil quality, and establishes requirements for platforms and drilling rigs at sea. In April 2006, the Senate ratified this treaty by unanimous consent. 
   H.R. 802 is the necessary implementing legislation for Annex VI of that Convention. This legislation will give the Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency the authority they need to develop the U.S. standards and to enforce these requirements on the thousands of U.S.- and foreign-flag vessels that enter the United States each year from overseas. 
   Everyone here recognizes the challenge that the world faces in combating global climate change. We must pursue all avenues in the effort to turn around the rising temperatures on this planet. I am pleased that the International Maritime Organization stepped up to the plate and developed amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships to regulate air pollution from ships. 
   Last year, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reported H.R. 5811, the MARPOL Annex VI Implementation Act of 2006, favorably to the House. This bill was subsequently added to H.R. 5681, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2006, and passed the House on October 28, 2006. 
   H.R. 802 is very similar to H.R. 5811, but includes changes to allow the EPA to enforce the standards, in addition to the Coast Guard. These changes were requested by the Administration. The Coast Guard acknowledges that the EPA has far more experience than they do on air quality emission standards. However, it is important for the EPA to develop the standards jointly with Coast Guard because of the Coast Guard's expertise over vessel safety issues. 
   During Committee consideration of the bill, the Committee adopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute that clarifies that MARPOL Annex VI will only apply to vessels in the United State's 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone when the Executive Branch determines that MARPOL Annex VI is customary international law. In addition, the amendment clarified that MARPOL Annex VI will not apply to public vessels owned by the U.S. Government until the head of the agency that operates the vessels agrees with the EPA Administrator that MARPOL VI should apply to that agency's vessels. 
   The amendment in the nature of a substitute that the House considers today further clarifies that the application of MARPOL VI to the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone and territorial sea takes effect when it becomes customary international law; requires EPA to consult with a State when establishing an emission area; and requires the regulations regarding reception facilities to be jointly prescribed by EPA and the Coast Guard. 
   I would like to take the opportunity to thank our new Chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Mr. CUMMINGS, for his help in developing this bill. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 802, the Maritime Pollution Prevention Act of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 971, a resolution to express sympathy for the victims of the tornados that struck Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee. 
   On the evening of February 5th, 2008, more than 100 tornados devastated communities in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee and provided us yet another reminder of the horrific impacts of natural disasters. I express my heartfelt sympathy to those who have suffered significant losses as a result of these terrible storms, especially to those who suffered the ultimate loss--the loss of a loved one. 
   I also rise once again, as I did in May of last year in the wake of devastating fires in my district, and again in August of last year after the tragic bridge failure in Minneapolis, to commend the men and women who serve this nation as police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel, placing themselves in great danger every day in order to protect each one of us. 
   Twenty-four hours a day, every day of the year, all over this country, when any type of tragedy enters our lives, from a medical emergency facing a neighbor to a large-scale natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other incident, our Nation's emergency responders and charitable organizations are the first on the scene to provide professional services, expert help, aid, and comfort. These well-trained, highly skilled individuals are truly on the front lines in preparing for, responding to, and mitigating damages from a variety of hazards. 
   Disasters such as the devastating tornadoes that hit just last week demonstrate the countless selfless acts of our Nation's charitable organizations and our Nation's rust responders. These first responders deserve our deepest thanks and respect. 
   I strongly support this resolution and urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4140 designates the Port Angeles Federal Building located at 138 West First Street, Port Angeles, Washington, as the ``Richard B. Anderson Federal Building.'' 
   Private First Class, PFC, Richard B. Anderson was born on June 26, 1921, in Tacoma, Washington. Anderson grew up in Port Angeles, Washington, and attended Sequim High School. 
   On July 6, 1942, Anderson joined the United States Marine Corps. He received his basic and infantry training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, California, and was promoted to the rank of Private First Class on April 12, 1943. 
   Following his promotion, PFC Anderson was assigned to the East Company, 2nd Battalion, of the 23rd Marines. PFC Anderson's unit was deployed to the Marshall Islands in January 1944. On February 1, 1944, his company was part of an invasion force fighting to take control of Rio Island from the Japanese. 
   During the assault, Anderson and three other Marines jumped into a shell crater to escape enemy flre. As Anderson prepared to throw a grenade from inside the crater, the grenade slipped from his hands and began to roll toward the other three marines in the crater. In an act of selfless heroism, Anderson lunged on top of the live grenade and absorbed the full impact of the blast, saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. Anderson died from his wounds shortly thereafter. 
   After his death, PFC Anderson was awarded the Purple Heart and the Medal of Honor for his acts of bravery and service to his country. 
   On October 26, 1945, the United States Navy commissioned a DD-786 destroyer battleship as the USS Richard B. Anderson in honor of the fallen hero. The ship began active service in January 1947, and was used in combat for the Vietnam and Korean wars. The ship remained in active service until December 20, 1975.

   The ICA (P.L. 90-553), passed by Congress in 1968, authorizes the Secretary of State ``to sell or lease to foreign governments and international organizations'' Federal property located in Northwest Washington, DC, off of Connecticut Avenue. The 47-acre parcel of land authorized by the bill offers space for new embassies, consulates, and international organizations and is commonly referred to as the International Center. 
   Intelsat was formed in the 1960s as an international commercial cooperative of 142 countries that provided global telecommunications including television, telephone, and data transmission. Intelsat's headquarters are located in the International Center. 
   In 2000, an act of Congress privatized Intelsat (P.L. 106-180). Since the ICA does not permit the U.S. State Department to lease space within the International Center to a private entity, Intelsat's lease no longer meets the requirements of the ICA. H.R. 3913 makes technical amendments to the ICA to permit Intelsat to continue its tenancy.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 832, honoring the Texas Water Development Board on its selection as a 2007 recipient of the Environmental Protection Agency's Performance and Innovation in the State Revolving Fund (``SRF'') Creating Environmental Success Award. This resolution was introduced by my colleague from Texas (Ms. Johnson), who is Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 
   In 2005, to recognize outstanding successes of the States' Clean Water State Revolving Fund programs, the Performance and Innovation in the SRF Creating Environmental Success Awards, or the ``PISCES'' awards, were created. The Awards recognize successfully designed projects or organizations that utilize exceptional planning, management, and financing to further the goals of clean and safe water for our citizens. 
   The PISCES award, which is biennially bestowed on one State entity per region, is an attempt to reward innovation and stewardship in meeting the Clean Water and wastewater needs of the Nation. 
   In 2007, the Region 6 recipient of this award was the Texas Water Development Board. 
   However, I would be remiss if I failed to also recognize the Region 5 award winner--Minnesota's Agricultural Best Management Practices Loan Program, operated by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture through funds and assistance obtained through the Minnesota Public Finance Authority. 
   The Texas Water Development Board has managed its funds exceptionally, awarding communities more than $4 billion in loans to finance more than 450 water infrastructure projects across the state. These projects help Texas treat more than two billion gallons of wastewater per day, resulting in significant environmental and health benefits. 
   The Board has also been an active partner with the Committee and Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment--twice testifying before the Committee on issues ranging from the enormous nationwide need for wastewater infrastructure investment to the long-term stewardship of water resource measures through thoughtful, statewide watershed planning. 
   I support this resolution honoring Texas' water and environmental management, and urge my colleagues to agree to the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6899, the ``Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act''. This bill promotes energy savings for all Americans and advances the national security interests of the United States by reducing its dependence on oil. 
   In particular, I am pleased that this bill incorporates H.R. 6052, the ``Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act of 2008'', which the House passed by a vote of 322-98 on June 26, 2008. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure also included these provisions in last year's House-passed energy bill, but unfortunately, they did not become law. At that time, decreasing America's demand for foreign oil was often lost in the debate, overshadowed by concerns over increasing our supply. But decreasing demand is one of the most immediate and effective ways we can deal with the high cost of gas and move America toward greater energy independence. 
   Americans understand this. They are riding transit more and driving less. Public transportation all across the country is seeing record ridership while the number of miles traveled in personal automobiles is falling. Last year, Americans took more than 10.3 billion trips on public transportation, the highest level in 50 years. In the second quarter of 2008, commuters took more than 2.8 billion transit trips nationwide, an increase of 5.2 percent. Meanwhile, use of personal automobiles is falling by record numbers when measured by vehicle-miles traveled, VMT. In fact, much of the recent drop in both crude oil and gasoline prices has been due to a reduction in demand. 
   People are making these choices based not only on the high price of gas, but also because of a very real desire to wean our country off our dangerous addiction to imported oil. At current rates, that means a saving of 1.4 billion gallons of gas a year, or 33.5 million barrels of oil. As transit ridership continues to grow, we can expect even greater reductions in oil consumption and demand. According to a recent study, if Americans used public transit at the same rate as Europeans--for roughly 10 percent of their daily travel needs--the United.States could reduce its dependence on imported oil by more than 40 percent. This ``mode shift'' to transit should be a national goal, and strategies to achieve it should be at the forefront of any well-rounded energy debate. 
   Unfortunately, this lesson appears to be lost on the Bush administration. Although voters continue to approve state and local ballot initiatives to support public transportation, the administration has opposed increased funding for transit to help public transit agencies keep pace with the rising costs of fuel and the demand for more transit service. In fact, by stressing the need for new transit projects to meet ``cost-effectiveness'' benchmarks above all other criteria, the administration has stunted or stifled altogether much needed growth in transit. And this short-sightedness couldn't be happening at a worse time. 
   According to a recent study by the American Public Transportation Association, 85 percent of public transit systems nationwide are experiencing capacity problems due to the unprecedented rise in ridership. The survey revealed that 91 percent of public transit agencies report that they are reaching the limit in their ability to add service to meet increasing ridership demands. Further, more than 60 percent of the transit systems report they are considering fare increases and 35 percent are considering service cuts, some for the second time in less than a year. 
   Just as high gas prices and the desire to use less foreign oil are inspiring more Americans to take the train or bus to work rather than drive alone, our Nation's public transportation systems are facing budgetary nightmares and high fuel prices of their own that may cause them to be unable to meet any further growth in transit ridership. This bill recognizes the importance of funding public transportation to further our energy savings and security goals. 
   Specifically, H.R. 6899 authorizes $1.7 billion over two years for grants to transit agencies nationwide to temporarily reduce fares, expand services, or offset the increased cost of system and fleet maintenance to meet the needs of the growing number of transit commuters. 
   It also allows transit agencies to use these new grants to offset the increased cost of fuel or to acquire clean fuel or alternative fuel vehicle-related equipment or facilities. In addition, transit agencies may use these grants to establish or expand ``commuter matching services'', to provide commuters with information about alternatives to single occupancy vehicle use. 
   H.R. 6899 increases to 100 percent the Federal share for clean fuel and alternative-fuel transit bus, ferry, or locomotive-related equipment or facilities, thereby assisting transit agencies in becoming more fuel efficient. 
   This legislation extends the Federal transit pass benefits program to require that all Federal agencies offer transit passes to Federal employees working in metropolitan areas with existing transit systems throughout the United States. Current law limits this program to Federal agencies in the Washington, DC, metropolitan region. This provision will provide more Federal employees with the incentives to choose transit options, thereby reducing their transportation-related energy consumption and reliance on foreign oil. 
   Finally, H.R. 6899 creates a national consumer awareness program to educate the public on the environmental benefits of public transportation alternatives to the use of single occupancy vehicles. 
   Mr. Speaker, public transportation in all its forms--buses, light rail, subways, to name a few--saves fuel and reduces our dependence on foreign oil. Increasing the use of public transportation by providing Americans the good transit service they want and need must be an important part of a holistic national energy policy. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6899.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (MARITIME POLLUTION PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I smile because it's a delight to call the gentleman Mr. Speaker. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 802, as amended, the Maritime Pollution Prevention Act of 2008. The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and I introduced this legislation at the outset of the 110th Congress to provide the Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency with the legal authority they need to implement Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. 
   The House passed H.R. 802 on March 26, 2007, by a vote of 359-48. Notwithstanding that overwhelming vote of approval, the bill languished in the place we affectionately call the other body  for more than a year. But recently they have passed, with minor changes, that legislation. With House passage today, the bill can go to the President for consideration and for his signature. 
   Global warming is a critical issue, not just for the United States, but for every Nation, for every person on the planet. The international maritime community has recognized their contribution to global warming and to ocean pollution and have developed an international convention to address air pollutants from diesel ships. 
   For many years, the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations has been developing international standards to prevent pollution from ships that traverse the oceans. Those standards are now embodied in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1973. The U.S. has implemented these environmental laws by enacting and amending the legislation known as the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, and when I served on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, much of whose jurisdiction has now been absorbed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, we worked on early versions of those amendments and environmental laws to implement and amend the APPS. 
   Annex VI of the Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships limits the discharge of nitrogen oxides from large marine diesel engines; it governs the sulfur content of marine diesel fuel; prohibits the emission of ozone-depleting substances; it regulates the emission of volatile organic compounds in the transfer of cargoes between tankers and terminals. It sets standards for shipboard incinerators and fuel oil quality; and it establishes requirements for platforms and drill rigs at sea. 
   The Senate ratified this treaty by unanimous consent in April, 2006. But it doesn't go into effect until we enact implementing legislation. The bill we consider today will implement Annex VI of the convention. It will provide the Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency the authority necessary to develop U.S. standards and to enforce those standards on the thousands of U.S. and foreign-flagged vessels that enter U.S. waters. 
   Recognizing the challenge that the world faces in combating worldwide climate change and global warming, we have to take every measure possible to contain and then reduce rising temperatures on this planet, and particularly the oceans that are deep reservoirs of oxygen but also reservoirs of carbon and of the acid that we are pouring into the atmosphere. And that combination of absorbing heat, acid, and carbon is having deleterious effects on the Nation's world coral reefs. There was a very enlightening program on this devastation of the coral reefs on the Science Channel just the other evening.     
   It is something that I witnessed myself when I lived in Haiti and did snorkeling and exploring of the coral reefs. This was in the 1950s. You could see the dead reefs on the one side, and the vibrant, growing coral reefs and the abundance of life on those coral reefs, filtering out deleterious elements in the ocean water. But on the other side, the dead reef and a testament to the effects of pollution in our waters. And that was 50 years ago. 
   So the Senate amendments do not affect the application of MARPOL VI to the thousands of vessels that enter our ports. Their amendment clarifies that the United States can enforce MARPOL VI on vessels that are registered in countries which are not party to the convention when those vessels are in our 200 mile economic zone if the Coast Guard is on board of the vessel to enforce other annexes to the convention and to the extent that this enforcement does not violate international law. 
   In addition, the Senate amendment clarifies that an individual, a person, may bring a civil action if the Administrator of EPA has failed to perform any act or duty not discretionary under the act, and that is similar to civil action that may be brought under other provisions of law on application of other annexes to the convention. 
   The delay by the Senate, I regret, may have near term unfortunate consequences for the United States in the IMO negotiations that will take place this coming October to reduce emissions from ships. Under the terms of the convention, only parties to the convention may vote on those reduction measures, and a nation is not party to the convention until 90 days after its instruments of ratification have been deposited with the IMO. The Senate delay means we may not meet that deadline and the U.S. may not be able to vote to improve increased standards, even though delegates representing the United States chaired the working group that met over many sessions to negotiate these new, more rigorous standards. 
   So, given the importance of completing action on this legislation, I asked our majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, to schedule this bill as quickly as possible immediately upon the House's return to session today. I thank the majority leader for his consideration, and I am hopeful we get the bill to the President's desk without delay. 
   I would also like to take the opportunity to thank our chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Mr. Cummings, who has devoted a great deal of energy to the work of the subcommittee and to this particular issue in developing this legislation, and to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the ranking member of our committee, for his cooperation and support in moving the bill last year and expediting today's action considering the bill, and to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette), ever the thoughtful, considerate, legal expert of the committee. I am grateful for his contribution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I thank the gentleman for that promotion, I think. But I most sincerely thank him for his comments on the work of our committee and for his partnership in shaping that success story that we have enjoyed and in partnership with Mr. Mica as well. It is representative of the historical tradition of the committee to work in a bipartisan spirit. Perhaps it is so because of the nature of our committee jurisdiction, as the gentleman has suggested in his comments. 
   Indeed, as of the recess for Fourth of July, we had passed the 110th bill on that Thursday of the 110th Congress, the 110th bill from our committee, 64 of which have become public law or concurrent resolutions or House resolutions that were self-implementing; and that last measure, the 110th, was indeed to address the energy issue, to provide funding for transit and flexibility for transit authorities. And another bill that we passed by 311-104 was for the future of Amtrak, a bill that is now in House-Senate conference, and which I am confident we will bring to the House floor before the August recess to give Amtrak a new breath of life, incorporating some very significant Republican concepts and contributions that I think are important for the future of Amtrak. We did not operate in the committee on the principle of a majority of the majority, but rather on the principle of the best ideas that we could marshal and muster together and shape legislation that is beneficial for the future. 
   I now yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).

   I think our committee has been able very successfully to attack these issues of short-term as well as long-term importance to the Nation, and we intend to continue pursuing the best interests of the country in the legislation we move from this committee, and to incorporate the good ideas from all members of the committee regardless of their political stature or standing. 
   I recall so well during T-21, the shaping of the surface transportation legislation, Mr. Shuster, then the chairman, and I traveled the country to major points of congestion throughout America to advocate for more robust investment in surface transportation. And at one point, I believe it was in Atlanta at a news conference, the last question was, well, Mr. Oberstar, why are you traveling and participating in this news conference, you a Democrat, with Mr. Shuster, a Republican? And I said: Because I have never seen a Democratic bridge or a Republican road; but if we work together, we can build all-American roads and all-American bridges. 
   The reporter then turned to Chairman Shuster and said: Why are you travelling with Mr. Oberstar? And he said, Because Jim Oberstar and I are joined at the hip. 
   And I think if we could carry that spirit with vigor and honesty and with resoluteness of purpose, we can accomplish great things for this country and for this Congress. And I for that reason enjoy the participation of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), and in the current context Mr. Cummings of Maryland, because there is a real sense of doing what is good for America and putting the country first and not our own personal agendas.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (PROMOTING THE SAFE OPERATION OF 15-PASSENGER VANS -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution, H. Res. 964, which seeks to promote the safe operation of 15-passenger vans and highlights an important safety issue. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN) for bringing this important issue to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the House. 
   This resolution encourages all organizations owning or operating a 15-passenger van not to allow inexperienced drivers to operate these vehicles without proper training and education regarding the safe operation of these vehicles. The design and handling characteristics of 15-passenger vans make them different to drive than other passenger vehicles. 
   The operators of these vehicles must understand the special driving skills necessary for their safe operation due to the larger size and higher centers of gravity. These characteristics make 15-passenger vans less stable than vehicles such as cars. 
   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, from 1997 through 2006, there were 1,090 fatalities of van occupants resulting from crashes involving 15-passenger vans, of which 534 fatalities resulted from largely preventable single-vehicle rollover crashes of such vans. 
   Furthermore, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, in 2005, 59 percent of the fatalities in 15-passenger van crashes  occurred in single-vehicle rollover crashes, which is higher than the rollover fatality rates for any other passenger vehicle type. The threat of rollover in these vehicles becomes even greater when operators place heavy loads on the roofs of the vans, such as luggage. 
   Mr. Speaker, safety belts dramatically increase the chances of survival during a rollover crash. Nearly 80 percent of those who died in 15-passenger van rollovers nationwide between 1990 and 2003 were not buckled up. These striking statistics paint a very clear portrait of the dangers associated with 15-passenger vans, and that the operation of these vans by inexperienced drivers raises significant safety concerns for operators and passengers in these vehicles. 
   In the last federal surface transportation act, we made progress on this issue. However, more must be done to bring public awareness to this critical issue impacting the public safety on our nation's roadways. As we embark on the initial stages of our next surface transportation authorization bill, we must include the concerns raised by H. Res. 964 in our discussions and ensure that the safety problems associated with 15-passenger vans are addressed. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 964.

More than 150 Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2007 will be honored at this Memorial Service. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 181 officers died in the line of duty in 2007. Five officers were women. Forty States and the District of Columbia experienced officer fatalities in 2007. Thirteen States had five or more fatalities. 
   In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation which designated May 15th as Peace Officers Memorial Day, and the week in which that date falls as ``Police Week''. The first official memorial service took place on May 15, 1982, at which 91 law enforcement officers were honored. Over the past 27 years, the Memorial Service has honored more than 3,000 law enforcement officers from around our nation. Today, the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service on Capitol Hill has become one in a series of well attended events during Police Week. 
   Activities on the Capitol Grounds conducted under H. Con. Res. 308 will be coordinated with the Architect of the Capitol, will be free, and open to the public.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and colleagues, here we are once again for at least the fifth time in 3 years to consider technical corrections to the SAFETEA-LU legislation. 
   In the 109th Congress, the gentleman from Alaska, then Chair of the full committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and I worked to bring this technical corrections bill to the House floor, passed it successfully. We dealt with hundreds and hundreds of minor adjustments, changes that normally happen in the course of passing a major bill of this nature. If I recall rightly, in ISTEA in 1991, there were 600 or 700 such technical corrections in the TEA-21 bill. In 1998 there were something like 1,200 technical corrections that had to be made. And we had a somewhat smaller number for SAFETEA-LU. We passed it three times in that Congress, and three times we could not get the other body, as we affectionately call them, to come to agreement and move the bill. We tried, in fact, after election in November, 2006, in a conference call, I recall, with Chairman Young and me, with the other  body leadership, but they could not come to a resolution on the matter. So we took it up again in this Congress, and we passed it. It's been a year since we moved the bill. 
   This is bipartisan. Finally, it's a bicameral agreement among all the issues under jurisdiction of our committee on the bill that we passed. Finally, the Senate passed the bill by an overwhelming margin of 88-2. In our body it passed 422-1 in August of 2007. 
   So we now have a number of changes here. A good many of the adjustments were requested by the DOT Modal Administrators, and we have accommodated those in this legislation. 
   Particularly, there were errors made in drafting the final language in the research program. Funding calculations resulted in lower than intended funding levels for several research programs. These technical fixes now will finally recapture critical research funds for the Future Strategic Highway Research program aimed at dealing with highway safety, reliability, capacity, renewal; and the University Transportation Center program that provides funding for the many disciplines in the Academic Center that generate useful and productive ideas for the practitioners of highway and bridge construction and transit operation. We also have an important clarification to the repeat intoxicated driver law to allow for use of ignition interlock devices, strongly supported by Mothers Against Drunk Driving. This legislation gives States more flexibility to either continue with the 1-year license suspension or permit a 45-day license suspension with limited driving privileges. 
   We also have clarifying language to help the Federal Transit Administration to interpret section 3011 of SAFETEA-LU on new start and small start projects. I say ``help.'' It will put them on the right course to do the right thing that we intended in House-Senate conference on the transit title of the bill. As then Chairman Young will recall, we had a very vigorous debate with the conferees from the other body on this matter, and we came out with this language, and now it's been misrepresented over there by the Federal Transit Administration. 
   The number of technical corrections that we provide in this legislation will allow hundreds, maybe even thousands, of projects to move more vigorously ahead to the construction stage, and I'm quite certain that we will see a generation of at least 40,000 family-wage, highway-related construction jobs that will help lift this economy out of its doldrums. With over a million construction trades workers out of a job, we'll make at least a start in getting the economy back on track and putting them back to work. 
   For bringing us to this stage, I especially want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), ranking member of the committee, who has devoted a great deal of time. I know personally that he has interceded with the leadership in the other body to ask them to move this legislation along, and proceeded with one of the principal recalcitrant Members of the other body. He's really done his share of shouldering the workload and then some, and I'm grateful to the gentleman. And I appreciate the enduring participation with the former chairman, Mr. Young, the work that we did together in the last Congress to move the SAFETEA-LU legislation and then the technical corrections portion of it, and I appreciate that participation. 
   This really is a bipartisan initiative in the best tradition of this committee. Again, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his splendid work and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) for the splendid effort he has made. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (SAFETEA-LU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.  
   One of the items in our technical corrections bill that I mentioned at the outset was clarifying language to help the Federal Transit Administration to properly interpret section 3011 of SAFETEA-LU on New Start and Small Start project justifications. The reason for that language was that in the consideration of the bill in the House and Senate, and then during conference on SAFETEA-LU, it was clear the Federal Transit Administration was trying to, by administrative action, change existing law. 
   So we, the lawmakers, gave specific direction to FTA that rather than rely so heavily on their own fabricated cost-effectiveness index in determining authorization or approval of New Start and Small Start projects, they are giving inadequate consideration to other factors, economic development and environmental benefits among them, the investments that private sector interests make at transit stops on major projects, such as Dallas Area Rapid Transit, such as the Washington Area Metro project, where over $20 billion in private sector capital investments have been made along the stops. In Dallas, it is over $1 billion. FTA was not taking into consideration those additional benefits that flow from the investment in a transit project. 
   Similarly, they were not taking those factors into consideration in evaluating the Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project extension out to Wiehle Avenue, which is otherwise known as the Dulles Metro Extension. 
   Well, I am delighted that even before we moved this bill through to final enactment, the Federal Transit Administration announced this morning that it intends ``to approve entry into final design for the Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project,'' one of the most important transit projects in the entire United States. This is a vital decision. It is very important to move ahead with this project, so, frankly, we don't look like a third world country when it comes to moving people and goods in our economy. 
   I would also like to take this opportunity to note that one of the technical corrections that was so important for us to make in this legislation is for the authority to move ahead with MAGLEV development. Magnetic levitation technology was initiated in the United States going back even before ISTEA in 1991 under an amendment that I advanced with the support of the Congressional Steel Caucus to perfect magnetic levitation technology.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself an additional 2 minutes. 
   While we continued to study it and develop it in university research centers and in contracts with the private sector, Germany and Japan moved ahead with test track MAGLEV technology projects. One of those, the German technology version, has already been implemented in Shanghai, China, while we continue to lag behind because we have not moved ahead with sufficient authority. 
   Well, we have provided that authority in SAFETEA-LU, but the language wasn't precise enough to satisfy the Federal Transit Administration to move ahead. So we have corrected that ambiguity, if you will, or at least what the Department of Transportation considered to be an ambiguity, with the following language. ``Fifty percent of the funds will be allocated to the Nevada Department of Transportation, who shall cooperate with the California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission for the MAGLEV project between Las Vegas and Primm.'' In addition, the other 50 percent of the funds shall be allocated ``for existing MAGLEV projects located east of the Mississippi River, using such criteria as the Secretary deems appropriate.'' 
   In the accompanying report, section 102 language on MAGLEV, we further specify how those funds are to be used, specifically, the 50 percent allocated to the California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission for Las Vegas-Primm and the other 50 percent for projects east of the Mississippi. The intent of this clarification is to limit the eligible projects to three existing projects east of the Mississippi River; Pittsburgh, Baltimore-Washington and Atlanta-Chattanooga, in a competition to be determined by and evaluated and resolved by the Secretary of Transportation.

   I earnestly hope now that after two decades of studying, evaluating and developing in very limited test modes, MAGLEV technology will now be able to move ahead with passenger MAGLEV technology. 
   I also note for the record that the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) and I have been working with the Port Authority of Los Angeles-Long Beach and the California Transportation Department, and Mr. Rohrabacher with the Governor's office in California, on a MAGLEV circular route, loop route, from the Port of Los Angeles to Riverside, California, to carry container cargo that can actually pay its own way to the interior of California and avoid the grade crossings and actually haul paying passenger containers.

I yield myself the balance of my time again to express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Florida for the splendid cooperation, bipartisan participation, for the efforts made here in this body and with the other body on moving them along to bring the technical corrections to a conclusion. 
   I also want to note for the record the gentleman from Florida joined with me in the appeal, in fact, he initiated the request to the Secretary of Transportation, Ms. Peters, last October, for a meeting in our committee offices with the Governor of Virginia, the Commissioner of Transportation for Virginia, the Northern Virginia bipartisan Republican and Democratic House delegation, with Senator Warner's staff and FTA Administrator Simpson to discuss this Dulles Metrorail project, to bring to the attention of the administration that this is a bipartisan initiative, that we are together on supporting it, and to move it ahead. Now we are there. I thank the gentleman for his consistency and constancy on that initiative. 
   I concur also with the gentleman's remarks. These are technical corrections. There are 485 of them. Some of them, a good many of them, are just misspellings that needed to be technically corrected. There was some wording that the Federal Highway Administration wanted clarification on, that the Federal Transit Administration asked us to provide clarifying language on, and we do that in this legislation.     
   There were other projects where Members found that a project had been designated and was not exactly what their constituents were anticipating, they wanted to change it, dollar for dollar, no increasing, no additional spending. It is appropriate. 
   As former Chairman Bud Shuster was fond of saying: We Members of Congress are not potted plants. We are not there to just stand and look on benignly while the executive branch implements the legislation that we vote for. We are the ones who are accountable to raise the revenues; we are the ones who are accountable to put the policies in place, and we have a say in how they are carried out. And that is what we do with these Member high-priority projects. 
   So I urge all Members to support this legislation as an affirmation of the role of the people's body in setting transportation policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 444. H. Res. 444 highlights the House of Representatives' support for the May 24 National Aviation Maintenance Technician Day to honor Charles Edward Taylor, the first aviation maintenance technician who created and maintained the engine used to power the Wright brothers' aircraft, and the men and women who followed in his footsteps as aviation maintenance technicians. 
   This resolution celebrates the life and achievements of one of the fathers of aviation while also recognizing the indispensable role aviation maintenance technicians play by ensuring the safety of civil and military aircraft and infrastructure as well as the American people. In 1901, Charles Edward Taylor left his job making 25 cents an hour at the Dayton Electric Company to make 30 cents an hour in the Wright brothers' bicycle shop. Within a year of starting, Taylor helped them build a wind tunnel to test the Wrights' theories on winds and control surfaces. 
   When, in 1903, the Wright brothers' tasked Taylor with creating an 8-horsepower engine to power the Flyer, his only prior experience was an attempt to repair a gasoline automobile engine in 1901. He designed and built an aluminum, water-cooled, 12-horsepower engine. He built the engine from scratch in only 6 weeks, and without drawings, using a drill press, metal lathe, and hand tools. 
   Taylor said, ``[I] always wanted to learn to fly, but I never did. The Wrights refused to teach me and tried to discourage the idea. They said they needed me in the shop and to service their machines, and if I learned to fly, I'd be gadding about the country and maybe become an exhibition pilot, and then they'd never see me again.'' 
   After assisting the Wright brothers, Taylor went on to a pioneering aviation maintenance career spanning more than 60 years including a job as the chief mechanic for the first transcontinental flight in 1911 by Calbraith Perry Rodgers. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 444, honoring the first aviation maintenance technician, Charles Edward Taylor, and every aviation maintenance technician who has or will follow in his footsteps.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3074, the Department of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies, THUD, Appropriations Act of 2008. First and foremost, I am pleased that the bill fully funds the Federal highway, transit, and highway safety programs at the levels guaranteed by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, SAFETEA-LU. 
   At the same time, I regret that the bill rescinds $3 billion in highway funds that have been apportioned to the States, but are not available for obligation. However, I understand the significant funding constraints faced by the Committee on Appropriations in crafting the fiscal year 2008 THUD appropriations bill. If the Committee did not rescind this excess contract authority, it would have had to make real cuts in Amtrak funding, Federal Aviation Administration operations, and other critical programs. Given the Committee on Appropriations' limited choices, I have refrained from objecting to this rescission. 
   I appreciate Chairman Obey's and Subcommittee Chairman Oliver's willingness to work with me on this issue. The Committee on Appropriations did agree to my request that this rescission be applied proportionally to all Federal-aid highway programs. I have been very concerned with the way States have been implementing previous rescissions, and language included in H.R. 3074 would ensure that the rescission contained in this legislation will not undermine the priorities established in SAFETEA-LU. 
   I am particularly concerned with the treatment of the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement, CMAQ, program under previous rescissions. The CMAQ program provides funding for projects and programs that reduce transportation-related emissions in  areas that do not meet Clean Air Act air quality standards (i.e., nonattainment and maintenance areas). While representing about 4-5 percent of highway apportionments each year, CMAQ funds have accounted for about 20 percent of total highway funds rescinded in recent years. In FY 2006 alone, States rescinded $881 million in CMAQ funds, an amount that is equal to 55 percent of the total amount apportioned to the States for the CMAQ program that year. 
   Comparing the treatment of CMAQ to other highway programs further illustrates the disproportionate effects of these rescissions. In FY 2006, looking at rescissions as a percentage of the amounts apportioned for each program, the rescission of 55 percent of CMAQ funds compares to a rescission of only 12 percent of Interstate Maintenance funds and seven percent of National Highway System funds. 
   The Transportation Enhancements program has also received disproportionate contract authority cuts under the rescissions. The Transportation Enhancements program provides funds for bike paths, pedestrian walkways, historic preservation, and other activities that expand transportation choices and enhance the transportation experience. 
   In FY 2006, States rescinded $602 million in Transportation Enhancements funds, 15 percent of all rescissions in that year. Texas alone rescinded $223 million of Transportation Enhancements funding and the Texas Department of Transportation stated that it would not fund any transportation enhancement projects in that fiscal year. Texas' actions are directly contrary to our Federal efforts to develop a balanced, multimodal surface transportation system. 
   The language of H.R. 3074 is consistent with the approach taken in H.R. 2701, the Transportation Energy Security and Climate Change Mitigation Act of 2007, as ordered reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and will ensure that the priorities set by Congress in SAFETEA-LU are implemented as 
   intended. I greatly appreciate the Committee on Appropriations' willingness to address my concerns on this issue. 
   Throughout the bill, there are a number of other rescissions of highway, motor carrier safety, highway safety, and transit funds that raise concerns for the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In particular, section 124 rescinds $172 million of unobligated balances of contract authority for research programs conducted by the Federal Highway Administration. Earlier this year, the House passed H.R. 1195, the SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act, which provides additional resources to ensure that the highway research program receives the funding necessary to continue essential programs. Unfortunately, section 124 of the bill before us today rescinds some of these necessary research funds. 
   The final concern I would like to address today is the earmarking of Airport Improvement Program funds. The report accompanying H.R. 3084 includes a listing of 72 airport projects which the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, is directed to fund. The law governing the Airport Improvement Program requires the FAA to establish a priority system to decide which projects will receive funding. The FAA's National Priority System, which has been in use for many years, gives highest priority to projects that will bring airports into compliance with safety standards. Second priority is given to projects that are necessary to meet security requirements. Third priority is given to reconstruction or rehabilitation projects that are needed to preserve existing airport infrastructure. Fourth priority is given to projects needed to achieve compliance with current FAA standards. Fifth priority is given to capacity enhancement projects. 
   Aviation projects are not like projects in other modes of transportation. For example, an improvement to a highway project in one city does not necessarily benefit highway users in any other city, but in the national system of integrated airports, an improvement in one airport, particularly a major hub airport, could benefit aviation travelers throughout the system. For this reason, the FAA should have, and does have, discretion to fund improvements as it deems necessary to improve the aviation system as a whole. To limit the FAA's discretion in this regard would only worsen the congestion and delays we are already experiencing today. 
   I want to make it clear that the language in a report cannot override a priority system established under the governing law. I would like to quote from the decision of the Comptroller General on a similar situation. The Comptroller General wrote: ``It is our view that when Congress merely appropriates lump sum amounts without statutorily restricting what can be done with those funds, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions, and indicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how the funds should be or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on Federal agencies.'' 
   Throughout my career, I have steadfastly resisted designating airport improvement projects in authorizing legislation and in report language, and will continue to resist such designations. I urge the Committee on Appropriations to do so as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the ranking member of the committee, is misguided and an inappropriate amendment. 
   As the gentleman has already acknowledged, we discussed this in committee on our climate change legislation. We had a voice vote in which the gentleman's amendment failed. 
   It would strike the provision that is in this appropriation bill to require States to implement their future rescissions on a proportional basis; rescissions, that is cuts of unobligated contract authority, to make those reductions proportional. 
   States have applied previous rescissions in a disproportional way. They have disproportionately cut funding from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program that helps cities clean their air and move people more expeditiously. 
   They have disproportionately cut funds from the bridge program, from transportation enhancement funds, all of which play critical roles in creating mode choices and options and alternatives for moving people in our major metropolitan areas and in rural areas. 
   Flexibility, States have an enormous amount of flexibility under the current SAFETEA-LU law. They have the ability to transfer up to 50 percent of their programmatic apportionments to other apportioned programs. The National Highway System, States can transfer 100 percent from NHS funds to surface transportation. 
   This language will not in any way restrict States' flexibility in implementing the highway programs to meet  their priorities. It will restrict the practice of targeting specific programs for disproportionate cuts to meet their rescission requirements. 
   Now, the Equity Bonus Program, here is an example of the enormous flexibility States have under the current highway law. Funds under Equity Bonus are distributed to eligible States and apportioned to the interstate maintenance, the National Highway System, to the Bridge Program, to the Surface Transportation Program, Highway Safety Program and to CMAQ. States can use those funds to distribute the Equity Bonus account around to the eligibilities of these programs as they see fit to the needs of their specific State. 
   In fiscal year 2007, States got $8.327 billion in Equity Bonus accounts. They have a lot of flexibility with that amount of money. States have significant unobligated balances of contract authority available in all categories of the Federal-aid highway program.     
   As of May 31 of this year, States had a total of $46.5 billion in unobligated funds. That's $3.16 billion in the CMAQ program, 2 years' worth of apportionments. 
   They have got plenty of flexibility. They can use this money where they choose. Yet States have consistently chosen to target specific programs for disproportional cuts. Example, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement. That's only 4 or 5 percent of the total SAFETEA-LU program. But CMAQ funds account for 20 percent of the total rescissions in recent years. 
   States rescinded $881 million in CMAQ funds in 2006. That's $1 out of every $4 out of this one little program that metropolitan areas have to reduce congestion and pollution. 
   In 2006, rescissions were distributed this way. They cut 55 percent out of CMAQ. They cut 12 percent out of interstate maintenance. They cut 7 percent out of the national highway system. 
   In 2006, they cut $602 million out of the enhancements program. It was specifically set up to benefit communities that want to provide other transportation opportunities for their people. That's 15 percent of the rescissions just out of enhancements.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, in Texas, for example, of the $305 million assigned to Texas under the 2006 rescission, a total of $241 million of their cuts came from CMAQ and transportation enhancements. That's 79 percent of the amount that Texas alone cut out of these very small proportion programs. 
   Now, we should not allow States to just target certain programs. We have created a structure within the Federal-Aid Highway Program of categories of funding. We all voted for it. It's now law, and if they're going to cut, their cuts ought to be proportional across the board. 
   The Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations supports our position, National Association of Counties, regional councils, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, Surface Transportation Policy Partnership. The gentleman's amendment is unnecessary, it should not pass. States have enormous amounts of flexibility. We ought to defeat the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, this same amendment was offered in the last Congress and got 60 votes. It's as misguided now as it was then. 
   The Committee on Appropriations for the first time in a dozen years has provided a net increase in funding for Amtrak. We are not going to be here tonight or tomorrow when we vote on this and cut those funds and reduce Amtrak to the beggar position that it has been in for the last dozen years. 
   For the last 12 years, supporters of Amtrak have been reduced to pleading to just restore the funding; not to increase, not to advance the cause of Amtrak, but simply restore to where it was with the inadequate amounts that this administration has proposed. Most of the time they proposed to cut Amtrak. 
   In fact, when I hear Amtrak reform, I know what it means. It means cut the funds, tie their hands, submit Amtrak to a board that's going to run it into the ground, not run it into the 21st century. 
   As the gentleman, the chairman of the subcommittee, has said, the committee bill provides nearly $120 million increase in funding for the homeless. That's the first time in 4 years. A 23 percent increase, that's substantial. I'm for it. We don't need to take money out of Amtrak to increase funds for the homeless. Amtrak needs help. 
   I hear this old saw time and again. Oh, Amtrak is bleeding money, and we are subsidizing it. What do you do for the airlines? What do you do for highways? We provide funds for the highway program. We provide funds for aviation. 
   Amtrak is the residue of what was left when the railroads abandoned their passenger service in the 1960s and to the eve of 1970 when Amtrak was created. Time and again, they conspired with the Postal Service to take the railway post office off the passenger service so that then they would have a losing proposition, and they could apply for discontinuance to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and they did. They shut down passenger rail service to small towns, and they also lost less-than-carload service, and towns went out of business because they didn't have a small shipping service on freight rail with passengers to move their goods. 
   So what did Amtrak get? When we created Amtrak in 1970, we got the dregs of what was left of intercity passenger rail service, and the Congress for several years was trying to build up Amtrak to provide funds for improved rail, and railbed and rolling stock. But over the last 12 years, we haven't had the funds to do that with Amtrak. 
   Every industrialized Nation in the world has high-speed intercity passenger service. In France you can travel on the TGV a distance from International Falls to Minneapolis-Saint Paul, 185 miles an hour, 220-some miles, in 80 minutes, 80 minutes, in France. They can do that in Spain on the Talgo. They can do it in Germany on the ICE. They can do it in Japan on the Shinkansen. We don't have a high-speed, 185-mile-an-hour passenger rail service anywhere in America. The best Amtrak can do is 150 miles in a few segments of its track. 
   But if we make the investments, if we invest in improving the tracks, if we invest in the catanaries and improve the patographs on the existing locomotives in the Northeast corridor, we can have that high-speed rail service. We should have it. We should have it on the Northern Tier. We should have it from Chicago down to New Orleans. With we ought to have it all through the Southwest and the Southeast. 
   We need Amtrak rail passenger service in this country. We need a high-speed, modern, intercity rail passenger service in this country. We are a proud industrialized Nation. We have the highest mobility of people in the world. 
   In the aftermath of September 11, what did people take? They couldn't fly, and the highways were crowded. They took Amtrak. 
   We need to upgrade Amtrak. We need to invest in Amtrak. We need to invest in its future. This is where America has an opportunity to move from this highway-dependent economy of ours, reduce our dependence on imported oil, move people more efficiently and more effectively with high-speed intercity passenger rail, as every industrialized nation in the world does except the United States. 
   This is a misguided amendment. I regret that my dear friend, the lovely gentlewoman from central Minnesota, has offered this amendment, one of her first offerings in the House, but I have to say, it is misguided, it is the wrong thing to do. We need to defeat this amendment as we did in the last Congress.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. This is, as the chairman of the subcommittee has said, a shutdown amendment. It would totally eliminate operating grants for Amtrak and guarantee a shutdown. I suppose that is what the gentleman wants as he offers the amendment. He knows what he is doing. He is a very astute Member of this body. But I want to widen the perspective here. 
   The effects would ripple through our economy, through our national transportation system, stranding millions of passengers and force them onto already congested roadways and airways. 
   People in 106 cities served by Amtrak who are without air service would have to find new means of transportation; 19,000 Amtrak workers would lose their jobs. Their local economies, businesses would suffer. The railroad retirement and unemployment programs that cover employees of freight rail as well as passenger rail would eventually be depleted. We would be scrambling around here trying to restore the railroad retirement fund. It would disrupt commuter operations with whom Amtrak has contractual arrangements, stranding millions more passengers. GAO has reported to our committee that an abrupt cessation of Amtrak would result in major disruptions or shutdowns of commuter rail service throughout the country, stranding and straining regional transportation systems as hundreds of thousands of regular commuter rail passengers would have to look for alternative transportation. 
   It would increase costs for our freight rails. If Amtrak were to shut down, the freight rail industry would lose some $5.3 billion over the next 6 years. That would also include the loss of $57 million Amtrak pays each year to the four class I railroads for access to their infrastructure and increase tier II taxes to keep the railroad retirement system solvent. It would shut down operations of freight railroads in the northeast corner. Norfolk Southern relies on Amtrak's dispatch and infrastructure systems throughout that corridor to provide rail service to major mid-Atlantic markets. Without Amtrak, cost of the freight rails to maintain operations on those lines would be very substantial. 
   The real issue with Amtrak is it has been on a starvation diet practically since the time that we created Amtrak in 1970. But little by little, people are seeking alternative operations. They learned in the aftermath, as I said a moment ago, of September 11, that the only option to travel without air was inner-city passenger rail. 
   Amtrak, in 2006, had 24.3 million passengers. President Alex Kummant of Amtrak told us very recently on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that they expect 2007 to far surpass 2006 ridership levels. So far this year, just in the first quarter of this year, Amtrak had 2.17 million passengers. That is nearly a 7 percent increase over the previous year. 
   So keep funding Amtrak, give it an opportunity to breathe, give it this additional investment that it needs. Soon our committee will come to the floor with a substantial increase in funding for Amtrak to put it on course to be a real world-class competitor in inner-city passenger rail service.  
   When I was a student just graduating from college in St. Paul, the College of St. Thomas, I won a scholarship to study at the College of Europe in Belgium. I traveled from my home in Chisolm by bus to the Twin Cities, and there I talk the Milwaukee 400: 400 miles to Chicago in 400 minutes. And in Europe, I took the train from Paris to Brussels and then on to Brugge in Belgium for this program. That was a 6-hour trip. Today, that 6-hour trip is 80 minutes traveling at 185 miles an hour on the TGV. 
   Today you can't get to Chicago in 400 minutes from Minneapolis, not even by air. By the time you travel, drive to the airport, park your car, go through security, wait for the plane, get off the plane, try to get to your destination, you can't do it. We need a restructure, a rebuild, a reinvigorated Amtrak. Don't kill it with this amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The chairman has said it very well. The gentleman from Arizona first wants to cut the operating account, and then, after Amtrak is unable to operate, then cut their capital and debt service funds, and then, I guess, bury passenger rail service in America. He doesn't provide for a burial service, however, and we're not about to do that. 
   This would cut the $425 million in capital and debt service grants that would go below the level recommended by Amtrak's Board of Directors, who haven't been known to be generously supportive of their own organization. It would undermine the solvency of Amtrak. The capital needs are critical to operating Amtrak, to bring it to a state of good repair and maintain it in a state of decent and good repair. The capital overhead program on rolling stock is critical to keep aging equipment in safe working order and minimize failures. 
   You should go out sometime to the Amtrak repair facility in Indianapolis and see the highly skilled technicians who are working to repair and restore locomotives and passenger cars and the dining service cars. They are meticulous workers who are saving Amtrak hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars a year by restoring old equipment, putting it into a good state of operation. This amendment would cut the guts out from that operation. That doesn't make any sense whatever. 
   Amtrak has been investing in its deferred capital needs since 2003, incrementally, with not enough money, by far too little to reach the goals that they must attain, but they're doing it nonetheless. And the result is that with those very skilled workers, 70 percent of Amtrak's passenger car fleet and 85 percent of its locomotives will be in a state of good repair by the end of fiscal 2007. 
   Now, if you cut this money out, they'll never be able to bridge the gap and go on to make the other improvements that are needed. 
   I heard the gentleman say, well, we need to cut the funding and force change, and subject Amtrak to market forces. Well, in a hospital you don't cut off the blood supply to a patient and say, we're going to push the patient into a state of good health. That idea went out with applying leeches to the body and draining the body's fluids and essential operations. It doesn't make any sense. 
   And the gentleman, as many others have misguidedly said, we need to subject Amtrak to market forces. That implies that there's some other competitive passenger rail service in this country. There isn't. The railroads abandoned it in the 1960s. They didn't want to operate passenger rail service. It was much easier to carry freight than to carry people in this country. And they ran the passenger rail service into the ground, and then they handed it over to the Federal Government and said, here you take it. You do it. You do something good for the country.     
   Well, Congress did. I was here on the staff at the time when Amtrak was created. There was great hope for it. There were going to be capital investments made. The rail was going to help out with all the support that was needed for the infrastructure of intercity passenger rail. None of that happened. 
   Freight rails last year earned $4.5 billion net after-tax profit hauling freight. Amtrak is on a starvation diet made worse over the last 12 years by this previous leadership in Congress refusing to provide funding. But with a few enlightened Members on the other side supporting us over here, we were able to keep Amtrak alive, just keep it moving along, just hand-to-mouth existence. 
   Well, no more. There's a new leadership in this Congress. The gentleman from Massachusetts has seen the need, seen the opportunity to make investments. He has provided the funding in this bill. We need to move ahead. We should not cut the operating funds nor the capital grants. We ought to be doing far more than we are doing already in this bill. But this is at least a start and moves us in the right direction. We have to defeat this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2008, PART II -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6984, the ``Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2008, Part II''. 
   The previous long-term Federal Aviation Administration (``FAA'') reauthorization act, the Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L. 108-176) expired on September 30, 2007. On September 20, 2007, the House passed H.R. 2881, the ``FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007'', to reauthorize FAA programs for fiscal years 2008 through 2011. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate has been unable to complete action on a long-term FAA reauthorization bill. As a result, Congress has passed a series of short-term FAA extension acts. The current authority for aviation programs and taxes expires next week, on September 30. 
   H.R. 6984 provides a 6-month extension of aviation programs and taxes, through March 31, 2009. 
   H.R. 6984 provides $1.95 billion in contract authority for the Airport Improvement Program (``AIP''). The $1.95 billion provided for the first six months of fiscal year 2009 will enable airports to move forward with important safety and capacity projects, and is sufficient to meet all Letter of Intent (``LOI'') commitments. When annualized, this level of AIP funding equals $3.9 billion, consistent with both the House and Senate FAA reauthorization bills, and the fiscal year 2009 Concurrent Budget Resolution. 
   The bill also authorizes appropriations for FAA Operations, Facilities and Equipment (``F&E''), and Research, Engineering, and Development (``RE&D'') programs. 
   In addition, H.R. 6984 extends the aviation excise taxes through March 31, 2009. These taxes are necessary to support the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which in recent years has provided about 80 percent of the FAA's budget. With an uncommitted cash balance of just $1.4 billion estimated as of the end of fiscal year 2008, any lapse in the aviation taxes could put the solvency of the Trust Fund at risk. 
   In addition to extending the aviation taxes, H.R. 6984 extends the FAA's authority to make expenditures from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, through March 31, 2009. 
   To allow aviation programs to continue under the same terms and conditions as were in effect during the previous authorization period, H.R. 6984 also extends several other provisions of Vision 100. 
   I thank Chairman Rangel, Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, for his assistance in ensuring the continued operation of aviation programs. I also thank my Committee colleagues, Ranking Member Mica, Subcommittee Chairman Costello, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Petri, for working with me on this critical legislation. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6984.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 584, a bill to designate the Department of Education headquarters building located at 400 Maryland Avenue Southwest in the District of Columbia as the ``Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building.'' 
   I commend the gentleman from Texas, Mr. GREEN, and his colleagues of the Texas delegation, for their steadfast advocacy for this bill. In the 109th Congress, Mr. GREEN introduced a similar bill, H.R. 4252. Regrettably, the House did not take action on that legislation. 
   Lyndon Baines Johnson, ``the Teacher who became President,'' was one of the leading political figures of the 20th century. He served his country in ways too numerous to detail, including as lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Member of both houses of Congress, Vice President of the United States, and the 36th President of the United States. 
   President Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, TX. In 1927, he enrolled in Southwest Texas State Teachers College at San Marcos, TX--Texas State University--San Marcos. He took a leave of absence for a year to serve as principal and teach fifth, sixth, and seventh grades at Welhausen School, a school in the south Texas town of Cotulla. He graduated with a bachelor of science degree in August 1930. After graduation, he taught at Pearsall High School in Pearsall, TX, and taught public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston, TX. 
   In a special election in 1937, Johnson won the U.S. House of Representatives seat representing the 10th Congressional District of Texas, defeating nine other candidates. In the next election, he was re-elected to a full term in the 76th Congress and to each succeeding Congress until 1948. 
   After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Johnson became the first Member of Congress to volunteer for active duty in the Armed Forces--U.S. Navy, reporting for active duty on December 9, 1941. Johnson received the Silver Star from GEN Douglas MacArthur for gallantry in action during an aerial combat mission over hostile positions in New Guinea on June 9, 1942. President Roosevelt ordered all Members of Congress in the Armed Forces to return to their offices, and Johnson was released from active duty on July 16, 1942. 
   In 1948, he campaigned for and was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was elected minority leader of the Senate in 1953 and majority leader in 1955, where he served until January 1961, when he resigned to become Vice President. 
   Lyndon Johnson became the 36th President of the United States on November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
   During President Johnson's administration, education was one of the many areas where Johnson blazed new ground. He pursued numerous education initiatives, and signed many landmark education bills into law. 
   In 1963, President Johnson approved the Higher Education Facilities Act--P.L. 88-204--which authorized a 5-year program of Federal grants and loans for construction or improvement of public and private higher education academic facilities. This legislation created the largest education program since enactment of 
   the National Defense Education Act of 1958, and it was the first comprehensive education bill enacted in the post-World War II period that was not tied to national defense. 
   In 1964, President Johnson signed the Library Services Act--P.L. 88-269--to make high quality public libraries more accessible to both urban and rural residents. The funds made available under this act were used to construct as well as operate libraries, and to extend this program to cities as well as rural areas. Later that year, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act--P.L. 88-352--which, among its landmark provisions, authorized Federal authorities to sue for the desegregation of schools and to withhold Federal funds from education institutions that practiced segregation. 
   In 1965, President Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Act--P.L. 89-10. This legislation was the first general aid-to-education program ever adopted by Congress, and it provided programs to help educate disadvantaged children in urban and rural areas. Later that year, he also signed the Higher Education Act--P.L. 89-329, which was the first program approved by Congress for scholarships to undergraduate students. 
   President Johnson launched Project Head Start, as an 8-week summer program in 1965, to help break the cycle of poverty by providing pre-school children of low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs. Recruiting children ages three to school-entry age, Head Start was enthusiastically received by education and child development specialists, community leaders, and parents across the Nation. Currently, Head Start continues to serve children and their families each year in urban and rural areas in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories, including many American Indian and migrant children. 
   In 1966, President Johnson signed the International Education Act--P.L. 89-698, which promoted international studies at U.S. colleges and universities. 
   In 1968, he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments of 1967--P.L. 90-247, establishing bilingual education programs for non-English speaking children, and providing more funds for special education for disabled children. Later that year, President Johnson also signed the Handicapped Children's Early Education Assistance Act--P.L. 90-538, which authorized experimental programs for disabled children of pre-school age. 
   After leaving office, Lyndon Baines Johnson continued his involvement in education and taught students while he wrote his memoirs and pursued other academic endeavors. Lyndon Johnson died January 22, 1973. 
   Lyndon Baines Johnson will be remembered not only as a great President and Member of Congress, but also as a champion for education. Thus, it is very appropriate that the headquarters building of the Department of Education, located at 400 Maryland Avenue Southwest in the District of Columbia, be designated as the ``Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 584.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 399, a bill to designate the United States Courthouse to be constructed in Jackson, Mississippi, as the ``R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse''. 
   R. Jess Brown was born in Coffeeville, Kansas, on September 2, 1912. He was educated in the Muskogee Oklahoma public schools and received a Bachelor of Education Degree from Illinois State Normal University in 1935, and a Master of Education Degree from the University of Indiana in 1943. He attended Texas Southern Law School. 
   In 1948, he was a co -plaintiff in a suit for equal salaries for Jackson, Mississippi school teachers. 
   In 1953, he was admitted to the bar for the State of Mississippi and admitted to practice before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. In 1955, he co-founded the Magnolia Bar Association, and he later served on the Board of the National Bar Association for nearly 15 years. In 1958, he was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court.  
   As associate counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Brown filed the first civil rights suit in Mississippi in the 1950s in Jefferson Davis County, seeking the enforcement of the right of black citizens to become registered voters. In 1961, Brown represented James H. Meredith in his suit to enter the University of Mississippi; his victory in this case opened the doors of that university to all of Mississippi's citizens. While an associate with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, he played a major role in fighting discrimination in the areas of transportation and other public accommodations working along side Thurgood Marshall, who would later become Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. 
   Brown also served as counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, where he was successful in obtaining reversals of convictions of black defendants because of discrimination in jury selection. He also represented numerous black defendants in cases where the State sought the death penalty. As a result of these appeals, none of these defendants were ever executed. 
   R. Jess Brown died in Jackson, Mississippi, on January 2, 1990. 
   R. Jess Brown will be remembered as more than a brilliant attorney and civil rights leader; he will also be remembered as a great American. As such, it is very appropriate that the U.S. Courthouse in Jackson, Mississippi, be designated the ``R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse''. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 399.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 544, a bill to designate the United States Courthouse at South Federal Place, Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the ``Santiago E. Campos United States Courthouse''. 
   I commend the Gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. UDALL) for his steadfast support of this bill to honor an outstanding jurist. 
   Mr. UDALL introduced identical legislation in three previous Congresses--H.R. 5083 in the 107th Congress, H.R. 2274 in the 108th Congress, and H.R. 984 in the 109th Congress. Regrettably, the House never considered those bills. I am pleased that we are moving forward on this legislation today. 
   Santiago E. Campos was born on December 25, 1926, in Santa Rosa, New Mexico. He served in the United States Navy as a Seaman 1st Class from 1944 to 1946. After leaving the Navy, Judge Campos attended Central College in Fayette, Missouri, and received his law degree from the University of New Mexico in 1953, graduating first in his class. 
   From 1954 until 1957, he worked as an Assistant Attorney General and subsequently as First Assistant Attorney General for the State of New Mexico. After 14 years in private practice, Judge Campos was elected District Judge for the 1st Judicial District of New Mexico in 1971, and served in that capacity until 1978. In 1978, Judge Campos was appointed to the Federal Bench by President Jimmy Carter and began serving on July 20, 1978. 
   Judge Campos was the first Hispanic American to serve as a Federal Judge in the District Court of New Mexico, as well as the first Hispanic American to serve as its Chief Judge. He held the title of Chief U.S. District Judge from February 5, 1987, to December 31, 1989, and took senior status on December 26, 1992. Judge Campos died on January 20, 2002, after suffering a long bout with cancer.  
   During his career, Judge Campos was named an honorary member of the Order of the Coif. He also received the Distinguished Achievement Award of the State Bar of New Mexico in 1993, and in the same year the University of New Mexico honored him with a Distinguished Achievement Award. 
   H.R. 544 has received the unanimous endorsement of the Judges of the 10th Circuit Court in New Mexico and the district judges of the District of New Mexico. 
   In honor of Judge Campos's trailblazing legal career in New Mexico and his outstanding contributions to the legal profession, it is both fitting and proper to designate the courthouse located at South Federal Place in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the ``Santiago E. Campos United States Courthouse''. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 544.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TAUSCHER) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. ROGERS). 
   Our Nation is experiencing a public transportation renaissance. Last year, people took over 10.1 billion trips on public transportation. Transit experienced its highest ridership in 47 years. 
   Currently, transit use reduces U.S. gasoline consumption by approximately 1.4 billion gallons per year, or 3.9 million gallons per day. However, transit could play a much larger role in reducing our dependence on foreign oil if the traveling public had additional transit options. 
   One of the lowest cost modes of public transportation is vanpooling. Vanpooling is an arrangement by which commuters travel together in a van, usually 6 to 15 passengers. Vanpooling is used often in para-transit and special needs services, such as providing transportation services for the elderly. It is also used by employers to transport commuters to and from work. Vanpools provide transit services in a variety of ways. Public transportation agencies own and operate vanpools, and often times, the public agencies contract with private operators to provide vanpool service. 
   This amendment creates a new vanpool demonstration program through the Department of Transportation to explore the cost and energy efficiencies of transit vanpool services. It will enhance the ability of communities to offer vanpool transit services by providing State and local governments access to a Federal Transit Administration policy known as the ``Federal Capital Cost of Contracting'' policy. The provision simply provides local governments with an additional option for using Federal formula transit dollars. It also allows private sector vanpool providers to leverage private investment with Federal transit funds, by using private capital as a local match, in order to lower the cost of joining a vanpool. 
   It is estimated that this program could conserve over 500 million gallons of fuel per year and greatly reduce ozone emissions. The program will also provide commuters with increased transit services and options which will help reduce congestion nationwide without having an impact on the Federal budget. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Tauscher/Rogers amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The European community nations have achieved a remarkable milestone. They have achieved a 10 percent mode shift from automobiles to transit. The State of New Jersey has also achieved a mode shift to 10 percent of all travel by transit. If we can make that mode shift nationwide in the U.S., we will save the equivalent of all the oil we import from Saudi Arabia. That's 550 million barrels a year. 
   The recommendations from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure incorporated in this bill will move us in that direction. 
   We authorize $1.7 billion of capital operating funds for transit agencies to reduce fares and expand services, to purchase alternative fuel buses, alternative fuel locomotives, ferries, and refueling facilities. 
   If the alternative transit program had been continued with vigor, there was a very successful hydrogen bus initiative that produced vehicles that operated in Santa Barbara, California, that I had the privilege of going out there to ride in those buses. We can achieve those goals without a Manhattan Project or without a man on the moon project because we have the technology already in hand. 
   Our legislation also increases the Federal share for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement funds to increase incentives for States to use those funds. We authorize funding for the purchase of green locomotives and track improvements for short-line railroads. 
   The private line, private sector rail companies have had great success with their green goat switch engines in makeup yards for freight rails, producing vastly less particulates and CO  
   2 and NO 
   X in those areas which are very close to habited communities that feel mostly the effect of the noise and the air pollution, vast reductions in already existing technology with no loss in efficiency but also savings of cost. 
   We also authorize $2 billion in loan guarantees to establish a short sea shipping transportation program which would be very beneficial on the Great Lakes, would help reduce the congestion in Chicago, and would improve the coastwise trade on the east, west and gulf coast regions of the United States. 
   We also require GSA, General Services Administration, to install energy-efficient light bulbs in Federal buildings, including to photovoltaic systems. We require the Department of Energy to construct a sun wall on its headquarters. Actually, that building was constructed, the south wall, with no windows or doors to accommodate solar application. We reported that bill early in the work of our committee with the support of our ranking member, Mr. Mica, and enthusiastic bipartisan vote in the committee to use money out of the public building fund to build that wall so that at the end of the day the Department of Energy will pump excess electricity into the Pepco grid system and run all of the elevators, escalators, computers, lights, anything that runs on electricity by photovoltaics. We already have technology. We need to do that. Our provisions in this bill will, using what already exists to save energy, reduce costs. 
   And I just add one further item, and that is on the General Services Administration, our committee has jurisdiction over 366 million of square feet of Federal office space. The electricity bill annually is $5.8 billion. If we install photovoltaic cells on all those buildings, we can save 90 percent of that cost and save also the consumption of coal and natural gas, whatever it takes to produce the electricity for those buildings. 
   These are all realistic, within grasp, available technology initiatives that we bring to you in a very practical way. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I listened with interest to my good friend from Florida about our committee markup on this legislation, and I do think that a correction to the record is in order. 
   The Drake amendment would have amended the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program to allow construction of new single-occupancy vehicle lanes. That hardly contributes to energy conservation. CMAQ is intended for high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Ninety-eight percent of the STP and NHS programs can be used for single-occupancy vehicle lanes. CMAQ, since ISTEA in 1991, has been an energy conservation and air quality improvement program. That amendment would have set us back rather than moved us forward. 
   The L&G provision the gentleman referenced, the amendment was directed at a provision in the existing safety law legislation in the State of Massachusetts, one which the entire Massachusetts delegation supported in 2005, and the existing law and this provision would have overturned or significantly amended that language and was vigorously opposed by the entire Massachusetts delegation.

To reduce the cost, save the use of coal so that it can be directed to more important industrial purposes like producing steel, we do have an energy conservation and energy-creating program that we bring to the floor in our portion of this legislation. 
   I was actually out this morning myself helping the energy issue, consuming 900 calories on the seat of a bicycle, rather than consuming a gallon of gasoline in my car. 
   In fact, if we all did that, we could save that eight barrels of oil a year, consume 86,000 calories on the seat of a bicycle and convert from a hydrocarbon economy to the carbohydrating economy.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by Mr. Hoyer. In particular, this Manager's package includes two provisions submitted as an amendment by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure: a provision to help maximize the energy efficiency of the Capitol Power Plant, CPP, and a provision to help expand intercity bus service. I thank the Speaker and the gentleman from Maryland for including these important enhancements to the bill. 
   This amendment requires the Architect of the Capitol to operate the steam boilers and the chiller plant at the Capitol Power Plant in the most efficient manner possible. Adopting these changes will reduce the carbon emissions and energy required to operate the building of the House of Representatives and result in cost savings for the American people. 
   This provision implements recommendations outlined in the final report on the ``Green the Capitol'' initiative, which was issued and submitted to Congress on June 21, 2007. The recommendations draw on the research conducted by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkley Laboratory, LBL, on the operating practices of the CPP. According to this research, operation of the House buildings was responsible for approximately 91,000 tons of Carbon Dioxide-Equivalent Emissions (CO  
   2-e) emissions in fiscal year 2006. This value is equivalent to the annual (CO 
   2-e) emissions of 17,200 cars. 
   The LBL study determined that the current CPP practices do not take into account operating differences by season. Specifically, the chilled water temperature could be raised in the winter when less cooling is needed and the steam pressure could be lowered in the summer when less heat is needed. The level of steam pressure could be lowered overall because energy needs in the buildings have decreased over time. 
   The estimated cost of fine-tuning the steam pressure used to supply House office buildings is approximately $10,000 and results in an annual savings of $417,000 per year. The costs of tuning the boilers could be recouped in direct energy savings in just 1 week. The anticipated costs for optimizing the chilled water distribution to the House office buildings is approximately $25,000 and could save about $340,000 annually. The costs of this effort could be recouped in direct energy savings in just 1 month. 
   The amendment also will require the Architect of the Capitol to ensure the accuracy of the steam and chilled water meters in the House office buildings as part of standard maintenance practice, to maximize energy efficiency. 
   These are small changes, but they stand to have a big impact on improving the energy efficiency of the Capitol Power Plant, and in turn, reduce the energy consumption required to operate House buildings. This amendment allows the Federal Government to lead by example in the promotion of energy efficiency. 
   The Manager's package also makes technical corrections to the section of the bill authorizing grants to improve public transportation services. The bill provides that grant funds are to be used either to reduce public transportation fares or to expand public transportation service in both urban and rural areas. However, current law authorizes intercity buses to provide public transportation services between rural areas in order to provide additional, meaningful transit services to those areas. Therefore, in order for the grant funds provided under this bill to be used for eligible purposes under current law, this technical amendment is needed to authorize intercity bus services as an eligible use of grant funds. 
   I strongly support this amendment and urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (AUTHORIZING BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION TO CONSTRUCT A GREENHOUSE FACILITY -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5492, which authorizes the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to construct a greenhouse facility at its museum support facility in Suitland, Maryland. 
   The Smithsonian has leased a 55,000-square-foot greenhouse complex for its horticultural operations on the property of the Armed Forces Retirement Home (``AFRH'') in northwest Washington, DC, since 1974. The complex includes 12 greenhouses, space for administrative and logistical functions, and a shade house. The complex houses the Institution's world-class orchid collection, and provides space to grow a wide variety of plant materials for exhibits, gardens, and special events that would be costly or impossible to obtain commercially. 
   The AFRH plans to lease the property where the greenhouse complex is currently located to real estate developers and could turn the site over to a developer as early as September 30, 2008, when the current Smithsonian lease expires, leaving the Smithsonian without a greenhouse facility. 
   This bill authorizes $12 million for the construction of a new greenhouse facility. This facility will support the Office of Facilities Engineering and Operations (``OFEO'') of the Horticulture Services Division (``HSD''). This office provides services for the Smithsonian museums and units through planting for exhibits and special events, and through development and management of the Smithsonian public gardens. 
   I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) and the other congressional Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for introducing this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5492.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (HONORING 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF GALLATIN REPORT ON ROADS AND CANALS, AND RECOGNIZING THE VAST CONTRIBUTIONS NATIONAL PLANNING EFFORTS HAVE PROVIDED -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 936, which honors the 200th anniversary of the Gallatin Report on Roads and Canals, celebrates the national unity the Gallatin Report engendered, and recognizes the vast contributions that transportation improvements have provided to the United States. 
   With the acquisition of vast land area under the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and with the persistent westward migration of early settlers, the United States in the early 19th century was a young and rapidly expanding Republic. To President Thomas Jefferson, the architect of the Louisiana Purchase, uniting the United States and its people was of paramount importance. 
   President Jefferson directed his Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, to develop a national plan for transportation improvements to unite the country. Secretary Gallatin presented his report--the Gallatin Report on Roads and Canals, Gallatin Report--in 1808. 
   Mr. Speaker, Gallatin's national plan matched the Nation's hopes with the opportunities presented by a growing population, expanding territories, and widening markets. It recommended, for example, an inland waterway navigation canal from Massachusetts to North Carolina, which was the precursor to our present Intracoastal Waterway system. 
   As a result of Gallatin's national plan, the United States has achieved a number of important and significant transportation infrastructure improvements, including: 
   The Erie Canal that connected the east coast with the Great Lakes to reduce transportation costs to the interior of the country; 
   The transcontinental railway that linked the east and west coasts and united the country at a time of national discord; 
   The Tennessee Valley Authority that brought electric power, economic development, and employment opportunity to a region in need; 
   The National Highway System, including the Interstate System, that fostered transportation connectivity, promoted interstate commerce, and advanced national unity; and 
   Transit projects throughout the country that provided accessibility and choice. 
   This year marks the 200th anniversary of the Gallatin Report on Roads and Canals. H. Res. 936 honors the Gallatin Report and celebrates the national unity the Gallatin Report has engendered. 
   This resolution reaffirms the goals and ideals that prompted the development of the Gallatin Report 200 years ago. It commemorates the legacy of Gallatin's national plan for transportation improvements and the public investment in infrastructure the Gallatin Report helped bring forth. 
   Our Nation's surface transportation system is at a crossroads. As we continue the discussion of the future of the system, it is important to recognize the bold vision provided by Secretary Gallatin in his report. 
   The Gallatin Report should serve as a lasting reminder to this and future Congresses of the need for vision and leadership at the national level. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H. Res. 936 and urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (KIDS IN DISASTERS WELL-BEING, SAFETY, AND HEALTH ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3495, the ``Kids in Disasters Well-Being, Safety and Health Act of 2007''. 
   The importance of examining the special needs of children in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from emergencies and disasters cannot be overstated. Approximately one-fourth of the residents of areas damaged or flooded by Hurricane Katrina were under the age of 18. More than 400,000 children under the age of five lived in or were evacuated from counties or parishes declared as disaster areas by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (``FEMA''). 
   Hurricane Katrina exposed sobering vulnerabilities in our Nation's ability to meet the needs of children during disasters. As a result of Hurricane Katrina, 5,192 children were reported missing or displaced to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Stunningly, it took 6 1/2 months to reunite the last child separated from her family. The impact of this prolonged separation on a child, compounded by the other hardships related to dealing with a tragedy, is indeed profound. 
   In addition, 1,100 schools were closed immediately following Hurricane Katrina. Today, more than two years later, only 45 percent of New Orleans schools have reopened. 
   H.R. 3495 establishes the National Commission on Children and Disasters (``Commission'') to address the needs of children in disasters. 
   The purposes of the Commission are to: (1) conduct a comprehensive study to examine and assess the needs of children as they relate to preparing for, responding to, and recovering from all hazards, including major disasters and emergencies; (2) build upon and review the recommendations of other government and nongovernmental entities that work on issues relating to the needs of children in disasters; and (3) report to the President and Congress on its specific findings, conclusions, and recommendations. 
   The Commission will investigate special needs related to children's health, child welfare, elementary and secondary education, affordable housing, transportation, and relevant activities in emergency mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. The Commission is further charged with identifying, reviewing, and evaluating the lessons learned from past disasters and emergencies relative to addressing the needs of children. 
   I commend the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. BROWN) for introducing this important bill. I also thank Mark Shriver, Vice President and Managing Director of Save the Children, and the many children's advocacy groups that strongly support this legislation and have worked with us to bring this bill to the Floor expeditiously. 
   Children are a symbol of promise and rebirth. Protecting their safety, well-being, and health in the wake of a disaster must be a critically important priority of emergency management and preparedness. This Commission will help advance that goal. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3495, as amended.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, the President's veto of the Water Resources Development Act was pointless and unnecessary. 
   This legislation, which authorizes project authorizations, modifications, and studies for the breadth of authorities for the United States Army Corps of Engineers and for the entirety of the United States, represents a culmination of seven years of bipartisan, bicameral consensus to invest in our nation's future. 
   The Water Resources Development Act is vital for our nation's economic growth. 
   It is essential to maintaining the nation's competitiveness in the international marketplace. 
   It is necessary for the lives of our families, our neighbors, and our nation through the authorization of flood control structures, and hurricane and storm damage reduction projects throughout the country--but most notably for those living in the Gulf Coast region. 
   It is necessary for crucial navigation projects and studies, including the modernization of a portion of the largest inland waterway system in the United States--the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway System. 
   It is prudent for sustaining economic growth in our nation's industries--such as the revitalized iron ore and steel industries of the Great Lakes. 
   Finally, it is critical for the long-term, environmental health of the nation's ecosystems, including fulfilling our commitment to restore the Florida Everglades. 
   Enactment of the Water Resources Development Act is also significant because it represents the culmination of many years of debate on programmatic changes to the economic and environmental policies of the Corps of Engineers. 
   These changes, which have colloquially been referred to as ``Corps reform'', are noteworthy because they signify what can be accomplished when industry and the environmental community sit down, talk through their concerns, and mutually agree upon a set of changes to the way the Corps of Engineers formulates and carries out projects and studies within its missions. These programmatic changes will result in better studies, better projects, and hopefully, less controversy over the final recommendations of the Chief of Engineers. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 was approved by both bodies of Congress--the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States Senate--with overwhelming, bipartisan consensus. How can this legislation merit a Presidential veto? 
   For six years, this administration has done nothing to assist in the passage of a water resources bill. 
   For six years, there have been no draft administration proposals for a water resources bill. 
   For six years, this administration has done nothing to advance of the cause of investment  in our nation's water related infrastructure--its navigation projects, its flood damage reduction projects, and its environmental restoration projects. 
   For six years, this administration has been entirely disengaged from the water resources development process. Yet, at this late hour, and espoused to a newfound, self-ordained fiscal conservatism, the President comes to Congress to veto this legislation? This veto is an affront to the needs of the American people. 
   During the years of consensus building in Congress, there has been no participation by this administration to craft legislation to address the water resources needs of the nation. 
   The President says ``[This] bill lacks fiscal discipline.'' Yet, the administration will have an opportunity to influence future funding of projects and studies contained in this legislation through the annual President's budget request to Congress. 
   The President says ``[This] bill does not set priorities.'' Yet, the conference report to accompany H.R. 1495 authorizes several, high-priority projects for investment and restoration of the nation's water resources needs. 
   First, for farmers and other agricultural industries, internationally disadvantaged by aging and inferior locks and dams on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway System, this legislation authorizes the construction of seven new, 1,200-foot locks and other navigational improvements that will help move grains and other agricultural commodities to market faster and at a reduced cost. 
   For the environment, this legislation realizes the decades-long dream of restoring the Florida Everglades ecosystem by taking the first steps toward undoing the mistakes of the past and ensuring the vitality of this internationally recognized environmental treasure for generations to come. 
   For the communities devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, this legislation is essential to fulfilling the President's commitment to rebuild the Gulf Coast communities ``even better and stronger than before the storm.'' The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 authorizes the reconstruction of the flood walls and improvements to the interior drainage of the City of New Orleans, the closure of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (``MRGO''), and the initial steps to restore the coastal wetlands surrounding the Gulf Coast region. 
   For the Great Lakes region, this legislation is crucial to sustain and improve the movement of ores from the Iron Range of Minnesota through the Great Lakes to international markets. In addition, this legislation authorizes the construction of two barriers to halt the northward movement of the Asian Carp--one at the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, and the other at Lock and Dam 11 on the Upper Mississippi River System. These two barriers will help control the movements of this voracious fish, and sustain the fisheries of the Great Lakes communities. 
   This legislation also creates a rapid response authority for the Corps and other Federal agencies to control and prevent further spreading of viral hemorrhagic septicemia, or the VHS virus in the Great Lakes. VHS is an infectious viral disease of fish that has been linked to a multiplicity of fish kills. The virus has been a prolonged problem in Europe and Japan, and has now been confirmed in Lake Ontario, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, and the St. Lawrence River. Just this past January, it was detected in Lake Huron. With four different strains, the VHS virus spreads rapidly. However, it is unclear exactly how it spreads. We must study and attack this threat immediately, or else we face fish kills in the Great Lakes, a decline in the fishing industry, and economic repercussions. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are many national priorities in this legislation, as well as countless priorities for our local towns, communities, and constituents. Yet, why has the President chosen to veto this bill? 
   I can only surmise that the President has so far distanced himself from the water resources needs of this nation that he fails to recognize the importance of this legislation to the American people. 
   I urge my colleagues to quickly vote in support of this legislation, notwithstanding the Presidential veto, so that we may fulfill the commitments that the Federal Government has made to so many, and ensure the economic, environmental, and public health of this nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (GREAT LAKES--ST. LAWRENCE RIVER BASIN WATER RESOURCES COMPACT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 45, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. 
   In July, I, together with the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS, Jr.), Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATOURETTE), and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. EHLERS), introduced H.R. 6577, the ``Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact'', the House companion bill for the legislation that we consider today. 
   H.R. 6577 received the bipartisan support of almost 50 Great Lakes Members and the Committee on the Judiciary ordered the bill reported favorably to the House on July 30. However, to expedite implementation of the Compact, the House agreed to consider the Senate companion legislation (S.J. Res. 45), which the other body passed on August 1. Today, we hope to complete the long process for implementation of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact by sending this ``consent of Congress'' directly to the President, where he has said he will sign it. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important legislation for the protection of the Great Lakes for current and future generations. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Great Lakes are national and international treasures, serving as both the nation's largest fresh water resource and one of the largest systems of fresh water on earth--containing nearly 20 percent of the world supply. Formed by melting glaciers 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, the Great Lakes contain enough fresh water to cover the entire landmass of the continental United States to a depth of almost 10 feet. 
   Yet, despite their massive volume, the Lakes' water is a fragile resource. Rainfall and snowmelt replenish only about one percent of the water in the Great Lakes each year, with the remaining 99 percent of the volume being carried over from year-to-year. It is this unique circumstance that requires the nation, and  Congress, to be vigilant in protecting the waters of the Great Lakes for the use and sustainability of the environmental, economic, and public health of the Great Lakes Basin. 
   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has been integral in protecting the waters of the Great Lakes from water diversions. In the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (``WRDA 1986''), the Committee required that each of eight Great Lakes States consent to any diversion of water from the Great Lakes Basin. WRDA 1986 prohibited any diversion of Great Lakes water by any State, Federal agency, or private entity for use outside the Great Lakes Basin without the consent of each of the eight Governors of the Great Lakes States. 
   Unfortunately, however, the waters of the Great Lakes are still at risk. 
   In 1998, Congress learned of a plan, approved by the Canadian province of Ontario, to export up to 160 million gallons of water from Lake Superior for sale to Asia. After this incident, a decision was made by the Governors of the eight Great Lakes States and Congress to strengthen Federal and interstate protections of Great Lakes waters. 
   In the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure strengthened the prohibition on diversions of Great Lakes waters by explicitly prohibiting exports, and ``encourage[d] the Great Lakes, in consultation with the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, to develop and implement a mechanism that provides a common conservation standard embodying the principles of water conservation and resource improvement for making decisions concerning the withdrawal and use of water from the Great Lakes Basin.'' 
   This ``common conservation standard'' is embodied in the Great Lakes--St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact (``Compact''), as proposed for the consent of Congress in S.J. Res. 45. The protections contained in the Compact are consistent with the underlying prohibition of diversions and exports of Great Lakes water without consent of all eight Great Lakes States under section 1109 of WRDA 1986. In addition, the Compact should be viewed as supplementary to current laws and regulations, and as an effort by the eight Great Lakes States and Congress to strengthen protections already in place. 
   First, the Compact establishes that ``all new or increased diversions of Great Lakes waters are prohibited,'' except within the limited exceptions contained in the Compact. 
   The Compact also requires each of the Great Lakes States to regulate any proposed new or increased withdrawals of Great Lakes water so as to not ``physically impact'' the waters and water-dependent natural resources of the Basin, including the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the Basin watersheds. 
   In addition, the Compact establishes a process for the inventory, registration, and reporting of Great Lakes water withdrawals, diversions, and consumptive uses within the Basin. 
   With respect to small-scale water uses, such as bottled water, beer, and canned goods, the Compact allows individual States to choose how to regulate smaller transfers of water in products. For example, the State of Michigan chose to regulate bottled water under the Compact by requiring producers to obtain a permit for new or increased water withdrawals of more than 200,000 gallons per day. Under Michigan law, a permit may be granted if, among other requirements, there are no individual or cumulative adverse impacts, the water withdrawal is reasonable under state common law principles, and the producer has certified that it is in compliance with water conservation measures. This state program ensures that bottled water proposals receive careful scrutiny. 
   It is time for the U.S. House of Representatives to join with the Governors and State legislatures of all eight Great Lakes States, the U.S. Senate, and the administration in support of the Great Lakes--St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S.J. Res. 45.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (OREGON SURPLUS FEDERAL LAND ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6370, the ``Oregon Surplus Federal Land Act of 2008'', introduced by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio). 
   H.R. 6370 transfers 24 acres of federally owned land, which includes the Cape Arago Light Station, in Coos County, Oregon, from the Coast Guard to the Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust for the benefit of the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians. The Commandant shall transfer the Light Station within 5 years of the date of enactment of this Act. 
   The Cape Arago Light Station no longer functions as an aid to navigation since the light has been extinguished. Over the past decade, the Coast Guard has been disposing of its lighthouses and has determined it no longer needs the property at Cape Arago. This is beneficial to the Confederated Tribes and they are eager to manage the land since it once served as a burial site and is sacred to them. 
   Under the bill, the Confederated Tribes are prohibited from selling, conveying, assigning, exchanging or encumbering the property in the future without the approval of the Secretary. The Tribes are also prohibited from conducting any commercial activities on the property without the approval of the Secretary. The property with the Light Station is to be made available to the general public for educational, park, recreational, cultural, or historic preservation purposes. 
   The Committee attempted to obtain maps of the actual property that is being transferred from the Coast Guard to the Secretary of the Interior. However, the Coast Guard has been unable to develop formal maps of the area yet. Therefore, the Coast Guard and the Secretary will have to develop maps depicting the property being transferred. This has been done numerous times before--such as in the conveyance of Sentinel Light Station in Alaska in the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-293) and the conveyance of the Naval Reserve Pier in Portland, Oregon, Slip Point Light Station in Callam County, Washington, and Point Pinos Light in Monterey County, California, in the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-295). 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6370. 
   Finally, I insert in the Record an exchange of letters between Chairman Nick J. Rahall, II, Chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, and me.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6524, a bill to authorize the Administrator of General Services to transfer parcels of real property in Eastlake, Ohio, and Koochiching County, Minnesota. 
   The Koochiching parcel is approximately 5 1/2 acres located at 1804 3rd Avenue in International Falls, Koochiching, Minnesota. The Koochiching Army Reserve Training Center site includes the U.S. Army Armory Building. The bill transfers the property to Koochiching County, which will pay to have the roof replaced, install a new boiler and heating system, and make extensive repairs to the ceiling. The Army reported the property excess in January 2006 and the General Services Administration, GSA, accepted the report of excess in February 2006. GSA screened the property with other Federal agencies but there were no expressions of interest. 
   The conveyance will be by quitclaim deed and the County of Koochiching will pay $30,000 to GSA for the real property transfer. The General Services Administration will forward to the Secretary of the Army the net proceeds from the Koochiching transfer. 
   The parcel of real property in Eastlake is an approximate 10-acre site which includes the John F. Kennedy Senior Citizen Center. In 1964, the city of Eastlake purchased the property and, consistent with the deed restriction, used the site for recreational uses for more than 40 years. The bill will lift the deed restrictions and thus allow the city to use the property for economic development purposes. The city of Eastlake has provided a better location for the senior citizens center. The city of Eastlake will pay $30,000 to GSA for the real property transfer. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6524.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is one that has not only bipartisan but bicameral agreement among all the committees of jurisdiction over the Nation's highways, highway safety and public transportation programs. Our Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the Senate Committees on Environment and Public Works, Banking and Housing and Urban Affairs and Commerce, Science and Transportation, all of us met, discussed, agreed on these technical corrections. 
   In fact, in the last Congress, we were so much in agreement that we passed this bill five times in the House. They passed it a couple of times in the other body. But somehow it just never got to the point of being sent to the President. 
   We took it up again this year. We were going to include it in the Water Resources Development Act, but at the last moment, technical glitches arose in the other body. 
   So we are taking it up separately in this body in order to pass it and send it over to the other body. Hopefully, they will be able to act on it before the end of the week and send it to the President for the President's signature. 
   There are over 400 technical corrections, really, truly technical in nature, waiting for 2 years to be adjusted and to be enacted. Tonight we can do that.

A school bus that had just barely missed crashing into the water was damaged, and students on board were bloodied and injured.     
   The crumbled wreckage of the bridge is on the east bank and in the water. The concrete roadway is in the river gorge. It is a 40-year-old bridge, and it is a tragic occurrence, and I make that observation during the midst of technical corrections as an indication of how vitally important it is for us to continue our vigilance on the integrity and condition of the Nation's roadways.

That's going to be reaffirmation of the strong stand the House has taken on these, and they truly are technical matters. We ought to just get them passed so that we can get over, so the States and the Federal Government agencies can get on with the work they need to undertake and that these adjustments to Members' projects can be made and be carried forward. 
   That's really what this is all about, and other matters that go beyond the scope of this current technical correction we will address in future legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   At the very outset, I want to, on this historic day and historic occasion, express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Florida, the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Mica, for the time that he has devoted and the close cooperation that we've enjoyed in crafting this legislation. 
   We reached an agreement at the very outset of this session that we would take up the work of the last 6, really 7 years on three previous Congresses on the Water Resources Development Act and limit action in this Congress to only those measures that were in the previous three Congresses and not take up new measures, not take up new initiatives by Members, not even adjusting the cost of previously approved projects on which cost escalation may have occurred, and limit the scope of the legislation to the work of three previous Congresses, and also to comply with the rules of the House in getting sign-offs from Members on both sides as the ethics rules require. 
   We crafted our sign-off sheet in advance of that done by any other committee in the House, got it approved by the Ethics Committee and by the Parliamentarian. We went through all these sign-off sheets, did everything according to the book, and in roughly 6 weeks from the beginning of the session, we were ready to go to the floor in March with the House version of the Water Resources Development Act. 
   Regrettably, it took quite some time thereafter for the other body, because of the difference in procedures and rules in their body from those in ours, for them to get to this point, but they eventually moved through committee and through the other body their version of WRDA. 
   We've concluded a conference, and I have to say, in 6 years, this is a very extraordinary, historic accomplishment, and I'm very grateful for the cooperation we've had and the participation every step of the way on the Republican side on this committee in the historic tradition of our committee, a very bipartisan approach. 
   I express great appreciation to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), Chair of the Subcommittee on Water Resources. She devoted an enormous amount of her time in working through all of the 900-plus projects that come to the floor in this conference report, the 600-plus projects that were in the original House bill; and to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker), who equally devoted an enormous amount of his time to the subject matter before us. 
   It's that kind of time and effort and consideration that brought us to the point where we have a bill that I expect will pass with an overwhelming vote. 
   I will make a further observation, and that is, for me, as I said at the  opening meeting of our committee on January 17, a very historic and nostalgic moment. I started in this body 44 years ago as clerk of the Subcommittee on Rivers and Harbors, and now I'm chairman of the full committee. That's not happened before in the House nor the other body, and I feel very privileged, very honored, very deeply moved to be here at this moment to see passage of this impressive legislation that will make significant changes in Corps policy and programs, review of Corps projects that will deal with the restoration of the wetlands in the gulf from Texas through Louisiana and Mississippi; restoration of the Everglades, one of the Nation's greatest water resource treasures; will deal with locks and dams on the Mississippi River to expedite passage of our agricultural commodities and international trade in which grain moves on as little as an eighth of a cent a bushel. 
   It now takes 820 hours round trip for a barge tow to move from Clinton, Iowa, to New Orleans, the world's most important grain export facility. We can take 60-plus hours of time off that transit and make our agriculture commodities more competitive in the international marketplace. 
   We can restore the efficiency of commerce on the Great Lakes by accelerating the dredging of the Great Lakes during this period of drought where we have harbor depths that are down 58 inches in Cleveland, 18 inches in St. Mary's Canal, 54 inches in Ashtebula Harbor, preventing the movement of iron ore to the steel mills, coal to the power plants at competitive prices. We're having to make two, three, four more voyages per vessel in the Great Lakes because the Corps has not been doing the dredging it needs to do. It will do that under the provisions of this legislation. 
   We address the issues of invasive species in the Great Lakes, and the east and the west coast and the gulf coast parts are now being invaded by species brought in from waters foreign to our lands. Mr. Ehlers, for whom I have a great admiration and respect, has been such a strong advocate. 
   There's much, much more in this legislation. We need not be exhaustive in discussing it. I just say I'm very grateful to all our colleagues on the committee for this very special moment, and especially to the committee staff on both sides who have worked so diligently. And in particular, I want to express my great admiration for Ryan Seiger, for he has steered the ship of state for us on this matter; John Anderson on the minority side who was has been diligent and forthright and helpful with his years of experience.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Florida for his splendid cooperation, his heartfelt earnestness on getting this legislation through and understanding the great significance it represents for all of us. 
   I want to emphasize once again, we exercise great discipline in this body in shaping the legislation, keeping the costs within containment, within the previous 6, almost 7 years of projects that had already been vetted through the House, passed by this body and yet, unfortunately, didn't make it through the Senate. 
   I read with heavy heart the administration statement of veto. I think that it's a misunderstanding on their part. We will do our part, we will do our role, and the other body will do its part. Then we will see whether, in fact, a veto comes forward. If it does, we will deal with it just straightforwardly, without rancor, without discussion. These are the right investments for America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the distinguished Chair of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment and thank her once again for the splendid work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I compliment the gentleman on his statement and his recognition of underscoring the importance of the Mississippi River-Illinois-Ohio River system as the water highway for our midcontinent grain producers. 
   If you look at a map of the north and south hemisphere, the furthest point of Brazil sticks out of the South Atlantic Ocean, and that is Recife. From that port are exported soybeans. That is 2,500 miles further out in the Atlantic than New Orleans. They market to the same destinations that we do for soybeans, we in the great Midwest, to east and west Africa, and to the Pacific rim. They have a 5-day or 6-day sail advantage. 
   If we don't do the modernization on the locks, we continue to lose market share in the world marketplace. As I said earlier, grain moves on as little as an eighth of a cent a bushel. 
   So we have to do this, and it is going to be done. It has waited far too long.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman very much for his kind words, for his prayers and his thoughts about our fellow Minnesotans and the tragedy that's occurred this evening; and I join my prayers with his and those of my colleagues who spoke earlier this evening on that bridge collapse. We certainly keep the members, the family members and the victims in our prayers as we go forth this evening. 
   We reach a milestone this evening with this legislation. I said at the outset and I say it again, this is a historic moment. We have accomplished in 7 months what it has taken 7 years to put together, but it is a good bill, and it is evidence that this body can and does work together constructively for the common good, for the purpose of building a better Nation, for moving people and goods efficiently and effectively in the domestic economy. 
   Getting us to this point was not easy. The staff had to put in long hours, as the gentleman from Florida already expressed.     
   I want to specifically mention Ryan Seiger, Beth Goldstein, Ted Illston and Mike Brain on the Democratic side; John Anderson, Geoff Bowman, William Collum and Tracy Mosebey on the Republican side; Rod Hall, Chairwoman Johnson's staff member; Stewart Crigler, staffer for Ranking Member Baker. 
   From the Office of Legislative Counsel: David Mendelsohn, Curt Haensel, Heather Arpin over in the Senate, and Rosemary Gallagher. 
   And from the Senate staff: Ken Kopocis, Jeff Rosato, Tyler Rushford, Angie Giancarlo, Jo-Ellen Darcy, Mike Quiello and Let Mon Lee. 
   All worked very closely together to craft this legislation, spending enormous amounts of time, weekends. While Members were back home in their respective districts, staff were here in this oppressive heat of Washington, although, I think, comforted by air conditioning at least, but putting in extraordinarily long hours to craft this bill, bridge the gaps, reach agreements, report back to Members so that we could be here this evening. 
   It is a significant moment for America, for this Congress to have this comprehensive water resources bill together. And, again, I express great appreciation to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) for the time that he has spent and the cooperation that we have had; the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for the time that she has devoted, for her care, concern, and energy; and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker), who put his heart and soul into this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, the Corps has long had authority to terminate dams, but it has been reluctant to use it. In the conference report, we make that authority explicit with the intention that the Corps will be invigorated to evaluate dams in a broader context. 
   But I think it is important for us to hold hearings so that the issues are aired fairly, equitably, scientifically, and engineeringwise, so rather than just have these things go on and conducted by bloggers and in some other unscientific way, let's put the issues on the record, and we will consult with the gentleman and the gentleman from Oregon on appropriate subjects and witnesses as we go through and proceed toward these hearings.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.J. Res. 20, the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution for Fiscal Year (FY) 2007. I commend Chairman OBEY and our House Leadership for bringing this Joint Resolution to the floor. While a Resolution such as this is not the ideal way to fund Government programs, the failure of the last Congress to complete its work left us with no viable alternative. In a very limited amount of time, the Appropriations Committee has done yeoman's work to bring the FY 2007 appropriations cycle to a close in the Resolution that is before us today. 
   Many difficult choices had to be made in this Joint Resolution. I am pleased that one of those choices was to fund highway, transit, and highway safety programs at the levels guaranteed by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). Under H.J. Res. 20, highway programs will be funded at $38.962 billion, an increase of $3.411 billion over FY 2006 enacted levels; transit programs will be funded at $8.975 billion, an increase of $470 million over FY 2006; motor carrier safety programs will be funded at $520.5 million, an increase of $30 million over FY 2006; and highway safety programs will be funded at $821 million, an increase of $14 million over FY 2006. 
   These programs are funded by highway user revenues that have been deposited into the Highway Trust Fund, where they are held in trust for the purpose of meeting our surface transportation infrastructure needs. These needs are reaching crisis proportions. Congestion has worsened dramatically in recent years. In 2003, traffic congestion cost motorists $63.1 billion in terms of wasted time and fuel. 
   In addition to meeting our infrastructure investment needs, the highway and transit funding levels set by this Joint Resolution will create an additional 192,000 family-wage construction jobs. 
   I would also like to mention one aviation-related matter. Under the previous Continuing Resolution, there was a technical anomaly that had the effect of reducing the amount of Airport Improvement Program contract authority  well below the intended program level. I am pleased that H.J. Res. 20 corrects this anomaly, and further, ensures that the full amount of contract authority that is authorized for the Airport Improvement Program in FY 2007 remains available. This will set the stage for a successful reauthorization of Federal aviation programs later this year, and I thank the Appropriations Committee for their assistance in this matter. 
   All too often, long-term investments in our nation's infrastructure are short-changed in the face of the more immediate need to fund day-to-day operations. This Joint Resolution avoids such a short-sighted approach. Instead, it takes a longer-term view and recognizes the far-reaching effects transportation infrastructure investments have on our nation's economy, our competitiveness in the world marketplace, and the quality of life in our communities. Again, I applaud Chairman OBEY and House Leadership for recognizing the value of fully funding highway and transit programs, and I urge my colleagues to support the Joint Resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION FACILITIES AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6627, the ``Smithsonian Facilities Authorization Act of 2008''. 
   H.R. 6627 authorizes the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to design and construct laboratory space to accommodate the Mathias Laboratory at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (``SERC'') in Edgewater, Maryland. The bill also authorizes the Board of Regents to construct laboratory space to accommodate the terrestrial research program of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (``STRI'') in Gamboa, Panama. 
   The SERC is a global leader in the study of ecosystems in coastal zones. Founded on the site of an abandoned 1930s dairy farm in Edgewater, Maryland, the SERC facilities include farm buildings, the Mathias Laboratory, 10 temporary trailers, an administrative building, and a variety of lab support spaces. Nearly one-half of SERC's 146 employees and fellows conduct the majority of their work in trailers. A major part of SERC's mission is to conduct research and professional training of the next generation of environmental scientists. 
   The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution requested authority to design and construct laboratory space to accommodate the Mathias Laboratory at SERC. The Board requested authority to upgrade and replace the facility to eliminate unsafe trailers and address substandard, inefficient labs. The facility and its support spaces need to be replaced. The bill authorizes a total of $41 million for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 to design and construct the Mathias Laboratory. 
   The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute is located in Gamboa, Panama. STRI is the principal United States organization devoted to research in tropical biology. Both scientific advancement and human welfare depend on a continuing commitment to research in tropical biology for such things as finding untapped tropical resources to add to the important supply of food, pharmaceuticals, and fiber that we already get from the tropics, and to give us a better understanding of how to avoid further ecological catastrophes such as drought, starvation, and flooding caused by deforestation and overpopulation of tropical regions. 
   The STRI facility is a world-renowned research and education center dedicated to research and analysis of tropical ecosystems. The Board of Regents requested authority to replace current science building structure that is heavily infested with termites. The bill authorizes a total of $14 million for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 to construct the laboratory. 
   Madam Speaker, over the past two years, the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution has worked to address numerous management shortfalls. I look forward to working with the Board of Regents and the new Secretary of the Smithsonian, Secretary G. Wayne Clough, as we continue to work together to improve the Smithsonian's management practices and carry out James Smithson's mandate of 1826: ``for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.'' 
   I thank Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Ranking Member Mica, Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton, Committee on House Administration Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Ehlers, the Smithsonian Congressional Regents, Mr. Becerra, Ms. Matsui, and Mr. Johnson of Texas, and Majority Leader Hoyer for their support in authorizing construction funding of these two vital Smithsonian facilities. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6627, the ``Smithsonian Institution Facilities Authorization Act of 2008''.-

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (RECOGNIZING NORTH PLATTE, NEBRASKA, AS ``RAIL TOWN USA'' -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 408, recognizing North Platte, Nebraska, as ``Rail Town USA.'' 
   North Platte has a rich tradition of railroading. The Union Pacific Railroad flrst entered North Platte on December 3, 1866, as  railroads were building into the West and just one month later, on January 2, 1867, main line operations began through the city of North Platte. 
   During World War II, the city was best known for the North Platte Canteen, which served as a major rest point for soldiers heading across the country by rail to fight in the war. The people of North Platte famously brought food, water, and other necessities to more than 6 million members of the armed forces passing through the city. 
   Today, North Platte is served only by freight trains, but it is home to one of the most important rail yards in the world. The Bailey Yard, named after former Union Pacific President Ed Bailey, is now recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the world's largest classification yard. It sits on 2,850 acres of land in North Platte, is 8 miles long, and is home to 315 miles of track. 
   Bailey Yard prepares approximately 135 trains, or 10,000 individual rail cars, each day, shipping home products, food, coal, lumber, and many other necessary goods destined for every corner of the country. 
   North Platte's contribution to the rail industry increased in the 1990s when Bailey Yard added east- and west-bound locomotive fueling and servicing centers that now handle more than 8,500 locomotives per month. 
   Railroads are often considered a barometer of the American economy. When trains are moving--America is moving. To watch cars pass through Bailey Yard is to see America moving forward, and the people of North Platte are at the center of Bailey Yard's success: more than 2,600 residents of North Platte work at Bailey Yard, which makes up more than 10 percent of North Platte's population of 23,878. 
   This weekend, North Platte is celebrating its railroading heritage at Rail Fest, where attendees will get the chance to see historic rail cars and locomotives, tour Bailey Yard, learn about each job in the rail yard through actual hands-on training, learn about railroad safety, and learn more about the history of railroading in North Platte. 
   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Notth Platte for their successes and urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to H. Con. Res. 480, recognizing North Platte, Nebraska, as ``Rail Town USA''.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (GREAT LAKES LEGACY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6460, the Great Lakes Legacy Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   This legislation is designed to address the toxic legacy of the Great Lakes' industrial past that is currently putting residents of the Great Lakes region in harms way. Residents of the region have long been waiting for the remediation of these contaminated sites and it is the responsibility of this Congress to ensure that they do not wait any longer. 
   The history of the Great Lakes' region has largely been defined by the industrial successes of its past. For more than 2 centuries, the Lakes have provided residents of the region with sources of power and abundant natural resources, as well as transportation for the residents and manufactured goods of the basin. The Lakes have served as a catalyst that brought about growth and economic prosperity to not only the region, but also to the country as a whole. 
   The growth and expansion of the region's commerce and economy, however, did not come about without negative consequences. Along with it came unrestrained pollution of the Great Lakes watershed. Sadly, for the most part, this contamination remains today and continues to affect the region's residents. 
   In 2002, Congress enacted the Great Lakes Legacy Act to remediate contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes' areas of concern. This Act brought attention and awareness to the areas of concern, and also provided much needed funding for remediation sites. 
   This Congress has been tasked with reauthorizing the Act, but has also been afforded the opportunity to address the shortfalls of the initial legislation. For instance, during a hearing before the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, many Members from the Great Lakes region expressed concern with the pace of cleanup of areas of concern. 
   In our view, the delay is the result of an incomplete knowledge of the contamination present at sites within the areas of concern, as well as a lack of funding to address the 70 different contaminated sediment sites with the U.S. areas of concern. 
   Madam Speaker, for far too long, residents of the Great Lakes region have been waiting for cleanup of these toxics sites. 
   H.R. 6460, the Great Lakes Legacy Reauthorization Act of 2008, will accelerate remediation of the areas of concern. It is my hope that this legislation will advance the pace of cleanup of contaminated sites in the Great Lakes and also ensure that parties responsible for the contamination are held liable. 
   Madam Speaker, I applaud the efforts of my Committee colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. EHLERS), for his unremitting work during the 107th Congress on the passage of the initial Great Lakes Legacy Act, as well as for his work on this important legislation that the House considers today. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6460, the ``Great Lakes Legacy Reauthorization Act of 2008''. 
   I insert in the RECORD an exchange of letters between the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Science and Technology.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3986, as amended, the ``John F. Kennedy Center Reauthorization Act of 2008''. 
   The Kennedy Center is one of the world's preeminent cultural centers. More than a physical memorial, the Kennedy Center acts as a  living memorial for performance arts programming and education. The Kennedy Center is the Nation's busiest arts facility, presenting more than 3,000 performances in 2006 and hosting millions of theater goers, visitors, and tourists. The Kennedy Center also provides educational programs for teachers and students from pre-kindergarten through college across the United States. 
   H.R. 3986, as amended, authorizes the Kennedy Center's capital and maintenance program for the next 5 years. The bill authorizes a total of $112.5 million for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for maintenance, repair, and security projects for the Kennedy Center. The bill also authorizes a total of $91.7 million for capital projects for the Kennedy Center during this period. These authorization levels are derived from the Kennedy Center's 2006/2007 Comprehensive Building Plan. 
   Over the past 10 years, the priorities for Kennedy Center capital improvements were life safety and accessibility projects. With the pending completion of these projects, the current Comprehensive Building Plan emphasizes facility infrastructure. In some past projects, such as theater renovations, the mechanical and electrical infrastructure scope has been limited to replacement of renovated space. The primary building mechanical and electrical systems consist of original equipment and those elements not previously replaced are reaching the end of normative service life, are showing signs of failure or impending breakdown, or are deteriorating. The bill authorizes systematic rehabilitation of these primary mechanical and electrical systems. 
   In addition, the bill authorizes the Kennedy Center to study, plan, design, and construct a photovoltaic system on the 4-acre (140,000 square foot) main roof of the Kennedy Center. According to a preliminary estimate by the Kennedy Center, a photovoltaic system would cost approximately $6 million to construct and would yield savings of approximately $10.2 million over the next 25 years.

The Smithsonian Institution has set up the telescope at this site on an interim basis and the VERITAS Science Consortium and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory request that the VERITAS telescope remain at the Whipple Observatory for the rest of its scientific life. As a result, the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution requests an amendment to Public Law 108331 to authorize the Board to locate the VERITAS telescope at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Base Camp on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, or other similar location.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, this is the moment that a majority of Americans who voted last November have been waiting for, a time when Congress does something about Iraq. And that something that the people asked of us is to get us out of Iraq. 
   The resolution before us will not of itself get U.S. forces out of Iraq, but to paraphrase Winston Churchill, if it is not the end, it is at least the beginning of the end. 
   Our President is having trouble understanding the message from the American people. It is a simple message that I hear every time I go back home to Minnesota. Time to bring our troops home with honor. The people are telling me our mission in Iraq is accomplished. The President already declared victory. The goals of the U.S. invasion have been met. 
   Iraq's army was defeated, Saddam Hussein removed from power and brought to judgment. The Iraqi people held elections to establish a new government. Mission accomplished. Time to bring the troops home with honor. 
   No weapons of mass destruction were found, despite extensive searches. The Iraqis have a government, they have an army, a police force. There is no further purpose of American policy to be served by a continued military presence in Iraq. 
   What remains in Iraq is religious warfare between Sunni and Shia, with our troops caught in the crossfire. This is not the job our troops signed up for. This is not the war President Bush sold to Congress. People are telling the President, it is time to bring the troops home and to do it with honor. 
   President Bush has said he is concerned this resolution is prejudging the outcome of our involvement in Iraq. I would say the outcome is not in doubt. We have spent and are continuing to spend $9 billion a month in Iraq; 3,122 of our servicemen and -women have been killed; 23,550-plus have been wounded; tens of thousands more Iraqis killed and wounded. The violence is escalating, our troops are the targets. 
   I do not think this resolution prejudges anything. The facts speak for themselves. And the people are saying bring the troops home with honor. I did not support this war at its outset. We had Saddam Hussein contained. Al Qaeda was not in Iraq. We had a job to do in Afghanistan. I supported going into Afghanistan to capture Osama bin Laden. But I saw no clear rationale for sending troops into combat in Iraq. 
   The resolution does offer a statement of support for the troops. Their service is an extraordinary gift. They volunteer to leave their homes and families and risk their lives every day, at the order of the President. All they ask is that we never ask them to go to conflict unless that conflict is absolutely necessary and in the national interest. 
   Lieutenant General William Odom, in a recent article in The Washington Post said, about the question that we have to continue to fight in order to support the troops, has anyone asked the troops? During their first tours, many may have favored staying the course. But now in their second, third, fourth tours, he writes, many are changing their minds. 
   We see no evidence of that in the news stories about unhappy troops being sent back to Iraq. The strangest aspect of the rationale, General Odom writes, for continuing the war is the implication that our troops are somehow responsible for deciding to continue the President's course. 
   That political and moral responsibility belongs to the President, not to the troops. Didn't Harry Truman make it clear that the buck stops in the Oval Office? The President keeps dodging it. Where does it stop, General Odom asks, with Congress? And that is why we are here today to say it is up to us to make a definitive statement with this resolution, a statement that it is time to end the U.S. involvement in Iraq, to bring the troops home with honor. And then if the President does not heed, then we must take more vigorous steps, steps that I voted for in coming to end the U.S. involvement in Vietnam over 32 years ago. 
   If that is what it takes, then we have to say that the buck stops with us in the Congress to stop the U.S. engagement in Iraq.

   The United States Capitol and its iconic dome are symbols of democracy around the world; symbols of the deliberative legislative process, a place where people debate in the realm of ideas not with arms, swords, or bombs but with minds and ideas. As America has grown and changed over its history, so has the Capitol. Beginning next year, the Capitol will have an extraordinary new addition, the Capitol Visitor Center. The CVC represents the largest addition to the U.S. Capitol in its 212-year history. 
   This facility will host the more than three million people who visit the Capitol on an annual basis. The great hall will include information and ticketing desks, and provide an area where Americans from all over the country can gather to take in scenic views of the Capitol or prepare to explore the 580,000-square-foot Visitor Center. The CVC will also include an exhibition gallery, a 550-seat cafeteria, gift shops, and orientation theaters. 
   The CVC will provide an opportunity for visitors to learn about the construction of the Capitol from its very beginning. This education would not be complete without an acknowledgement of the contribution slave labor. 
   In 2004, Congress directed the Architect of the Capitol to produce a report on the history of slave labor in the construction of the United States Capitol. Although the record is incomplete because of limited documentation of slave labor, the evidence available and historical context provide several indications that slaves and free African Americans played a significant role in building these historical monuments.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2403, a bill to designate the United States courthouse, located at 700 East Broad Street, Richmond, Virginia, as the ``Spottswood W. Robinson III and Robert R. Merhige, Jr., United States Courthouse''. Spottswood W. Robinson III and Robert R. Merhige, Jr., were appointed to the Federal bench by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and 1967, respectively. Judge Robinson graduated from Howard University Law School, was a prominent civil rights lawyer, and was appointed by President Kennedy to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Judge Merhige graduated from the University of Richmond, served in the U.S. Army, and was considered one of the most formidable lawyers in Virginia. Judge Merhige was known for presiding over several high-profile cases and was noted for ordering the University of Virginia to admit women. 
   Both judges served with distinction and played a key role in the racial integration of Virginia schools so it is fitting and proper to name the U.S. courthouse in Richmond, Virginia, as the ``Spottswood W. Robinson III and Robert R. Merhige, Jr., United States Courthouse''. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of S. 2403, the ``Spottswood W. Robinson III and Robert R. Merhige, Jr., United States Courthouse''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2837, a bill to designate the U.S. courthouse located at 225 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, New York, as the ``Theodore Roosevelt United States Courthouse''. This bill honors former President Theodore Roosevelt, who at various times served as a member of the United States Civil Service Commission, President of the New York Board of Police Commissioners, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and as a Colonel of a voluntary cavalry regiment of the United States Army during the Spanish-American War, which became known as ``Roosevelt's Rough Riders''. 
   President Roosevelt also has the distinction of becoming, at the age of 42 in 1901, the youngest serving president at that time. During his two terms in office, President Roosevelt's list of achievements include facilitating and ensuring the construction of the Panama Canal, establishing the Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor, signing the Elkins Anti-Rebate Act for railroads, and greatly advancing environmental conservation efforts by providing Federal protection for close to 230 million acres of land. He was also awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906, for his work in ending the Russo-Japanese War. 
   Becaue of his honorable and distinguished service it is appropriate to name the U.S. courthouse in Brooklyn, New York, as the ``Theodore Roosevelt United States Courthouse''.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (INTEGRATED DEEPWATER PROGRAM REFORM ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, today, the House considers H.R. 2722, the ``Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act''. This legislation is the product of the lessons learned from a series of hearings delving into the Coast Guard's Deepwater program. 
   I would like to thank Subcommittee Chairman CUMMINGS for his diligence in thoroughly examining these problems and for developing a comprehensive bill to get this program back on course. 
   The Committee has held three hearings in the 110th Congress on the Deepwater program--including one that finally adjourned at 11:29 p.m. Committee Members have heard the saga about problems with this program that include inadequate staffing, patrol boats that have been altered in such a way that they are not seaworthy, and construction standards that shorten the fatigue life of cutters below their contracted 30-year life. 
   During these hearings, the Committee heard testimony from the Coast Guard, contractors, the Office of Inspector General (``OIG'') of the Department of Homeland Security, and the Government Accountability Office (``GAO''), and in addition received reports from the Defense Acquisition University (``DAU''), the GAO, and the OIG. 
   Unfortunately, we learned from the testimony to the Committee that the Deepwater program is an example of a total abdication of governmental responsibility for overseeing its contractors, the quality of their work, and the timeline for completion. 
   H.R. 2722 will correct this problem. The bill establishes within the Coast Guard the acquisition management systems, and requires appointment of necessary personnel, to effectively manage the $24 billion Deepwater Acquisition Program.  
   As reported by the Committee, H.R. 2722 prohibits the use of a private sector entity as a lead system integrator beginning at the earlier date of October 1, 2011, or the date on which the Coast Guard certifies to the Committee that the service has the trained personnel and resources to implement the system integration. 
   I understand that the Coast Guard intends to move forward well before the 2011 date and I can assure you that this Committee will monitor their progress on taking over the Deepwater program. 
   H.R. 2722 also requires the use of full and open competition for procurements under Deepwater, and sets forth specific provisions to be included in future contracts including requirements subjecting designs to technical review and development of independent cost estimates. Transient electromagnetic pulse emanation (``TEMPEST'') standards, as used by the Department of the Navy, must be used for procurements requiring TEMPEST certification. The bill further requires that all contracts include provisions allowing the OIG to privately interview contractor personnel working on Deepwater. 
   The bill also requires the appointment of a civilian Chief Acquisition Officer within the Coast Guard, who would report directly to the Commandant, and specifies a number of authorities reserved to the Chief Acquisition Officer. 
   H.R. 2722 sets standards for testing and certification of assets procured under Deepwater. Each cutter--other than a National Security Cutter (NSC)--must be classed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). The design and construction of NSCs, with the exception of NSC 1 and 2, must be certified as capable of being underway for at least 185 days a year for 30 years and the other performance requirements by an independent third-party such as ABS or the Navy. The bill calls for all aircraft to be certified by an independent third-party such as the FAA or the Navy as well. 
   In addition, the bill requires a number of reports to Congress from the Coast Guard to enhance the Committee's oversight of this important acquisition program. 
   I would like to thank Ranking Member MICA and Subcommittee Ranking Member LATOURETTE for working with Subcommittee Chairman CUMMINGS and me on this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of H.R. 2722, the ``Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act of 2007''.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (RONALD H. BROWN UNITED STATES MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 735, a bill to designate the United States Mission to the United Nations Building located at 799 First Avenue, New York, NY, as the ``Ronald H. Brown United States Mission to the United Nations Building.'' 
   Consideration of this bill on the House floor is long overdue. I commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL) for his steadfastness in supporting this bill. Congressman RANGEL introduced similar bills to designate the United States Mission to the United Nations in honor of Ron Brown in the 108th and 109th Congresses. I am pleased that today we will finally pass this bill and pay a fitting tribute to the life and achievements of this extraordinary American. 
   Ron Brown was a man who served his country in many capacities: lawyer, pragmatic bridge builder, statesman, mentor, and trusted friend. 
   He may be best known for his service as the first African-American Secretary of Commerce. In that position, he became a powerful and influential voice for promoting American products and trade abroad. He championed expanding markets for U.S. goods and services, in order to increase job opportunities and foster job creation here at home. 
   He also served on President Clinton's National Economic Council, Domestic Policy Council, and Task Force on National Health Care Reform. He served President Clinton on the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee and was Co- Chair of the U.S.-Russia Business Development Committee. 
   Secretary Brown served on the Board of Trustees for Middlebury College and received his law degree from St. John's University in New York City. Prior to entering public service, he worked as a welfare caseworker in New York City. 
   In addition to his many talents and strengths, Secretary Brown was a passionate civil rights activist with a distinguished record of service to his community. His commitment to this Nation and its citizens provides a model for us all. 
   Secretary Brown's life was tragically ended in April 1996 when he was killed in a place crash in Croatia while on an official Department of Commerce trade mission. 
   The Department of State had requested that Secretary Brown personally 
   undertake the trade mission to highlight and find opportunities for U.S. businesses to boost economic reconstruction of the war torn region of former Yugoslavia. 
   Congress has previously designated Federal buildings that serve as Department of State facilities on four separate occasions. In 2000, Congress designated the Department of State headquarters as the ``Harry S Truman Federal Building'' (P.L. 106-218). In 2004, Congress designated the Foreign Service Institute as the ``George P. Schultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center'' (P.L. 108-136). In 2005, Congress designated the United States Embassy Annex in Rome, Italy, as the ``Mel Sembler Building'' (P.L. 108-447) and designated the Federal building in Kingston, Jamaica, as the ``Colin L. Powell Residential Plaza'' (P.L. 109-89). 
   Secretary Brown died in service to his country on a mission undertaken at the request of  the Department of State. It is fitting and proper to honor this Federal building as the ``Ronald H. Brown United States Mission to the United Nations Building.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 735.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (WATER QUALITY INVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. As far back as the 108th Congress, the committee considered and favorably reported this bill to address the urgent and mounting needs of comprehensive wastewater infrastructure. A visionary on the committee and leading the charge on this legislation was our former committee member, Mr. Pascrell, the gentleman from New Jersey, who spoke earlier. He and Mr. Capuano, the gentleman from Massachusetts, urged upon the committee a vigorous program of reinvestment in the Nation's wastewater infrastructure needs. The committee, in fact, in the 108th Congress considered and favorably reported this bill with total bipartisan support. 
   Regrettably, it didn't reach the House floor in the 108th Congress. It wasn't reported from the committee in the 109th Congress. The needs have only grown. They have worsened. In those areas of the gulf stricken by the Katrina and Rita and Wilma hurricanes, the needs are crushing as the gentleman from Louisiana can well attest. 
   So we have moved again expeditiously in the committee to bring this bill to the House floor. I thank all those who have participated: the gentleman from New Jersey; the gentleman from Massachusetts; especially the Chair of our Subcommittee on Water Resources, the gentlewoman from Texas; and the gentleman from Louisiana who is now managing the bill on the Republican side. These are serious, urgent problems, combined sewer overflows. 
   The administration in their statement of opinion on the bill sort of suggests that this is not a national problem. We settled that issue in 1956, that clean water is a national problem when my predecessor, John Blotnik, authored the very first legislation, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments 1956, signed into law by President Dwight Eisenhower. Every President since then has acknowledged the need for the Nation to address the problems of clean water in our rivers, the tributaries to those rivers, the lakes, the estuaries and the saltwater regions of coastlines of the United States and the Great Lakes. 
   The vast majority of cost in cleaning our Nation's wastewater falls on the shoulders of local communities, local ratepayers, with some participation from States varying from one State to the other, and now through the Clean Water Revolving Loan Fund. 
   We have felt that, as the committee that originated this legislation, that led the charge for the Nation to clean up the Nation's rivers, lakes and receiving waters of all types, to leave a heritage for those who come after us of clean water. This investment we make today, that will, I am very confident, quickly be considered by the other body, and I am quite confident will be signed into law by the President, will move us along the way toward that goal of meeting the Nation's need for clean water. 
   As is stated in the opening paragraph of the Clean Water Act of 1972, the purpose of the act is to establish and maintain the chemical, biological and physical integrity of the Nation's waters. With this legislation, we make a down payment on meeting that objective.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I read with interest and puzzlement the gentleman's amendment that requires offsetting decreases in spending of the Federal Government, such that the net effect of this act does not either increase the Federal deficit nor reduce Federal surplus, of which we do not have one at this point. 
   We have inquired of the Congressional Budget Office about the language of the bill. The legislation before us, H.R. 569, does not include direct spending. The Congressional Budget Office estimates in their statement included in the committee report language: CBO estimates that implementing this legislation would cost about $1.45 billion over the next 5 years, which should be less now with the King amendment, and an additional $0.35 billion after 2012, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts. Enacting the bill, CBO says, would not affect direct spending or receipts. 
   So I think the gentleman's amendment, while well intentioned, goes beyond the purpose of PAYGO. It would apply if we were taking money out of the highway trust fund. This is direct spending, although the highway trust fund is a different matter because there is already an antideficiency provision, you cannot spend more than the highway trust fund has in its account; and it is managed in a different manner. 
   So, we do not have direct spending authority in the legislation. And, therefore, the gentleman's amendment is not applicable, is not valid, and I would oppose the amendment. 
   I yield to the gentleman if he would like to respond.

And the gentleman is perfectly within his rights to offer such an amendment on direct spending legislation, for which I would have no objection, but in this legislation, it creates the false impression that we are in fact creating direct spending authority when in fact we are not. And, if adopted, it would create an unacceptable and invalid precedent.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. May I make another attempt with my colleague? 
   If I may make another appeal to the gentleman from Georgia. In the bill that we will consider on Friday to replenish State revolving loan funds, we submitted the legislation to the Office of Management and Budget and to the Congressional Budget Office. Both came back and said there is a possibility, not the possibility, there is the reality that local governments will float municipal bonds to match and to repay the cost of the loan from the State revolving loan fund. Those municipal bonds will result in a reduction in Federal revenues. Therefore, you must create an offset. 
   We then, taking that direction from CBO, reevaluated the bill in a bipartisan fashion. We reduced its authorization number from $20 billion to $14 billion, the period of time from 5 to 4 years, created the offset for the $14 billion.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I explained the situation with H.R. 720, the State Revolving Loan Fund, Mr. Chairman, so that the gentleman from Georgia would have understanding and confidence that the committee has done its homework, has acted responsibly on the matter of offsets where there is direct spending or where there is a reduction in Federal revenues.     
   We submitted H.R. 720 to review by CBO and the Office of Management and Budget. Both were of the opinion that there would be a reduction in revenues if municipalities issue municipal bonds and that those municipal bonds will be tax exempt and therefore a reduction in revenues. 
   The distinction between that legislation and this is that there is no direct spending involved. There is no resulting responsibility on governments to take action that would result in a reduction in revenues, nor is this an appropriation. It is not a direct spending. And, therefore, it is not subject to the PAYGO rules.

It says nothing about paying lobbyists, retaining a lobbyist or influencing Federal, State or local government entity or officer. But if the gentleman is concerned that somehow money might be diverted in that, we are fully prepared to accept the amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 822, which recognizes the 100th anniversary year of the founding of the Port of Los Angeles. 
   The Port of Los Angeles is located in San Pedro, California and is a part of the Southern California port complex. This complex handles more than 43 percent of all goods arriving in the United States. The complex has grown 246 percent over the past 11 years, and trade-related jobs at the complex have tripled. The amount of cargo handled by this complex is also expected to triple by the year 2030. 
   Although the earliest history of the Port of Los Angeles dates back to the 1500s, the Board of Harbor Commissioners was created on December 9, 1907, which officially founded the port. In 1542, a Portuguese explorer named the natural harbor ``Bahia de los Fumos'' or ``Bay of Smokes,'' when he stated the bay ``is an excellent harbor and the country is good with many plains and groves of trees.'' 
   In 1869, a new era of development for the harbor region was marked when Los Angeles and San Pedro Railroad began service between San Pedro Bay and Los Angeles, becoming the first railroad of Southern California. 
   In 1958, the containerized cargo revolution began on the west coast, when the Hawaiian Merchant delivered its first shipment of 20 cargo containers to the port. 
   A principal partner in the $2.5 billion Alameda Corridor project, which opened in April 2O02, the port worked with local, regional, and statewide agencies to develop a robust regional transportation infrastructure. The project is a 20-mile expressway that connects the Port of Los Angeles to America's transcontinental rail system, improving the transportation systems that move goods throughout the region. 
   Last year, the Port of Los Angeles handled more than 8.5 million twenty-foot container units, making it the leading container port in the United States for 7 consecutive years. The port has the largest single container terminal in the world. The nearly 500-acre container complex, operated by Maersk Sealand and APM Terminals, was completed in 2004 and has been acclaimed as an engineering phenomenon and a model of operational efficiency. 
   The port has implemented modern and innovative transportation and good movements systems, has set global standards, and is a leader in terminal efficiency and environmental initiatives. I congratulate the Port of Los Angeles on its achievements for the past 100 years and wish the port continued success in national and world commerce for the next century. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure brings to the House today an historic bill to address the needs of aviation today and into the future. At a time when we are seeing aviation recover from the devastating aftereffects of September 11, the flood of bankruptcies that occurred in the years subsequent to that tragic assault on America, and the retiring of aircraft, laying off of tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of airline workers and workers in related fields, we are now seeing aviation return to and exceed all-time previously registered highs. 
   Last year, over a billion people traveled by air worldwide, and 750 million of that travel was in the U.S. air space. We are seeing increasing delays. Only 72 percent of flights arrived on time in this last year. That indicates congestion in the air space and congestion on the ground and congestion in our air traffic control system. 
   We bring to the House, we bring to the country, historic funding levels of $68 billion over the next 4 years. We bring you a 4-year bill, not 3 years like we have done in years past, to address the needs of creating capacity on the air side of airports: $15.8 billion for the airport improvement program; $13 billion to invest in the air traffic control technology and making room for and accelerating the development of the Next Generation air traffic control technology; and $37.2 billion to fund the operations of the FAA, essentially paying air traffic controllers and those who maintain the system. 
   These are all-time high investments. I have served in the House for 33 years. I have been deeply engaged in aviation for over 25 years of those years, and I have never seen this kind of investment that Congress has made, this deeply, this extensively, and so far out into the future. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Aviation who has seized the issue, mastered the subject matter, conducted extensive in-depth hearings on a broad range of issues considered by the committee, and has played a critical role in shaping the bill. 
   I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the ranking member of the full committee, who has served previously as the Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee and is fully engaged in the issues of aviation and who committed himself every step of the way to the shaping of this legislation, including working together with us on the Democratic side, with the DOT and the White House and the air traffic controllers in an attempt to resolve a very knotty problem of the air traffic controllers' contract. 
   And I also express appreciation to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri), the ranking member on the Aviation Subcommittee, for the enormous amount of time he devoted and for his always thoughtful and intellectual contributions to the work of the committee.

The gentleman from Wisconsin has been a quick learner and a very astute participant in both the hearings and the markup process. And the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello) has really put his arms around the subject of aviation, mastered the issues, and brought forth an extraordinary piece of legislation that will serve aviation well and serve the Nation well out into the future. 
   Yes, we have disagreement principally on two issues, and we have been open and candid about that right from the outset. We have worked cooperatively, bipartisanly to try to resolve the air traffic controller issue. Both parties seemed irreconcilable. We have created a process in this legislation by which the air traffic controller issue can be resolved with an arbitration process.     
   And I think that's in the best interest of the Nation. 
   As we go forward from here, I look forward to the amendments that will be forthcoming, and I think in a very constructive manner we can conclude the action on this bill today.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Airline delays, as I said at the outset of general debate, have reached historic levels, 72 percent of flights arriving on time so far this year. Long term, we need continued modernization of the aircraft traffic control system. That is not to say that this is a system that has been frozen in time and nothing has been done. 
   The FAA has, over the past 20-plus years, 25 years, installed over 80,000 pieces of technology to upgrade, modernize, expand, and increase capacity in the air traffic control system. 
   They installed a voice switching and control system over one weekend, with a million lines of computer code, installing this entirely new communication system over one weekend without a second of delay in the air traffic control operations. That's like changing a tire on a car moving at 60 miles an hour. They did it. 
   They installed the automatic replacement system for the en route centers, and did that after 5 years of development of this greatly enhanced new technology, increasing to 1,300,000 lines of computer code. And the installment is now working well. 
   The Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System, the STARS, that, too, took years to develop; 1,300,000 lines of computer code also installed and operating effectively. But those were platforms on which we build the air traffic control technology of the future. And in this legislation, we provide for the funding of the air traffic control technology of the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield now to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello).

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Skelton, chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, for his leadership in bringing the Conference Report on H.R. 1585, the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008,'' expeditiously to the House floor. This legislation includes critical program and funding authorizations for the men and women in our Nation's armed forces. 
   This Conference Report contains several provisions that fall under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, including provisions that affect the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the General Services Administration. I have no objection to the inclusion of most of these provisions. 
   I rise today in opposition to one provision in the final Conference Report that significantly affects the responsibility of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ``Corps.'' Section 2875 rewards the city of Woonsocket, RI, for failing its statutory obligation to operate and maintain its local levee by shifting responsibility for this now-failing levee to the Federal government. Current law provides that operation and maintenance responsibility for flood control projects is a non-Federal responsibility. However, this section requires the Corps to conduct any repairs or rehabilitation of the existing structure, including its replacement. 
   This provision is bad policy, because it establishes the precedent that the Federal government will assume responsibility for failing flood control systems, which according to the Corps, may include an inventory of roughly 15,000 miles of levees and other flood control structures, nationwide. 
   This provision also creates the false impression that communities that sign contractual obligations with the United States, through the Corps, can have these contracts overturned by congressional action if the community can convince one Member of Congress that the community lacks sufficient resources to meet their operation and maintenance responsibilities. 
   The Corps is often called upon to construct flood control projects, in partnership with a non-Federal interest under a normal cost-sharing agreement. Once the project is completed, the responsibility for long-term operation and maintenance is transferred to the non-Federal interest. With the exception of the projects along the Mississippi River that are part of the Mississippi River and Tributaries project (MRT), the Corps is typically not responsible for operation and maintenance of flood control projects. 
   The Corps currently has responsibility for operation and maintenance of navigation projects. For these projects, the backlog for operation and maintenance of existing Federal responsibilities is roughly $4 billion annually, but appropriations for operation and maintenance have hovered around $2 billion. The result is that roughly 50 percent of vitally needed operation and maintenance responsibilities of the Corps are not being met, and are deferred to future appropriations. To shift additional operation and maintenance responsibilities to the Corps is unwise and is likely to impair the ability of the Corps to carry out its existing obligations for operation and maintenance. 
   During pre-conference negotiations, I proposed to provide the city of Woonsocket with some flexibility related to the cost of operation and maintenance of this project, but not a permanent blanket waiver of operation and maintenance. 
   I proposed two solutions, which I believe would have addressed the concerns of the city of Woonsocket. Unfortunately, the Senate was unwilling to compromise, and both proposals were rejected. 
   Both proposals would have authorized the Corps of Engineers to assume greater responsibility for the reconstruction of the failing levee system, but would have continued the long-term operation and maintenance responsibilities for the city of Woonsocket. I believe that both offers were made in the spirit of compromise without violating fundamental statutory and contractual responsibilities of the non-Federal sponsor. Both offers would have allowed the city of Woonsocket to start fresh with a structurally sound flood control system, provided that the city retained its obligation to operate and maintain the levee system. 
   I continue to believe that this shift of operation and maintenance responsibility is bad policy that will worsen the backlog of deferred operation and maintenance responsibility for the Corps and set a poor precedent of shifting responsibilities for other projects in the future. 
   I opposed a similar provision in last year's Defense Authorization bill that changed operation and maintenance responsibility from the local sponsor to the Federal government for another project in Rhode Island. 
   As chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I will continue to explore the implications of these changes in operation and maintenance responsibilities in the formulation of the Water Resources Development Act of 2008.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the conference report on the fiscal year (FY) 2009 Budget Resolution recognizes the importance of meeting our nation's infrastructure investment needs. Adequate investment in our transportation and other public infrastructure is critical to our nation's economic growth, our competitiveness in the world marketplace, and the quality of life in our communities. Despite the importance of these investments, many of our nation's infrastructure needs are going unmet. 
   Rather than addressing these unmet needs, the administration's FY 2009 budget proposed to cut virtually every infrastructure investment program within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, including highways, public transit, airports, Amtrak, wastewater treatment, and water resources development. 
   In contrast to the harmful cuts proposed by the administration, the conference report before us today fully funds highway, transit, and highway safety programs at the levels originally authorized in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). The conference report rejects both the negative $1 billion adjustment for Revenue Aligned Budget Authority, and the administration's proposal to cut highway and transit funding by an additional $1 billion below the authorized levels, which would be detrimental to short-term economic stimulus efforts, as well as long-term economic growth. 
   For the Airport Improvement Program (AlP), the conference report rejects the $765 million cut proposed by the administration, and instead provides the full amounts authorized in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 2881), as approved by the House last year. Specifically, the conference agreement allocates $3.8 billion for AlP in FY 2008, increasing to $3.9 billion in FY 2009, and to $4.1 billion by FY 2011. This funding will allow the AlP program to keep pace with inflationary cost increases, and begin to address the investment gap in airport safety and capacity needs. 
   For Amtrak, the conference report rejects the $525 million cut proposed by the administration, which would essentially shut-down our national passenger rail system, and instead increases funding to meet the costs of Amtrak's new labor agreement, pursuant to Presidential Emergency Board 242. 
   For environmental infrastructure, the conference report rejects the administration's proposed cut to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program, the primary Federal program for funding wastewater infrastructure projects throughout the nation. A year ago, the President requested $687.5 million in capitalization grants for CWSRFs for FY 2008. At that time, it was the lowest level requested by any administration since the creation of the program. For FY 2009, the administration requested a pitiful $555 million, a 20 percent cut from last year's appropriation of $689 million. The administration's proposal puts at risk the water quality gains achieved in recent decades, and the conference report correctly rejects this cut. 
   Finally, the conference report rejects the administration's proposal to cut funding for the Army Corps of Engineers by $845 million in FY 2009, and instead provides increased funding to begin to address the growing backlog of water resources development projects, including those authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   I am also pleased that the conference report includes an Infrastructure Investment Reserve Fund, which provides the flexibility necessary to accommodate legislation to increase investment in our nation's infrastructure in FY 2009. 
   I look forward to working with Chairman Spratt on continued improvements to our nation's infrastructure, and I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 (CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008) -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about the myriad legislative provisions in this bill that modify projects and studies of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ``Corps''. These provisions, contained in the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008 division of H.R. 2764, affect authorizations and policy issues that are solely within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 
   Mr. Speaker, after 7 long years, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure successfully enacted P.L. 110-114, the ``Water Resources Development Act of 2007,'' ``WRDA 2007'', last month. This landmark legislation authorizes roughly $23 billion in project studies, authorizations, and modifications across the spectrum of Corps missions. 
   Unfortunately, however, several of the provisions contained in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act undermine agreements reached in the House and Senate conference negotiations on the water resources act. In addition, these provisions undermine existing statutory obligations and Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure policy with respect to Corps project authorizations. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the most egregious examples of legislative language contained in this bill is section 117, related to the project at Johnson Creek, Arlington, TX. This provision expands the flood damage reduction measures currently underway in Arlington, TX, to provide additional flood protection to new developments currently being constructed along Johnson Creek, including a major league baseball stadium, a new national football league stadium, and a 5-million-square-foot development plan for Glorypark that will be comprised of multiple hotels, residential units, and commercial space nestled between the creek and the two stadiums. 
   The original plan for Johnson Creek, authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of 1999, called for the restoration of approximately 155 acres of bottomland hardwoods, and recreation features, e.g., walking trails, along Johnson Creek, at an estimated total cost of $30,000,000. Construction on the authorized project is approximately 50 percent complete. 
   During consideration of WRDA 2007, the Committee received a request to modify the ongoing project for Johnson Creek--the very same provision that is contained in section 117 of the Energy and Water appropriations bill. Section 117 modifies the existing project to convert approximately 90 acres of the 155 acres designated as mitigation lands--and proposed for restoration in the original plan--into a parking lot and other improvements related to the proposed stadium construction. Section 117 provides for the construction of additional flood control structures and the acquisition of an additional 90 acres of new environmental restoration/preservation lands to offset those lands constructed under the original authorization. The estimated cost of the revised proposal is $80,000,000. 
   I opposed the proposed modification for Johnson Creek when it was offered before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and continue to oppose the very same language that now appears in section 117 of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. 
   First, section 117 authorizes the Johnson Creek project without requiring that the project meet a traditional cost-benefit test. 
   Section 1 of the Flood Control Act of 1936 requires that, for flood control projects, the benefits of the project are in excess of the costs. Over many decades, this statutory requirement has been carried out through the calculation of a cost-benefit test for Corps projects. Typically, when Congress authorizes a project, it must be ``feasible''--meaning that the Corps determines that the project is technically sound, environmentally acceptable, and economically justified. 
   Section 117 waives the traditional cost-benefit test, and only requires that the project be technically sound and environmentally acceptable. 
   During the formulation of the Water Resources Development Act in the House, the Corps provided the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with information on the estimated cost-benefit ratio for the Johnson Creek plan, ``A Vision of Conservation,'' dated March 2006. According to the Corps, the total anticipated cost for the flood damage reduction element of the project is $27.9 million. The average annual costs are estimated to be $2.84 million. The total potential average annual benefits are $1.28 million. The estimated benefit to cost ratio is 0.45 to 1. In essence, the reason that the benefits for this project are very low is because the project does not protect traditional structures, e.g., housing, commercial properties, but mainly serves to minimize potential flooding of the parking lot for the sports stadium complex, built on the former ecosystem restoration lands of the prior project, and protect an amusement park further downstream. 
   The Corps estimated that the total anticipated costs for the recreation component of the plan are $10.6 million, estimated to be $1.14 million annually, and include the construction of trails and associated facilities within the project area. The total potential average annual benefits from the recreational element were estimated to be $1.6 million. The estimated benefit-to-cost ratio for the recreational element is estimated to be 1.44 to 1. The Corps also estimated that the ``Vision of Conservation'' plan would include an additional $21.5 million for bank stabilization, sedimentation basins, and the planting of trees, shrubs, and grasses. The Corps did not provide a detailed assessment of the benefits of these additional elements. 
   As Chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I opposed the proposal to waive existing statutory and policy requirements that the project undergo a proper cost-benefit test. In a carefully and extensively negotiated bipartisan agreement, the Committee modified the project to allow the ``Vision of Conservation'' to proceed, but to retain the traditional benefit-cost analysis for the project. In addition, the Committee included statutory language to allow the non-Federal sponsor to  contribute additional local funds to ensure that the Federal and non-Federal shares of the cost of the project would reflect the estimated cost-benefit ratio. The Committee believed that this was a fair way to allow non-Federal sponsors, such as the City of Arlington, TX, to contribute more funding toward desired Corps projects, but not violate the requirement that the costs of a project at least equal the benefits. 
   This bipartisan agreement was included as section 5123 of the House-passed Water Resources Development Act of 2007: 
   ``SEC. 5123. JOHNSON CREEK, ARLINGTON, TEXAS. 
   ``(a) IN GENERAL.--The project for flood damage reduction, environmental restoration, and recreation, Johnson Creek, Arlington, Texas, authorized by section 101(b)(14) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 (113 Stat 280), is modified to authorize the Secretary to construct the project substantially in accordance with the report entitled `Johnson Creek: A Vision of Conservation', dated March 30, 2006, at a total cost of $80,000,000, with an estimated Federal cost of $52,000,000 and an estimated non-Federal cost of $28,000,000, if the Secretary determines that the project is feasible. 
   ``(b) NON-FEDERAL SHARE.-- 
   ``(1) IN GENERAL.--The non-Federal share of the cost of the project may be provided in cash or in the form of in-kind services or materials. 
   ``(2) CREDIT.--The Secretary shall credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of the project the cost of planning, design, and construction work carried out by the non-Federal interest for implementation of the project, if the Secretary determines that the work is integral to the project. 
   ``(c) SPECIAL RULE.--In evaluating and implementing the project, the Secretary shall allow the non-Federal interest to participate in the financing of the project in accordance with section 903(c) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 4184). 
   ``(d) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.--Section 134 of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2006 (119 Stat. 2263) is repealed.''  
   During conference negotiations on H.R. 1495, the Conference Committee reached agreement on language related to the Johnson Creek project, which was modeled after the House-passed provision. Congress included its modifications to the Johnson Creek project in section 5143 of the Conference Report on H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   Now, just over one month after Congress enacted the Water Resources Development Act, section 117 of the Energy and Water bill seeks to undo our bipartisan, bicameral agreement before this language has even had the opportunity to work. The principal difference between the language contained in the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 and the language contained in section 117 of this Act is the waiver of the benefit-cost test for the project. 
   I oppose the waiver of the benefit-cost test, and was able to work with my colleagues in the House and Senate to retain this important protection in WRDA 2007. Section 117 of this Act arbitrarily waives the benefit-cost test--a position that was uniformly rejected by both the House and Senate during consideration of the water resources development legislation. 
   I continue to oppose this proposal, and will revisit the changes made by section 117 during the development of our next Water Resources Development Act in 2008. 
   I also strongly oppose section 123, related to the project for St. John's Bayou and New Madrid Floodway, of the bill. 
   Again, this language fundamentally undermines normal Corps planning and design methodologies related to the development of sound Corps projects. With regard to the defined project, this provision represents a complete reversal of well considered and appropriate law and policy, by waiving cost-benefit analysis and justification, as well as the environmental review required by National Environmental Policy Act (``NEPA''). Section 123 carefully defines the project and states ``..... the project is economically justified.'' This precludes appropriate and required economic analysis of the defined project. 
   The St. John's Bayou/New Madrid Floodway project was recently adjudicated with the judge issuing a summary judgment, in September 2007, in favor of the plaintiffs, enjoining the Corps from work on the project, and ordering the Corps to deconstruct the elements it had already built. 
   The judge's ruling stated: ``The Corps' manipulation of its habitat model in analyzing fish mitigation gives new meaning to the phrase `result-oriented decision-making.' (Emphasis added.) The Corps has obviously worked backwards from the mitigation dollars it could afford, tweaking several of its original, fundamental understandings of its mitigation obligations so as to make the project appear to return a positive benefit-cost ratio. Many mitigation decisions seem to have been based on cost alone, with a troubling disregard for the fundamental assumptions of the HEP [Habitat Evaluation Procedures] team model and HEP team member judgment. Several elements discussed above lack factual support or substantial evidence, but, more disturbingly, the Corps has demonstrated its willingness to do whatever it takes to proceed with this project--change definitions, abandon core assumptions--even if it means ignoring serious environmental impacts.'' 
   Like Johnson Creek, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure considered and rejected a legislative proposal to waive the beneft-cost test and environmental reviews for this project during negotiations on the Water Resources Development Act. However, the Committee did approve language directing the Corps to utilize existing statutory authority to consider the non-Federal sponsor's ``ability to pay'' when determining an appropriate cost-share for the project. This language was included as part of section 2019 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are just two of the many concerns I have with the number of legislative provisions contained in the Energy and Water Appropriations Act. 
   I will continue to review the legislative proposals contained in this bill, and should changes be warranted to conform the projects to existing statutory authorities or Committee policy, I will revisit these projects during the development of a Water Resources Development Act in 2008.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rescission of $683 million of highway contract authority that is included in the Conference Report on H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act, 2007. 
   The Conference Report provides an additional $683 million for the Federal Highway Administration's (``FHWA'') Emergency Relief Program. Section 4952 of the Conference Report designates this appropriation as an emergency requirement, for which no offset is required. 
   Despite the fact that no offset is required, the Conference Report rescinds $683 million in unobligated balances of highway funds that have been apportioned to the States. This rescission is highly gratuitous, as it is neither required nor effective as an offset for the supplemental appropriation to the Emergency Relief Program. 
   Rather than offsetting the supplemental appropriation for the Emergency Relief Program, the $683 million rescission of highway contract authority offsets other spending under the FY 2007 discretionary budget authority cap. 
   A similar provision was included in the Senate-passed version of the bill. The Senate amendment provided an emergency supplemental appropriation of $389 million for the FHWA's Emergency Relief Program, and rescinded $389 million in highway contract authority. 
   On April 23, 2007, I wrote to the conferees, strongly objecting to this unnecessary rescission of highway contract authority, and urged them to strike the rescission in conference. Instead, the conferees increased both the appropriation and the rescission to $683 million. 
   Madam Speaker, the rescission of highway contract authority is the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. This rescission violates clause 2 of Rule XXI of the Rules of the House. 
   Programmatically, I am concerned because of the effect these types of rescissions have on the Federal-aid Highway Program and, specifically, the ability to ensure that our nation's transportation system provides modal choices. 
   In recent years, the Appropriations Committees have increasingly relied on highway contract authority rescissions to finance non-highway spending in appropriations acts. In addition, more than a dozen states have chosen to apply such rescissions disproportionately to cut contract authority for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program, the Bridge program, and transportation enhancement funds. 
   I am particularly concerned with the treatment of the CMAQ program under these types of rescissions. The CMAQ program provides funding for projects and programs that reduce transportation-related emissions in areas that do not meet Clean Air Act air quality standards (i.e., nonattainment and maintenance areas). 
   Although CMAQ funds represent only about 4-5 percent of highway apportionments each year, CMAQ funds have accounted for about 20 percent of total highway funds rescinded in recent years. In FY 2006 states rescinded $881 million in CMAQ funds. Almost one of every four dollars rescinded by the States in FY 2006 came from the CMAQ program. 
   Comparing the treatment of CMAQ to other highway programs further illustrates the disproportionate cuts of these rescissions. In FY 2006, rescissions as a percentage of the total amount made available for programs are: 
   CMAQ--55 percent. 
   Interstate Maintenance--12 percent. 
   National Highway System--7 percent.  
   The Transportation Enhancements program has also received disproportionate contract authority cuts under the rescissions. The Transportation Enhancements program provides funds for bike paths, pedestrian walkways, historic preservation, and other activities that expand transportation choices and enhance the transportation experience. 
   In FY 2006, states rescinded $602 million in Transportation Enhancements funds, 15 percent of all rescissions in that year. Texas alone rescinded $223 million of Transportation Enhancements funding and the Texas Department of Transportation stated that it would not fund any transportation enhancement projects in that fiscal year. Texas' actions, which are facilitated by these contract authority rescissions, are directly contrary to our federal efforts to develop a balanced, multimodal surface transportation system. 
   During consideration of the FY 2004 Transportation-Treasury-HUD Appropriations bill, the Committee faced a similar effort to cut transportation enhancements funding. The bill, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, included a provision that would have prohibited funds from being used for the ten percent set aside for transportation enhancements under the Surface Transportation Program. Subcommittee Chairman PETRI and I offered an amendment to strike the anti-enhancements provision from the bill and the House overwhelmingly passed the amendment by a recorded vote of 327-90. This vote illustrates the tremendous support that exists among Members of Congress for transportation enhancements, the type of program that is disproportionately harmed by highway contract authority rescissions such as the one included in the Conference Report before us today. 
   Therefore, for both policy and procedural reasons, I oppose the rescission of highway contract authority as a means to offset non-highway spending elsewhere in the budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this House will have an opportunity to reconsider this decision in a future Supplemental Appropriations bill and I would like to make clear that, with the urgent climate change issues that our nation faces, I strongly oppose efforts to allow the continued raid of CMAQ and Enhancements funding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I support the conference report, but not the rescission of highway contract authority which this bill uses to offset non-highway spending elsewhere in the conference report. 
   The report provides an additional $683 million for the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program. No offset is needed for that emergency relief. 
   Nonetheless, the conference report rescinds $683 million in unobligated balances of highway funds that have been apportioned to the States. Now, the rescission does protect highway safety programs, but it leaves transportation environmental programs vulnerable. 
   The rescission of highway contract authority is the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and this provision violates clause 2 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House. 
   These types of rescissions adversely affect the Federal aid highway program, specifically the ability to ensure that the Nation's transportation system has modal choices. 
   More than a dozen States have applied these rescissions disproportionately to cut contract authority for critical transportation and environmental programs, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement and the Transportation Enhancement Program. 
   CMAQ funds are only 4 or 5 percent of highway apportionment every year, but they have accounted for 20 percent of the funds rescinded in recent years, and particularly in the State of Texas. 
   In fiscal year 2006 States rescinded $888 million in CMAQ funds. One out of every $4 rescinded by States in 2006 came from CMAQ programs. In 2006 also the States rescinded 602 million of enhancements funds in which Texas cut $223 million of enhancement funding and completely suspended its program. 
   The House, I think, will have an opportunity to reconsider the rescission issue in a future supplemental. And we, with all the environment problems that we have and the climate change problems, this is one area that we should not allow to be cut.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we meet on the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act from 1972; a bill that started out in the House, made its way through the Committee on Public Works, as it was known then, through the House, to the Senate Committee on Public Works, and then through a 10-month House-Senate conference, a remarkable meeting of Members of the House and Senate which, in a time very different from the times we experience recently, where Members actually participated, sat across the table from one another, not separated by staff, although I was a member of the staff at the time, not relegating their responsibilities to others, but actually participating vigorously with informed judgment, with strongly held views in shaping what everyone in that conference knew was going to be a new future for the waters of the United States. 
   That legislation was considered against a backdrop of 14 years of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, crafted by my predecessor, John Blotnick, who was Chair first of the Subcommittee on Rivers and Harbors and then Chair of the Full Committee on Public Works, to clean up the Nation's waters.  
   In that year, 1955, and then following, in 1956, John Blotnick wanted to acquaint himself with the new responsibilities of being a chairman of the Subcommittee on Rivers and Harbors, and managing the inland waterways of the United States and the locks and dams and the harbors of this country, of the saltwater coast and the fresh water of the Great Lakes. So he journeyed down the Mississippi, part of the Ohio-Illinois river systems. 
   He was a biochemist by training, and a teacher of biochemistry, and observed that by the time he got to New Orleans, there was so much trash, discharge, waste, feces and raw phenols bubbling in the Mississippi River by the time they reached New Orleans, he was appalled. And he said the purpose no longer became how can we move goods through the inland waterway system and barges of this Nation, but how can we, what must we do to clean up this resource of fresh water. 
   On return to Washington that spring, he visited the Tidal Basin, the cherry blossoms in bloom, and he observed all of the debris and all of the foul smell in the Tidal Basin and called it the best dressed cesspool in America, and crafted a three-part program to deal with this problem of cleaning up America's waters.     
   And he undertook what was then a unique activity: a Dear Colleague letter. It's very common. We see them by the hundreds today. But it was very rare in 1955 and 1956 to do something of that nature, and reserved the Caucus Room of the Cannon House Office Building, which can seat over 600 people, because he thought so many would want to come and participate in this great enterprise of protecting America's waters and restoring our rivers and lakes. 
   And three people showed up: John Blotnick; Congressman Bob Jones from Alabama, who was elected in 1946, the same year as John Blotnick; and Murray Stein, an attorney in the U.S. Public Health Service whose office was, as John Blotnick described it, in the 7th sub-basement of HEW, the Health, Education, and Welfare building. And there they crafted broad outlines of what became the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. 
   Research, engaging the best minds in this country to understand what are the limiting factors in our waters that, if removed, would restore good health. Nitrogen, phosphates, toxics, phenols, how do you get them out of the water once they're in? How do you prevent them from getting in? The second point, treatment. Treating our wastes before they get into the receiving waters. And, third, an enforcement program to bring the States together to resolve common problems of enforcing a program of cleaning streams before they get into the receiving waters. 
   It was signed into law by President Eisenhower in 1956. It had $30 million in Federal funding, 30 percent Federal grants to municipalities to build sewage treatment facilities. It was supported by the garden clubs of America. They were the first ones, the leaders, seeing the need for a national program of clean water. 
   The next 3 years saw broad acceptance of this legislation, a need for increased funding. So John Blotnick proposed a successor to increase to $50 million Federal funding and 30 percent Federal grants and a stronger enforcement and more money for research. And that bill was vetoed by President Eisenhower with a veto message that read in its last sentence: ``Pollution is a uniquely local blight. Federal involvement will only impede local efforts at cleanup.'' 
   But that was an election year. John F. Kennedy, Democratic candidate, committed to an expanded program of clean water. And he came in and signed a bill that moved through our committee for $100 million in Federal funding with 50 percent Federal grants and an expanded research and development and much stronger enforcement. 
   And over the succeeding years, the program grew, and so did our understanding of the broader needs and the broader reach of a Federal program to go beyond point sources but to get to the watershed, to go beyond the point of discharge, to reach further out into the country. 
   At the same time, great suds, mounds of suds, were floating down the Ohio River system and the Illinois River system and the Mississippi. And people were turning on their faucets and finding soap coming out instead of clean water. And then the Cuyahoga River caught on fire in 1968 in the town of the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette), and the Nation was galvanized into action. That led to increased funding for the clean water program and a recognition that we need to have a much broader scope program. 
   So in 1970 the committee began extensive hearings on a much wider reach of the program. And in 1971 I was chief of staff of the Committee on Public Works when we began this much broader scope program. 
   The result of all these efforts was the Clean Water Act of 1972, whose opening paragraph reads: ``The purpose of this act is to establish and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters,'' not just the navigable waters, which had been the signature word of previous legislation but the Nation's waters, going beyond what you can paddle in a canoe, going to the source of pollution. 
   That massive bill was vetoed by President Richard Nixon. But the veto was overridden by a 10-1 vote in the House and a similar 10-1 vote in the United States Senate and has remained our cornerstone act for maintaining the integrity of the Nation's waters. 
   It is our legacy to pass on to other generations that all the water there ever was in the world or ever will be is here now, and we have the responsibility to care for it. This Clean Water Act is our guarantee that it will be done. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, first to observe that Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair of the Water Resources Subcommittee, would have been here to manage this bill were it not for the death of her mother. And we join with her in mourning that loss. I know that she and her mother were very, very close. She spoke so warmly of her mother so often, and we join in prayers for both of them. 
   We have engaged in spacecraft missions to the Moon, to Mars, to Saturn, to the asteroid belt in quest of water. The very first effort is to look for water on distant planetary objects in our system, for primitive life forms that may exist in that water, and yet we have not looked closely enough at the water here on Earth. 
   This recognition of the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act will give us that opportunity to stop, to reflect upon the journey that we have made  over these three and a half decades, and the journey yet ahead of us to clean up that remaining one-third, to protect that other two-thirds of water, to pass on to the next generation this priceless heritage of fresh water, that we do not have to go wandering in space looking for water that we may have destroyed on Earth so that we may bring it from some extraterrestrial planetary system to replenish our fresh water on Earth. No, let us be custodians of that fresh water that we have. It's only 2 percent of all the water on Earth. Let us resolve and renew our efforts. Let's resolve to maintain the purpose of that Clean Water Act, to protect the waters of the United States.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 478, a bill to designate the Federal building located at 101 Barr Street in Lexington, Kentucky, as the ``Scott Reed Federal Building and United States Courthouse''. The bill was introduced by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Chandler) and his colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers). 
   Scott Reed was born in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1921. He attended local schools and graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1945. While at the University, Reed received many awards and honors, including the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Medallion for excellence. 
   The first years of Judge Reed's career were spent in private practice during which he distinguished himself as a trial lawyer of great integrity. During this time, he also taught at the University of Kentucky College of Law. 
   From 1964 to 1969, Judge Reed was judge of the First Division of the Fayette Circuit Court. From 1969 until 1976, he served on the Court of Appeals, 5th Appellate District. In 1976, Judge Reed became the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, a position which holds equal rank with the Governor. His opinions from the Supreme Court of Kentucky have received national attention for their scholarly content and careful judicial reasoning. 
   In August, 1979, Judge Reed was nominated by President Carter to the federal bench. He was confirmed later that year and served until his death in 1994. During his confirmation hearing, Judge Reed was characterized as possessing a great sense of fairness and objectivity, practical legal experience, and great respect for the law and its responsibility to our Nation's citizens. Both Senator Huddleston and Senator Ford participated in Judge Reed's confirmation hearing. 
   Judge Reed enjoyed a rich and rewarding career. His contributions to the American judicial system are exceptional. It is fitting that the United States Courthouse located in Lexington, Kentucky, bear his name to honor his distinguished career and enduring legacy. 
   I support H.R. 478 and urge its passage.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 429, a bill to designate the newly-constructed courthouse located at 225 Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn, New York, as the ``Hugh L. Carey United States Courthouse''. 
   Hugh Carey was born in 1919, in Brooklyn, where he attended local schools. He graduated from St. John's University and, in 1951, graduated from St. John's Law School. During World War II, he fought in Europe with the 104th Division. For his valor, he received the Bronze Star, Croix de Guerre, and Combat Infantry Award. 
   Hugh Carey served the people of New York for almost three decades, first as a Congressman representing Brooklyn and then as Governor of the State. Congressman Carey served seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1960 until 1974. In 1974, he was elected as Governor of New York in a landslide victory. He served two full terms as Governor until being succeeded by his Lieutenant Governor, Mario Cuomo. 
   Carey's public career is highlighted by his handling of the city's economic crisis in the late 1970s. As part of this effort he spearheaded the construction of the Jacob Javits Center, Battery Park City, and South Street Seaport. He was a fierce opponent of the death penalty and, as Governor, prevented the reinstatement of the death penalty in the State of New York. 
   Carey was a master at forming coalitions between business and labor. This ability helped save the city from fiscal crisis in the late 1970s. During that time, he worked diligently to attract businesses to the State mainly by reducing State taxes. 
   Governor Carey, who will be 88 in April, still practices law in New York. This designation will honor the truly outstanding, civic career of one of New York's finest public servants. 
   I support H.R. 429 and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1045, a bill to designate the Federal building at 210 Walnut Street in Des Moines, IA, as the ``Neal Smith Federal Building.'' 
   Neal Smith was born on March 23, 1920, in his grandparents' home near Hedrick, Keokuk County, IA. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1959 until 1995, and has the distinction of being the longest serving Member of the House of Representatives from Iowa. Congressman Smith is a World War II veteran, having served in the United States Army Air Force as a bomber pilot. His plane was shot down during combat and he received a Purple Heart, nine Battle Stars, and the Air Medal with four oak leaf clusters. 
   He received his undergraduate training at the University of Missouri and Syracuse University. In 1950, he received his law degree from Drake University. 
   Neal Smith is one of Iowa's most respected and distinguished elected officials. His interests while serving in Congress were varied,  but he especially focused on agriculture, small business, and the environment. He became a champion for those issue areas and authored legislation establishing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Meat, Poultry and Egg Inspection Acts, and Small Business Development Centers. 
   Congressman Smith also sponsored legislation to authorize construction of the Big Creek and Rathbun Dams. Further, he was instrumental in creating the Red Rock Watershed Conservation District and a National Wildlife Refuge that was named in his honor. In the 1980s, he was especially active in helping to jump start Iowa's stagnant economy. In 1996, Smith published his autobiography, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington: From Eisenhower to Clinton. 
   It is most fitting and proper to honor the long, distinguished civic career of Congressman Neal Smith with this designation. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1045.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 430, a bill introduced by the gentleman from Brooklyn, New York (Mr. Towns), to designate the United States Bankruptcy Courthouse located at 271 Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn, New York, as the ``Conrad B. Duberstein United States Bankruptcy Courthouse''. 
   This bill has the unanimous support of the judges of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. At the time of his death, on November 18, 2005, at the age of 90, Judge Duberstein was the oldest serving Chief Bankruptcy Judge in the country. 
   Judge Duberstein is a native New Yorker, born in the Bronx in 1915. He was 17 years old when his father died. As a result, he dropped out of school to support his mother and two sisters. In 1934, he received his high school diploma from the Morris Evening High School. In 1938, he graduated from Brooklyn College and, in 1942, he received his law degree from St. John's University Law School. While a law student, he served on the St. John's University Law Review. 
   Judge Duberstein was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1942. In the same year, he took the oath for admission to practice before the United States District Court for the Eastern District in the very building which today we designate in his honor. 
   Judge Duberstein was drafted and served with distinction in World War II from 1943 until 1946. He was stationed in Northern Italy, where he was wounded. He was awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Combat Infantry Badge. While in Italy, he had the honor of being granted an audience with Pope Pius XII.  
   In 1981, he was appointed to the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District in New York. In 1984, the Board of Judges appointed him as the Chief Judge. His work was noted for its thoroughness, extensive analysis, and scholarly approach. He was a person known by his humility and humanity. He worked tirelessly to enable persons of every faith, race, and origin to achieve a ``fresh start,'' consistent with bankruptcy laws. He was beloved and revered by his colleagues. It is both fitting and proper that the bankruptcy courthouse in Brooklyn, New York, be designated in his honor. 
   I support the bill and urge its passage.

   This highway, which leads to Ralph Wilson Stadium--home of the Buffalo Bills, is a fitting tribute after Tim Russert. 
   A native of Buffalo, Mr. Russert will be best remembered for his integrity and his tenacious yet fair approach to his interviews as moderator on NBC's ``Meet the Press''. 
   Tim Russert began his career in 1977 as a key advisor for two of the leading elected officials and policymakers of their time, United  States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and New York Governor Mario Cuomo. 
   In 1984, Russert joined NBC and quickly became one of the Nation's leading journalists and political analysts, serving as NBC's Washington Bureau Chief and host of ``Meet the Press''. 
   Throughout his career in journalism, Russert received 48 honorary doctorates and several awards for excellence in journalism, including an Emmy Award, the Radio and Television Correspondents' Joan S. Barone Award, the Annenberg Center's Walter Cronkite Award, and the Edward R. Murrow Award for Overall Excellence in Television Journalism. 
   Tim Russert also became a bestselling author, with the publication of his autobiography, Big Russ and Me, which chronicled his life growing up in South Buffalo and the lessons that he learned from his father. He also authored The Wisdom of Our Fathers. 
   What many may not know about Tim Russert is the work he did on behalf of numerous charities, which included serving on the board of directors for the Greater Washington Boys and Girls Club and America's Promise-Alliance for Youth. 
   Tim Russert will also be remembered as a proud native son of Buffalo, New York, and his passion for his hometown football team the Buffalo Bills is legendary. 
   It is a fitting tribute to Tim Russert that Buffalo Bills' fans will drive down the ``Timothy J. Russert Highway'' as they approach Ralph Wilson Stadium.

   The Appalachian Regional Commission was created to address economic issues and social problems of the Appalachian region as a part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society program. Historically, the Appalachian region has faced high levels of poverty and economic distress resulting from geographic isolation and inadequate infrastructure. 
   As a regional economic development agency, the ARC supports the development of Appalachia's economy and critical infrastructure to provide a climate for industry growth and job creation in 13 States, including all of West Virginia, and parts of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. The Appalachian region covers nearly 200,000 square miles and contains nearly 23 million people. Currently, of the 410 counties included in the ARC, 78 are economically distressed counties and an additional 78 counties are classified as ``at-risk''. 
   Since its creation in 1965, the ARC has administered a variety of programs to aid in the advancement of the region, including construction of the Appalachian Development Highway System, enhancements in education and job training, and the development of water and sewer systems. The ARC's funding and projects have contributed significantly to employment, health, and general economic development improvements in the region. According to research conducted by Brandow Co. and the Economic Development Research Group, three fourths of ARC infrastructure projects with specific business or job-related goals met or exceeded formal projections.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (NATIONAL TRAIN DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1176, which supports the goals and ideals of National Train Day. 
   National Train Day marks the 139th anniversary of the ``golden spike'' being driven into the ground at Promontory Summit, Utah, in 1869. The golden spike bound the last tie connecting the last rail that united the Central Pacific Railroad with the Union Pacific Railroad,  connecting the United States by rail from coast to coast. 
   The transcontinental railroad was born thanks to the support of President Abraham Lincoln. He, along with Civil War leaders, envisioned and planned the creation of the railroad. Not only did the completion of the railroad result in the ability to deliver goods and people across the country, it ultimately bound the East with the West, further unifying the country as the divide between the North and the South was beginning to mend. 
   The transcontinental railroad was the first of its kind. It was an engineering marvel completed with great precision and speed. The railroad was an engineering wonder and it set the example for how transcontinental railroads would be built across Canada and Russia some 20 to 25 years later. 
   Completion of the transcontinental railroad created a new sense of wonder and enthusiasm for discovery and entrepreneurship across the country. It set the stage for a great migration of businessmen, created a new frontier for those seeking a new way of life, enabled faster movement of people and goods, and provided the country with a great opportunity to expand the economy. 
   Today, we are witnessing a rebirth of passenger rail in America. In the same way that the transcontinental railroad was critical to our Nation in the late 19th century, a strong national passenger rail system is vital today. To strengthen intercity passenger rail in this country, I have introduced H.R. 6003, the ``Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008.'' The bill authorizes $14.4 billion for Amtrak over the next 5 years. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will mark up the bill next week. 
   The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, more commonly known as Amtrak, operates a nationwide rail network, serving more than 500 destinations in 46 states over 21,000 miles of routes, with nearly 19,000 employees. Amtrak recently marked the beginning of its 38th year of operation. Our passenger rail service has come a long way since its beginnings in 1971, and has faced many challenges since, but continues to grow stronger with each passing year. Despite uneven Federal investment over the years, Amtrak has persevered, achieving many successes in improved operating efficiency, increased ridership, and higher revenue. 
   In fact, in FY 2007, Amtrak set a new ridership record for the fifth year in a row, exceeding 25.8 million passengers. At the same time, Amtrak increased ticket revenues by 11 percent to more than $1.5 billion, a figure that increased for the third straight year. These successes are being enjoyed across Amtrak's entire network. In fiscal year 2007, Amtrak held 56 percent of the air/rail market between New York and Washington and 41 percent of the market share between New York and Boston. This shows that where Amtrak is provided the resources to succeed, it provides a trip-time competitive alternative to air and automobile. 
   America needs to look toward Amtrak as we address our growing transportation needs. The Department of Transportation describes the problem of congestion on our highways and in the air as ``chronic.'' Amtrak removes almost 8 million cars from the road annually. Airports are experiencing significant delays too, with more than 400,000 flights departing or arriving late in 2006. Amtrak eases air congestion by eliminating the need for 50,000 fully loaded airplanes each year. 
   Amtrak is also a substantially more environmentally friendly mode of transportation than automobiles or airplanes. According to the World Resources Institute, rail transportation produces 57 percent less carbon emissions than airplanes, and 40 percent less carbon emissions than cars. 
   Mr. Speaker, I lend my strong support to the commemoration of National Train Day on May 10, 2008, and encourage all of my colleagues to use this excellent opportunity to reflect on the benefits that Amtrak and intercity passenger rail provide to our Nation.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 342, to designate the U.S. courthouse at 555 Independence Street, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, as the Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Sr., U.S. Courthouse. 
   Judge Limbaugh was a leading figure in the legal profession, not only in Missouri, not just in the United States, but worldwide. He practiced law for over eight decades. At the age of 104, at the time of his death, he was still practicing law and was in fact the oldest practicing attorney in the United States. 
   He argued over 60 cases before the Missouri Supreme Court, tried cases before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Labor Board and the Internal Revenue Appellate Division. He was city attorney for Cape Girardeau from 1917 to 1919. In 1923, he started a law firm that bears his name to this day. 
   From 1942 through 1946, he was Missouri counsel for the War Emergency Pipelines, which transported gasoline from Texas and Louisiana to the east coast as part of our war effort. 
   He was president of the Missouri Bar from 1955 through 1956, and served on a committee that drafted the Missouri Probate Court. In the early days of the independence of India, the State Department sent Judge Limbaugh to that country to be an Ambassador for the U.S. legal system. 
   He was active in civic aspects of life; elected to the Missouri State legislature in 1932 and 1933, where he advocated for the formation of the Missouri State Highway Patrol. He was president of the State Historical Society for Missouri from 1956-1959. He was a Sunday school teacher; active in the Boy Scouts of America, his Centenary United Methodist Church, and the Salvation Army. He died at his home on April 8, 1996. 
   Judge Limbaugh will be remembered as a brilliant attorney and a great American. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (DIRECTING ADMINISTRATOR OF GENERAL SERVICES TO INSTALL A PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM FOR THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Over 30 years ago, Mr. Speaker, as a second-term Member of the House and serving on the Public Works Committee, as it was called then, and the Subcommittee of Public Buildings and Grounds, I heard an extraordinary presentation about the use of photovoltaics in public buildings and how, as a result of this study, energy could be saved, burning of fossil fuels could be avoided, and the Federal Government could save enormous amounts of energy costs by using a then-new technology known as photovoltaics. 
   I was so enthralled by the idea, I drafted legislation which I shared with my then-colleague in the Senate from the State of Minnesota, Senator Hubert Humphrey, who introduced the companion bill in the other body; and together we got the legislation enacted, signed by President Carter, funding for the first 3 years of a 3-year investment by the Federal Government in converting Federal civilian office space to photovoltaic energy. Unfortunately, President Carter lost the election. President Reagan came in and decided that the alternative energy program was an unnecessary investment of the Federal Government, and the entire alternative energy budget was deleted. 
   Years passed. Interest in photovoltaic cells continued. Research and development and testing and application in the private marketplace, as well as by government agencies, continued and the cost of photovoltaics dropped from $1.75 a kilowatt hour in 1977 to about 25 cents a kilowatt hour today, compared to 7 cents produced by conventional fossil fuel power centers. 
   Well, I thought the time was ripe again for us to make another effort at having the Federal Government lead the way and being the template, being the exemplar in the marketplace for alternative energy use and deployment and reducing its cost. 
   So the bill that is before us today, it was reported, we had a hearing and markup in the subcommittee and markup in the full committee to use the Department of Energy headquarters as the exemplary facility for the Nation in use of photovoltaics. The Department of Energy building, just down the street from the Capitol, on Independence Avenue and what is also known as the Forestall Building. 
   In 1999, our then-Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, conducted a national competition to get the best architectural firms to develop a conceptual design for a photovoltaic system  to be installed on the south wall of the Department of Energy. Solarnet, the winning design, will transform that south wall, which was deliberately built in a solid face with no windows and no doors. It will transform that rather ugly, nondescript wall into this very attractive piece that is depicted in the panels before us in the well of the House. But that solar wall will generate 460,000 kilowatts of energy. It is 300 feet long, 130 feet high, will contain 24,750 square feet of power-generating panels. 
   The Federal Government is the largest single consumer of energy in the country. We are in a unique position to show the rest of the Nation how to conserve energy, how to be efficient in doing it, and to do so with our trust of management of Federal civilian office space. 
   The Department of Energy estimated in 2005 that the cost of energy consumption of all forms by Federal agencies was $14.5 billion; $5.5 billion of that was spent on buildings and facilities, meaning electricity. 
   GSA, General Services Administration, manages 387.7 million square feet of non-military, non-postal civilian office space. It ought to set the stage, it ought to set the standard for the Nation in being energy efficient and reducing the cost to the taxpayer of operating these Federal buildings. 
   We ought to, also, change our management of Federal office space both in the construction and in the leasing of those office facilities to life-cycle cost considerations, not just the lowest initial cost of construction; but we are going to be the tenant, we are going to be the owner of those facilities, tenant in the leased operations and owner in those that are outright owned by the Federal Government for as long as we are in there, and we ought to do the best that we can for the taxpayer, and we ought to set the stage and help create a marketplace for production of photovoltaics that will, in volume production, reduce their cost. 
   Photovoltaics are very simple devices. The sun strikes a panel that has lines of filament that create resistance, transmit that resistance across a grid and collectively produce direct current electricity that is then converted into alternating current electricity. It can run all the lights, the elevators, the escalators, everything, computers, everything that uses electricity in the Department of Energy building, and have excess power at the end of the day to turn back into the Potomac Electric Power Company grid so that the electric meter will run backwards at the Department of Energy at the end of the day. That is what we ought to be doing. We can do that. 
   It is within our authority of this committee to set the stage for advances in technology. Already some 25 buildings of the Federal Government nationwide use photovoltaics in one way or another. The Department of Agriculture does, also just down the street, Independence Avenue. The Park Service, the Forest Service, NOAA, on their weather buoys, the space program all use photovoltaics to gather information, transmit. The Highway Departments, on traffic monitoring signs, use photovoltaics, gathering electricity during the day, storing it in batteries and run those signs at night off solar power. 
   We are only addressing one project today, but that could be multiples in the future. And we are here doing what we can within our ability. It is not going to solve all of the problems of global climate change, but we have an obligation to do our part and to do what we can within this committee. 
   Toward that end, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) for his participation through the subcommittee and then to the full committee. 
   I thank our full committee ranking member, Mr. Mica, for his support and initiative on this matter and moving us to this point where we could pass this bill in the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Again I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his thoughtfulness. And I recall our very pleasant visit to his district on transportation and economic development issues many years ago when we saw so much of the progress that has been done through the Economic Development Administration, the need for highway investments, for which the gentleman has been a strong advocate. And I also remember a very special feeling, the presentation by the Fort Smith Chamber of Commerce of a unique award: a noose. I don't know what happened to it. I never did take possession of it to bring back with me, but someday I will make a return visit to Fort Smith. There is a long story we need not describe in this setting about Fort Smith and its role in the early days of territories and frontiers. 
   The sun wall design, as these posters describe it, will be a very attractive facility aesthetically but attractive energywise and more than a statement, a demonstration by the Federal Government, the leadership role that it can play and it should play in moving the Nation toward energy independence. 
   The Department of Energy conducted an analysis some time ago of the potential for photovoltaics and demonstrated that in a 100-mile by 100-mile square area of the Arizona desert, all the energy needs of the United States could be produced by photovoltaics. Well, we are making a start on that commitment with this legislation, moving in the right direction. It is long overdue, but we are making that step in the right direction. 
   I thank my colleagues on the committee, Chairman MICA for his willingness to move ahead with this legislation; and the gentleman from Ohio for his thoughtful and studious advocacy of the legislation; and Ms. Norton, the Chair of our Public Buildings and Economic Development Subcommittee, for their participation in bringing the bill to this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   This legislation is vitally important. It is long-standing. Actually, transportation security legislation in the aftermath of September 11 originated in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, where the gentleman from Alaska, then the chairman, and I worked on a wide range of transportation issues. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), then the Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee, and I worked on what became the Transportation Security Administration, the TSA, the aviation portion of it. 
   So we have a long-standing interest and involvement and in-depth engagement in this issue of transportation security. And now that the Homeland Security Committee has been created, we share aspects of this jurisdiction with that committee under the able leadership of the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the able chairman of the committee. We are very grateful for the opportunity we have had to work together to align our interests and achieve a memorandum of understanding that has been incorporated into the Rules of the House on the shared jurisdiction. 
   Over a decade before September 11, 40-plus percent of terrorist incidents were carried out against rail systems and transit buses; and events of recent note show that those kinds of attacks continue. 
   The transportation systems covered under this legislation cover over 11 billion passengers. In the United States, every day 14 million people use public transportation for some 10 billion plus transit trips annually. 
   This legislation gives us new authority and new funding to address the needs of those transit systems, to protect them against attacks, reduce their vulnerability and improve the security of passengers. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. That is correct. This clarifying language comes in large part as a response to court opinions that have misapplied principles of Federal preemption which has prevented people injured by the negligent acts of railroads from being compensated. The bill does not change any of the current law, but only adds to it to clarify the meaning of what is already in public law.

The situation needing remedy is the misinterpretation of the statute by some courts. That is precisely what this clarifying language is intended to accomplish. This matter will be further reviewed as we proceed with reauthorization of the Federal Rail Safety Act in our Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and I would look forward to continuing to work with the gentleman from North Dakota, the Chair of the subcommittee, and ranking member of the subcommittee to address the judicial interpretation.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, we have worked very vigorously in our committee over decades to achieve the bipartisanship, and we have done so. But I think the gentleman is a little misguided in his recitation of history, because there were the Federalists and the Democrats at the outset and they didn't do much bipartisanship at the beginning of this Congress of ours. 
   I just refer to section 3 of the manager's amendment, line 2: No Preemption of State Law. Nothing in section 20106 of title 49 U.S. Code preempts a State cause of action, or any damages recoverable in such an action, et cetera. So, in fact, the preemptive language specifically recognizes that existing law preempts positive laws, regulation, or orders by executive or legislative branch officials, expressly address railroad safety or security. And, not to be concerned, we will address the broader issue as we go forward with the rail safety authorization.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Again, I want to express my great appreciation to the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee with whom I have worked very diligently and cooperatively. He is a man of great personal integrity and legislative honor and has worked vigorously to produce a splendid rail and public transportation security bill. 
   There has been some discussion about how the grants will be administered. We had testimony before our committee from the Nation's transit agencies and through their national organization. The American Public Transit Association told our committee they prefer to work with the DOT and Federal Transit Administration and grant administration. They have had experience with them. FTA knows the operational aspect of transit. They know the security side of transit. They can combine the two with less complexity and more efficiency than the Department of Homeland Security, which is just getting started, with a huge new bureaucracy, as we have learned, with over 206,000 people. So that part is working well and will work well in the language that we have agreed upon. 
   Again, let me just come back to the preemption issue. Read the words, believe the words, ``no preemption of State law.'' That's what it says. That's what it means. I strongly support the manager's amendment.

   And I respect very much the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). He is a very devout fiscal conservative. But, unfortunately, this language, as I read his amendment, would make very vulnerable those persons who travel Amtrak routes that don't yield as much revenue to Amtrak as those on  the east coast or the west coast. The Silver Service Palmetto carries 457,000 passengers. The Silver Meteor goes from New York, Philadelphia, Wilmington, all the way to Ft. Lauderdale, 273,000 passengers. The Capitol Limited, Chicago to Washington, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Toledo, nearly 200,000 passengers. The City of New Orleans, from Chicago to New Orleans, 175,000 passengers a year. You are saying that they should be vulnerable, but not others in more densely run lines. I think that is inappropriate.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (APPALACHIAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentlewoman, the Chair of our Water Resources Subcommittee, for standing in and carrying on while I was actually returning from Appalachia. And I thank the gentleman from Missouri, our ranking member on the subcommittee, for his strong support of all of the issues before our committee, and particularly these matters today. 
   I was in Sunbury and Shamokin Dam in Pennsylvania with our colleague, Congressman Carney, in his portion of the Appalachian Regional Commission looking at the Economic Development Highway Program of ARC. 
   Well, it's a long stretch from Minnesota to Appalachia, but the Appalachian region is an area that I have been associated with legislatively since I started here in the Congress 44 years ago as clerk of the Subcommittee on Rivers and Harbors, to the Committee on Public Works, predecessor to our Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
   I was engaged then in the earliest stages of forming what we know today as the Economic Development Administration and the Appalachian Regional Commission. It was close on the heels of the designation by President John F. Kennedy of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. to travel throughout the Appalachian region to assess the conditions of distress, to listen to the concerns of the communities throughout the 13-State region, and to provide him with a report and a road map on dealing with the needs of Appalachia. 
   When John F. Kennedy went into the region, he found a region of poverty, a region of desolation. It struck him as worse than anything he had seen; a region he described as exploited by the coal barons, neglected by government and laid bare by ravages of the boom-and-bust cycles of coal mining. 
   In President Kennedy's words: ``This is an area rich in potential. Its people are hardworking, intelligent, resourceful, capable of responding successfully to education and training. They are loyal to their homes, to their families, to their States and to their country.'' 
   ``The Appalachian region,'' he said, ``is well-endowed with potential water, mineral, forest and scenic resources. This region, properly developed and assisted by the Federal Government, can make a contribution to the Nation's well-being.'' 
   That was in 1960. Following the report of Franklin Roosevelt, Jr., President Kennedy shaped what we know today as the legislation that created the Appalachian Regional Commission, engineered into law by then-President Lyndon Johnson, authored in the Senate by Senator Jennings Randolph, and many cosponsors in the House, including my predecessor John Blotnick. At the time that John F. Kennedy made those observations, the way up for most people in Appalachia was a bus ticket north to Detroit or Chicago. 
   The economy of Appalachia could well be described in those days as 80 acres and a mule. When I traveled as a staff member into the region and saw that people were living in the hard pan areas, where there was no ground filtration for the sewage they were discharging into the creeks and streams, and in many places, generations of dysentery, where people were drinking their own sewage. 
   The area needed highways, airports; it needed vocational training centers; it needed education systems; it needed health care centers; it needed the structure of what 150 years of neglect had denied that area. And through the establishment of the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Federal/State partnership that resulted from it, an area that in 1960, whose income amounted to 45 percent of the national average, today is up to 75 percent of the national average. Where homeownership was a luxury, it is now a reality. Where job creation was nonexistent, it has now returned to this area, fulfilling President Kennedy's promise that the region can make a contribution to the Nation's well-being. And so it did exceedingly well. 
   Over many years, there were efforts to kill Appalachia. I remember so vividly during a hearing that I conducted as Chair of the Economic Development Subcommittee many years ago that we held in eastern Kentucky and brought witnesses from throughout the region, including from Tennessee, and I remember Ms. Tilda Kemplan, director of a child resource center, testifying at our field hearing and saying, ``Gentlemen, when you go back to Washington, try not to look at that dollar and see George Washington, but look over the top of the dollar and see a child and see our future.'' And that is what Appalachia has done. The Appalachian Regional Commission has caused us to look over the top of the dollar and to see a child and to see the future of the region. 
   In another community we talked to members of the city council and the chamber of commerce. One of them said, very touchingly, ``Before the ARC, we were so far down we had to look up to see bottom, but now we see a future.'' And in another community in West Virginia, the mayor of the town took us to his small business. Congressman NICK RAHALL was along, this was his district. And as the mayor and businessman explaining his operation and the need for road, for airport, for rail transportation, describing the needs and the good things that had been accomplished so far with the ARC, I looked at the wall behind the cash  register, and there was a sign that read: ``God never put nobody in a place too small to grow.'' 
   Appalachia has been growing, the counties throughout this region, growing and overcoming 150 years of neglect and decline; making investments, creating opportunities, building for the future. One of the reports about a decade ago by the commission, their annual report on progress, said: ``Halfway home and a long way to go.'' Well, there's still a long way to go, but the march forward has been much improved, vastly improved by the investments we have made in partnership with the States throughout this region. 
   Continuing the investments, as we have done in the SAFETEA-LU Appalachia Backbone Highway Program at $470 million a year, continuing with the more than $400 million over the 4 years of the authorization in this bill, we will continue that partnership with the States, the communities, the neighborhood, the people of the Appalachian region. It is an investment of which all America can be proud, and of which all America has benefited. 
   I thank the gentleman from Missouri, and, heck, my colleagues on the Republican side of the committee. Throughout this whole initiative from the 1960s, this has been a totally bipartisan effort. And I recall, especially during the Reagan years when the Reagan administration was proposing to abolish the ARC and Congressman HAL ROGERS, the former chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee of appropriations, said, ``We're not going to let them wear us down. We're going to proceed. We're going to prevail. We have prevailed. Appalachia prevails. And America prevails with it.''  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 799, a bipartisan bill to improve the programs authorized by the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-4) and reauthorize the Appalachian Regional Commission (``ARC'') for 5 years through FY 2011. 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission was created to address economic issues and social problems of the Appalachian region as a part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society program. Historically, the Appalachian region has faced high levels of poverty and economic distress resulting from geographic isolation and inadequate infrastructure. 
   As a regional economic development agency, ARC supports the development of Appalachia's economy and critical infrastructure to provide a climate for industry growth and job creation. ARC programs affect 406 counties located in 13 states, including all of West Virginia, and parts of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. The Appalachian region covers nearly 200,000 square miles and contains approximately 22 million people. Currently, of the 406 counties included in the ARC, 114 are considered to be distressed counties. 
   Since its creation in 1965, ARC has administered a variety of programs to aid in the advancement of the region, including the creation of a highway system, enhancements in education and job training, and the development of water and sewer systems. ARC's funding and projects have contributed significantly to employment, health, and general economic development improvements in the region. 
   Because of its efficiencies in decision-making and service delivery, ARC served as a model for the Delta Regional Authority. ARC is successful because it responds to identified and agreed upon needs, and is extremely flexible in its approach. According to research conducted by Brandow Co. and the Economic Development Research Group, three fourths of ARC infrastructure projects with specific business or job-related goals met or exceeded formal projections. This is a very robust figure. 
   H.R. 799 builds on more than four decades of economic development successes by providing additional, much-needed Federal investment in the region. The bill allows ARC to continue its economic development activities using such tools as the telecommunication and technology initiative, and the entrepreneurship initiation to improve the quality of life for the citizens of Appalachia. Further, the bill provides authority for the Commission to make technical assistance grants for energy efficient projects or projects to increase the use of renewable energy resources. This bill also authorizes the designation of ``at risk'' counties, which are counties in the Appalachian region that are most at risk of becoming economically distressed, and identifies the percentage of funds for which these counties are eligible. 
   ARC's authorization expired at the end of FY 2006. During the 109th Congress, the Committee's bipartisan leadership introduced H.R. 5812, a bill reauthorizing ARC through FY 2011. Although the Senate passed S. 2832 to reauthorize the ARC, the Senate-passed bill did not include the anti-earmarking provision of H.R. 5812. The House did not pass S. 2832 and no further action was taken on H.R. 5812. This bill includes the anti-earmarking provision. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Appalachian Regional Commission.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I greatly appreciate the remarks of the gentleman from Ohio. He did great service, Madam Speaker, during his chairmanship of the Economic Development Subcommittee in service to the needs of the Appalachian Regional Commission, the ARC, and the Federal Economic Development Administration programs throughout the country. Adding these counties is an appropriate and necessary step to help lift the region further toward the future of continued economic growth. I was very touched by the gentleman's remarks  about education and the increase in education rights. He spoke well and rightly. 
   I do want to emphasize for the record, though, that included among all the many beneficial provisions of this bill is an important limitation on earmarking of funds within the ARC. In the past, and it has usually happened in conference, but also occasionally in the House appropriations bill, funds have been earmarked for one or another project which has undercut the effectiveness of the Federal-State partnership and the authenticity of the grass-roots up process of project designation, development and implementation. Using the appropriations process to direct funds has disadvantaged the other regions, of the other States within the region, and has devalued the funding that Congress has appropriated. More importantly, it devalues the Federal, State, and local partnership, the very effective grass-roots up process of project selection within Appalachia. It says your judgment doesn't count. We know better. The authenticity and effectiveness of the ARC program derives exactly from its grass-roots initiative. 
   So I was very insistent in the last Congress on finding a means by which we could thwart the earmarking. We have it in this bill. Our Senate counterparts have concurred that they want to follow this procedure. It will inure to the benefit of the Appalachian Regional Commission.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   The manager's amendment authorizes the Coast Guard to delegate to classification societies the Coast Guard's authority for safety plan review and construction inspections of offshore oil structures. It allows this authority to be delegated to foreign classification societies to the extent that the government of the country in which the classification society is headquartered accepts documents prepared by our classification society, the American Bureau of Shipping, on behalf of the leaseholder, and does not limit the ABS to this process. 
   I also want to thank several colleagues for agreeing to have their amendments incorporated into the manager's amendment to expedite consideration of the bill: The gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Tauscher); the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Loretta Sanchez); the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind); the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo); and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner). 
   The Tauscher amendment requires federally licensed pilots to use portable electronic devices with navigational charts capable of being connected to an Automatic Identification System. 
   The Sanchez amendment requires the Superintendent of the Coast Guard to prescribe a policy on sexual harassment and sexual violence. 
   The Kind amendment deals with monthly ballast water treatment reports to the Secretary, requiring them. In addition, the amendment provides that no-ballast-on-board vessels will be required to conduct ballast water treatment, when applicable. 
   The Bordallo amendment requires Coast Guard vessels homeported in Guam to be repaired at shipyards in the U.S., including Guam shipyards. The same requirement applies to all other Coast Guard cutters homeported elsewhere in the United States. 
   The Weiner amendment requires the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study on health, safety and environmental concerns related to an underground petroleum spill on the Brooklyn, New York, shoreline.

   The amendment addresses section 720 of the substitute regarding waterside security around LNG tankers and terminals. It provides that the Coast Guard may consider security assets and personnel provided by State and local officials who are contracted for or otherwise made available to an LNG terminal operator in determining whether security resources are available to carry out our waterside security measures. 
   The Coast Guard has, as we have so often discussed, limited resources to undertake its many missions. Partnering with State and local officials or contracted waterside security services will be in effect force multipliers for the Coast Guard. So we support that initiative.

I think that is a very important protection, especially for women who are often alone and can be subjected to violence, as we have seen in the course of these hearings. I support the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman from Texas, a member of our committee, for offering this amendment. 
   The Coast Guard in the past 4 months has had 23 cases involving semi-submersible vessels, and the Coast Guard intelligence sector predicts that 85 cases will occur this year, possibly a projection of 120 such cases next year. 
   This amendment deals with stateless submersible or semi-submersible vessels on international voyages, and makes it a finding of Congress that they are a serious international problem that facilitates transnational crimes, including drug trafficking and terrorism, a serious threat to U.S. maritime security navigation, and I appreciate the gentleman offering the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   It was our purpose from the very outset of crafting the marine safety provisions of this bill to delineate clearly the responsibilities of the Coast Guard on safety, on its safety mission, and on the new emphasis within the Department o Homeland Security on their security responsibilities. 
   In fact, this was an issue, I would say to the gentleman from Ohio, that then Chairman Young and I raised with the President at the White House some 6 plus years ago when he first proposed the Department of Homeland Security, that the bill, as proposed, the proposition set forth by the administration, did not distinguish between search, rescue, safety responsibilities of the Coast Guard and these new emphasis duties on security. We do that now in this legislation. The amendment of the gentleman from California will further delineate that distinction. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding this time, and I thank the gentleman for his amendment.

I do support the amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman from Florida with whose father I had the pleasure to serve, a person of great personal distinction who served this body very well and with whom I had a delightful personal relationship. And I always appreciated that friendship. 
   I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment which requires biometric identification of suspected persons, including terrorists, to strengthen border security. Fingerprinting, digital photos, and other technology can be used to identify illegal migrants, smugglers, and terrorists. It will be useful in establishing a database. 
   It parallels what we do in the TSA for aviation security and in other areas of security. It will be a valuable asset in the ongoing struggle against terrorism, and I appreciate the gentleman offering the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I share those concerns. 
   Lockheed Martin, which has the contractor responsibility for issuance of TWIC cards, has reported that fingerprint rejection rate due to poor print quality has been in the range of 2 percent. If you happen to be one of those 2 percent, then you really have a problem. And so that requires those who are rejected to keep coming back to an enrollment center. And the amendment would alleviate mariners from having to make several trips. 
   I remember myself, when I was working my way through college, I was working at a concrete block factory. I eventually wore out gloves and I said I can't afford any more gloves, so I just moved the concrete blocks with my hands until eventually I had such thick calluses I had no fingerprint whatever, no markings on any of my fingers. It took months afterwards, back in college, to shed those calluses. So I can imagine workers on the docks and all having similar problems. And I think this relief for mariners will be very, very beneficial. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I want to start by thanking the Chair and the Parliamentarian for clarification of a rule of the House that somehow escaped my understanding, and it was interesting to have that explanation. I apologize to the gentleman from Ohio if we had some missteps even to the advantage of the committee. 
   Of course, I support the amendment, as I said at the outset. It's a study and report amendment to provide a critical assessment of how much the Coast Guard has done to establish standards for State and local law enforcement units that perform maritime patrols and the extent to which law enforcement can meet those standards. I think it's useful to have that information. 
   Madam Chairman, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Ohio.

   Certainly it's our intention to protect the resources of the Coast Guard. We will work to assure that when a bill emerges from conference that there will be sufficient change, that we will not elevate one mission above any other critical Coast Guard mission. 
   And as further clarification, it was simply a request from NTSB that at least for 1 year we transfer adequate funds to start off. So the legislation limits that transfer of dollars to 1 year, and we will work to assure the strengthening of that language to make sure that that's only for 1 year. And then in the meantime, as I said in an earlier discussion on this matter, we will go to the Appropriations Committee, I hope in a bipartisan effort, to ask them to provide sufficient additional funding for the Coast Guard to continue to carry out its missions.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Again I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It is certainly not our intent to elevate marine safety. Marine safety is one of several functions of the Coast Guard. But as I said in earlier debates, when Mr. Young, then chairman of the committee, and I were at the White House at the earliest stages of creating the Department of Homeland Security, we raised this issue at the White House and said, You're not making clear enough distinction between the homeland security role of the Coast Guard and the other functions, search and rescue, marine safety, aid in navigation, and so on. So we're now providing that clear delineation, assuring there are adequate resources, providing additional personnel to the Coast Guard, the first really substantial increase in Coast Guard personnel since I came to Congress in 1975. And I'm really insistent on this, that we do not elevate above that but that we clearly delineate the marine safety function of the Coast Guard.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) for offering this amendment. It does indeed correct a technical mistake and oversight in drafting the bill. There should have been a cross-reference as we inserted one provision in the bill so that the interlake transfer of ballast water would have been covered. Unfortunately, it was an oversight that the legislative counsel did not catch in time, and our committee staff found it after the manager's amendment had been already presented. So through the vigilance of the gentleman from Illinois and his concern for interlake transfer, we certainly accept this provision. 
   I am very happy to report that not only did we deal with invasive species in the WRDA bill, but also in this Coast Guard bill. It is the first time we have enforcement language on invasive species and interlake transfer. As the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) said earlier today, this is a bad day for invasive species. This is another bad moment for invasive species. 
   I also want to mention that either next week or the following week I have a meeting, the subject of which I have already discussed with Mr. LaTourette, with one of our major interlake shipping companies and other entities to put in place this shipping season a control pilot program for ballast water for lakers. The lakers present a more complicated challenge on ballast water exchange because they have four or five times as many ballast chambers as do the salties coming into the Great Lakes, and dealing with the volume of water and the number of ballast chambers and the treatment technology, it becomes much more complicated for interlake shipping. 
   We are going to address that this summer. We are going to put in place a pilot program and explore all of the treatment methodologies and equipment and chemicals and how to treat those chemicals before they are again discharged back into the waters of the Great Lakes. And the viral hemorrhagic septicemia issue is chief among those. I think science still doesn't know how to address it. But it and other such assaults upon this one-fifth of all the fresh water upon the face of the Earth is vital. We make an assault upon it in this legislation, and we are determined to follow it through. 
   I thank the gentleman for his amendment. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.

Our colleagues on the west coast for many years, I remember in the seventies and eighties, were saying, what are you worried about invasive species for? Then curious creatures began to appear in the waters of the ports on the west coast from ballast water discharged in those ports from vessels leaving the Pacific Rim, from Japan to Korea to the South China Sea. So this is a unified effort here.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The amendment is very limited in nature, very specific, to deal with the transfer of property that will not take place until the Coast Guard has relocated the station at facilities that are yet to be built. It will also not take place until environmental cleanup has occurred on the existing site. And that is important. The commandant has determined that retention of property is not required to carry out any other Coast Guard mission. So protection for the Coast Guard, protection for the City and the cleanup provisions, and it is a very beneficial amendment. 
   I want to address another matter, the concern of the gentleman from Michigan about the transfer of excess property to the Christian Cornerstone Academy, a land transfer that is supported by the Coast Guard, by the Academy, and the community of Sheboygan. We had already filed the manager's amendment at the time that this issue came to the attention of the gentleman from Michigan, and it was not possible to include that in the manager's amendment nor in the amendments considered by the Rules Committee. 
   But I do want to assure the gentleman that we will work to accomplish the purposes of this land transfer as we get into conference with the other body. Or, should such language be included by the other body in their version of the Coast Guard, which is now working its way to the floor of the other body, that we should expect to meet in conference and recognize the special needs in this matter. The Coast Guard executed a 10-year, no cost lease for the construction of the Cornerstone Christian Academy in Sheboygan. The lease has been renegotiated to fair market value. The Coast Guard has deemed 6 acres of the property as excess, if I have described the matter rightly. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I share the gentleman's concern for adequate icebreaking capability on the Great Lakes. We have the new icebreaker Mackinaw. The Coast Guard has smaller harbor icebreakers. But they simply are not sufficient to keep channels open. This past shipping season, the Coast Guard failed to send the Mackinaw upstream, up lake, to keep channels open for shipping of iron ore to lower lake steel mills. 
   I assure the gentleman, I will work diligently with the Coast Guard to keep their attention focused on our needs for icebreaking capability on the Great Lakes. On the Chesapeake Bay, I said to the chairman of the subcommittee, you don't have that problem. It doesn't freeze over.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I enormously respect the distinguished and amiable gentleman from Ohio, the weight-lifting champ of the House gym. When he walks on the floor, the weights quiver and shake in awe of his appearance. 
   He has been an advocate for the Delta Queen even back to last fall when I was in the Bethesda Naval Hospital for an operation to correct a long-standing injury to my neck. He sent a sheet cake with the Delta Queen emblazoned upon it to remind me of his diligence and of his enthusiasm for the Delta Queen. I could only eat one slice of it, but I assured him that the staff at the hospital, who had no idea what the Delta Queen was all about, appreciated this sheet cake from the very distinguished and caring gentleman from the State of Ohio. 
   But labor has nothing to do with this issue. I haven't heard from a single person in any labor union about this matter. 
   The Delta Queen was built in 1926 and carried 174 passengers, 88 state rooms. It has extensive wood superstructure. It has extensive wood interior and furniture, and for those reasons, the Coast Guard will not certify this vessel. Opposition is clear. The combustible construction of the vessel presents an unacceptable fire risk that cannot be mitigated by the addition of fire-suppression measures, says the Coast Guard. 
   As such, the Coast Guard's position remains unchanged. The Delta Queen should be prohibited from operating with overnight passengers. 
   Since May 28, 1936, the United States has required that passenger vessels be constructed essentially of fire retardant material. In the interest of maritime safety, the Coast Guard, continuing their quote, has consistently opposed legislation to prolong the service of the Delta Queen. A vessel constructed of wood operating in the overnight passenger trade presents an unacceptable fire risk to its passengers and crew. 
   It goes on at great length. 
   The Delta Queen can operate in daytime but not at night. 
   In the operation of the trade on the Mississippi River, the worst disaster in history occurred, fire onboard a paddle wheeler. Yes, in the 19th century, but 1,700 people died 100 yards from shore. 
   On March 22 of this year, of this year, the Delta Queen had a fire in the generating room requiring the use of their fixed C0  
   2 extinguishing system. Fortunately, no one was injured. The generator shorted, caused flames to shoot out the generator end. 
   Earlier this month, the Queen of the West, this April, a similar paddle wheel operated by the very same company that owns and operates the Delta Queen had a fire in the engine room, required evacuation of 177 passengers and crew. Three crew members were treated for smoke inhalation.     
   Last year, in May, the Empress of the North, another excursion vessel operated by the same company owning the Delta Queen, ran aground in southeast Alaska, evacuating over 200 passengers and crew; fourth grounding of that vessel in less than 4 years. 
   Now I can understand those who live along the Mississippi River, which starts nearly in my district all the way down to the Gulf, but friends, we would never stand for limiting safety on a 747 aircraft. And over a decade ago, a foreign airline was trying to remove over-  wing exits from a 747. Congressman Bill Clinger, Pennsylvania's ranking Republican on the Committee on Aviation with me, we stopped them from doing that. We stopped the FAA from allowing that risk to safety. We should stop this risk to safety here. Fire at night is terrifying. Oppose the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act that includes critical provisions to strengthen the U.S. Coast Guard. 
   It's been since 2004, the last time we actually moved through House and Senate and conference a Coast Guard authorization bill, not for lack of effort. In the 109th Congress in 2005 and 2006 the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, under then Chairman Don Young, a strong advocate, admirer of and one who embraces the U.S. Coast Guard, we moved the bill through committee, and we brought it to the House in 2006. Unfortunately, we were not able to reach conference with the other body, but not for lack of effort.  
   And so that bipartisan initiative was rekindled last year as the committee picked up the pieces and incorporated the work of previous Congresses and moved forward with a very expansive Coast Guard authorization bill. 
   Toward that purpose, I express my deepest appreciation for the chairmanship of the subcommittee, under Elijah Cummings, the Member from Baltimore, who has embraced his responsibility and duty and embraced the Coast Guard and mastered the subject matter. And our ranking member on that Coast Guard Subcommittee, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) who, in his ever thoughtful, judicious, thorough manner, similarly has mastered the subject matter. He is a master of detail, and has brought many thoughtful recommendations to the legislation that is before us. 
   And I thank the gentleman for his splendid cooperation, that of the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Mica, who has ceded the floor responsibilities to Mr. LaTourette. Mr. Mica, representing the State of Florida, a State that is intimately related with, to, dependent upon, and grateful to the Coast Guard for its services. 
   In this bill, we extend, we first of all, increase personnel for the U.S. Coast Guard. In my first year in Congress, 1975, I served on the Coast Guard Subcommittee and subsequently, all through to 1995, when the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, which included Coast Guard, was dissolved and the responsibilities of the Coast Guard transferred over to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure where I continued to work on Coast Guard issues. 
   From 1975, Coast Guard personnel authorization was at 39,000. We added 27 new functions, new responsibilities, various Congresses, various presidents over the years, without increasing substantially Coast Guard personnel. We do that in this legislation. We add 1,500 military personnel.     
   We increase the total strength of the Coast Guard to 47,000 to adequately serve the needs of the clear dual responsibilities of the Coast Guard, safety, which is search and rescue, and buoy tending and navigation aids and so on, and the security responsibility in the Coast Guard in the era of homeland security. 
   There will be no argument or no, how shall I say, excuse in the future that the Coast Guard doesn't have sufficient personnel so they have to be a multi-mission agency. We're going to assure that they have adequate personnel through this authorization and subsequent funding of it to carry out all of their civil responsibilities. 
   We extend benefits to Coast Guard personnel, reimburse them for medical-related travel for members assigned to remote locations. We grant access to Armed Forces retirement home systems to the Coast Guard veterans. We allow Coast Guard in this legislation to provide authorization for personnel who work in support of a declaration of a major disaster or emergency issued by the President to retain up to a total of 90 days of accrued leave compared to only 60 days currently. 
   We implement the administration's proposal initiated by the Coast Guard to reorganize the Coast Guard. As they propose in their plan in this legislation, we provide authorization that eliminates two area commands established by law and the Coast Guard chief of staff position and replace those with four vice admirals, deputy commandant for mission support, deputy commandant for national operations and policy, the commander for force readiness command and the commander for the operations command, and we promote, in this legislation, the vice commandant to full admiral. 
   The legislation strengthens substantially fishing vessel safety, the most dangerous occupation in the United States, improving the training, construction, and enforcement standards for commercial fishing vessels; double hull around fuel bunker tanks on new construction of U.S. vessels. Any vessel carrying more than 600 cubic meters of oil will have double hulls around their fuel tanks to prevent the disastrous consequences such as the COSCO BUSAN, which Chairman Cummings went out to hold a hearing on in the San Francisco Bay following the allision with the Bay Bridge and with the release of 53,000 gallons of heavy fuel. 
   Ballast water treatment. We have the first enforcement program since invasive species were identified as a major problem in the Great Lakes in the 1970s. We require ships to install ballast water treatment systems in 2009 to control invasive species into U.S. ports, waterways, of course in the inland waterways and the Great Lakes. We established a standard adopted by the International Maritime Organization from 2009 to 2012, but beginning in 2012, the standard will be increased to 100 times greater than the IMO, based on best-available technology. 
   There are eight provisions dealing with port security that I will withhold comment on which Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON will speak, and I'm very grateful for his participation in all of our committee work. I will also set aside for the moment the Coast Guard Deepwater assets procurement issue for Chairman Cummings to address. That was a matter on which he devoted an enormous amount of time. 
   We remove appearance of conflict by transferring administrative law judges from the Coast Guard to the National Transportation Safety Board, as we did years ago, bipartisan initiative in our committee for pilots. The venue for appeals to the commandant decision to suspend or revoke a mariner's license, such as a captain's license, for violation of marine safety laws or acts of professional incompetence will now be heard by an NTSB administrative law judge but retaining the Coast Guard authority to decide whether to seek suspension or revocation of a mariner's license. 
   In 2007, two former Coast Guard ALJs testified before the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation that they were pressured not to allow a mariner's discovery of information that could vindicate that mariner. 
   I think one of our major contributions, perhaps in my mind the most significant, apart from the Deepwater, which has already passed the House, is the establishment of new Marine Safety Authority and raising the quality of personnel and the authority for marine safety within the Coast Guard, establish marine safety as a function of the Coast Guard. It is now mentioned in their basic law. But we established marine safety as a Coast Guard function focused on actions necessary to protect life, property and the environment at sea. 
   Created an assistant commandant for marine safety. The chief of marine safety in each Coast Guard sector; established minimum qualifications for all marine safety personnel saying that those persons appointed to marine safety positions, safety inspectors, casualty inspectors, chief of marine safety, be technically qualified for those positions that they should have at least the qualifications that the American Bureau of Shipping has and better than those. 
   We establish a limited duty officer program in marine safety to allow commanders or chief warrant officers who have extensive marine safety experience to have the opportunity to specialize in marine safety. 
   We require that appeals and waivers of marine safety laws and regulations be handled by qualified marine inspectors. Those marine safety regulations now are handled by the chain of command of the Coast Guard. That means an appeal can be decided by a ship driver, a helicopter pilot, who has no qualifications in the specific issue at hand. We need to raise the qualifications, the skills of those personnel in key positions of the Coast Guard. This bill does that. 
   And we also require establishment of and funding for a course in marine safety as part of the curriculum at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. I was there in New London at the Coast Guard Academy on Friday, and a commandant of the academy and a commandant of cadets both were thrilled with this idea, as were cadets with whom I visited. 
   And the final point I want to call attention to is the strengthening of the marine pollution prevention provisions in the act. I will leave those details to later. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

I have a very positive and hopeful outlook. 
   Third, as for redesigning and restructuring the Coast Guard, the committee has done that since the 1960s, directing how the structure of the Coast Guard shall be organized. In fact, we do far less structuring in this bill following in that tradition than is done for the U.S. Navy.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill authorizes conditional conveyance of any interest retained by the United States in St. Joseph Memorial Hall in St. Joseph, Michigan, to the city of St. Joseph, Michigan. In the 109th Congress, an identical bill was introduced, moved through committee, and passed the House as H.R. 4700. Unfortunately, no action was taken on that bill by the other body. 
   The bill would complete a land transfer between the Federal Government and the city of St. Joseph, Michigan, that is very long standing. It goes back to 1935. The city in that year received a nonhistoric building and property with a restriction limiting use of the property to a public park. In 1954, the public use restriction was lifted on the parcel just north of the building through Public Act 348. 
   H.R. 494, the bill presently before us and its predecessor in the last Congress, conveys to the city of St. Joseph any interest in St. Joseph Hall that is retained by the United States. This legislation has the effect of removing the restriction requiring use of the property for a park. 
   City officials have asked for this transfer in order to permit the city to complete a redevelopment plan for the downtown that would utilize this parcel of land and the building. The city is further prepared to pay $10,000 to the General Services Administration for the transfer. 
   This legislation has been advocated by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) who has been very persevering in pursuit of this legislation. I have come to know the gentleman from Michigan very well personally through our work on Great Lakes issues and on the U.S.-Canada Interparliamentary Group in which we have both participated. He is very earnest about this project, and has been a very effective advocate for it. I am hopeful that with our action again in this body that we will be able to persuade the other body to move forthwith on the legislation and get it enacted.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us would authorize St. Louis County, Missouri, to build a road over three-tenths of an acre of deed-restricted property. The road that they would build will lead to a development project along the Mississippi River adjacent to St. Louis. 
   In the aftermath of the 1993 Mississippi River flood, which many of us can vividly remember, and I recall so much part of that tragedy our then majority leader, Mr. Gephardt, passing sandbags down along the riverfront to halt the onslaught of the river, it was a very compelling moment in flood history in America. St. Louis was particularly hard hit. 
   FEMA, under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, acquired property, took it out of development and protected the floodplain from development for uses that would be inconsistent with the need to protect the area against flood. 
   FEMA requires that properties purchased under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program be maintained in perpetuity for uses consistent with open space, recreation or wetlands management. The law generally does not allow new structures to be built on such property, but exceptions are permitted under existing law, including projects preapproved in writing by the director of FEMA. FEMA has promulgated regulations to spell out those restrictions. 
   The property which is the subject of this legislation, was not purchased with hazard mitigation funds, but with Community Development Block Grant funds. But those funds were subjected to the same FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program easement restrictions for open space. 
   All parties tried in the current situation to find an exception in the historic application of FEMA law and regulation, but the project didn't fit any of the historic examples or exceptions. So the State and the county both are seeking a waiver of the easement so that both entities can proceed with construction of a road that will create access to a complex development project of housing, retail, commercial space and open and recreational space. 
   Now, this project itself is not within nor will it be built anywhere on restricted property, property restricted by FEMA under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds. And to be sure that there are no escape clauses or escape hatches, if you will, the bill includes requirements to ensure that the road authorized to be developed will not increase the danger of flooding and that the road will not subject the Federal Government to any additional exposure or liability. 
   The bill requires the county in which the road will be constructed, and that is St. Louis County, Missouri, we have one also in Minnesota, to ensure that the construction, operation and maintenance of the road will not cause any future additional flood damage that would not have occurred without the project. It is very important to spell those conditions out. 
   The bill also requires the county or its assignee to mitigate the project by adding to the flood protection area a nearby parcel of land of equal or greater size to the deed-restricted land used for the road. 
   Further, the bill provides that the Federal Government shall not be liable for future flood damage that may be caused by the project and that the county will be liable for such damage. 
   The bill also provides that the deed restricted property on which the road will be built, and only the road, will not be eligible for any future disaster assistance from any other Federal source. 
   I think with those very precise, very carefully crafted constraints, we can and should approve this legislation to allow the other development to go forward, a development that is not within the hazard area. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, it was shortly after the election in which Juanita Millender-McDonald was elected to the Congress, she called on my office. I was the ranking member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
   She came to see me about service on our committee. I had learned a little about her background, and I was surprised. I thought she would be more interested in Judiciary or International Relations, but when I asked why she wanted to serve on this nuts and bolts committee, she said, well, I have the Alameda Corridor in my district. And if I heard Alameda Corridor from her once, I heard it 50 times. It was incessant, it was a refrain, it was a passionate advocacy. I, of course, did support her candidacy for the committee. 
   Then, when the assignments were given out, she came calling again, said, I want to know more about what this committee does. What are all these responsibilities? What does this subcommittee's work mean on public buildings and grounds and economic development? 
   When I laid out the picture that this committee has jurisdiction over 367 million square feet of Federal civilian office space, she was excited. Well, there are things we can do here. 
   It was just such an enlightenment and so exciting to see a new Member enthused about the work of the committee and wanting to understand it and grasp and understand it. 
   The other thing that I have observed over the years, I have watched, as many of our colleagues have, as have the gentleman from Michigan and the  gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) who spoke so warmly and touching earlier, I see Members come in and they scratch and claw to get a committee assignment. Then they get on a committee, and they scratch and claw to get their subcommittee assignments. Then when you are there presiding or working, for so many years as the ranking member, you turn around, where are they? You don't see them again. Juanita Millender-McDonald showed up for work, every time. 
   What was also touching was when another committee assignment conflicted, she would come in, sit down, be checked in, look at the committee agenda and the information, then she would come over and say would you please hold me excused, I have to go to another committee because something else is happening. You don't see that happening very often, the conscientiousness that she displayed about her service in the Congress. She took it seriously, learned it well. 
   When we were crafting the Tea-21 legislation, she wanted to be a part of shaping the minority business enterprise provisions. She was on the floor to advocate for them. Her whole career was one of dedication to service, but she was a person, a mother, a wife, a human being, warm and caring. When she walked into a room and offered that smile, clouds parted, lights went on and Juanita Millender-McDonald was there for us. 
   She will always be in my heart, in our hearts.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 reauthorizes two existing commissions and establishes three new commissions. The two existing commissions, one, the Delta Regional Commission, was created through the appropriation process, and the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission was established some time ago, but we establish three new regional economic development commissions: The Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission. 
   The purpose of the regional commission approach to economic development is a recognition that economic difficulties don't stop at political dividing lines, county lines, State lines, that they transcend our political boundaries, that the economic development problems are grouped by region. By economy, if you will. 
   Some years ago, we had the Upper Great Lakes Regional Commission linking the upper peninsula of Michigan, the upper counties of Wisconsin and the northern tier of Minnesota. They had in common forestry, wood, wood fiber industries, fisheries, travel/tourism and Great Lakes ports connected to the international economy through the St. Lawrence Seaway. Projects conceived by the Upper Great Lakes Commission were to be linked to the commonality of regional economic difficulties the three States experienced. The same with Appalachia coal; the attendant difficulties of the coal sector of our economy stretched across State boundaries and linked the entire Appalachian region with their forestry difficulties as well and also with their need for surface transportation development. That is the principle that is extended to the three new commissions, the Southeast Crescent, the Southwest Border and the Northern Border Commission. 
   The Delta Regional Commission is one that has unique problems, exacerbated and at the same time underscored by the tragedy of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. All of the counties, or I should say most of the counties, and parishes in Louisiana, in that region suffered common economic problems. Creating an economic development structure on a regional basis will join the resources and the forces of these States, the counties and the parishes, to bring forth new ideas that will benefit not just one community, not just one parish, but a commonality of parishes, a commonality of counties and a commonality of the States. 
   In this legislation, we establish a structure, a common framework for administration and management modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission but also modeled after the difficulties we experienced in previous regional economic development commissions in the sixties and seventies and early eighties. We need standard procedures. We need a voting structure. We need standard procedures for staffing, standards that establish conditions under which conflicts of interest can be evaluated and avoided. Commonality establishment of local economic development districts, a consistent method for distributing economic development funds, a uniform set of procedures that will apply to all of the commission, and, finally, with commonality then we can have uniform evaluation standards of the results of these commissions. And it will be the purpose of our Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to hold intensive oversight hearings as these commissions get under way with their work, they are funded, and we will want to hold them accountable, we will want to see their record of success, and I am quite confident, given the grassroots-up nature of establishment of planning and mission of these commissions, that there will be great success stories. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   In the matter of adding counties that were not in the original commissions' proposals, we adhered to a very strict principle, that is, the additions had to conform with unemployment rate significantly above national average, per capita income rates that were significantly below national average rates, and out-migrations. In all cases, the counties recommended by the gentleman from Missouri, the parishes by the gentleman from Louisiana, and the gentleman from Mississippi all conformed when we got updated census information. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think we have here a splendid structure, one in which we can achieve accountability, one in which there already is success. In a report the committee received just this morning from the Delta Regional Commission on cumulative projects over the last year, the leveraging ratio is 16 to 1. That is for every $1 the commission invested in projects within the region, $16 additional in private sector and non-Federal funds have been invested. That is an extraordinary success ratio, and we want to ensure that that success will continue and will be extended to all of the commissions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and ask for a resounding affirmative vote for this legislation.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, it is well known, has been debated many times in this body, that a motion to recommit that uses the term ``promptly'' is simply a motion to kill the bill by sending it back to committee, where it will take weeks to then return it to the House floor. Why an initiative to try to kill this legislation would be offered is puzzling to me, since there was no opposition to the legislation in subcommittee, full committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago when the bill was debated on the suspension calendar, no one rose in opposition to the bill. There was no opposition raised to the legislation this afternoon. So the motion to recommit on the merits of the term ``promptly'' is clearly an effort to send it back to committee, kill the bill. 
   But I point out, since the gentleman offering the motion referred to initiatives by the Democratic majority to have accountability, on page 17 of the bill, section 15-306, Personal Financial Interests, conflicts of interest, we address the issue of personal conflict of interest, of integrity of personnel employed by the commission in either the Federal co-chairman's office or the State co-chairman's office, and establish very clear obligations for reporting and excluding of such activity. Furthermore, under general Federal legislation, lobbying by a Federal Government agency of the Congress is not permitted. 
   So this is a non sequitur motion. It does not accomplish anything except the purpose of sending the bill back to committee and, in effect, killing it by delay. Again, I repeat, there was no opposition registered. When the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure considered this bill in subcommittee, in full committee markup, when it came to the floor under suspension of the rules, nor was there any opposition today, why there would be a motion of this nature to kill the bill is beyond me. 
   Furthermore, there are restraints, very explicit language on personal financial interest, conflict of interest not allowed; and, in general, Federal law, Federal agencies are prohibited from retaining a lobbyist, to pay expenses for lobbying. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a transparent effort to try to kill the bill rather than deal with it on its merits. So I oppose the motion to recommit with instructions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1224, to commemorate the Tennessee Valley Authority (``TVA'') on its 75th anniversary. 
   H. Res. 1224 recognizes the TVA for its long history of service in the areas of energy, the environment, and economic development on a service area that includes parts of seven States. 
   President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the legislation creating the TVA on May 1, 1933. This Authority was a product of President Roosevelt's New Deal plan to help the economy rise from the depths of the Great Depression. 
   The establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority by the Federal Government illustrated Congress's recognition of the importance of integrating regional and national planning into problem solving strategies that affect multiple States. 
   The TVA's mission areas were originally identified to reduce the risk of flood damage, improve navigation on the Tennessee River, provide electric power, and promote ``agricultural and industrial development'' in the region. 
   The TVA continues to manage its resources in an integrated fashion for a wide range of benefits including electric power production, flood control, waterborne commercial transportation, recreation, water supply, and water quality. 
   Through the years, TVA has continued to adapt and evolve to reflect the needs of the day. This evolution is reflected in its development of hydroelectric facilities in the 1940s to support the war effort and production of aluminum, to its present day development of renewable power resources. 
   I applaud the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Cramer), for his strong advocacy of the Tennessee Valley Authority during his 18 years in Congress. The gentleman has been a valuable member of this Chamber, a distinguished alumnus of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and a dedicated champion for the people of the 5th Congressional District. I wish him well in his future endeavors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill before us arises out of long-standing concerns of communities along the routes of the Nation's freight rail system, particularly in cases where there is dramatic change, where a merger has occurred or is about to occur, and the result of which will be to change their quality of life. 
   The period of the Interstate Commerce Commission, from the 1880s until the Staggers Act of 1980, was a period of regulation necessary in the public interest but of increasing burdensome regulation that inhibited the productivity of the Nation's railroads. Many would argue that the result of deregulation was too little representation of the public interest in our freight rail system. 
   There are so many instances where the freight railroads have dismissed or been dismissive of or not paid sufficient attention to the concerns of communities and people that live along the railroad, the tracks that go through their cities and by their homes. There are, of course, those cases where some railroads have been very attentive and very responsive. 
   But the core problem is that of the Surface Transportation Board. As we looked into the issues of concerns raised by many communities along class 2 or class 3 railroads, who are about to be absorbed into a larger class 1 railroad, I find questions of the actions of the Surface Transportation Board defending the public interest. 
   This bill will assure that the Surface Transportation Board will have the legal authority and policy direction it needs to deal with mergers, which have potential to cause serious safety, environmental and other quality-of-life problems for the people in the communities along the route of the proposed merger. 
   The bill does not require the STB, Surface Transportation Board, to approve or disapprove any particular merger. It is not merger specific. It seeks only to ensure that when the STB considers mergers, it will have the authority to disapprove any merger in which the benefits from the merger are outweighed by the adverse effects on communities or safety. 
   It will vest in the board authority and give the board direction to fully evaluate rate crossing safety, hazardous materials transportation safety, public safety, noise, job losses, adverse economic impact. It will also, and our anticipation is, that the board will fully evaluate the benefits of a merger. There are clearly, in most of these mergers, benefits for one community that unfortunately are accompanied by adverse effects on other communities, or at least perceived adverse effects. 
   Now, the problem that we found in the course of the hearing and in evaluating issues leading up to the hearing in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is that the action of the board in dealing with mergers of two class 1 railroads are different authorities than are available to the board in evaluating the proposed merger of a class 1 and a class 2 or class 3 railroad. 
   This legislation will assure or make it clear that the board has the same authority to deal with mergers of class 1 with class 2 and class 3 railroads as it does in mergers of class 1 to other class 1 railroads.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   This is not a retroactive measure. It does not undo any transaction in the works or already concluded. It sets standards for all railroads, for all considerations of acquisition by class 1 or class 2 or class 3 railroads, sets up standards, reinforces authority that the Surface Transportation Board chairman has said they thought they had authority over environmental review but they've never exercised it. They're concerned that if they did, they might have some legal difficulties. We're clarifying that the board has authority to act on environmental issues raised by communities. 
   We did hear from those inner city communities who testified in person at the hearing at the request of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski). I have heard railroads don't need help from the Federal Government. Well, they shouldn't. The Federal Government gave the railroads, between 1850 and 1871, 173 million acres of public land, 9 percent of the total surface area of the United States, for the public use, convenience, necessity, and benefit of the Nation to own and control the resources above and below ground: the timber resources as well as the coal and, in many cases, oil and gas, and other minerals; and the right to sell those properties. The railroads have sold billions of dollars' worth of public land that were given to them for the public trust. And they're not without their requests to the Congress. They've spent a considerable amount of time, the Association of American Railroads, lobbying the House and the Senate for a 25 percent investment tax credit to increase their capital investment. I'm for it. I think that's a reasonable investment to make. I think we ought to help railroads do that. I think we ought to ensure that they use that tax credit for those capital investments. It's a reasonable request, but they're not without their hand out to the Federal Government 
   Why should the railroads take the position that they are above review? When other forms of transportation are subject to public scrutiny by the communities affected by road construction, bridge construction, transit, light rail, commuter rail, all are subject to citizen review. Railroads cannot take the position that they're above review. They, too, take actions that affect the citizens and the communities that reside along their lines. And all we're providing in this legislation is a process within which those actions taken by railroads would be subject--class 1 to class 1, and class 1 to class 2 and class 3 should be considered in the same way. 
   That's all this legislation does. 
   I ask for a very resounding ``aye'' vote for this long overdue legislation. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 3068. This bill, as amended by the Senate, represents an important step in ensuring the safety of Federal employees and all those who work in and visit our Federal buildings. 
   On April 18, 2007, the Committee held a hearing entitled ``Proposals to Downsize the Federal Protective Service and Effects on the Protection of Federal Buildings''. The hearing probed the Department of Homeland Security's plans to cut the presence of Federal Protective Service (``FPS'') officers nationally. The reliance on contract security guards to protect Federal buildings is a troubling trend. 
   On October 2, 2007, the House passed H.R. 3068 to prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from awarding security guard contracts to businesses owned, controlled, or operated by convicted felons. 
   H.R. 3068, as amended by the Senate, continues to support the central concept of the legislation as enacted by the House. The Senate amendment authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish guidelines that prohibit contracts for the provision of guard services to any business owned or controlled by individuals convicted of serious felonies, as determined by the Secretary. Further, the amendment allows discretion to contracting officers assess mitigating factors and the risks associated with a particular conviction. 
   This bill, as amended, offers a common sense w y to ensure that security contracts that provide an essential service are awarded only to contractors who are, ``capable, responsible, and ethical'', as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 
   I support H.R. 3068, as amended, and urge its passage. 
   Finally, I insert in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an exchange of letters between Chairman HENRY WAXMAN, Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and me.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Finally, we are here with essentially a conference report on the Great Lakes Legacy Reauthorization Act of 2008. This great and extraordinary body of water, the Great Lakes, represents one-fifth of all the fresh water, not frozen, on the face of the Earth and is a treasure for all of America, not just for the nearly 40 million people who reside on or near or within 100 miles of those Great Lakes. It's a treasure for all of America and for the world. It is our responsibility. And only us humans can protect that water. 
   Only Lake Baikal rivals the volume of water in Lake Superior. Lake Baikal is deeper. It's almost 1 mile deep, not as much surface, enormously deep water. Next is Lake Victoria in Africa. But all are standing in line in significance, in volume and in quality of water to the Great Lakes. 
   The gentleman from Michigan, for whom I have enormous admiration, Mr. Ehlers, has been a relentless champion since entering the service of Congress, bringing his splendid scientific mind to the challenges of the Great Lakes, of invasive species, of water quality, of bottom sediments in the 45 toxic hotspots of the Great Lakes, principally the harbors throughout the lakes, the need to study, to understand the causes, but then for the need to implement an action program to deal with this. It is not enough just to verify in scientific test tubes that pollution exists and invasive species are present, but to get to the causes and then to roll back that pollution, to roll back those invasive species and to prevent their further or future entry into this waterway. 
   The Great Lakes Legacy Act gives us the opportunity to do that. It is the culmination of a great deal of effort on both sides of the aisle in both bodies of the Congress. 
   I must stop for a reflective moment and go back to 1955 when my predecessor, John Blatnik, assumed the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Rivers and Harbors. John Blatnik was also a scientist, a biochemist. He served in the OSS in World War II behind Nazi lines in northern Yugoslavia in what is Slovenia today, rescuing American airmen shot down on returning bombing runs over the Ploesti oil fields in Romania. And John Blatnik started his service as an educator in the Civilian Conservation Corps after graduating from college. There weren't any jobs. He became camp educational adviser in the Superior National Forest, later a chemistry teacher in our hometown of Chisholm, and then later, as I mentioned a moment ago, with the OSS and working with the junior chamber of commerce on resource use conservation. 
   When he came to Congress, he brought his scientific mind to bear on the problems of the country. And in 1955 he took the chairmanship of the Rivers and Harbors Subcommittee and traveled down the Mississippi River to understand the work of the Corps of Engineers. What became more important for him was to see, as he described it, the raw phenols, the raw sewage that came in to the Mississippi River from its tributaries and from the cities that lie along the banks of those 2,000 miles as the river courses from Upper Leech Lake down to the Gulf of Mexico. He said that by the time we got to New Orleans, there were raw phenols bubbling in the water. It was toxic. It was a soup of chemicals. And he realized that more important than the locks and the navigation channels was to clean up the Mississippi. 
   And then he turned his attention as well to the Great Lakes. These were  great reservoirs of clean water. And how could they be fouled? But by that time, the lamprey had invaded the Great Lakes. And in 1953, just 2 years before he took the chairmanship of that subcommittee, the lake trout population plummeted from 3.5 million pounds of catch a year to 350,000 pounds. The white fish population plummeted from 2.5 million pounds to 250,000 pounds in just 1 year because the lamprey exploded with violent force on the Great Lakes, this invasive species that came in the ballast water of vessels probably from the Black Sea into the fresh waters of the Great Lakes. 
   That led John Blatnik to launch legislation that he called the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1956, signed into law by President Eisenhower, with three key provisions that are still the core of the EPA program today, research to understand the causes of pollution, funding to help cities build sewage treatment facilities and enforcement program to bring communities and industries together to clean up where they failed to do so voluntarily. 
   A great deal of progress has been made since 1956. Since 1968 when the Cuyahoga River caught on fire and caught people's attention, from later that year in 1968 when great mounds of suds were floating down the Ohio River and endangering water quality of homeowners who would turn on their faucets and instead of getting clean water, they would get suds coming out. When just a little later, in 1969, Lake Erie was declared a dead lake, a dead sea it was called. 
   There were many proposals for how to do this. One hare-brained scheme was to punch a hole in the bottom of Lake Erie and let all the sediments drain down 2,000 feet into some underground aquifer, which of course Blatnik said was an absolute idiotic idea and would endanger far more than the Great Lakes. But steadily with the funding that was provided under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and later the Clean Water Act of 1972, of which he was the principal author and I served on the staff at the time, cities along the Great Lakes invested some $10 billion, industry invested nearly $110 billion in cleanup, and the toxics that once flowed into the Great Lakes began to recede and Lake Erie began to regain its vibrancy step by step. And now we have a vibrant fishery. We have the same on Lakes Michigan, Ontario, Huron and Superior. 
   But the challenge is never over. Those toxic hotspots, those 45 areas of concern, still have to be dealt with. And the Great Lakes Legacy Act, which the gentleman from Michigan championed in 2002 which the House passed, the Senate passed and got enacted, set the stage for substantial investment that we included in our House-passed version, $150 million a year through 2013. 
   Regrettably, when this measure got over to the Senate, as so often happens in the other body, one person can shut down the Senate and can shut down the country. In this case one objection held up Senate action on the bill until funding for the program was cut. I'm just so disappointed and so anguished over the failure of the Senate to provide the funding. They didn't change anything else in the bill, just implementing it, just funding it. That is cutting out the heart. That's all right.     
   Congress survives. We will come back next year. There will be a different spirit in the White House, a different spirit in the Congress. We will fix that. We will provide funding in years to come. For now, it is important to move ahead with this excellent piece of legislation, which will help us move further ahead, laying the groundwork for creating the framework within which we can undertake cleanup in those areas of concern. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas, the ranking member of the Water Resources Subcommittee, for his attention to detail. He has really lent his best efforts to understanding the broad problems of water quality, water resource development issues, the programs of the Corps of Engineers, and I greatly appreciate his thoughtful, scholarly consideration. And, of course, our Chair of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Texas, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, who has really been vigorous in her pursuit of the water resources issues under the jurisdiction of the committee. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (GREAT LAKES LEGACY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Again, I want to express great appreciation to our colleagues on the committee on the Republican side who have worked without party barriers or banners to deal with a common issue of importance to all of us on the Great Lakes, and that is to address these issues, these areas of concern. 
   I also want to express great appreciation to Senators Levin and Voinovich, George Voinovich of Ohio, Carl Levin of Michigan, who both have been champions for the Great Lakes. I have known both men for many, many years, Senator Voinovich, particularly, going back to his years as mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio. We worked together on so many issues. 
   We worked on economic development of the Great Lakes, water quality, trade between Canada and the United States, on the Asian carp issue, supporting funding for the barrier to the Chicago rivers, to prevent the Asian carp from getting into the Great Lakes; and then the second barrier that is authorized in the Water Resources Development Act south of the Twin Cities, to prevent Asian carp from going up the Mississippi into the inland waters of the State of Minnesota and into the upper Midwest. While there is occasionally obstruction from the other body, there are people of goodwill, good intentions and good bipartisan spirit who deserve recognition. 
   In the Duluth Harbor, with the Corps of Engineers and the EPA, we have had a remarkable success story in dredging bottom sediments with suction dredging and other technologies that avoid reintroduction into the water column of the removal of bottom sediments and putting them into a contained disposal facility. The Erie Pier in the Duluth-Superior Harbor has maybe 2 million cubic feet of bottom sediments that have been dredged from the harbor, deposited in the facility, with the sand filtration barrier that has allowed the water to filter back into the lake relatively clean, not quite drinkable, but without the toxics, without the PCBs, without the mercury and cadmium and lead and other toxic metals that have been found in those bottom sediments. 
   What the Corps learned in this project was that the most complicated issue is that of grease, fuel oil, gasoline, other hydrocarbons that mix with the sand and the clay in the harbor bottom and become extremely difficult to extract in the cleanup process. 
   Attacking that issue, this is a typical issue, we had a steel mill in Duluth for nearly 100 years. Its discharges went into the harbor, and that's typical of many communities along the lower lakes that have to deal with these problems of bottom sediments. We learned a great deal from Duluth. We now need to apply those lessons to the other harbors on the Great Lakes. 
   It's somewhat of an embarrassment to us in the United States that Canada has cleaned up two of its three principal areas of concern and we have not done as well in the United States. This legislation sets the framework for us to move in that direction, $150 million would have provided the funding we need to go in that direction, but we will deal with that in the next Congress. 
   Again, I thank all who have participated. I am pleased that the gentleman from Illinois mentioned Mr. Emanuel from Chicago. Rahm Emanuel has certainly been a champion on the issue on our side as well, along with a great list of Members. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and ask for a unanimous vote in support of the Great Lakes Legacy Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (REPEALING LICENSE REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYMENT AS A SALVAGER ON THE COAST OF FLORIDA -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2482, a bill to repeal the provision of title 46, United States Code, requiring a license for employment in the business of salvaging on the coast of Florida. 
   In 1847, Congress enacted a law designed to prevent individuals from luring ships on the beach with lanterns--and then salvaging these wrecks. The law said that you cannot salvage a ship in Florida unless you have a license issued by a U.S. District Court. At the time these individuals were called wreckers. Today, they are called salvors. 
   Two years ago, Congress passed a recodification of all of the laws in title 46 of the U.S. Code--titled ``Shipping''. It was only after that recodification when the terms were updated from ``wreckers'' to ``salvors'', did the salvage industry realize that they needed a license to do its work in Florida. This requirement is not imposed on salvors in any other State of the United States.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (INTEGRATED DEEPWATER PROGRAM REFORM ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, this legislation in a previous form passed the House last year by a vote of 426-0. The Senate passed a comparable bill by unanimous consent. The bill before us is a bipartisan compromise between our Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the House and the Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation in the Senate. 
   It is a complicated piece of legislation that took a great deal of time to work out. The objective of this legislation is to reform the Coast Guard acquisition program.     
   Stories began creeping out of mistakes and cost overruns and serious problems within the Coast Guard's Deepwater Program. A closer look by our committee investigative staff found that there were serious flaws in the conduct of this program, and we began an extensive inquiry and investigation into those flaws and into the consequences thereof, the most serious of which was that the first article of the cutter extension program went to sea and cracked in three places, predicted to be problem areas by the chief naval architect of the Navy, in consultation to a whistleblower within the Deepwater Program. 
   I need not go back and unravel all of the details that led up to that. Suffice it to say that the core of the problem was a self-certification initiative undertaken by the Coast Guard at the direction of the Department of Homeland Security that led to serious flaws, not only in the program but in the construction of these vessels and the extension initiative. The result was that taxpayers have lost over $100 million, the Coast Guard has lost the service of some 49 cutters, and frankly, I think there should have been criminal investigations undertaken by the Justice Department of those engaged in these practices. 
   Thanks to the leadership of the gentleman from Maryland, the Chair of the Coast Guard Subcommittee, Mr. Cummings, and the staff's relentless pursuit of the facts of the causes of the problems, we held a hearing that went till 11:30 at night, nearly 10 hours of investigative hearing, drew fact after fact out and established causality problems and led the way to solutions. It's not enough just to conduct oversight, to find the flaws, to find the problems; it's important to correct them. 
   And in that process, we had this blended participation with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) who has proven himself to be a devotee of the Coast Guard and mastered the issues of the Coast Guard and of this particular contractual undertaking of the Coast Guard. 
   The result of those hearings was substantial reform of the Coast Guard's acquisition program. The details of the program I will call on the Chair of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), and ask him to explain the details and how we frankly intend and are going to cure this problem for the future. 
   It took a great deal of negotiation with the other body and with the Coast Guard to come to the resolution that we bring to the House today, and for that progress, I thank the gentleman from Ohio and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Mica, for their patience over many weeks of negotiating out these terms and conditions  that we bring to the House today to cure this program, save the taxpayers money, put the Coast Guard on a sound footing, and assure to the greatest extent that we can that these problems don't extend into the future.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6999, as amended, the ``Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act of 2008''. I would like to congratulate the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Mr. Cummings, as well as Ranking Member Mica and Subcommittee Ranking Member LaTourette for their work on this landmark acquisition reform bill. 
   Last year, the House passed H.R. 2722, the ``Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act'', by a vote of 426-0. The Senate subsequently passed its Deepwater Reform bill, S. 924, by unanimous consent. H.R. 6999 is the bipartisan compromise agreement of these two bills of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. 
   The Integrated Deepwater Acquisition Program is a $24 billion program to replace all Coast Guard aircraft and cutters that primarily operate more than 50 miles offshore. The Coast Guard has never attempted to replace its whole fleet under one long-term program. The Committee has conducted numerous oversight hearings on this program to understand why there have been cost-overruns and why the Coast Guard spent $100 million to renovate and replace eight of its 110-foot patrol boats--only to have these renovated boats tied to the dock as unseaworthy. 
   As I have said many times, if I were adrift in the ocean, there is no one I would want to save me but the U.S. Coast Guard. What they do at sea to save lives is second to none. However, when it comes to managing an acquisition program--the Coast Guard has serious challenges. Just because you can fly an aircraft or drive a cutter, doesn't mean you know how to manage an acquisition to buy that aircraft or cutter. As a result, the Coast Guard's acquisition programs are hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule--including the Deepwater Acquisition program and the Rescue-21 program to install new search and rescue communications systems. 
   In the past week, we have seen firsthand what happens on Wall Street when there is a lack of oversight, accountability, and standards. But Wall Street doesn't want to be regulated. Neither does the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard wants to have Congress continue to write the checks--while they say ``trust us'' to spend the taxpayers' money wisely. While I would trust them with my life at sea, I don't think we should continue to write blank checks without demanding standards and accountability. 
   H.R. 6999 reforms the Coast Guard acquisition program. Specifically, the bill: 
   terminates the use of lead systems integrators beginning on October 1, 2011; 
   requires that the Commandant, and not the contractor, retain the technical authority to determine when the contract specifications have been met; 
   requires Early Operational Assessments to be made for all aircraft and cutters after they are designed--but before they are built--to ensure that they will meet the mission requirements of the Coast Guard; 
   requires all new cutters and aircraft and their engines to be certified by an independent 3rd party to ensure they meet design and performance requirements; 
   requires the development of workforce policies to ensure that the best qualified individuals are assigned to the acquisition program; 
   requires the Commandant to establish career paths for military and civilian personnel who wish to pursue careers in acquisition programs; 
   requires the Commandant to establish a balanced workforce policy to promote a workforce in which women and members of racial and ethnic minorities are appropriately represented in Government service; 
   establishes a Chief Acquisition Officer for the Coast Guard. The CAO may be a civilian or military officer, but must have a level III acquisition program manager certificate and 10 years of experience in an acquisition position; 
   requires the Coast Guard to report to Congress when there are cost overruns or program delays; and 
   requires the Coast Guard to use the Department of Defense's contract management expertise and contracting, where appropriate, to obtain the best possible price for Coast Guard assets. 
   H.R. 6999, as amended, also contains a provision that makes it unlawful to operate a stateless submersible or submersible vessel on the high seas. Use of submarines has become a new trend with the international drug runners operating out of Columbia. When the Coast Guard interdicts these vessels the smugglers pull a lever to flood and sink the submarine--and then wait for the Coast Guard to ``rescue'' them. However, all of the drugs are on the bottom of the ocean and it makes a prosecution more difficult. So Coast Guard personnel are risking their lives to enter the sinking submarine to get some of the cocaine as evidence. H.R. 6999 will obviate the need to enter the submarine. The Coast Guard can arrest the smugglers and they can be prosecuted for operating these pirate submarines. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a landmark bill that will significantly improve the management of the multi-billion dollar acquisition program of the Coast Guard. It is the direct result of the Committee's in-depth investigation of the Deepwater Program. Like H.R. 2722, it deserves the support of every Member of the House. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6999, the ``Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act of 2008''. 
   Finally, I insert in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an exchange of letters between Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, and me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the gentleman for those very thoughtful comments. 
   I was listening with great interest as he moved from deepwater to deep finance and was worried that he was going to suggest that the powers on high give that problem to our committee. Well, we'll build a fence around it, we'll build a bridge over it, we'll build a tunnel through it, we will encapsulate it and subject it to the funding out of the highway trust fund and the problem will be behind us. I think in the end we would have a solution to that problem that everybody could sign onto, but that's not our domain. 
   And of course we both have reservations about the legislation before us in similar spirit, but I think we go forward with this legislation, hope that the other body moves it through without further--how shall I say? I'll be kind about it--without further changes, and that the bill will move on to enactment, and that someday soon the Lorain Shipyard will build vessels for the Coast Guard. It will be good for the Great Lakes, it will be good for Lorain, Ohio, it will be good for the gentleman from Ohio, and it will be good for the country. 
   The Lorain Shipyard is one of the great assets of this Nation, built extraordinarily successful vessels that are still plying the lakes today, the thousand-footers that carry iron ore from northern Minnesota in my district to the lower lake steel mills, and that have borne the brunt of the forces of nature on the Great Lakes. It was a great shipyard, I've been there several times. It built the Mesabi Miner, by the way, a thousand-footer that is still active, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore. But, unfortunately, that vessel, if I may digress a moment, and others have had to go out 7,000 tons light because of the drought in the Great Lakes and the failure of the Corps of Engineers to dredge the harbors and the channels of the Great Lakes, meaning that our lakers have to travel three or four extra voyages a year to meet the tonnage requirements, raising the cost of tactonite, and therefore raising the cost of steel production in lower lake steel mills, and why passage of our Water Resources Development Act of last year and the veto override is so critically important and why funding of those projects is so critical. And I'm delighted that the stimulus legislation we passed yesterday has some $5 billion for the Corps of Engineers to undertake projects that can be underway within 90 days. And we all know very well that there are dredging projects all throughout the Great Lakes--and the lower lake harbors, particularly--that could benefit from that investment. 
   As Mr. Cummings said moments ago, we didn't get here on our own. Our staffs on both sides of the aisle have worked rigorously in shaping in legislation and in laying the groundwork for the investigation. Clay Foushee, who led the investigative team on our side. And Lucinda Lessley, on Mr. Cummings' committee staff, who championed both the oversight hearings and the legislative hearings. And our chief council on the Coast Guard Maritime Subcommittee, John Cullather--for my money, the finest mind in maritime legislation in the country. And John Rayfield, who is a storehouse of knowledge on the subject, and Eric Nagel on the minority side, all deserve our appreciation and gratitude for the many hours of labor invested in bringing us to this point of the legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (BARRING ACCESS OF LONG-HAUL MEXICAN TRUCKS -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6630. This is a bill with a simple purpose: to require a cross-border trucking pilot program initiated by the Department of Transportation (``DOT'') on September 6, 2007, to terminate immediately, and to force the Administration to stay true to its word that this program remain a short-term, limited experiment. 
   In February of last year, the Secretary of Transportation first announced her intent to launch a pilot program to allow up to 100 Mexico-domiciled motor carriers to operate beyond the commercial zones at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Secretary assured Congress and the American people that this pilot program would last one year. The Secretary made this pledge at news conferences and multiple Congressional hearings. DOT further cemented this commitment by publishing the details of a one-year pilot program in three separate Federal Register notices. 
   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure ordered H.R. 6630 reported in July in anticipation of the one-year mark, which occurred a few days ago. We considered this bill, which statutorily requires the Secretary to shut the program down after one year, because we had no reason to believe that the  Administration would terminate the pilot program and revoke the authority of participating carriers--unless compelled to do so by Congress. 
   We were right. On August 4, 2008, on the first day of the Congressional recess, DOT announced that it would extend the program for an additional two years, through 2010. 
   Since last February, I have expressed my strong concerns over whether safety on U.S. roads would be adversely impacted and whether DOT was ready to enforce all Federal motor carrier laws and regulations. I have also expressed my amazement with the careless way that the Administration has violated the will of Congress and the spirit of the law over the last 18 months. 
   Today, I repeat these sentiments and say enough is enough. It is time for DOT to be held accountable for its actions and made to keep its own promises. 
   The House has already voiced strong, bipartisan opposition to the implementation of this pilot program in three separate pieces of legislation, each of which DOT has strongly opposed: 
   The House passed H.R. 1773, the Safe American Roads Act of 2007, on May 15 by a vote of 411-3. 
   On May 25, 2007, the House passed the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (P.L. 110-28), which was signed by the President, and which included a number of safety prerequisites regarding the proposed pilot program. DOT glossed over these requirements and moved ahead without fully taking them into account. 
   On July 24, 2007, the House passed the FY 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill (H.R. 3074) with a provision to bar DOT from using any funds to implement its proposed pilot program. A similar provision was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-161), approved by the House on December 17, 2007. DOT found a technical ``out'' to avoid compliance with this provision. 
   DOT pushed past Congressional concerns in establishing this program. The Department has pushed on despite strong opposition to extend the program, and they will continue to push on. Carriers participating in the pilot program have been granted provisional operating authority for 18 months, after which DOT could allow the authority to become permanent. 
   Without further Congressional action, this ``experiment'' will turn into what opponents of this program have feared all along--a sea change in surface transportation policy. 
   To date, participation in the pilot program has been underwhelming. According to Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association (``FMCSA'') data, 27 Mexican carriers operating 107 trucks and 10 U.S. carriers operating 55 trucks are participating in the pilot program. Pilot program participants from Mexico crossed into the United States 9,776 times. Only 1,337 of these crossings, or 14 percent, resulted in carriers traveling beyond the border zones. 
   To accommodate a small fraction of trips taken by these 37 carriers, the Federal Government has spent more than $500 million since 1995 to prepare for opening of the U.S.-Mexico border to motor carrier traffic. 
   This is more than the entire FMCSA budget for all Federal motor carrier safety programs in all 50 States for FY 2008. 
   While spending thousands of hours of staff resources to implement the Administration's cross-border operations, FMCSA has yet to finalize 14 Congressionally mandated rulemakings--some of which have been pending since {999--on critical motor carrier safety issues such as medical certification of drivers, commercial drivers license testing standards, hours of service, and revocation of operating authority from a carrier with a pattern of safety violations. Several reports are also overdue--including a report on whistleblower protections required in 1998. 
   There is nothing in the North American Free Trade Agreement, or any other trade agreement, that abrogates the authority of Congress to exercise its power under the Constitution to change domestic law. It is time for Congress to reclaim its ability to have some bearing on the obligations contained in the surface transportation provisions of NAFTA. 
   I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, Mr. DeFAZIO, for introducing the bill, and Ranking Member Mica and Subcommittee Ranking Member Duncan for joining with us in this effort. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6630.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I commend my good friend and colleague from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON), chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, for his leadership in bringing the Conference Report on H.R. 2419, the ``Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008,'' to the House. His outstanding work and dedication over the past year and a half have culminated in this important legislation, which includes critical authorizations for farm programs and addresses vital nutrition, conservation, and economic development needs across the Nation. 
   This Conference Report makes great strides in the fight against hunger by providing an additional $10.4 billion for nutrition programs, which help 35 million low-income families. For the first time in 30 years, the legislation increases the minimum benefit under the Food Stamp Program, which keeps 26 million of our Nation's poorest individuals from going hungry, and indexes the benefit amount to inflation. The Conference Report also provides an additional $1.3 billion for the Emergency Food Assistance Program to provide food banks, soup kitchens, and other emergency feeding sites with much needed resources. The Conference Report also includes $50 million for 2008, which is available immediately to address food shortages at a number of food banks. 
   The Conference Report also contains a number of provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, particularly economic and infrastructure development, which I strongly support. The House-Senate agreement voted on today represents a major step forward in delivering critical economic and infrastructure development assistance to the most chronically poor and economically distressed regions of the country. The Conference Report reauthorizes two existing regional economic development commissions and establishes three new regional economic development commissions in economically distressed areas of the Nation. 
   Section 6026 of the Conference Report reauthorizes the Northern Great Plains Regional Authority through fiscal year 2012 and provides $30 million per year to fully establish this Commission and fulfill the mission Congress intended when it was first authorized in FY 2002. The counties eligible for assistance under the Northern Great Plains Regional Authority, including those in my district, will greatly benefit from the grant funds and planning provisions included in the Conference Report. Section 6025 reauthorizes the Delta Regional Authority, DRA, through FY 2012 at current funding levels of $30 million per year, and includes 12 additional Louisiana parishes and Mississippi counties in the DRA. 
   The Conference Report also authorizes three new commissions--the Northern Border Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, and the Southwest Border Regional Commission--through FY 2012, at an authorization level of $30 million per year for each Commission. I commend Congressman HODES, Congressman MICHAUD, Congresswoman SHEA-PORTER, and other Members representing the Northeast region of the United States for their strong support of regional economic development and for their persistence in bringing this important issue to the attention of Conferees on the farm bill. 
   These three Commissions are established under a unified administration and management structure as developed in the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 (H.R. 3246). We moved this bill expeditiously through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to the House floor, where, on October 4, 2007, it passed by a strong vote of 264-154. These administrative and management procedures are modeled after the highly successful Appalachian Regional Commission, provide for a consistent method for distributing economic development funds, and ensure a comprehensive regional approach to address problems of systemic poverty in the Nation's most severely distressed areas. 
   The Conference Report on H.R. 2419 also makes a number of important improvements to conservation programs, including increasing investment in conservation programs that take environmentally sensitive land out of farming and encourage environmentally friendly practices on working farmland. Water conservation provisions under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the final legislation include the creation of a new Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program, which provides a commitment of resources from the Department of Agriculture to restore, improve, and protect water quality throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed; and reauthorization of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act through 2012. 
   I am also pleased that the Conference Report includes a provision which I strongly support to assist small logging companies who are facing bankruptcy because they are not able to pay off their contracts on National Forest System land. The language contained in Section 8401 gives the Chief of the Forest Service the right to cancel or redetermine a qualified timber contract, and will help a number of small businesses who are suffering, particularly in light of the current housing downturn. 
   I am proud to lend my support to this important effort and commend Chairman PETERSON for his commitment and determination in getting this legislation to the President's desk.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment offered by the Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. 
   This amendment makes several technical and clarifying changes to the Beach Protection Act, as reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 
   These changes further improve the underlying bill, and will greatly assist in providing the public with clearer, quicker, and hopefully, more accurate information on the quality of our Nation's coastal recreational waters. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that we were able to reach agreement within the Committee on establishing a hard deadline for the Environmental Protection Agency to complete its evaluation and validation of a rapid testing methodology for testing coastal recreation waters. 
   As recognized by the sponsors of this legislation, we need to move away from two-to-three day delays in obtaining information on the quality of our waters, and towards real-time, same-day information. It does no one any good to know that the waters were unsafe for swimming yesterday--yesterday is too late. 
   We want to know what the conditions of waters are today--before we decide to take ourselves and our families to the beach for the day. This amendment will move us in the direction of providing same-day information on the condition of our recreational waters, and give our citizens the option of avoiding contact with waters that could be potentially harmful to their health. 
   The Manager's amendment was developed jointly by the majority and minority staffs of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. 
   I am unaware of any opposition to this amendment, and urge its adoption.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from California, Mr. Bilbray. 
   This amendment builds upon the ongoing work of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop the next generation of testing methodologies for coastal recreation waters. These new standards, already well behind schedule, should represent significant improvement over the existing standards for pathogens and pathogen indicators both in terms of accuracy and delivery time. 
   The amendment of our colleague, Mr. Bilbray, calls the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to study the benefits of using a ``molecular diagnostic for monitoring and assessing the quality of coastal recreation waters.'' This shift from culture-based testing to molecular diagnostics should significantly reduce the period of time necessary to produce accurate results on the condition of the nation's swimming beaches. 
   By some estimates, the amount of time that would be necessary under this new testing methodology could fall from 24-36 hours to 1-2 hours. This would represent a significant breakthrough in providing almost instantaneous information to the public on any potential human health risks that might result from coming into contact with contaminated waters. 
   I congratulate the gentleman for offering this amendment, today, and express my appreciation for his willingness to work with us to address some concerns raised with his initial amendment. 
   I urge adoption of the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Kucinich. 
   This amendment furthers the overall goals of the BEACH Act in providing the public with greater amounts of information on the quality of their favorite beach locations, including any potential sources of contamination that may make these beaches unsafe for swimming. 
   The gentleman's amendment would require States and local governments that choose to implement contaminant source identification and tracking programs to ensure that any information gathered on potential sources of contamination be made public. Since, I would surmise, that many potential sources of contamination of coastal recreation waters come from failing wastewater or stormwater infrastructure systems, this increased public awareness on their location and relevance in protecting water quality is important. 
   I have often heard it said that ``out of sight'' means ``out of mind.'' This is especially true of the deplorable condition of our Nation's wastewater treatment infrastructure. By providing the public with direct links between the source of the contamination, and the real world implications of potential infrastructure failure, I only hope that we will rekindle interest in reinvesting in our Nation's infrastructure. 
   This amendment provides yet another avenue for increasing public awareness and pressure on improving our infrastructure, and in turn, improving our overall environment and safeguards for human health. 
   I urge adoption of the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Richardson. 
   The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act (BEACH Act) was signed into law on October 10, 2000, as a means to reduce the risk of illness to users of the Nation's recreational waters. 
   The BEACH Act requires states, tribes, and territories to identify their coastal recreation waters and to report on monitoring activities at those beaches. EPA compiled into a single list all of the information submitted by states and territories to EPA as of December 31, 2003. 
   This National List of Beaches provides the only nationwide assessment of the extent of beach monitoring across the country. The requirements for EPA to create and periodically maintain this list were included as part of the BEACH Act to help EPA determine how to better implement the Act, and minimize the potential human health effects from coming into contact with contaminated waters. 
   The National List of Beaches also provides information to the public about beaches in their state. 
   Unfortunately, this important list has only once been published by EPA--in March of 2004. Since that time, we have little information on whether progress is being made towards full implementation of the BEACH Act. No additional nationwide assessments have been conducted to determine whether individual states or local governments are making improvements in the number and quality of local beach monitoring and notification programs. 
   By requiring EPA to revise this list every two years, we will halve a better idea of the progress that is being made to safeguard public health, and ensure that a trip to the beach will not also result in a trip to the emergency room. 
   I applaud the efforts of our Committee colleague, Ms. Richarson, for offering this amendment, and I strongly support its adoption.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Congressman Inslee's amendment to H.R. 2537, reauthorization of the  BEACH Act. This amendment calls for a study of the long-term impacts of climate change on the pollution of coastal waters. 
   At its center, the intent of the BEACH Act is to provide information and notification for the public with regard to the safety of the coastal waters they use for recreation. It is well-known that climate change may cause significant changes to ecosystems, hydrology, and water temperature. What we are unsure of, however, is the extent to which these changes will occur, and also--importantly--the effect this will have on public health. 
   For example, if coastal water temperatures increase and freshwater inflows decrease, does this result in a more hospitable environment for pathogens in our coastal waters? Because the public--including children--are in direct contact with these waters, it is of the utmost importance that we have a better understanding of what a warming environment means for public health. 
   The Transportation & Infrastructure Committee included a similar provision in last summer's energy bill. This program called for a National Academy of Science study to be conducted on the impacts of climate change on water quality, and subsequent ramifications of these changes on the Clean Water Act. While this provision did not survive conference, I am pleased that Mr. Inslee's amendment picks up in a similar vein. 
   I call on other members to join me in supporting passage of this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6327. This legislation provides a three-month extension of aviation programs and taxes, through September 30, 2008. Without this extension, the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, will face a partial shut-down beginning next week, on July 1, 2008. 
   The previous authorization for aviation programs--the ``Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act''--expired on September 30, 2007. On September 20, 2007, the House passed H.R. 2881, the ``FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007,'' to reauthorize FAA programs for fiscal yeas 2008-2011. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to act on this or any other long-term FAA reauthorization bill. I strongly urge the other body to bring their reauthorization bill to the floor, so we can go to conference and pass a long-term reauthorization of aviation programs. In the meantime, the three-month extension before us today is urgently needed. 
   H.R. 6327 extends the aviation excise taxes through September 30, 2008. These taxes are necessary to support the Aviation Trust Fund, which in recent years has provided about 80 percent of the FAA's budget. With an uncommitted cash balance of just $1.5 billion at the start of this fiscal year, any lapse in the aviation taxes could put the solvency of the Aviation Trust Fund at risk. 
   In addition to extending the aviation taxes, H.R. 6327 extends the FAA's authority to make expenditures from the Aviation Trust Fund. Without this authority, the FAA will face a partial shut-down beginning July 1st, as it will be unable to pay approximately 4,000 employees whose salaries are funded entirely by the Aviation Trust Fund. 
   H.R. 6327 also provides an additional $919 million in contract authority for the Airport Improvement Program, AIP. Together with the $2.756 billion provided under the previous short-term extension, this results in a total of $3.675 billion in contract authority for the AIP program in FY 2008. This will enable airports to move forward with important safety and capacity projects. 
   To allow aviation programs to continue under the same terms and conditions as were in effect during the previous authorization period, H.R. 6327 also extends several other provisions of Vision 100. 
   I thank Chairman RANGEL and Ranking Member MCCRERY of the Committee on Ways and Means for their, assistance in ensuring the continued operation of aviation programs. I also thank my Committee colleagues, Ranking Member MICA, Subcommittee Chairman COSTELLO, and Subcommittee Ranking Member PETRI, for working with me on this critical legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6327.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me express my great appreciation to my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation for their cohesion and their support of legislative action to respond promptly to the needs of the people of Minneapolis and the State of Minnesota. Mr. Ramstad, Mr. Kline, Mrs. Bachmann, Mr. Ellison, in whose district this tragedy occurred, Ms. McCollum, Mr. Walz, Mr. Peterson have all united as one in support of the needs of the people and in common mourning for the tragedy that occurred. 
   All of us were struck deeply within our souls over this tragedy. Ms. McCollum's daughter, just miraculously almost, passed over this bridge shortly before it collapsed. 
   I want to express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Florida, the ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. Mica, and his staff and to Mr. Petri, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Mr. DeFazio of Oregon, Chair of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, for the cooperation, for the splendid efforts made, and for the common cause in which we all persevered to bring this legislation promptly to the House, as we are doing today. 
   And, again, I'm very grateful to the gentleman from Florida for his participation. 
   Bridges are built to last, not forever, but for a very long time. The title, in Latin, of the leader of the Catholic church is Pontifex Maximus, the maximum bridge builder. And when that title was adopted, bridges were built to last. The one in Rome has lasted 2,000 years, a marble arch bridge. 
   But in our day and time, not much that we build lasts forever, and that is why we have a bridge inspection program. That is why we annually evaluate the condition, structure and structural integrity of bridges and their operational capacity and ability; and why, in the current law, SAFETEA-LU, with the help of then Chairman Young, I included language to authorize the funding of a new technology comparable to the technology used in aviation to determine the structural integrity of aircraft wings, movable surfaces and fuselage, to find hairline cracks using technology that can discover microscopic cracks not visible to the naked eye and then measure their propagation and do the same with bridges. 
   The Minnesota Department of Transportation was offered the opportunity to use that technology, and I am disappointed that the State rejected the opportunity to use that technology to test the structural integrity of the bridge that collapsed. 
   In March of 2004, I sent Members of the House a letter and information providing data developed, at my request, by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics showing the number and location of structurally deficient bridges in the national highway system in each Member's congressional district. 
   Now, not many Members followed up on that, but I just happen to have in front of me the letter addressed to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) who did respond. The letter pointed out the number of structurally deficient bridges in each Member's district and then pointed out that, in 2002, the U.S. Department of Transportation found that 167,566 of the Nation's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Since then, that number has grown to, of the 597,340 bridges in the national bridge inventory, 26 percent are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. 
   Then the cost to repair and bring to a good state of maintenance, the cost in 2004, was estimated at $9.4 billion a year to maintain. In the SAFETEA-LU legislation, we provided $4 billion a year. It should have been at $5 billion. If the original introduced bill Mr. Young and I introduced in October of 2003 had prevailed, we'd have been at $5 billion a year. We are where we are. 
   But this is the map, in smaller form, that we sent out to all Members of the House in 2004. For the State of Minnesota, it lists all the structurally deficient bridges. There are 19 on this list updated today. 
   The State of Minnesota has 13,000 bridges. 1,135 are structurally deficient. 451 are functionally obsolescent. That's 12.2 percent. That's one of the lowest percentages in the country, but it underscores the serious problem of the State of Minnesota and of the Nation's bridges. 
   We come to the floor today united in purpose to help the State rebuild this structure. The estimate from the Minnesota Department of Transportation is in the range of $200 plus million, which may grow, depending on the bridge abutments on both sides of the river; and the structural integrity of those facilities has yet to be fully evaluated. So the $250 million is a soundly based estimate, based on engineering evaluations, and is a fair number, and so is the funding that we provide in the legislation to compensate the State for the shift from highway transportation to transit as occurred in California, in Oakland earlier this year in April when their bridge collapsed due to a tanker truck collapse. 
   Those are the basic figures. Those are the justifications. We've limited, capped the dollar amount for transit at $5 million in response to a question from the other body, and we have a well-supported figure of $250 million for the reconstruction out of general revenue funds. 
   I appeal for the support of this body for this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   I think the applause on our side for all of the speakers shows the depth of feeling, the depth of appreciation that the Minnesota delegation feels toward each other, toward others in the body who have spoken tonight, toward our ranking member, Mr. Mica, to whom, once again, I express my appreciation for the responsiveness and to prompt action on this matter. 
   And to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Young, I remember so well the Sunshine Skyway Bridge tragedy and later included it in a hearing that then Mr. Clinger, my ranking member on the Investigation and Oversight Subcommittee, held hearings that included that tragedy. I was here to vote on the funding for that restoration of that bridge, and I appreciate the gentleman's recollection. 
   We will look back, I guess, in a few days, on this moment as a welcome respite from the cacophony of dissidence that we have heard in the last several hours in this body. Unfortunately, tragedy, loss of life and injury has brought us together, but it shows the greatness of this House of Representatives, that it can come together and find common cause and move ahead. 
   I hope that respite from cacophony will prevail in the other body as we send this legislation forward and that there will not be, as has been threatened, procedural issues raised or jurisdictional matters that may be raised that might deter a provision of this legislation to provide respite from the congestion that will result in the reconstruction of this bridge and that already is occurring in the city of Minneapolis. 
   The House provided respite for Oakland, San Francisco in the collapse of the 580 and 880 structures just earlier this year, in April. We provide almost identical language and support in this legislation. I just hope the other body will not raise objections and move this legislation forward, because those are relatively minor matters that be can resolved in the management by DOT of that transit language. 
   I want to thank all our colleagues for the dignity of this discussion tonight and for the support expressed for the people of Minnesota by the rest of the Nation. We thank you, thank all our colleagues, and we ask for a wholehearted vote in support of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman and colleagues, we gather here for an historic moment in the history of transportation, particularly the history of rail transportation. And I'm glad there are so many Members still gathered on the floor to listen to an erudite conversation that we are going to have on both sides of the aisle about the history of rail safety. 
   Although our committee has had jurisdiction over the rail sector for the past dozen years, this is the first time the committee has brought a rail safety authorization bill to the House floor. It is, in fact, only the second time in 100 years that the House will consider amendments, adjustments to the hours of service rule in the rail sector. 
   We bring to you an important bill that addresses long-neglected failings and shortcomings of safety in the rail sector that will make the railroad safer in the future; that will make jobs for workers in that sector safer in the future; that will make safer passage through towns through which railroads pass, often with toxic substances, toxic chemicals, frankly, the safest way to move those substances, but we are going to make it safer with this legislation. 
   I particularly want to thank the distinguished Chair of the Subcommittee on Railroads, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown) for her persistent leadership, persistent efforts over the past years of service on the committee in support of rail safety; and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), ranking member of the full committee, participating in substantive discussions that resulted in compromises that we bring to the floor; and to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), who has a large rail presence in his own district and, of course, in the State of Pennsylvania. 
   In each of the past five Congresses, I have introduced for consideration by the committee broad scope rail safety legislation and pledged that if it isn't considered in each of those Congresses, when the majority would turn and I would have the opportunity to lead the committee, that we would move such legislation. And today we deliver on that commitment. 
   The discussions that we had were inclusive. They were extensive. They were intensive. There were adjustments made on both sides with the result that, as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart) said during consideration of the rule, this is a bipartisan bill. 
   The Federal Railroad Administration has reported that the total number of train accidents, collisions, derailments, and others increased from 2,504 in 1994 over the next decade to 3,325 in 2005. Thankfully, over the last year, that number decreased to 2,925. Those improvements in rail safety statistics are a good sign. But I know from more than 25 years of chairing subcommittees on safety issues that we have a long way to go. Serious accidents resulting in fatalities, injuries, and environmental damages continue to occur and will continue to occur. Equipment can fail, people make mistakes, storms happen that cause those accidents. But we have to do everything that is possible in our realm to make sure that those accidents are minimized. 
   Safety requires constant vigilance by workers on the job, by employers, by  government safety oversight agencies, and by the Congress. Whether it is in mining, whether in maritime, whether in aviation, trucking, highway passenger vehicle traffic, or in the railways, vigilance is the key to safety. Safety, I define, is the relative absence of risk. And when we apply that standard to every mode of transportation and we enforce it, we will achieve greater protection of the public interest. 
   The FRA says that 40 percent of all train accidents result from human factors, and that's a comparable number in the other modes of transportation as well. In railroading, one in four of those accidents results from fatigue. In testimony at our committee hearings, the National Transportation Safety Board said, ``The current railroad hours of service laws permit, and many rail carriers require, the most burdensome, fatigue-inducing work schedule of any federally regulated transportation mode in the country.'' And a comparison of the modes is revealing. 
   A commercial part 121 airline pilot can work up to 100 hours a month. A part 135, generally known as a charter operation, can work up to 120 hours a month. Shipboard personnel on ocean-going vessels can work up to 360 hours a month. A truck driver can be on duty for 350 hours a month. But in train crews, they can be on duty up to 432 hours a month. That's 14 hours a day for each of those 30 days. 
   Fatigue sets in. Fatigue causes people to lose concentration, to lose focus, to lose control. Vince Lombardi said, ``Fatigue makes cowards of us all.'' He didn't mean physical cowards. He meant inability to make the right judgments.     
   And that's what fatigue does in the workplace. If you have any question about it, look at some of the things we say around this body at 2, 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning after 14 or 16 hours of debate. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you listen to it or when you read it. And it doesn't make any better sentence in the locomotive. 
   Congress made some slight modifications to the hours of service law in 1969, but this bill is the first major reform of rail hours of service standards since 1907. Our duty is to make hours of service safer and better. And this bill provides signal and train crews with rest, prohibits them from working more than 12 hours in a day, limits limbo time. I said in the beginning of the hearing, if it was good enough for the Pope to eliminate limbo, it ought to be good enough for the Congress to at least limit it in rail service. 
   The bill also requires all class 1 railroads to implement a positive train control system, which was the NTSB's most wanted transportation safety improvement since this was developed in 1990. 
   The legislation also addresses track safety. In 2006, track-related accidents surpassed human factors as the leading cause of all train accidents. Just look at the list. Most recently, in Oneida, New York; Pico Rivera in California; Home Valley in Washington; Minot, North Dakota; Nodaway, Iowa. All of them raise serious questions about the condition and the safety of the track on the Nation's railways, call into question the adequacy of track safety regulation and FRA's, Federal Railroad Association's, oversight of those conditions. 
   This bill requires the railroads to inspect their tracks, to look for internal defects, and provides increased funding for Federal Railroad Administration for track inspection technology, and strengthens enforcement at the Federal Railroad Administration. 
   FRA investigated just 13 percent of the most serious grade crossing collisions. We've got to do better than that. In 2004, the FAA conducted onsite investigations of 1,392, 93 percent of the aviation accidents that FAA had responsibility for investigating, but the FRA did only 13 percent. That's not good enough. That's not conducting oversight. That's not accepting and exercising your governmental oversight responsibility and responsibility to the public. 
   We increase the number of inspectors for safety at the FRA. We will double the number of Federal rail safety inspectors over the next 4 years. And we do many other items that are of great importance. I will include in the Record at this point the committee document that lists in specific detail all those safety improvements.

   Mr. Chairman, I again want to express my great appreciation to Ms. Brown for years of advocacy for rail issues and for her championing of the rail safety matters, and to thank the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania, who has devoted a great deal of energy and time and effort to rail from his first day on the committee, asking the committee to hold a hearing in 2001 in his district on rail maintenance yard issues and continuation of rail service. It turned out to be a very enlightening hearing. 
   He has remained engaged in the issues. As the gentleman said a moment ago, we did not just throw issues on the table; we rather sat around the table after the hearings and discussed in detail repeatedly subject matters, made concessions on each side, adjustments, understanding each other's concerns, and reached not the ideal of each side, but ideal in the best public interest. The result is, I believe, a bill that substantially advances the cause of rail safety.     
   I must say in passing that it diminishes the substance of the bill to say that it is, as the previous speaker did, a gift to rail labor. This is a gift to all Americans, to all residents of communities that are home to railroads, to rail makeup yards through which the goods of America move, through which the coal and the grain and the containers move. It is safety for them. It is safety for the workers on the railroads. It is in the best interest of all America. I urge passage of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (FEDERAL RAILROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   The collapse of the Interstate 35 bridge in Minneapolis on August 1 while I was at this very microphone managing a conference report on water resources amendments stunned the Nation, stunned this House. It startled my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation and our colleagues on the committee. 
   But shortly after that, the Federal Railroad Administration and the GAO warned that many of the Nation's 76,000 railroad bridges may also be at risk. 
   FRA on September 11 issued a rail safety advisory on railroad bridges, reporting that 52 accidents over the period 1982 to 1986 were caused by the catastrophic structural failure of railroad bridges. The most recent accident was the M&B Railroad near Myrtlewood, Alabama, where a train of solid-fuel rocket motors derailed when a timber trestle railroad bridge collapsed under that train. Several cars, one carrying a rocket motor, rolled onto their side. Six people were injured. 
   Bridge failures do not account for the majority of train accidents, but FRA noted and updated their guidelines and reported that they have found instances ``where lack of adherence to the FRA's bridge safety policy resulted in trains operating over structural deficiencies in steel bridges that could easily have resulted in serious train accidents.'' We deal with that issue, among others, in this manager's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to point out that in the manager's amendment, we strike section 301, the whistleblower provision, and section 616, the preemption provision, which was included in the security bill. And I note those two because they are two of the five objections the administration raises in its statement of administration policy, so they are objecting to two items not in the bill nor in the manager's amendment. Therefore, I urge support of the manager's amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes to point out that although the gentleman is right, the FRA did deny Union Pacific, the denial is ``without prejudice to the submission of a future request addressing the same subject matter,'' so the issue remains alive and it seems appropriate to address it in this manner. 
   The gentleman does raise a concern about the NAFTA agreement and such language might run in contravention, but safety always trumps other issues. In our aviation trade agreements with other countries, the U.S. rules on safety prevail over those of the trading nation. We are elevating this whole role of safety in the FRA and changing its title to the Federal Railroad Safety Administration. 
   I think we should explore further in that context and with relationship to aviation the effect of NAFTA and the effect this language might have within NAFTA, and I will be glad to pursue that with the gentleman.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, the essential issue here is not whether the noxious fumes, whether the groundwater pollution caused by solid waste deposited on rail property should be regulated. The question here is whether the language and the manner in which the gentleman proposes to prevent those effects upon nearby communities is in interference with the authority and the preemption authority of the Federal Railroad Administration. 
   Mr. Mulvey, one of the commissioners of the Surface Transportation Board, said, ``I believe that an amendment such as this is necessary to redress the growing misuse of Federal railroad preemption law ..... with respect to solid waste transload facilities.'' But he, too, expresses concerns that it could be interpreted too broadly to frustrate the zoning of legitimate solid waste transfer facilities. 
   This is an issue, he says, that can be worked out. It can be worked out, and we are committed to doing so, with participation of the gentleman from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I think it's clear the amendment does not apply to containerized facilities. They still are subject to the Federal preemption. The only question is whether there's infringement on preemption with open facilities, open solid waste storage facilities. That is a matter on which I think with further discussion we can reach an amicable resolution.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself 2 3/4 minutes. 
   This is a proposal that really does have a thousand fathers. The distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is an advocate for this initiative; I believe the Governor of his State is an advocate for it, as the mayor of Los Angeles is an advocate for it. I know the City of San Diego and their planning organization are for this kind of initiative, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Port of Los Angeles-Long Beach is an advocate for this. And I am an advocate for it. And I think that in this initiative we have found the ideal solution to intermodalism, to movement of goods, reduction of noise, of pollution, of accidents, of intersection of goods, people, and vehicles by adopting the maglev technology. This was an idea that I advocated well in advance of ISTEA in 1991. We got first funding in the ISTEA legislation for study of maglev technology. And then in TEA-21, under then Chairman Shuster, advocating experimental projects. It took years of development, but finally General Atomics, under contract with the Department of Transportation, perfected the technology. And then it was the Port of Long Beach/Los Angeles that said we would like to move containers with it before you start moving people. The ideal solution. I wish I had thought of it myself. But it was the port that came to the idea, and then the gentleman from California working with the port authority and with the State embraced this idea. 
   This can be a very exciting, successful initiative. We have a paying customer, containers. And with a combination of some Federal grant funding and loans from the railroad infrastructure loan program to whatever the sponsoring authority may be, it can be a State, it can be a railroad, this project can be very successful. We can have one not only in California but in discussion with the Chair of the Rail Subcommittee, Ms. Brown, the Port of Jacksonville would be interested in such an initiative. 
   So I just want to point out that while the gentleman advances the cause, it is not limited only to California. The language of the amendment says, authorized to be appropriated such funds as may be necessary to design and develop a pilot electric cargo conveyor system for the transportation of containers from ports to depots outside of urban areas. A brilliant solution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. If the gentlewoman would yield, the language is very broad. It says: Such sums as may be necessary to design and develop a pilot electric conveyor system. But I think that is not limited to one. That is broad enough language to be interpreted as to embrace more than one such project. It would be done by the Department of Transportation through the Federal Railroad Administration with appropriated funds. But also, the applicant has the authority under existing law in the SAFETEA-LU bill to apply for some of the $35 billion in railroad infrastructure loan funding.

   Earlier, I said this project has a thousand fathers. I should have said a thousand parents, because there are mothers and fathers in the presence of the gentlewoman from Florida and the gentlewoman from California, the newest member of our committee, Ms. Richardson. 
   And I love the gentleman's enthusiasm. Mr. Rohrabacher has from the time we began discussing this project been a very vigorous and knowledgeable supporter of the project. He has  also worked to bring local interests in to work with the Governor of California. I think with this enthusiasm and with this broad bipartisan and bicoastal interest, the Pacific Coast and the Atlantic Coast, that we will see something happen. There is going to be a project resulting from this when we get this legislation enacted. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time and ask for support of the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The only thing I can say for it is that I wish the gentleman had been here in 1995 when the Republican majority forced upon National Airport and the Washington Metropolitan Area Government Authority, Airport Authority, the changing of the name to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. And they did so, I say to the gentleman from Idaho, with their finger in the nose of the authorities, saying either you make the changes and you spend the money or we'll take your money away from you. And they said it right here on this floor. 
   What was the purpose of changing the name of that airport? No useful benefit. 
   We are creating a new safety emphasis for the Federal Railroad Administration. 
   In 1996, this committee and this Congress created a Motor Carrier Safety Administration. I didn't hear anybody jump up on the floor and say, Oh, my God, it's going to cost money to change the stationery of the agency. 
   Baloney. It doesn't cost any money at all. You just use up the existing stationery you have and print new ones. It doesn't cost you any new money. This is bogus. I have no idea where people get such ideas as this. 
   But when it comes to some priority that some people on the other side of the aisle had in previous Congresses, they shove it down the throat of the Washington Metropolitan Airport Authority and say, You will change the name on all the facilities. You will change, they said to the National Park Service, signs leading to the airport, and you will do it at your expense, at the Federal Government expense. 
   Here it's going to be a change of stationery. You run out of the existing stationery they have and print new ones that says ``safety'' on it. 
   Maybe he's getting at something more sinister. Maybe the gentleman doesn't want ``safety'' to be in the title of this agency. Maybe the gentleman doesn't want, and anyone who votes for such an amendment, doesn't want ``safety'' to be in the name of the agency that regulates safety in the public interest. 
   Vote against this amendment. This is nonsense. 
   I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (PROVIDING REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXPENSES INCURRED BY MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE ON LEVEE SAFETY -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6040, a bill to make a technical correction to a Water Resources and Development Act of 2007 provision authorizing the Secretary of the Army, acting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to establish a Committee on Levee Safety. 
   Title IX of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 authorizes the Corps to establish a committee of Federal, State, local, tribal, and private sector experts on levee safety to develop recommendations for a national levee safety program. 
   As the events of the last few years have clearly demonstrated, there is a serious concern with the condition of the Nation's primary structural flood control measures--the Nation's system of levees. These structures, which range from the Federally constructed and maintained levees along the lower Mississippi River and tributaries, to Federal, State, and local levees nationwide, protect our lives and livelihoods from the risks of flooding. Within the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers alone, there are between 12,000 to 13,000 miles of levees protecting everything from major metropolitan cities to towns and townships throughout the nation. Without a doubt, the health, safety, and security of countless lives depend on the resiliency and upkeep of these essential structures. 
   We have all witnessed the result of levee failure. Just 2 years ago, the flood walls surrounding three of the canals within the city of New Orleans failed, and the result was a major metropolitan city being underwater for days. Many of the communities impacted by this failure are still struggling today. 
   Just this past month, we watched as the rivers of the Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries overfilled their banks and resulted in the unfortunate loss of life, as well as thousands of families losing their homes, their cars, and their businesses to the raging waters of the Mississippi River. 
   Cognizant of the importance of the Nation's system of levees, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure included a provision within the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 to create a Committee on Levee Safety that would be tasked with developing recommendations for a national levee safety program. 
   The Secretary of the Army will establish the committee, and it will develop short-term recommendations to Congress for the creation of an effective and efficient 
   National Levee Safety Program. The House and Senate conferees on the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 agreed on the importance of soliciting the recommendations of the Nation's leading experts in levee safety to aid in the drafting of a future National Levee Safety Program. The recommendations made by the committee on Levee Safety will be reported to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 
   It is my understanding that the Corps has been working toward the creation of this committee, including the identification of a broad array of experts in levee safety. Unfortunately, the Corps believes it has hit a roadblock due to the specific wording of the authorization language that has prevented the Corps from utilizing available funding to pay for the travel expenses of the committee members. 
   H.R. 6040 is a simple modification to the existing authorization language to ensure that the Corps can utilize already identified funding to pay these expenses so that the Committee on Levee Safety can formally be assembled and begin its important work. 
   I applaud my colleagues on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Ranking Member MICA, and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, Congressman BOOZMAN, for sponsoring this legislation. It is my hope that the other body can quickly move this legislation to the President's desk, so that the Committee on Levee Safety can begin its important work later this summer. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5001, a bill to direct the redevelopment of the Old Post Office Building, which is not only a landmark in the Nation's capital, but a jewel of ``America's Main Street,'' Pennsylvania Avenue. I commend the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) for introducing this legislation and for her work on this issue as Chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management. 
   Completed in 1899, the Old Post Office building was intended to be the U.S. Post Office Department Headquarters building as well as the city's main post office. The Old Post Office building was awarded a place on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. This Romanesque building is the second tallest structure and one of the first steel-frame buildings in the District of Columbia. 
   Despite the magnificence of this building and its extraordinary location, it has been difficult to develop this building to its fullest potential. A renovation of the Old Post Office began in 1977 as part of the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue. In 1982, the General Services Administration, GSA, entered into a 55-year lease with a private sector developer  to lease and operate the Old Post Office building. The building was renovated as a multifunctional building that included office space, retail, and a food court. Unfortunately, this redevelopment effort was not successful because of high turnover among the retail businesses and low satisfaction among tenants. The original developer went into bankruptcy and the lender foreclosed on the leasehold. 
   Today, the Old Post Office building is an aging historical building that is inefficient, underutilized, and a financial drain on the Federal Building Fund. The building's large atrium and other factors contribute to the high costs of operating and maintaining the building. 
   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has provided oversight and direction to GSA previously in attempts to foster the development of the Old Post Office, including requiring that GSA submit a viable development plan for the Old Post Office before any Federal funds be used to convert the space. Notwithstanding these efforts, the desired development has not occurred. 
   H.R. 5001, the ``Old Post Office Building Redevelopment Act of 2008'', authorizes the Administrator of General Services to enter into an agreement to redevelop the Old Post Office Building in a manner that is beneficial to the Federal Government. This bill will not only help spur the redevelopment of this building but also help ensure that the taxpayers get the fullest return from this historic and treasured structure. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 5001, the ``Old Post Office Building Redevelopment Act of 2008.''

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (PRE-DISASTER MITIGATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. And I want to compliment Chairwoman Norton for the splendid work she has done chairing the subcommittee, holding hours of hearings on the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program and on various aspects of FEMA's programs that have unfolded in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. She has rendered enormous service to the country, to the people of flood prone, disaster prone areas of the country through these hearings and done a superb job. And to Mr. Graves, the ranking member of the subcommittee, and Mr. Mica who has fully participated in the shaping of this legislation. It is truly a bipartisan initiative, but one that goes back a very long time. 
   It was in 1988, then the Committee on Public Works and Transportation authorized FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Program. We thought then this was a very important initiative to provide grants to communities so that they could put in place initiatives, whether structures or nonstructural approaches to protecting communities and individuals, businesses, residences against the hazards of flood, tornado, hurricane and, in our northern tier, excessive snowfall. 
   The idea was to build better after a disaster and be better prepared for the next time around. But that idea evolved over time, and it was in the mid 1990s that then James Lee Witt, the administrator of FEMA, conceived the idea of taking hazard mitigation a step further to pre-disaster mitigation. He called it Project Impact. 
   He came up to the committee, now the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, to meet with then Chairman Bud Shuster and me as the ranking member to discuss Project Impact, saying that we can save money, as the gentlewoman, the minority leader for this afternoon, has indicated, that we can save money by protecting against what we know will be hazards, disasters happening in the future. And so the committee crafted in 2000 the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program in our FEMA disaster Hazard Mitigation Program. 
   Out of that program was allocated to the City of Seattle $50 million to strengthen structures in the city against the possibility of earthquake. The city invested some $50 million in strengthening public structures, public buildings, public roadways, and private structures as well. And then they had an earthquake. After the effects of the earthquake had been analyzed, FEMA estimated that the Pre-Disaster Mitigation investments saved $500 million in what would have been damaged public and private structures alike, ten-fold the value of the investment. 
   The program then was further extended as the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure continued its work. I remember subsequent Chairman Don Young saying so often: Yes, we have to be prepared. FEMA is in the Department of Homeland Security and has to be part of protecting against the security threat to the United States. We don't know when it will come. We know that we have to be prepared. But we do know that every year, said Chairman Young, there are going to be hurricanes, there is going to be a flood, there is going to be whiteouts, there is going to be an earthquake, and we need to continue this program. So with bipartisan support, we have extended the program. 
   In the aftermath, one of the best examples was the town of Valmeyer, Illinois, devastated in the 1993 Mississippi River flood. For $45 million in Federal, State, and local funding and Pre-Disaster Mitigation, the town was simply relocated to bluffs 400 feet above the site of the former town. This year, as the Mississippi overflowed its banks in many places along its course from southern Minnesota through Iowa, the Chicago Tribune ran a story entitled, ``Valmeyer, Illinois, Soaked in '93, Town Now High and Dry.'' Quoting a resident, Eleanor Anderson, 86 years old, home destroyed in the 1993 flood, said, ``I am sure glad I don't have to worry now that we are high enough here on the hill.'' That is a reasonable investment of public funds. 
   Story County, Iowa, in 1990, 1993 and 1996, homes were flooded out. Finally, in 1996, with Pre-Disaster Mitigation Funds, those six homes were bought out and moved out. And in 1998 when the floods struck, FEMA estimated that the Federal and State and local governments saved $541,900 in what would have been damages to restore those homes. 
   In my own district, in 1999, on the eve of July 4, on July 3, straight-line winds called a derecho of 100 miles an hour in a swath 15 miles wide swept through the Superior National Forest, the Boundary Waters Canoe area on the U.S.-Canadian border, and blew down 26 million trees, 3 years' worth of timber harvest for the whole State of Minnesota, creating an enormous hazard for fire to local residents. In the area outside of the wilderness, trees had to be subjected to salvage logging to clear out a way from homes, from resorts, and from outfitter buildings. 
   Following up, FEMA came to the area and said, with Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds, we propose a 75/25 participation to install sprinkler systems around all the homes and all the businesses in the Gunflint Trail area to protect against the potential, the very real potential of future fire. Almost every resident and business participated in the program, and about 96 percent of the people maintained their sprinkler systems. Then last year, in April of 2007, a fire broke out. Careless campers left the site of their camping and a wind came up and blew it into what eventually became a 75,000 acre fire. The homes that had the sprinkler systems, the buildings that were protected with the sprinkler systems were unscathed. Those that weren't, 147 of them, burned. 
   Pre-Disaster Mitigation saves lives, saves property, saves costs. It is a sound investment in the future. We have authorized in this legislation the program for an additional 3 years at $250 million each for fiscal 2009 through  2011. The chair of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) has outlined all of the specifics of the bill; I need not go into them. 
   I simply speak to reinforce the specific examples the benefits of the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program. It is a sound investment in the future of this country for all of us as we are subjected to increasing amounts of disaster from natural causes.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (RAW SEWAGE OVERFLOW COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2452, the ``Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act''. Let me begin by congratulating our Committee colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. BISHOP), for introducing legislation to provide common-sense standards for public notification of both combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows. This well-thought-out legislation will be a welcome addition to Federal efforts in protecting public health as well as the natural environment. 
   The most reliable way to prevent human illness from waterborne diseases and pathogens is to eliminate the potential for human exposure to the discharge of pollutants from combined sewer overflows (``CSOs'') and sanitary sewer overflows (''SSOs''). This can occur either through the elimination of the discharge, or, in the event that a release does occur, to minimize the potential human contact to pollutants. 
   Unfortunately, Federal law does not provide uniform, national standards for public notification of combined and sanitary sewer overflows. Notification of sewer overflows is covered only by a patchwork of Federal regulations, State laws, and local initiatives aimed at limiting human exposure to discharges. 
   Potential human exposure to the pollutants found in sewer overflows can occur in a variety of ways. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'), the most common pathways include direct contact with sewer discharges in recreational waters and beaches, drinking water contaminated by sewer discharges, and consuming or handling contaminated fish or shellfish. However, humans are also at risk of direct exposure to sewer overflows, including sewer backups into residential buildings, city streets, and sidewalks. 
   In October 2007, in my own Congressional district, basements and city streets across the city of Duluth were flooded with sewer overflows that resulted from massive rainstorms in the Lake Superior basin. The Western Lake Superior Sanitary Sewer District reported at least seven major sewage overflows in its service area, with reports of numerous additional backups into local streets and basements. 
   Similarly, earlier this month, heavy rains in the Midwest and flooding along the Mississippi River system resulted in a significant overload to the sewer systems and treatment works, and resulted in the release of untold gallons of untreated or partially treated sewage into the homes and street of communities along the Mississippi River system. As families are starting to return to their homes, they are in need of information on any health risks from coming into contact with potentially contaminated waters. 
   The cost of eliminating CSOs and SSOs throughout the nation is staggering. In its most recent Clean Water Needs Survey (2000), EPA estimated the future capital needs to address existing CSOs at $50.6 billion. In addition, EPA estimates that it would require an additional $88.5 billion in capital improvements to reduce the frequency of SSOs caused by wet weather and other conditions. 
   Upon being elected Chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I made it a priority to renew the Federal commitment in addressing the nation's wastewater infrastructure needs. 
   In March 2007, the House approved two bills reported from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure--H.R. 720, the ``Water Quality Financing Act'', and H.R. 569, the ``Water Quality Investment Act''--to reauthorize appropriations for the construction, repair, and rehabilitation of wastewater infrastructure, including measures to address CSOs and SSOs. 
   H.R. 720 authorizes appropriations of $14 billion over four years for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which is the primary source of Federal funds for wastewater infrastructure. H.R. 569 authorizes appropriations of $1.7 billion in Federal grants over 5 years to address combined sewers and sanitary sewers. Both bills are pending before the United States Senate. 
   However, even with significant increases in Federal, State, and local investment, it is likely that sewer overflows will continue. In the event that a release does occur, the most effective way to prevent illness is to provide timely and adequate public notice to minimize human exposure to pollutants. 
   H.R. 2452, the ``Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act'', amends the Clean Water Act to provide a uniform, national standard for monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows. This legislation, which was approved by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure by voice vote, will strengthen the monitoring and public notification requirements of the Clean Water Act to encourage increased awareness and public notification of overflows in an expeditious manner. 
   The bill under consideration this afternoon is a slightly modified version of this legislation as reported by the Committee. The bill, as amended, makes a few technical and clarifying changes to the bill, as well as addresses a few transitional issues on the implementation of this Act. 
   The framework of this amendment was developed jointly by the majority and minority Members of the Committee, it consultation with the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, the Water Environment Federation, the California Association of Sanitation Agencies, and American Rivers. I appreciate the hard work by all parties to help move this common-sense legislation to increase public awareness of combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows. 
   Again, I applaud Mr. BISHOP for introducing this common-sense legislation to ensure that our citizens are made aware of the potential public health threats caused by sewer overflows. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2452.

We have got to protect our land here at home. And this is only today's fire. We had just a year-and-a-half ago a huge blaze that ripped through the Boundary Areas Canoe Area. 
   We need this assistance, we need it now, and we need it in this bill.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, a bill long in the making, 6 years in the making, a bill that has ultimately passed the House, not passed the Senate, passed the House, passed the Senate, not gone to conference. 
   We tried in the closing hours of the 109th Congress to wrap this measure up, then-Chairman DON YOUNG and I, working with our counterparts in the other body, attempting to reach an agreement, but it just proved insurmountable, too insurmountable an obstacle to get there. 
   In this 110th Congress, we resumed on the base of the legislation that has built up over 6 years, over three Congresses, and working with the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the ranking member on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, we spent a great deal of time together thinking through how to proceed with this legislation.  
   We agreed on basic principles that we would start with the bill that passed the House. There was no conference ever consummated in the 109th Congress. So we decided that the benchmark bill for this Congress would be only those measures that were in the bill of the 109th Congress, and we started from there. And then we have worked our way through myriad issues, Members who wanted new projects or amendments or additions to existing projects; and in all cases, we made very, very difficult, but I think honest and consistent, decisions about the legislation we bring before you today. 
   I want to assure Members that are concerned, that have issues that have arisen since the 109th Congress, that those issues that need to be addressed by projects of the Corps of Engineers will be addressed in subsequent legislation. As soon as we are able to move this bill through the House, through conference with the Senate, which I am confident can be done before the middle of June, maybe earlier if the other body will be able to free itself to work with us in conference, we can get this done very quickly, and then begin on the next round of water resources projects which I guarantee is not going to take 7 years.     
   We are going to deal with somebody, maybe in the next 7 or 8 months after the conclusion of this legislation. Again, I express my appreciation to the gentleman from Florida for consistently working to move this critically important legislation. 
   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is the proud inheritor of a long tradition of work, of investment in America's transportation needs, water resources, where the very first concerns of the new Nation in 1789 and the first act of the first Congress, 1789, was to authorize the establishment of a lighthouse, at the entry to Hampton Roads in Virginia. 
   Starting from that point, this committee continued the direction of the Constitution to build and maintain post roads. Well, not all roads were built just for the postal service; but, again, it was the spirit of the Constitution, the spirit of the new Nation that we needed mobility. The Nation was founded along the waterways, the salt water coasts, the inland waterways. It has been our task to assure mobility, movement of people and goods through waterways, and then the highways, later the railways, and then the airways. 
   Here we come with this massive bill, because the President, because Congress hasn't done its work; and the last time a President signed a Water Resources Development Act was in 2000. Well, we hope that the next one will be this year, which we fully expect. 
   There are many issues that have arisen in the intervening years, some that were weighing heavily upon us when we began this process in 2000 of crafting the current WRDA bill on the Great Lakes. Invasive species are threatening our native aquatic species, biota and flora, as well as a new issue called a deadly fish virus, a hemorrhagic virus that destroys the fisheries and is carried in ballast waters from one region of the Great Lakes to another. 
   We have language in this bill that will initiate an emergency program by the Corps of Engineers to protect the vital food supply and the quality of the waters. 
   Lake Superior, because of a drought in the Great Lakes watershed, has seen the water level drop 8 inches in the past 3 years and will drop another 2 inches this year with the beginning of the major shipping season. It will be at nearly its lowest level in history. That has meant that vessels carrying iron ore from the upper lakes to the lower lakes steel mills have gone out 7,500 tons light. 
   It means two or three extra voyages per vessel per season, raising the cost of iron ore, raising the cost of steel, affecting our competitiveness. We have legislation, we have language in this legislation that will direct the Corps to undertake an accelerated dredging program making up for the 15 years they haven't done the dredging because we have had high waters on the Great Lakes. 
   We authorize locks, improved extended locks on the Mississippi River system, seven extended locks to take the 600-foot locks to make them 1,200-foot locks. A barge tow leaving Clinton, Iowa, round-trip to New Orleans, back to Clinton, Iowa, takes 820 hours. New Orleans is the world's most important grain export facility. 
   We can cut 60 hours off that round-trip by extending the locks at 1,200 feet so the tows that are 1,200 feet don't have to be broken in half, sent through 600 feet at a time, lashed together, go through the next lock and do it all over again. We are in a world competitive market on which grain moves on as little as an eighth of a cent a bushel. Every time you have to spend those extra hours going through the locks, you are raising the cost of our commodities, which makes us less competitive with, say, Brazil, which is mounting a massive soybean export facility at Recife, which is 2,500 miles further out in the Atlantic Ocean than New Orleans is. 
   We have legislation here, language in this legislation to deal with the restoration of the Everglades, a matter of great interest to the gentleman from Florida, for which he has been an eloquent advocate. They are in a state of disrepair. The buffer to protect them from storms is weak because of our inaction, and we are going to deal with that issue, as well as the wetlands along the Gulf of Mexico from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, all the way on to Florida. 
   We are insistent on addressing the needs of the Everglades, the needs of the Louisiana coastal region and in Louisiana, New Orleans area, the Mississippi River gulf outlet, which allowed salt water intrusion to come up from the gulf, kill the wetlands. It allowed the overtopping of St. Bernard Parish. We have got to restore that wetland, and this legislation will do that at the request and insistence of the Louisiana delegation. 
   There are many other important features in this legislation. In all, 56 chiefs' reports, we had a request of over 1,500 projects. There are over 700 projects in this legislation. More than 300 Members of the House have a direct interest in the legislation. We welcome their interest in this participation. We bring to this body a very critical and supportable piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute to express my great appreciation again to the gentleman from Florida for his thoughtful discussion. I join him in his statement on the administration's statement of policy. I think they have it wrong, and the gentleman stated it just right. 
   Over the past 6 years, if we had passed the water resources bill in a timely fashion, it would have been in the range of $2 billion a year. That is normal. So what we are dealing with is a huge, pent-up backlog. 
   Again, as the gentleman said, this is an investment in America, and Members of Congress representing their constituents, their businesses, their water resources, know what they need. They have come forward with thoughtful recommendations, and this bill reflects those recommendations. 
   We have served as a filter to weed out those in our best judgment that did not measure up on cost-benefit analysis. So we have set a standard for the future and we have, in accordance with the rules of the House, made all of the Member projects available, and will continue to do that. 
   I would like to acknowledge the splendid work of the Chair of the Subcommittee on Water Resources, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson. She has devoted years of her service in the Congress to consideration of water resources vital to her State of Texas. She has taken ownership of these issues and led the subcommittee hearings. Even this afternoon, she has hearings going on in our committee room while she is here to help manage the bill.

   And the gentleman has stated the issue very well: that 6-foot channel depth is simply not viable for today's barge traffic. 
   And there is also the issue of PCB contamination in the lower Fox River. The gentleman has shown real foresight in dealing with the issue both of navigation and of cleanup. So the Superfund really ought to deal with this problem. It is not going to. We are going to be vigilant on the matter. If there is an opportunity in conference to address the issue in an appropriate manner, we will do that. If not, we will do it in a subsequent water resources bill. And I look forward to coming to Green Bay to see the gentleman's district and the lower Fox River.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is the so-called traditional manager's amendment that we have worked on for weeks in a bipartisan manner across the aisle within the committee to work out technical changes and modifications to the bill that came to the attention of the committee after consideration of the bill in March. A project of this magnitude always has some issues that we need to resolve, and we have done that quite well in this manager's amendment. 
   Among some of the highlights are a provision that is of great importance to the 35 million people who live along the Great Lakes. There is a provision to direct the Secretary of the Army, along with directors of other agencies and entities, to carry out an emergency project to control and prevent spreading a viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) virus in the Great Lakes and the connecting channels. I alluded to this issue at the outset of my remarks at the beginning of the legislation. It is an infectious viral disease of  fish and has caused fish kills throughout the lakes. It has been a problem in Europe, it is a problem in Japan, and now we have confirmed presence in Lake Ontario, Lake St. Clair, Erie, St. Lawrence River. It was discovered in Lake Huron. It is migrating up the lakes, killing fish in its wake caused by ballast water that is infected on vessels plying the Great Lakes. 
   It spreads rapidly. We don't really know how it spreads, but we need to attack this issue now. There is a multibillion dollar fishery industry throughout the Great Lakes, sport fish and commercial fishery, and this provision will help us deal with and hopefully find a way to contain this devastating virus. 
   We also have authorizations for new projects in water and wastewater-related infrastructure. For years, these were traditionally practices of the Environmental Protection Agency, but they have run out of money, frankly. Even though we have passed the State Revolving Loan fund bill in this committee to deal with the matter, there still are huge needs. No one better than the Corps of Engineers is equipped to deal with the needs of environmental infrastructure. So in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service program, the State Revolving Loan fund of the EPA, Corps of Engineers will help communities rebuild their infrastructure and provide for public health and economic vitality of our towns all across America. The needs of communities have not gone away; the ability to deal with them has simply diminished. 
   The Corps can do this work; they have proven they can. And we have a very vigorous and I think constructive environmental infrastructure program in the manager's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would yield such time as she may wish to the gentlewoman from Texas.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. In the preceding Congress, this amendment was offered on the floor during consideration of the WRDA bill, and it passed by voice vote; WRDA passed by 406 votes. It requires adequate budgeting by the administration for maintenance of small, low-use harbors. These are relatively smaller harbors; they may not handle thousands of containers or millions of tons of bulk commodities shipped on the Great Lakes, as we do in the Harbor of Duluth, but they are important projects and facilities that place lives and livelihoods at risk on the fierce storms of the Great Lakes, because these are also harbors of refuge. So I strongly support it.

I just wanted to point out that the Great Lakes have gone through 15 years, in the 1960s, into the 1970s, into the 1980s, nearly a 20-year period of abnormally high level. Now we are going  through a seventh year of low water drought in the watershed of the Great Lakes. The Corps of Engineers has avoided dredging costs all during those two decades of high water on the Great Lakes. It is time now to recoup, to do the dredging that is needed, especially for these small harbors, harbors of refuge, small commercial harbors. And the gentleman's amendment will ensure that this issue stays on the agenda of this and future administrations. So I urge support of the amendment.

   I appreciate the concerns of the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee about time and cost. We certainly don't want to add any more time than Corps projects already take to evolve, nor do we want to foist additional costs on local governments. 
   The language of the amendment of the gentleman, though, is simply to take current practice that the Corps has in its principles and guidelines, but to make those principles and guidelines into current law. I have talked with the Corps representatives in the chief's office, and they say, well, we're looking for direction from Congress. 
   This language will not add time, will not create costs that are not already being incurred under our existing practice, and in that spirit, I think the amendment should be accepted.

   But the gentleman from Illinois speaks for himself and also the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Bean) who shares this river with him and also our former Speaker, Mr. Hastert, whom I saw on the House floor just prior to consideration of the legislation. So he thought this would be a good idea because he would be able to do some walleye fishing on the river, and we are all for fishing walleyes, and the gentleman has had a very, very clear and narrowly drawn objective. 
   I am glad we have been able to work this out in a manner that suits his concerns and allays the fears and concerns of those in the Western States that thought this was going to be a major hindrance to hydroelectric projects.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. First of all, we had a very clear agreement within the committee on the Democratic and Republican side not to take new items that were not in the 109th Congress Water Resources Development Act. We have vigorously adhered to that, kept a great many projects out. 
   This proposal is not only new, but it is massive, it is huge, it is not a study of potential effects. It has very clear declarative language: the Secretary shall inventory, develop and maintain all lands, properties, projects, meaning hydroelectric projects. The language at the very outset prohibits any action that may be proposed, as is being considered along the Snake River, to remove dams for environmental purposes, and by directing the Secretary to undertake this action, creates a PAYGO issue. There is a clear budgetary consequence in that language. 
   This motion goes well beyond the intent of the Water Resources Development Act. It goes beyond the bipartisan agreement we have in bringing this bill to the floor. It authorizes unlimited projects without consideration of environmental impacts or consideration of taxpayer expense.     
   It impacts legislation that we already have in this bill. It goes far beyond the scope that we intended in WRDA. 
   We can consider the gentleman's proposal in future authorizations of WRDA and in hearings that we will undertake, but this amendment has no place during floor consideration of this bill at this late hour when it clearly brings into play items well beyond the scope of the agreement between the Democrats and Republicans on the bill and well beyond the scope of the purpose of the legislation. It imposes vast, potential new expenditures and requirements upon the Secretary, some of which are not even well understood at this point. 
   So I oppose the motion, and I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for bringing this bill to the floor and for the support of the Republican side. Mr. English, it is good to have you participating, and our colleague on the committee, Mr. Petri, thank you for your diligent work on behalf of aviation issues. 
   The House has done its job on aviation. We passed, on September 20, the reauthorization act to extend aviation programs through 2011. Shortly thereafter, we passed another bill to provide a short-term extension of FAA programs. Then in November, we passed another attempt to extend aviation programs in the short term. 
   Regrettably, our colleagues across the way in the other body have not acted on any of these. If we don't act, frankly, the FAA just simply runs out of money. It will run out of authority to spend money. It will run out of authority to collect the revenues. So the House again, thank goodness the Ways and Means Committee is doing its job of carrying the load, has brought to the floor with our participation and vigorous support an extension of the revenue authority for the FAA programs. 
   First of all, we extend with this legislation the aviation taxes. Now, that covers 80 percent of FAA's budget. And with an uncommitted cash balance of only $1.5 billion, any lapse in the aviation taxes could put solvency of the trust fund at serious risk. 
   Don't think it can't happen, because that did happen in 1995 when Congress allowed the aviation taxes to lapse and the Aviation Trust Fund ran out of money. Curiously, ticket prices didn't go down. The airlines just kept charging the same price. They didn't give the consumer during that period of lapse a break. They just kept on collecting taxes, revenues, at the higher level, without giving any kind of a rebate on taxes. We don't want to let that happen again. 
   The second thing that we do in this legislation is extend authority for the FAA to make expenditures from the Aviation Trust Fund. Without that, on March 1, FAA will face a partial shutdown. They will not be able to pay some 4,000 employees, and a good many of those will be air traffic controllers. 
   The third provision critical in this legislation is the $2.76 billion in contract authority for the Aviation Improvement Program, that is the construction program for runways and taxiways, the hard side, the air side of the airport. Because the previous authorization expired on September 30, there is no contract authority in place now for the AIP program in fiscal year 2008. No new airport grants can be made. 
   So without this legislation, not only is FAA going to have to lay off 4,000 employees, they are not going to be able to make grants to airport authorities, we will lose tens of thousands of construction jobs in building airport capacity, and we will lose the ability to meet the needs of aviation capacity out into the balance of this fiscal year. 
   So the several provisions I have already described, plus many other provisions of the previous law, Vision 100, are continued in this legislation. We extend that authority through to June 30 in order to keep the pressure on the other body to take up our aviation authorization bill, which passed our committee with overwhelming bipartisan support, passed the House with an overwhelming vote, and yet the other body sits over there in splendid isolation as though nothing else in the world matters. And I find that very, very disturbing. 
   We need to pass this legislation that the House has already acted on and let the Senate pass it and get in to conference with us. We will get this resolved, we can get it passed and get it to the President in very short order. But, meanwhile, we have to take the action embodied in the pending legislation, and I urge its support by an overwhelming bipartisan vote.  
   This legislation would extend the authorization for aviation programs and taxes through June 30, 2008. Such an extension is urgently needed to address significant budget problems facing the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, due to the current lapse in Airport Improvement Program, AIP, funding, and the upcoming expiration of both the aviation excise taxes and the authority to make expenditures from the Aviation Trust Fund. 
   These current and upcoming lapses in FAA's authorities have occurred despite repeated efforts by the House to pass legislation to extend them. The House has acted on three separate occasions to extend the authorization for FAA programs. On September 20, 2007, the House passed H.R. 2881, the ``FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007,'' to reauthorize FAA programs for fiscal years 2008-2011. On September 24, 2007, the House passed H.R. 3540, the ``Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2007'' to provide a short-term extension of FAA programs. On November 6, 2007, the House amended and passed S. 2265, in a subsequent attempt to provide a short-term extension of FAA programs. The Senate has yet to act on any of these bills, or on any other FAA reauthorization legislation. 
   As I supported each of these prior attempts to extend FAA's programs and financing, I again support the legislation before us today. 
   I strongly support the extension of the aviation excise taxes, as proposed in H.R. 5270. These taxes are necessary to support the Aviation Trust Fund, which in recent years has provided about 80 percent of the FAA's budget. With an uncommitted cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion, any lapse in the aviation taxes could put the solvency of the Trust Fund at risk.  
   In addition to extending the aviation taxes, a second key provision of H.R. 5270 is the extension of the FAA's authority to make expenditures from the Trust Fund. Without this authority, the FAA will face a partial shut-down beginning March 1st, as it will be unable to pay approximately 4,000 of its employees. 
   The third key provision of H.R. 5270 is that it provides $2.76 billion in contract authority for the AIP. Because the previous FAA authorization act, Vision 100, expired on September 30, 2007, there is currently no contract authority in place for the AIP in FY 2008, and no new airport grants can be made. It is our intent that the full $2.76 billion provided by H.R. 5270 be made available, without regard to any previously enacted rescission. 
   It is imperative that we reinstate the AIP program immediately. Unless we do so, we will lose the Spring construction season, and will not be able to do much construction this year, even if the program is reauthorized at a later date. 
   According to the FAA, a continued lapse in AIP funding will affect important safety and capacity projects, including runway safety area projects, letter of intent disbursements, runway safety action team projects, enhanced taxiway and centerline marking projects, and aircraft rescue, firefighting and snow removal equipment. We must act now to extend this important program. 
   H.R. 5270 also extends several other provisions of Vision 100 so that, until a long-term FAA reauthorization bill is enacted, aviation programs may be continued under the same terms and conditions as were in effect during the previous authorization period. 
   But this is only the first step. We need to enact a long-term FAA reauthorization bill, which will permit us to go forward on modernization of the air traffic control system, and improvement of our airports, to combat the ever-increasing inadequacies of the current system. Last year, our aviation system had the worst delay record in its history. With the number of air travelers predicted to surpass 1 billion per year by the year 2015, the system is rapidly approaching gridlock. I strongly urge the other body to bring their reauthorization bill to the floor, so we can go to conference and pass a long-term reauthorization of aviation programs. 
   I thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery of the Committee on Ways and Means for working with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to include the aviation authorization provisions in H.R. 5270. I also thank my Committee colleagues, Ranking Member Mica, Subcommittee Chairman Costello, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Petri, for working with me on this critical legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5270.

   Yet, too often, capital investments are shortchanged due to a more immediate need to finance day-to-day operations. 
   This budget does not make that mistake. Rather, it assumes full funding for programs financed by the Highway and Aviation Trust Funds. These programs are funded by highway and aviation system users and do not contribute to the deficit. 
   Specifically, the proposed budget fully funds highway, transit, and highway safety programs at the levels guaranteed by the surface transportation reauthorization act, commonly known as SAFETEA-LU. It rejects the Administration's proposal to cut highway and transit funding below the guaranteed levels by $631 million and $309 million, respectively. 
   The Administration's proposal to cut transit funding was particularly ill-advised. The Administration proposed that Capital Investment Grants receive $1.4 billion, compared to $1.7 billion authorized by SAFETEA-LU. Of the $1.4 billion requested for Capital Investment Grants, the Administration proposed to fund 11 existing Full Funding Grant Agreements, seven projects that are currently in final design, and three other projects currently in preliminary engineering. However, the Administration's request ignores the significant pipeline of new start projects seeking funding, including 11 projects that are currently in preliminary engineering, as well as another eight projects that are very close to approval to enter preliminary engineering. 
   Furthermore, within the $300 million reduction in Capital Investment Grants proposed by the Administration, $100 million was to have come from the small starts program. The small starts program is authorized in SAFETEA-LU to receive $200 million in fiscal year 2008. The Administration proposed to provide just $100 million, to fund four small start projects. There are, however, at least 11 other small start projects around the country which may be ready for project development approval in fiscal year 2007. 
   Given that traffic congestion has become a major national problem costing motorists more than $63 billion in wasted time and fuel each year, the Administration's proposal to cut funding for transit investments is just plain wrong, and I am pleased it is not included in the Concurrent Resolution before us today. 
   Beyond highways and transit, the Concurrent Resolution lays the groundwork for reauthorization of Federal Aviation Administration programs by allocating the full amounts recommended by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). As requested in the Committee's Views and Estimates, the proposed budget provides an allocation for AIP of $3.8 billion in FY 2008, $3.9 billion in FY 2009, $4.0 billion in FY 2010, and $4.1 billion in FY 2011. In contrast to the Administration's proposal to cut AIP funding to $2.75 billion in FY 2008, the increased funding levels provided by this Resolution will allow the AIP program to keep pace with inflationary cost increases, and begin to address the investment gap in airport safety and capacity needs. 
   I commend Chairman SPRATT for bringing this Resolution to the Floor, and look forward to working with him on continued improvements to our nation's infrastructure. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 99.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 335, authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for a celebration of the 100th anniversary of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. I am pleased to support this resolution and recognize the contributions that the Alpha Kappa  Alpha Sorority has made to strengthening networks that cut across racial, geographical, political, and social barriers. This event is a fitting tribute to the organization and I congratulate the sorority on its 100th anniversary. 
   The commitment of Alpha Kappa Alpha members to public service is long and legendary. The sorority has evolved over its 100-year history from a college-based organization in support of young women in their intellectual and cultural development to an organization that dedicates itself to a variety of humanitarian programs. 
   These programs include the Mississippi Health Project, the Educational Advancement Foundation, and the IVY AKAdemy. The IVY AKAdemy program promotes early learning and mastery of basic reading skills, enhances the school experience of children and young people through hundreds of local programs around the country and in South Africa. For members of AKA, community service and sisterhood are life-long commitments. Many members of Alpha Kappa Alpha stay active in the organization for more than 50 years. 
   It is fitting that the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority celebrates its 100th anniversary here on Capitol Hill. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to H. Con. Res. 335.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3712, a bill to designate the U.S. courthouse located at 1716 Spielbusch Avenue in Toledo, Ohio, as the ``James M. Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley United States Courthouse.'' This bill was introduced by the gentlewoman from Ohio, Ms. KAPTUR, to honor two members of the Ashley family, James M. Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley. 
   The Ashley family has a distinguished record in public service dating back to the mid 1800s. Various members of this family have served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1858. 
   James Monroe Ashley, 1824-1896, served five terms as a Representative from Ohio. During the American Civil War, Congressman Ashley was the first Representative to call for an amendment to the United States Constitution to outlaw slavery. The amendment he sponsored served as the antecedent to the thirteenth amendment of the Constitution, which abolished slavery. 
   Thomas William Ludlow Ashley is the great-grandson of former Governor and Congressman, James M. Ashley. In 1954, Thomas William Ludlow Ashley was elected to Congress served a total of 13 terms in Congress. While in Congress, Representative ``Lud'' Ashley served as chairman of the Select Committee on Energy and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. In 1977, Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill established a Select Committee on Energy and appointed Congressman  Ashley to chair the Committee, which compiled energy legislation based on bills reported by several House committees in response to President Jimmy Carter's legislative proposal. 
   This bill is a fitting tribute to two distinguished public servants.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5599, a bill to designate the Federal building located at 4600 Silver Hill Road in Suitland, Maryland, as the ``Thomas Jefferson Census Bureau Headquarters Building''. 
   The United States census is a count of the Nation's population, conducted every 10 years. The results are used for various purposes, including allocation of congressional seats and impacting Government program funding for States and localities. The U.S. Census Bureau is responsible for conducting the census and serves ``as the leading source of quality data about the Nation's people and economy,'' according to its mission. 
   The census is our Nation's longest continuous scientific project. In 1790, while Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson conducted the first official count of the Nation's population. Census Day was August 2, 1790. The national census has several colonial predecessors with eight of the original 13 colonies having conducted their own census. 
   President Jefferson not only was one of our Founding Fathers and the third President of the United States, but he was also an early demographer. 
   Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we designate this Federal building as the ``Thomas Jefferson Census Bureau Headquarters Building''.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I compliment Chairman Thompson on the superb work he has done as Chair of the Committee on Homeland Security. He is the right man at the right time in the right place. He has approached his responsibility with great sincerity and focus of purpose. He has accomplished a great deal, an enormous amount in his first year as chairman. He has defended the House position on the Homeland Security 9/11 Commission Report to the best of his ability against a rather obstructive other body. 
   I had great reservations about creating a Department of Homeland Security at its very outset. I opposed formation of the Department in 2002 on operational grounds. Four years later, I still question the Department's effectiveness in managing the responsibilities we have handed to it. 
   On signing the Homeland Security Act in 2002, the President said, ``Our objective is to spend less on overhead and more on protecting neighborhoods and borders and waters and skies from terrorists.'' 
   In at least one respect, this bill doesn't meet that objective. The conference report authorizes new rail, public transportation, and over-the-road bus security grant programs that will provide historically high levels of funding for those modes of transportation. I am for that. I support those needed investments. 
   But in the House bill, we recognize that the most efficient way to administer these programs and get the money out to the recipients was to have the Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security share those responsibilities. 
   The Department of Homeland Security in the House bill was to award grant funds based on risk and select grant recipients and then transfer those funds to DOT, which through the Federal Transit Administration administers $9 billion a year efficiently and effectively on time to transit agencies to disburse those grants with its already effective, award-winning distribution program. 
   Instead, in the conference, we met with nothing but obstruction from the other body. I offered several fair and sensible compromises: have the Government Accountability Office review the existing grant distribution programs of the two Departments and make recommendations; have the Inspectors General of the two Departments jointly certify that DHS was ready to distribute grant funds efficiently; and monitor and enforce the various grant certifications, including labor protections. That was rejected, as the previous was rejected. I offered for DOT to distribute the grant funds in the early years of the program to allow DHS to get up to speed and get an efficient program running. That was summarily rejected. 
   Now we are going to have the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation getting together and signing a memorandum of understanding. That is not going to work. This is a great mistake. It is misguided and works contrary to the best purpose of this Department.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (ESTABLISHING NATIONAL TUNNEL INSPECTION STANDARDS -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 409, to amend title 23 of the United States Code, to ensure the safety of the traveling public by establishing a national program to inspect highway tunnels, modeled after the National Bridge Inspection Program. 
   I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Capuano, for introducing this important piece of legislation that will address the absence of comprehensive inspections standards for our Nation's highway tunnels. 
   Madam Speaker, recent tragic events have highlighted the very real crisis facing our Nation's transportation infrastructure. America's transportation network is aging and increasingly in need of maintenance or reconstruction. Many facilities are being stretched to the limit of their design life and beyond. 
   The tragic collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge in my home State illustrated the deteriorating conditions of our bridges and the need for routine inspections. Similarly, another tragedy in Massachusetts has shown that we must do the same for highway tunnels. 
   On Monday, July 10, 2006, at approximately 11 p.m., a section of the suspended concrete ceiling above the eastbound lanes of the Interstate 90 connector tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, fell onto a vehicle traveling to Logan International Airport. A passenger, riding in the right front seat of the vehicle, was killed. The driver escaped with minor injuries. 
   The National Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, immediately launched an investigation into the cause of the ceiling panel collapse. 
   On July 10, 2007, the NTSB issued its accident report, identifying the failure of the epoxy adhesive used to attach the panels to the anchors in the ceiling to sustain long-term loads as the probable cause of the accident. 
   The NTSB report observed that had the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority inspected the area above the suspended ceilings at regular intervals, the anchor creep that led to this accident would likely have been detected, and this tragedy could have been prevented. 
   The NTSB report also found that the Federal Highway Administration, FHWA, lacked the regulatory authority to conduct tunnel inspections, and recommended that the FHWA seek legislation authorizing the agency to establish a mandatory tunnel inspection program similar to the National Bridge Inspection Program. 
   H.R. 409 will fulfill the NTSB recommendation, and establish a national program to inspect highway tunnels. 
   Under this legislation, the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with State departments of transportation, private organizations and individuals, is required to establish national tunnel inspection standards for safety inspections and evaluations of all public highway tunnels. 
   This bill also establishes criteria for certification and training of tunnel inspectors, and requires States to prepare and maintain an inventory of public highway tunnels. 
   FHWA has already begun to develop a tunnel inspection regime modeled after the bridge inspection program. This regime must account for the inherent differences between bridges and tunnels. Working in conjunction with the Federal Transit Administration, the agency has published highway and rail transit tunnel inspection manuals. 
   FHWA has also begun the process of working with State departments of transportation, highway tunnel owners, and other stakeholders to develop National Tunnel Inspection Standards and establish minimum training and qualification requirements for inspectors. 
   These are important steps, but the passage of this legislation will ensure that FHWA has the resources necessary to develop and implement comprehensive tunnel inspection standards and training. 
   I thank the gentleman from Florida, Ranking Member MICA, and his staff for working with us to ensure that this legislation accomplished its goal of increasing tunnel safety without inadvertently diverting resources from bridge inspections. 
   Madam Speaker, while we cannot undo the damage caused by this accident, we can, and we must, take the necessary actions to prevent future tunnel collapses. H.R. 409 establishes a framework to address the serious safety concerns raised by the NTSB, and ensures that tragedies like that of July 10, 2006, will never occur again. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in strongly supporting H.R. 409.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 772, to congratulate American Highway Users Alliance on the occasion of its 75th anniversary. 
   The American Highway Users Alliance (``Highway Users'') has changed its name several times over 75 years. The group was  founded in 1932 as the National Highway Users Conference. In 1970, the group merged with the Automotive Safety Foundation and was renamed the Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mobility. In 1995, the organization took on its current name. 
   Yet no matter what the group was called, Highway Users has always been a persistent and outspoken proponent for adequate funding and oversight of the Nation's highway infrastructure, and a diligent voice for the interests of the public. 
   Highway Users has voiced the interests of motorists and businesses on all major national highway and traffic safety legislation over the past 75 years, including strong support of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized the Interstate Highway System and established the Highway Trust Fund. 
   Highway Users has worked tirelessly over the past 75 years to protect the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund and State highway trust funds. 
   The organization has conducted crucial research documenting the promise and potential of modern United States highways in improving safety, facilitating emergency evacuations, and growing the national economy. 
   The American Highway Users Alliance has also been a consistent advocate in favor of strengthening the national highway network by promoting a strong Federal role in mobility and safety and by advocating policies that benefit all highway users. 
   For these and other contributions to our daily lives, our economic well-being, and our health and safety, I rise to recognize the outstanding achievements of the American Highway Users Alliance and its sustained contribution in service to our Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and join me in commemorating the 75th anniversary of the American Highway Users Alliance.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 866, which recognizes the brave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard for their tireless work and dedication in guarding our coasts and securing our borders since 1790. I thank the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble), a former Coastguardsman, for introducing this resolution. 
   Last year was particularly noteworthy for the Coast Guard's drug interdiction efforts. In 2007, the Coast Guard seized more than 350,000 pounds of cocaine, far surpassing all previous Coast Guard records. This seizure had a street value of over $4.7 billion, which equates to almost 50 percent of the Coast Guard's budget. 
   Throughout its history, the Coast Guard has protected the nation from piracy, rum runners, and illegal drug and migrant smugglers. The Coast Guard's first documented opium seizure was in 1890, by the Revenue Cutter Wolcott. In 1921, the Coast Guard Cutter Seneca seized 1,500 cases of liquor from a rum running schooner off the coast of New Jersey. 
   Due to the Coast Guard's aggressive drug interdiction pursuits, the supply of cocaine has been greatly reduced in more than 35 major U.S. cities. This has made a significant difference in the lives of American citizens. 
   The Coast Guard has established interagency and international partnerships which have contributed to its success. The United States negotiated bilateral agreements with 26 Caribbean and South American nations to allow the Coast Guard to stop illegal smuggling and conduct operations far outside the United States territorial seas. 
   Through these partnerships and more effective tools and tactics, the Coast Guard seized 2 million pounds of cocaine in the past 10 years. In March 2007, the Coast Guard made its largest maritime cocaine seizure in history when it intercepted and seized a Panamanian vessel carrying approximately 20 tons of the dangerous narcotic. 
   I commend the brave men and women of the Coast Guard for their selfless service and dedication to Nation and the American people. They work tirelessly to fulfill the numerous missions of the service, from search and rescue and environmental protection to maritime law enforcement and homeland security. We can live each day in solace knowing that the Coast Guard is on watch. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in strongly supporting H. Res. 866.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBERSTAR. (HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA RECOVERY FACILITATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3247, the ``Katrina and Rita Recovery Facilitation Act of 2007'', as amended. This bipartisan bill addresses lingering issues that continue to hinder the recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The changes in this bill are both necessary and long overdue. 
   Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005, and proved to be the costliest natural disaster in American history. The storm had a massive physical impact on the land, affecting 90,000 square miles, which is an area the size of Great Britain. More than 80 percent of the City of New Orleans flooded, an area comparable to seven times the size of Manhattan. 
   Although more than two years have elapsed since Katrina and Rita, significant problems still exist in the recovery effort. This disaster and its aftermath have revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (``FEMA'') may need additional authorities to deal effectively with catastrophes of such magnitude. 
   H.R. 3247 provides additional relief for problems associated with recovery efforts from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, by authorizing retroactive changes to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``Stafford Act'') programs. The Stafford Act authorizes disaster assistance that FEMA provides after a major disaster. While the authority of the Stafford Act is very broad and flexible, it does not anticipate every circumstance that can arise in disasters, especially catastrophic disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
   Historically, when catastrophic or unusual disasters struck, Congress would work cooperatively with FEMA to identify areas where FEMA required additional specific authority. When Hurricane Katrina struck, FEMA was not a flexible or independent government agency. Rather, FEMA was an organization within the Department of Homeland Security, a larger bureaucracy, and without direct access to the President and Congress. I believe that this structure prevented FEMA from engaging with Congress as they have in the past. This problem was further magnified by the unprecedented scope and magnitude of the disaster. As a result, Congress was forced to act in a unilateral manner. 
   H.R. 3247 was developed in a bipartisan fashion, and draws on the recommendations of Members representing the Gulf Coast region from both sides of the aisle. The provisions in this bill were developed following a hearing held by the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management on May 10, 2007, entitled ``Legislative Fixes for Lingering Problems that Hinder Katrina Recovery''. At that hearing, Members from Louisiana and Mississippi testified on specific issues that are still hampering the recovery from these devastating catastrophes and proposed solutions. The provisions of this bill reflect the findings and recommendations that were presented at this hearing. 
   Specifically, H.R. 3247, the ``Hurricanes Katrina and Rita Recovery Facilitation Act of 2007'', increases the Federal share from 75 percent to 90 percent for ``alternate projects'' for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, to allow money designated for a specific facility to be used toward another facility for the same purposes. This provision will help communities, which have had multiple facilities destroyed by these hurricanes, rebuild facilities and reestablish services in a manner that will best suit their needs. 
   The bill also permits the Administrator of FEMA to make public assistance programs under Hurricanes Katrina and Rita eligible under a public assistance pilot program authorized in section 689j of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (P.L. 109-295), which will expedite the provision of assistance to States. 
   This legislation further encourages alternative dispute resolution procedures for appeals of public assistance decisions by FEMA  for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, to address concerns over the speed of implementation of the public assistance program in the Gulf Coast. The bill allows the use of temporary housing units for volunteers, authorizes reimbursement of expenses incurred for the re-interment of human remains at privately-owned or private non-profit cemeteries, and authorizes the reimbursement of certain facilities that housed evacuees after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
   The bill also allows in-kind projects initiated in the recovery efforts after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to contribute the non-Federal share in a Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (``HMGP'') application, if FEMA can determine that the project meets all eligibility and compliance requirements that apply to HMGP projects. This provision simply waives the requirement for pre-approval of a project. 
   Madam Speaker, each of the provisions in H.R. 3247 is specifically tailored to solve an existing problem in the Gulf Coast, and will help provide immediate relief to those still suffering in the wake of these disasters. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3247.  
   MS. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2728, a bill to designate the border station of the United States Border Patrol located at 25762 Madison Avenue in Murrieta, California, as the ``Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak Border Patrol Station''. 
   On June 17, 1967, United States Border Patrol Inspectors Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak were killed in the line of duty while working the late-night shift at a checkpoint along the U.S.-Mexico border. While examining a vehicle intercepted for suspected drug smuggling, the two inspectors were kidnapped and later killed. 
   As a result of the tragic deaths of these two men, the U.S. Border Patrol now requires that a minimum of three to five agents work each checkpoint, depending on a variety of factors, along with a back-up unit. In addition to this requirement for increased manpower, the Border Patrol has also enhanced the training and support that all Border Patrol agents receive. 
   In honor of these two inspectors, the Border Patrol annually bestows upon its bravest agents the Newton-Azrak Award. Eligibility for  the award is based on the demonstration of unusual courage in the line of duty or a heroic or humane act during times of extreme stress or in an emergency. In addition, the National Border Patrol Museum in El Paso, Texas, has a permanent memorial display in honor of Inspectors Newton and Azrak. 
   Designating the United States Border Patrol Station in southern California as the ``Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak Border Patrol Station'' is a fitting tribute to honor the bravery and service of these men. Their valor has served as an inspiration for a generation of Border Patrol agents that have followed them in service to their country.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2671, a bill to designate the Federal courthouse located at 301 North Miami Avenue, Miami, in the Southern District of Florida as the ``C. Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse''. 
   Judge C. Clyde Atkins was born on November 23, 1914, in Washington, DC. He graduated from the University of Florida College of Law in 1936. He practiced law as a partner in the law firm of Walton, Lantaff, Shroeder, Atkins, Carson, and Wahl for more than 25 years, from 1941 to 1966. 
   In 1966, judge Atkins was appointed to the District Court in the Southern District of Florida by President Lyndon B. Johnson. He served first as a district judge, then as chief judge, and eventually as a senior judge. During his time on the Federal bench, Judge Atkins presided over a number of landmark cases, including the unprecedented desegregation of Dade County schools in 1969. In 1970, he presided over an important environmental case and ruled that there was a public interest in protecting wildlife from discharge from a nuclear plant into Biscayne Bay. Judge Atkins found the City of Miami guilty of a pattern of harassment of the City's homeless population and showed great courage in overturning Federal policies that required the repatriation of Haitian and Cuban refugees at Guantanamo Bay. 
   Judge Atkins often made these rulings with little fanfare but always with a deep, abiding respect for the rule of law and equality. He was respected because of his application of the law without respect to race, creed, religion, or national origin. 
   He was also very active in the Catholic Church, and he was named a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope Paul VI. 
   Judge Atkins died in 1999 at the age of 84.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3224, as amended, a bill to further enhance the safety of and bring to a state of good repair our Nation's aging dam infrastructure. This important bill has broad bipartisan support. 
   I commend the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Salazar) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Kuhl) for introducing this legislation and for their strong support. I would also like to thank Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton for her leadership and for diligently guiding the work of the Subcommittee on the issue of dam safety and rehabilitation. 
   During a May 8, 2007 hearing, the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management received compelling testimony about the need to rehabilitate our Nation's dams. The statements of witnesses reinforced some troubling statistics. There are approximately 80,000 dams in the United States; of these, approximately 10,000 dams are considered to have high-hazard potential, meaning their failure could result in loss of life or severe property damage. From 2000 to 2006, the number of high-hazard dams increased by almost 20 percent. 
   Further, States have identified approximately 3,400 dams as currently deficient or unsafe. These dams have been identified as having hydrologic or structural deficiencies that make them susceptible to failure triggered by a storm, an earthquake, progressive deterioration, or inadequate maintenance. 
   Since 1972, Congress has helped to mitigate the risk of dam failure by establishing a program to provide technical and financial assistance to States for dam safety. Through the National Dam Safety Program, the Federal government has helped to increase the level of knowledge and preparedness to prevent and mitigate the effects of dam failures across the country. Dam safety inspections have increased significantly and greater direct assistance has been provided for training State officials and providing technical seminars and workshops. 
   H.R. 3224 builds on this successful program and authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (``FEMA'') to provide grants for the rehabilitation and repair of publicly-owned dams. States must provide at least 35 percent of the funds necessary to rehabilitate a dam. While all States are eligible to apply, grants will be distributed after prioritization by the Administrator, along with the National Dam Safety Review Board, of all applications, based on degree of deficiency. 
   The bill is a necessary step in the right direction to upgrade our Nation's aging dam infrastructure. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3224.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the distinguished gentleman from the Committee on Ways and Means, whom we all admire and revere for his civil rights leadership. And we're delighted that he is bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   I certainly appreciate the fiscal concern expressed by the distinguished  gentleman from Louisiana, Madam Speaker. He's right in this sense, that we have a long-term problem in the highway trust fund. And we're going to address that issue next year in the authorization of the Surface Transportation bill that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will bring through committee and to the House floor in good order, well before the expiration date of the current law. But meanwhile, there is a short-term problem. 
   In 1998, when I think everybody I see on the floor who was serving in the House at that time, voted for what we affectionately know as TEA-21, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, to put firewalls around the highway trust fund to ensure that those revenues would be invested in transportation and not held back in reserve to make deficits look smaller, as had been done from the time of President Lyndon Johnson in 1968 to 1998. 
   As part of the agreement worked out by then chairman of our committee, Bud Shuster, with House Republican leadership, the Speaker, the Appropriations Committee, the Budget Committee, and on our side with the Clinton administration, we agreed to give up $29 billion of surplus in the highway trust fund for long-term debt reduction and short-term deficit reduction, and also to give up interest paid on revenues deposited in the highway trust fund from the collections every 3 months--as is the practice--it would give that interest up as well. Eight billion dollars was transferred to make the deficit look smaller, and the rest went to long-term debt reduction. 
   At the time, we had not only a balanced budget, but a budget in surplus. The prospects for the economy were shining. It was a rising economy. There were revenues galloping into the highway trust fund. But the economy has taken a bad turn. It has taken a bad turn on the backs of the cornerstone of the highway trust fund, which is the highway user fee. And for the first time since 1956, the establishment of the highway trust fund and the Interstate Highway Program, we have seen a decline in----

   Mr. OBERSTAR. We have seen a decline in vehicle miles traveled. And that has meant a leveling off of revenues into the highway trust fund. 
   We need this temporary adjustment to prevent a longer term shortfall in the highway trust in which the Association of Highway and State Transportation Officials said could be a $14 billion cut in Federal highway funding in the next year. 
   Now, we already have 8.2 percent unemployment in the building trades, 785,000 construction workers are out of work today. If you think the housing situation is bad, this will be worse if we have a huge hole in the highway trust fund. 
   I assure my very sincere and genuine colleague from Louisiana, who has been a very fiscally responsible person, that this is a long-term, fiscally responsible action that we're taking here to close the hole in the highway trust fund, give us a little breathing space until next year, and come back with a longer term solution.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, on August 1 of last year, I was at this microphone managing the conference report, with our colleague, Mr. Mica from Florida, ranking member on the committee, the conference report on the Water Resources Development Act when my BlackBerry buzzed. I looked to see what message was coming in, and I saw an announcement that a bridge had collapsed and there was an ``M'' alongside it. I thought, a Third World country? Then I looked closer. That M was Minnesota. That bridge was I-35W. It carries, or had carried, an average of 140,000 vehicles a day. Thirteen people were victims, 88 to 100 other people were injured, a dramatic collapse. 
   Twenty years ago, on December 1, 1987, 20 years ago, I opened hearings as Chair of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight on Bridge Safety. I said, ``There are an estimated 376,000 bridges ..... of that number, 217,000 are Federal-aid Interstate, primary, secondary and urban bridges. 
   ``They carry 85 percent of the Nation's traffic, yet 76,000 of these bridges are deficient and that number has been gradually increasing over the last four years.'' 
   That was 20 years ago. Today, we have 153,000 structurally and functionally deficient bridges.  
   ``We know there are elements of bridge design of particular concern to bridge inspectors; that is, bridges without redundant members to prevent a tragic collapse if that one critical member should fail.'' 
   I-35W was one of those fracture critical bridges. One essential element failed. The whole bridge could collapse and it did. There were multiple causes, and we await the determination of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
   I said further, ``We have to ensure that inspection personnel are keenly aware of the problems involved with bridges whose supporting members are set in the floor of the body of water as compared to those that are set up on pilings driven into the subsoil and deeper.'' 
   We're hoping in these hearings ``to find out how many of these types of bridges are in the Nation's bridge inventory. Right now that information appears to be scarce and perhaps in many States not maintained at all.'' 
   A key witness at that hearing, professor of bridge engineering Dr. Gerald Donaldson, said that in his estimation, ``Bridge maintenance was in the Stone Age. We have no good, logical way of selecting the proper bridges to repair, rehabilitate or replace other than our memory and manual review. 
   ``Most States have virtually no bridge maintenance programs with specific, qualified maintenance goals; no documented maintenance processes; no rationally planned aggressive strategies to arrest or slow bridge deterioration. Many States address maintenance deficiencies on an ad hoc basis.'' 
   He said, ``There are many States out there who are not even using the easily available technology'' to assess bridge conditions. 
   ``In terms of more sophisticated technology, many of the States basically are only dimly aware of what that technology is.'' 
   Well, I can say that in 20 years, not much has changed. Despite efforts to increase funding for bridge inspection, bridge safety, personnel, train those personnel better, train Federal and State inspectors to higher standards over the last 20 years, we have failed, and a bridge failed. 
   We bring to the House floor today legislation that will put the Nation on the right track to raising the standards by which we build bridges in the first place, raising the standards by which we determine which bridges are structurally deficient and which among those are the most critical bridges to repair and a categorizing and prioritizing of those bridges to increase the standards by which we train bridge inspectors at the Federal and State level and increase the funding for States and the Federal Government to hire the necessary number of bridge inspectors to raise the standards, make those bridges safer, prevent future loss and future collapse as happened in Minnesota.     
   This legislation will move us in that direction. There may be some little differences about the structure of this proposal, but we in the committee are agreed on the path, on the direction, on the goal, on the objectives. 
   The funding issues we will address next year in the surface transportation authorization bill. For now, we need to put in place this structure raising the standards by which we determine structural deficiency of bridges, categorizing them, establishing a yardstick of measurement, having it vetted by the National Academy of Sciences so that we have an absolutely transparent and reliable means of determining the prioritization for investment in and addressing the needs of structurally deficient bridges. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Those are valid concerns. 
   First of all, on the bridge inspection standards, the Federal Highway Administration is directed by the legislation to raise the standards. They will do this in consultation with the States. Pennsylvania is recognized as having very high standards for its bridge inspectors, and the country can benefit from Pennsylvania in that process. So Pennsylvania will be one of the leaders. 
   Secondly, the matter of transfer of funds, of flexibility, we, for years, when we first established the bridge category, gave States flexibility to transfer funds out of that account up to 50 percent. In the SAFETEA legislation, SAFETEA-LU current law, the language was further refined to distribute funds on a needs basis. If that formula is wrong, if that's the wrong way to do it, then we will correct it in the next legislation. This legislation deals only with current law. And that needs formula is based on the question to be determined by each State, in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration, on how much it costs to maintain, to replace bridges in a State, and then, under those factors, the allocation is made by the Federal Highway Administration to the States. 
   Maybe we need to change that altogether in the next legislation. I'm only dealing with current law, again, in this bill. And since we have seen in my State, Minnesota, they transferred 49 percent of their money--just to the limit of the law--out of the bridge account to other purposes, and then said, when the bridge collapsed, that, oh, well, there was so much money spent on bicycle paths, we didn't have money for bridges. They transferred the money out. They made the decision to do that. We're saying in this legislation, fix your bridge, your most critical bridge issues first. Certify you've done that. Then you can transfer those remaining dollars out elsewhere. But I think we want accountability for the States. 
   Now, the gentleman from Tennessee raised a very important issue--if the gentleman would continue to yield--about this category for bridges. Another issue for consideration next year is whether we should have a bridge category at all. That's something we can make a determination on. Maybe we shouldn't have this at all. Maybe we should just simply have a bridge inspection program and require States to act on the results of their own bridge inspections made to these new higher standards and verified by the National Academy of Sciences. 
   And I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   We ought to revisit the needs formula in the upcoming legislation for the new authorization and revamp, if necessary, that needs-based formula so that it more equitably reflects the needs of the States and their commitment to and actions taken on maintenance replacement of their bridges on the national highway system.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   Here is, in the well of the House, a chart listing the status of the structurally deficient bridges eligible for replacement State by State. We also have a smaller document at the committee table that Members can take with them. But this shows 589 bridges on the interstate system and 2,067 bridges overall on the national highway system that are in the structurally deficient category, eligible for replacement, and that is the standard by which we, in this legislation, determine whether a State qualifies for moving money out of its bridge account. We're just saying, once you have determined that you have structurally deficient bridges, fix them first, and we're saying just those that need to be replaced, not those that just need adjustments, but those that need to be replaced, do that first, then transfer money out of your bridge account. 
   States have transferred the money out of their bridge account, as I said earlier, and the State of Minnesota didn't address their bridge needs, and then the bridge collapsed. And they're looking for a handout. Well, if we're going to continue in the future with a category for bridge maintenance and replacement, then this is the standard we should have. We can make the determination in the next legislation. 
   I will rely heavily on the gentleman from Tennessee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), Chair of the Surface Subcommittee, who has one of the most severe bridge problems on Interstate 5 in the State of Oregon, on whether we should continue with the idea of a category for bridge funding. If we do, then we have to have better standards by which bridges are built, maintained and inspected. And this legislation puts us on course toward that goal. 
   Now I want to show what has happened. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) cited the speed with which the State of Minnesota has responded in rebuilding the bridge. These two photographs show the bridge replacement in two phases, the top portion showing where it was just about 3 weeks ago, and the bottom portion with only 2 1/2 feet separating the two segments, the north and south segments of the bridge. I was on that bridge on Sunday afternoon, observed the extraordinary work, the speed with which the bridge was constructed. 
   This is the way we should build bridges for the future, with sensors embedded in the structure itself, sensors that tell the temperature of the bridge, the coefficient of expansion and contraction. The wind velocity pressures on the bridge will be detected by sensors in that structure. There are also long-in-use rollers on the bridge so they can move north and south, expansion and contraction, but much higher quality than ever before built into those rollers. There is also an ice detection system operated by temperature, so that before freezing conditions are encountered, de-icing may be sprayed onto the bridge structure to prevent icing conditions. These are highly advanced technology systems that have not been built into bridges previously, and as many sensors as are going into this bridge, there are also sensors that detect minute cracks that can develop in a bridge and alert bridge engineers before something serious happens. That is the kind of quality that we need to build into future bridge construction and maintenance and replacement. 
   Now the questions that have been raised about the transferability, frankly, I am really troubled that in the last 5 years, States have transferred $5 billion out of their bridge account and then turn around and complain that they don't have flexibility. We give them flexibility to transfer up to 50 percent of their bridge account into other programs. But then they turn around and complain that this legislation will restrain their flexibility. I'm saying, as long as we have this bridge category, as long as there is a definition of structural deficiency, that States should address those structure deficiency issues, those structurally deficient bridges and if they are candidates for replacement, replace them. Use your bridge formula funds to replace those bridges. And then when you have done that and certified to the Federal Highway Administration you have addressed this, then you can transfer those funds elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   There is no limitation on the flexibility of States to use their bridge formula funds so long as they comply with one issue, and that is, certify that where you have structurally deficient  bridges that are on the national highway system that should be replaced that you have addressed the replacement issue. 
   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has the highest number of structurally deficient bridges in the Nation. Yet they transferred $2.2 billion of their Federal highway bridge funds out of that program into other needs of the State. Well, over that same period of time, since 2003, they transferred those dollars, and the number of structurally deficient bridges in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania increased by 500. You can't have it both ways, I'm saying. We have a category for bridge construction, maintenance and replacement, and if you transfer money out of it, then you can't complain that you don't have flexibility. You can't complain that a bridge fell down because there are other needs. Address those needs first. 
   The highway bridge program represents about 11 percent of the overall funding level of the current law, SAFETEA-LU, but as the Office of Management and Budget has issued rescission orders cutting funds from the overall surface transportation program, $3.4 billion in rescission of contract authority have come out of the bridge program.     
   So States are victimizing their bridge formula program when the rescissions come. Now maybe we should make the whole thing a block grant program and not have categories. If we do, then States will have all the authority they need to shift dollars around. 
   But I think that over the years, successive Congresses in the 50 years of the interstate highway system and the highway trust fund have concurred in the categories of funding. They serve a useful purpose, and we should maintain those categories, and make some adjustments in them. I think we should revisit the needs formula as the gentleman from Tennessee has suggested, and other Members have suggested. We should perhaps rewrite the entire needs formula. But that is a matter for next year, not in this bill. 
   I thought we should have a down payment of a billion dollars to get States started on addressing their structurally deficient bridge problem and expand that funding next year when we get into the authorization period. For the moment, I think this legislation represents what we can do and should be doing in the short term to set the stage for a longer-haul revision of the bridge program. 
   Again I compliment the State of Minnesota Department of Transportation for moving ahead so vigorously on I-35W and leaving a great legacy for the future. 
   I also once again express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) the chairman of our Surface Subcommittee, and the gentleman from Tennessee, the ranking member on the subcommittee, and my good friend and partner, the ranking member on the committee, Mr. Mica, for participating and for their thoughtful observations about the legislation before us, for the many suggestions that we have incorporated, and look forward to continuing this work as we move towards the reauthorization next year.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The amendment makes technical corrections to the bill. It clarifies that the Department of Transportation should consult with States when establishing a process for assigning risk-based priorities for bridge reconstruction and rehabilitation. We want to make sure that the Federal Government is consulting with, taking the best advice and best ideas from all of the States in crafting the risk-based program for evaluation of bridges. 
   The Federal Government should not be doing this on its own. Our intention from the very outset was that this should be a cooperative program as the Federal aid highway program always has been, and this language makes it very clear that the department must consult with the States. It defines complex bridges for purposes of addressing qualifications for managers and team leaders.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The gentleman's amendment is a very good one, and an important outcome to the endeavor to raise the standards to evaluate bridges and maintain bridges and replace bridges. I think it is important for us to adopt this amendment and to direct the Government Accountability Office to provide recommendations on how successful aspects of bridge-rating systems can be incorporated into the bridge-rating program and be a valuable asset for us next year as we go into the authorization process. 
   Bridge rating is a very complex process. It will be very useful for us to have GAO's input on better ways of rating bridges, ensuring that the traveling public has a complete understanding of the condition of the bridges on which they are traveling. This does not mean that we can define away the condition of bridges, but rather that we better understand the condition of bridges. 
   Under current Federal law, long-standing law, States are required to inspect all bridges longer than 20 feet at least once every 2 years and then to report those findings to the Federal Highway Administration. In the course of the inspection, conditions on various elements of the bridge are rated on a scale of zero, failure, to nine, excellent. ``Structurally deficient'' bridge means there are elements that need to be monitored or repaired or that the bridge entirely needs to be replaced. 
   Now this current rating system, as the gentleman from Florida said, when a bridge is rated structurally deficient doesn't mean it is going to fall down tomorrow or the next day, but that under various conditions it could well be unsafe. And if it is ultimately determined to be unsafe, that structure should be closed. We should have a rating system, but that rating system has not been evaluated in probably 25 years, certainly not since I held those hearings in 1987. 
   I think the amendment before us will put GAO on the course of doing that evaluation and giving us a better yardstick of measurement for determining various conditions of bridges. I look forward to the work to be done by GAO on both structural and functional deficiency rating systems for our Nation's bridges. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

In the course of consideration of legislation, we can't think of all the circumstances that legislation should cover; so it's useful and important for us to have Members such as Mr. Diaz-Balart to bring to the committee's attention unique circumstances in discrete regions of the country. 
   This amendment will add the consideration of public safety and availability of evacuation routes as further elements in consideration of the prioritization of bridges that are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. And we need look no further than the television pictures of the evacuation in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Rita and Wilma that flashed across our screen day and night to see the congestion and the confusion and the problems and even the question of whether one or another bridge that was on the screen could hold all those vehicles and all the people on those bridges. 
   The gentleman from Florida, whose State is in the path of nature's fury so often, brings to us a very valuable contribution and one that must be included. And I am delighted that we are able to accept this amendment, and I thank the gentleman for bringing it forth.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I too concur and I join the gentleman from Minnesota and the local government officials in a review of the Winona Bridge. 
   As the gentleman pointed out, Madam Chairman, it's such a terrible irony that we're highlighting this bridge on a stamp celebrating Minnesota's sesquicentennial and then the bridge is found to be deficient, so deficient that it had to be closed. 
   The gentleman's amendment requiring that a report within 15 days of a finding that results in closure of a bridge should also report on the economic impact and the effect on regional transportation, this will benefit all of America, not just Winona or the recent situation at Hastings in Minnesota close by. It will benefit all of America.  
   I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz). 
   This amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress, within 15 days of issuing a critical finding that results in the closure of a bridge, on the economic impact and effect on regional transportation that will result from the bridge closure. 
   This amendment also requires the Secretary to recommend solutions to mitigate such hardships. 
   The gentleman's district was recently hit with one such closure in the City of Winona. In early June, the Minnesota Department of Transportation ordered the closure of the Highway 43 bridge over the Mississippi River. 
   The closure was triggered when inspectors raised concerns about steel plates that help to hold the bridge together. One plate was so riddled with corrosion that an inspector's hammer went right through it. 
   The 2,289-foot-long bridge is the main artery between Winona, Minnesota, a town of about 30,000 people, and the Wisconsin communities of Fountain City and Arcadia. Roughly 11,600 vehicles crossed the bridge daily before it was closed. 
   Commuters to and from Winona are now burdened with a significant detour on their trip to work. To access the nearest river crossings at Wabasha and La Crosse, they have to drive an additional 60 to 70 miles each way, adding well over an hour to their commutes and forcing them to bear extreme financial burdens given the current skyrocketing price of gas. 
   To help mitigate this added inconvenience, the City of Winona has been forced to spend almost $85,000 a week to ferry commuters across the Mississippi River. Once across the river, shuttle buses and vans drive commuters to various points in the city. 
   Many businesses in Winona have also experienced economic difficulties as a result of the bridge closure and employers worry about their employees' ability to arrive at work on time. 
   We have seen similar hardships in St. Cloud and Duluth, Minnesota, where bridges were closed because of safety concerns. 
   The flow of goods and people on our nation's interconnected surface transportation system are greatly inconvenienced by disruption to bridges anywhere on the system. 
   This amendment ensures that we take the necessary steps to consider, at the Federal level, what can be done to minimize the economic impact of bridge closures on our nation's roadways. 
   To assist cities and States impacted by bridge closures, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The gentlewoman from Michigan has brought us a very important technical consideration for bridge construction. The idea of carbon fiber use in bridge construction is a novel but a very important one. 
   Carbon fiber technology has proven itself in the aircraft industry and manufacturing of critical parts of the fuselage or hull of aircraft, tail sections, the ailerons. 
   We have seen wide use of carbon fiber technology in the bicycle manufacturing. I have several of those carbon fiber bikes that are extraordinarily durable, flexible, but strong. 
   And the item that the gentlewoman showed the House Chamber a moment ago, I have seen firsthand as she demonstrated it in the committee and at the Rules Committee. I think this is a great suggestion. 
   Resistance to corrosion, avoiding costly repairs, longevity and strength all are great qualities. I am delighted the gentlewoman has brought this consideration to the bill that is before us. 
   And I would also point out that the bridge in Southfield, Michigan, Bridge Street Bridge was the first all carbon fiber reinforced bridge in the Nation. We ought to learn from this experience and adopt this amendment and apply the lessons of Michigan and of the gentlewoman from Michigan. 
   And we accept, of course the amendment. Having said all these good things about it, I must say we accept the amendment and are delighted she has brought it to us.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentleman from Texas for bringing this very, very valuable amendment to our attention and to the floor today. And we will accept this amendment. 
   Corrosion is the enemy of all structures. We saw that so repeatedly in aviation, where corrosion from condensation, moisture on the internal structure of hull and movable structures on aircraft are fatal. 
   We see every time we drive across the country, just looking under a bridge, you see the corrosion at work. It is the enemy of stability in our surface transportation system. 
   I showed a moment ago the work nearing completion on the replacement of the I-35W bridge. And exactly what the gentleman from Texas has said, Mr. Chairman, the State of Minnesota and the contractor are doing. They are, they have embedded in this structure corrosion-resistant materials. They have also embedded in the structure itself detection systems that can determine corrosion, that can determine deterioration of the bridge before it becomes a critical factor. 
   So the notion that we should have a corrosion management plan is extremely important to the funding of the program, to maintenance of bridges. And had we had, had there been such a farsighted provision, a requirement in Federal and State law, the Silver River Bridge between Ohio and West Virginia in 1967 might not have collapsed. I would say would not have collapsed. 
   Now, it is the 20th anniversary of that tragedy in which I held hearings which I referred to at the outset of my remarks in general debate. 20 years later, came back to look at what is the status of bridge inspection, maintenance and construction, and a distinguished bridge engineer, professor of bridge engineers said it is in the Stone Age. The gentleman's amendment will left us out of the stone age and address the issue of stress corrosion cracking. 46 people died, perhaps needlessly. That could have been prevented. 
   In 1983, the collapse of the Mianus River Bridge in Connecticut. I see the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) on the floor. Collapse of its bridge bearings rusted internally, pushed a corner of the slab off the support, killing three people. 
   In the Minnesota, I-35W replacement bridge, those bridge bearings are now enclosed, protected from the elements, and a sensor internally to determine whether there is moisture and whether there might be corrosion. So the gentleman's amendment really is important for the future of sound bridge construction and maintenance, and we are happy to accept it, and thank you for bringing the issue to our attention. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Over half of the bridges of this country were built before 1964, within the first 8 years of the Interstate Highway System and of the establishment of the highway trust fund. Since then, trucks have gotten 20 percent longer and 10,000 pounds heavier. Cars have expanded in size and now have shrunk in size. More pressure is being exerted on the Nation's road and bridge structures and especially on bridges where even the bridge formula has been modified in the manufacture of trucks and engines. 
   The gentleman's amendment to direct the GAO to study the factors that play a role in delaying the construction of bridge rehabilitation projects or bridge repair projects is very, very important and thoughtful, especially coming from the State with the Mianus bridge collapse that result in fatalities. So I'm happy to accept the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the distinguished gentleman. 
   In the hearing I referenced at the outset of my remarks today, 1987 was the time when the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Clinger) was the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight. 
   Together, we conducted this hearing and long-term investigation of issues, but I observed that there were two bridge designs that raised questions--the pin and hanger design that was used in the Mianus River Bridge that collapsed and the bridge design using spread footings in which the bridge piers are set on the bottom of a river or of a body of water but not on pilings that go into the subsoil and down to bedrock. That was the structure used in the construction of the Schoharie Creek Bridge in New York State that collapsed in the aftermath or in the course of, I should say, a swirling flood. 
   Bridges of that nature were not being properly inspected. Bridges that were set in the water were not properly being reviewed by underwater devices or by scuba divers' going down to the base in the aftermath of a flood to inspect the condition of the bridge footing, itself. 
   So the concern of the gentleman from Iowa of bridges that are located in a 500-year floodplain is supported by the history of bridge collapse in the aftermath of floods. So I think the gentleman's amendment is entirely relevant and appropriate, and I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished ranking member for his support. I support, of course, the amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I concur with the gentleman's remarks. 
   The amendment ensures that the 5-year performance plans required under the bill will account for historic bridges located within the State. 
   The gentlewoman has described the limitation on that approval and the requirements expected of the Department of Transportation of the State, and I include in the Record at this point my further evaluation of the amendment, which we do accept on our side.  
   I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. SHEA-PORTER). 
   This amendment ensures that the five-year performance plans required under this bill account for historic bridges located within the State. 
   H.R. 3999 ensures that States develop a risk-based prioritization of their bridge inventory, and lay out a strategy for addressing their bridge deficiencies. 
   This amendment recognizes that there are some States with bridges listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and ensures that the performance plans allow for States to institute more frequent, in-depth inspection of these facilities in lieu of replacement of these facilities. 
   The amendment requires the exemption to be allowed only if the Secretary determines that increased inspection frequency and intensity is appropriate given the condition and usage of the bridge, and will increase the overall safety of the State's bridge inventory. 
   This amendment ensures that States with these historically significant facilities are not aversely impacted in developing and implementing their performance plans. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) raised this issue of a National Tunnel Inspection Program, of course, from very firsthand experience in the City of Boston, with the collapse of the roof and several sections that collapsed resulting in at least one fatality and many injuries. 
   At the time, the gentleman offered the amendment on a previous piece of legislation. It was not the appropriate vehicle, and I counseled the gentleman to wait until we would have an appropriate bill from the committee with which we could consider his proposal. This was way last year. I didn't know at the time that we were going to have a bridge collapse in Minnesota and that we might have this very appropriate vehicle. 
   The amendment creates a National Tunnel Inspection Program at the Federal Highway Administration to develop national inspection standards for proper safety inspection and evaluation of highway tunnels. National standards would be designed to ensure uniformity throughout the States in inspection and evaluation of highway tunnels. 
   And the tragedy of the tunnel in the Boston harbor tunnel in that city is adequate reminder that we need to raise the standards, do a more vigorous and effective job of inspecting tunnels throughout the United States, and I ask for adoption of the amendment.  
   I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO). 
   This amendment creates a National Tunnel Inspection Program that would establish national tunnel inspection standards and ensure uniformity among the States in the conduct of such inspections. 
   The substance of this amendment was approved by the House in January by a voice vote. 
   While the need for these improvements to our surface transportation program has long existed, the tragic tunnel collapse in Boston, Massachusetts, two years ago brought about the catalyst for its implementation. 
   On Monday, July 10, 2006, at approximately 11:00 p.m., a section of the suspended concrete ceiling above the eastbound lanes of the Interstate 90 connector tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, fell onto a vehicle traveling to Logan International Airport. A passenger, riding in the right front seat of the vehicle, was killed, while the driver escaped with minor injuries. 
   The National Transportation Safety Board (``NTSB'') immediately launched an investigation into the cause of the ceiling panel collapse. 
   The NTSB report observed that had the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority inspected the area above the suspended ceilings at regular intervals, the anchor creep that led to this accident would likely have been detected, and this tragedy could have been prevented. 
   While we cannot undo the damage caused by this accident, we can, and we must, take the necessary actions to prevent future tunnel collapses. 
   The NTSB report also found that the Federal Highway Administration (``FHWA'') lacked the regulatory authority to conduct tunnel inspections, and recommended that the FHWA seek legislation authorizing the agency to establish a mandatory tunnel inspection program similar to the National Bridge Inspection Program. 
   That is exactly what this amendment will do--establish a national program to inspect highway tunnels. 
   The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with State Departments of Transportation, private organizations and individuals, will establish national tunnel inspection standards for safety inspections and evaluations of all public highway tunnels. 
   The program also establishes criteria for certification and training of tunnel inspectors, and requires States to prepare and maintain an inventory of public highway tunnels. 
   The NTSB report made clear that the death that occurred on that July evening could have been prevented had this tunnel been inspected at regular intervals. This legislation will establish a framework to address this serious safety concern, and ensure that tragedies like that of July 10, 2006, will not occur again. 
   To address the absence of comprehensive inspections standards for our nation's highway tunnels, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2537, the Beach protection Act of 2008. 
   This legislation, and the underlying statute that the Beach Protection Act amends, are vital to ensuring that the public is aware of, and protected from coming into contact with, potentially harmful pollutants and contaminants in our coastal recreational waters. 
   I applaud the efforts of the primary sponsors of this legislation, the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. PALLONE, and our colleague on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. BISHOP, for shepherding this important legislation through the hearing process, through Committee markup, and to the floor of the House today. 
   I also applaud the efforts of the gentleman from California, Mr. BILBRAY, for his efforts back in 2000 to move the initial BEACH Act to the President's desk. 
   The BEACH Act that was signed into law in October 2000 authorized $30 million annually for beach monitoring and assessment programs and public notification programs for fiscal years 2001 through 2005. It required States and tribes to determine minimum water quality standards that were considered ``safe.'' 
   In many ways, the BEACH Act has proven successful in making the public aware of the presence of potentially harmful water contamination at local beaches, and has brought about a revolution in terms of States creating and implementing coastal recreational water monitoring and notification programs. The benefits we have seen over the last 8 years include uniform standards for coastal recreational water quality, and increased monitoring and notification of such waters. 
   However, inasmuch as the BEACH Act has been successful in providing more information to the public, the Bush administration's track record on utilizing all of the tools contained in the BEACH Act to protect human health has been far less successful. 
   For example, the EPA was given authority to promulgate standards for States that did not have sufficient standards as compared to  those in the 1986 Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Bacteria. EPA was given further direction to continue to study the impacts of waterborne pollutants and bacteria to human health, and to revise the criteria every five years as needed. 
   Unfortunately, EPA failed to complete this task, as demonstrated by a lawsuit by advocates for safe beaches, and more recently, in a report of the Government Accountability Office (``GAO''). 
   This GAO Report, entitled ``Great Lakes: EPA and States Have Made Progress in Implementing the BEACH Act, but Additional Actions Could Improve Public Health Protection,'' established that more work could be done to ensure the safety of our beach waters. 
   Just this week, a Federal District Court judge in California ruled that EPA, again, violated its ``non-discretionary duty'' to complete required studies on revising coastal water quality criteria and standards. Even after losing a similar lawsuit in 2006, EPA continues to argue that the statute gives the Agency the discretion to ``conduct the studies as it sees fit.'' This is contrary to the law, and has once again been dismissed by the Federal District Court judge. 
   Similarly, the Bush administration has failed to utilize the authorities and direction of the initial BEACH Act to ensure the public has the best, most accurate, and timely information on the condition of their favorite beaches. For example, the BEACH Act called for a creation of a ``National List of Beaches'' that would provide the public with information on which beaches had in place monitoring and notification programs, and which did not. EPA was given the direction to periodically revise this list, based on the availability of new information. 
   I can assure my colleagues that latest list, published in 2004, is not the most up-to-date assessment of the condition of the Nation's beaches. Again, the administration has failed to utilize the tools provided by Congress to ensure the protection of human health and safety. 
   Despite the current administration's track record, the BEACH Act is an important law for protecting the public from the presence of harmful pollutants and contaminants in the Nation's recreational waters. 
   The Beach Protection Act, under consideration today, will further enhance these authorities by working towards real-time, same-day information on the condition of local waters to safeguard against unintentional contact with contaminated waters. 
   Again, I strongly support the efforts of our colleagues in drafting this important piece of legislation, and urge its adoption.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Chairman, I have sat here patiently and listened to a litany of speakers come here and address the Committee of the Whole on subjects important to them but irrelevant to the subject matter at hand. And one or another, maybe several of them, said ``this Democratic Beach bill.'' 
   I just want to remind the colleagues that this is the bill of the gentleman from California (Mr. Bilbray), who has labored for several years on behalf of this legislation. We finally move it through committee, bring it to the floor, and now it's laid on our doors to be the Democratic bill and why are we  wasting the House time. We bring it under an open rule, and then someone said, you should have brought it on suspension. If we had brought it on suspension, they would have complained because they didn't have an opportunity to offer the eight amendments that they're bringing to the floor. I am just perplexed by this tactic. It's unworthy of the legislation pending. 
   And we've worked hard to accommodate the gentleman from California who has a legitimate concern. I concur with his concern. We bring the bill out, and we do it in good faith, and we expect at least a good-faith response from the other side.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. In the 109th Congress, we considered the reauthorization of the Appalachian Regional Commission. During consideration of the bill in committee, I proposed language to prohibit earmarks, which have been done time and again in the appropriation process, prohibit earmarks in the Appalachian Regional Commission appropriation process. The gentleman from Arizona supported my initiative, and I appreciated his support. It was the right thing to do. 
   Unfortunately, the committee did not include that language. When the bill came to the floor, I worked to defeat the bill because it did not have that prohibition on earmarks, and the gentleman from Arizona supported my initiative. 
   In the BEACH bill, or the Beach Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act, proposed by the gentleman from California, with whom I worked on this matter for a period of 6 or 7 years, both in his previous seating in Congress and during the time he was out of service in the Congress and when he returned, it's a good bill. The initial BEACH Act authorized $30 million. About $10 million has been appropriated each year. And the money goes out by formula to the States. There have never been earmarks. In the Appropriations Committee nor on the House floor have there ever been attempts to suballocate the funds. Each State receives a portion of annual appropriations based on a calculation of each State's varied beach monitoring and notification efforts. 
   Now, we know very well that $10 million is insufficient, and because money is insufficient for a bill, that's often why, Madam Chairman, Members come with a proposal for an earmark to designate money so they are sure that their State or their beach or their city gets their, at least, perceived fair share of funding. 
   But it's never been done on this legislation, and we don't need any such limitation language. I think we have a fair formula, a specific focus on the base cost of the States of developing, maintaining water quality monitoring, notification programs, the mileage of the beach, beach use, the length of the season, and other factors that the administrator of the agency determines to be appropriate. That is fair, and I think Members of this body and of the other body recognize that it's fair; so they haven't attempted to tinker with it, and we shouldn't do that in this bill. This is a good piece of legislation, a fair piece of legislation. 
   Look, we bring this bill to the House floor under an open rule. It's one advocated by a Member from the other side, a Member for whom I have the highest personal regard, and then we have a succession of Members standing here complaining that we bring a bill to the floor under an open rule that should have been brought under suspension. If we had brought it under suspension, I suspect the same people would come to the floor, Madam Chairman, and complain that we didn't have an open rule. 
   So we're trying to the do the right thing on the right piece of legislation, and we ought not to gimmick it with this proposal that is totally unnecessary for a limitation on earmarks. We ought not to adopt this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3246, a bill to provide a comprehensive regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in the most severely economically distressed regions in the Nation. 
   H.R. 3246, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007, reauthorizes two existing commissions, the Delta Regional Commission and the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission, and establishes three new regional economic development commissions: the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission. These Commissions will address problems of systemic poverty and underdevelopment in their respective regions. 
   This legislation authorizes all of these regional commissions under a common framework of administration and management, modeled after the procedures for the highly successful Appalachian Regional Commission. By providing a uniform set of procedures, this bill provides a consistent method for distributing economic development funds and ensures a comprehensive regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in the most severely distressed regions in the country. 
   H.R. 3246 authorizes $250 million per year for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for each commission to provide vital assistance for the development of our Nation's most chronically poor and distressed regions. 
   Each of the three new commissions authorized by this bill serves a unique need. The Southwest border region includes all counties within 150 miles of the United States-Mexico border. This region contains 11 counties in New Mexico, 65 counties in Texas, 10 counties in Arizona, and 7 counties in California for a combined population of approximately 29 million people. According to research compiled by the Interagency Task Force on the Economic Development of the Southwest Border, 20 percent of the residents in this region of the Nation live below the poverty level, and unemployment rates often reach as high as five times the national unemployment rate. A lack of adequate access to capital has created economic disparities and made it difficult for businesses to start up in the region. 
   The northern border region stretches from Maine to New York. While the region enjoys abundant natural resources and is rich in potential, it lags behind much of the Nation in economic growth, and its people have not shared equitably in the Nation's prosperity. The region's historic reliance on a few basic industries and agriculture has failed to provide a diverse enough economic base for vigorous, self-sustaining growth. In the countries in this region, 12.5 percent of the population lives in  poverty, median household income is more than $6,500 below the national average, and unemployment through layoffs in traditional manufacturing industries is persistent. The population grew only 0.6 percent between 1990 and 2000, during which time the U.S. population rose by 13.2 percent, indicating significant out-imigration and loss of young people. 
   The southeastern region of the United States includes the coastal and central portions of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. Approximately 40 percent of the counties in this region have had 20 percent or more of their citizens living in poverty, on average, during the last 30 years. The area has also faced record unemployment. Additionally, this region has experienced natural disasters at a rate of two to three times greater than any other region of the U.S. The southeastern region is one of the last areas of the country without a Federal authority dedicated to ending poverty and strengthening communities. The Southeast Crescent Authority (SECA) authorizes a local-State-Federal partnership to lift citizens in this geographic area out of poverty and create jobs by targeting the communities with the greatest need. 
   This bill has broad bipartisan support, and the committee has held a series of hearings regarding the need for these economic development commissions. The model for economic development through partnerships between the Federal Government and State and local governments has worked extremely well in the case of the Appalachian Regional Commission, and I am certain it will continue to serve to enhance the lives and livelihoods of citizens in other regions. 
   I submit an exchange of letters regarding jurisdiction, and I support HR. 3246 and urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are at a transformational moment in the history of surface transportation in America today with this bill which has two parts, the extension of authority and renewal of authority for Amtrak, to move Amtrak into a totally new era of high-speed rail in the Northeast Corridor and eventually getting to high-speed intercity passenger rail in the rest of the country; and the second portion of this legislation, a bill the House previously passed last year, the Rail Safety Act, the first substantive, significant changes in railroad safety law in 100 years. 
   These are extraordinary moments. And to reach this moment took a great deal of initiative, innovative thinking, cooperation and concession on both sides of the aisle by our side and particularly by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the ranking member of the committee, who has offered innovative approaches to the future management of Amtrak, who has championed that cause for many years, and who said to me earlier in this Congress that this is an issue we should address, that we can address and that we can reach agreement on, and we have done; and Ms. Brown, the Chair of the Rail Subcommittee, ``Ms. Amtrak,'' who, in previous years, when the administration in other years proposed a bankruptcy budget for Amtrak, took to the rails Harry Truman-style and traveled around the country advocating for increased funding for Amtrak, to restore Amtrak. She is a real champion. And for Mr. Cummings, who served in a capacity in the previous Congress on a task force to evaluate proposals dealing with Amtrak and who submitted a report that validated the need to continue service of Amtrak. 
   With gas prices soaring, crippling the Nation and crippling the economy, we have seen our fellow citizens increasingly turn to intercity passenger rail. In fact, in the New York-Washington corridor, Amtrak has 56 percent of the air and rail passenger market. That is an extraordinary statement in and of itself. 
   At a time when flights are delayed, air delays, ground delays as many as 3 hours, people have seen the importance of Amtrak. In the aftermath of September 11, which we solemnly observed just recently in this body, it was Amtrak that carried people all throughout this country from Canada into the United States. 
   We have to invest in transportation solutions that are affordable, accessible and, most importantly, workable. This legislation provides a total of $13 billion over the next 5 years to help bring the Northeast Corridor to a state of good repair and to encourage development of new and improved intercity passenger rail service through a Federal-State matching grant program elsewhere throughout the country. The bill includes $1.5 billion in funding for the planning and development of high-speed rail corridors and $325 million in congestion grants to Amtrak in the States that are high-priority rail corridors. 
   It includes reforms in the governance and operation of Amtrak by restructuring the Amtrak board, requiring Amtrak to develop a new financial accounting system and a get-well plan for the worst-performing long-distance routes, and to open a public bidding process where nongovernment interests, private sector interests, can submit bids on management of the 11 corridors referenced in this legislation, and Amtrak will be able to bid, too. This is a concept that was very new, very much resisted, but after Mr. Mica and Ms. Brown and Mr. Shuster on the Republican side and I discussed this repeatedly over many weeks, we came to a common ground. What occurred to me is a statement in President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address: ``We should never fear to negotiate, but we should never negotiate out of fear.'' We should never fear to open the process of operating Amtrak to a public-private sector bidding process, and that is what we do. That is the important transformational step we take in this legislation--open the process up. 
   We are going to find new energy, new ideas and new initiatives in the process of inviting, evaluating, and acting upon these bids. We will have a far better idea of what can be done for the future of Amtrak when we go through this process. It will be good for Amtrak. It will be good for the country. It will be good for the traveling public. Again, I say this is a transformational moment in the history of rail passenger service in America. 
   With that, I thank Ms. Brown. I especially thank Mr. Mica for patience, the discussions and the cooperation that we have achieved and the frankness of our discussions over this past year and a half. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   When I graduated from college, I won a scholarship to study at the College of Europe in Belgium on European economic integration. I traveled by Greyhound bus from Chisholm to St. Paul; from St. Paul to Chicago by train, the Milwaukee 400, 400 miles in 400 minutes. That is 7 hours. Then train to the east coast; the Queen Mary to Europe; and from Paris to Brussels in 6 hours. That is the distance from New York to Washington. Today that trip from Paris to Brussels is 80 minutes at 184 miles an hour on the TGV. 
   Within the context of this legislation, we can cut that 7-hour trip from the Twin Cities to Chicago from 7 hours to 4 hours, if there is a will to do it. If there is a will to explore, to use the authorities we have provided under this legislation. 
   We can transform the travel time from New York to Washington to 2  hours or under, as has long been the goal of Mr. Mica and Ms. Brown and Mr. Cummings and so many others. We can do these things. We can put our best efforts forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 1376, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Okeechobee Hurricane of 1928. 
   H. Res. 1376 memorializes the loss of more than 3,000 lives in the United States and its territories as a result of Hurricane Okeechobee in 1928. Furthermore, the resolution recognizes the importance of hurricane preparedness, mitigation, enhanced evacuation measures, emergency plans, and disaster response training for helping to prevent the tragic loss of life as a result of natural disasters. This resolution recognizes the important roles that the Federal Government, States, and local governments all play in planning, collaborating, preparing for, and mitigating loss in the event of a natural disaster. 
   Hurricane Okeechobee, also known as Hurricane San Felipe Segundo, had winds exceeding 160 miles per hours. This was the first recorded hurricane to achieve winds at levels which equate to a Category 5 on the modern Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The hurricane made its way through the Caribbean Sea, landing in Palm Beach County, Florida, and then making its way up the East Coast from September 10-20, 1928, and then travelled all the way to Ontario, Canada. The storm surge on Lake Okeechobee overwhelmed the low dike around the lake, flooding hundred of acres and killing thousands of people. 
   As a result of the Okeechobee Hurricane and later hurricanes in the 1940s and 1950s, a series of larger dikes was built around the lake. The Herbert Hoover Dike was the culmination of large dike construction around Lake Okeechobee and was completed in the 1960s. Recent reviews of the Herbert Hoover Dike have indicated the dike is in a deteriorating condition. The Army Corps of Engineers is presently undertaking a comprehensive rehabilitation of the Dike to provide protection for citizens living in the area of Lake Okeechobee. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to the resolution.

Last week, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2881, the ``FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007,'' to reauthorize the aviation programs for four years. Until this long-term reauthorization bill can be signed into law, there are a few critical provisions that must not be allowed to lapse at the end of this week. These important provisions are extended in H.R. 3540, the bill before us today. 
   I strongly support the extension of the aviation excise taxes as proposed in H.R. 3540. These taxes are necessary to support the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which in recent years has provided about 80 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's budget. With an uncommitted cash balance of less than $2 billion, any lapse in the aviation taxes could put the solvency of the Trust Fund at risk. 
   In addition to extending the aviation taxes, H.R. 3540 extends the Airport Improvement Program. Because the Airport Improvement Program is funded by contract authority, rather than discretionary appropriations, funding for it is not automatically extended by Continuing Resolutions. H.R. 3540 creates $918.75 million in Airport Improvement Program contract authority to fund the program for the three-month period from October 1, 2007, to December 31, 2007. This amount, when annualized, equals the fiscal year 2007 amount for the program ($3.675 billion). This provision will ensure that airport funding is not interrupted because of a lapse in the Airport Improvement Program's authorization. 
   The bill also authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for Federal Aviation Administration Operations, Facilities and Equipment, and Research and Development programs for the three-month period of the extension. 
   Finally, current law allows the Secretary to limit to $100 million the third-party liability exposure of airlines and aircraft manufacturers for any cause resulting from a terrorist event. This authority expires September 30, 2007. H.R. 3540 extends this authority to December 31, 2007. 
   In summary, this bill simply continues aviation programs and financing under the same terms and conditions as current law. It ensures that these important programs continue to operate without any interruption. 
   I thank Chairman RANGEL and Ranking Member MCCRERY of the Committee on Ways and Means for working with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to include the aviation authorization provisions in H.R. 3540. I also thank my Committee colleagues, Ranking Member MICA, Subcommittee Chairman COSTELLO, and Subcommittee Ranking Member PETRI, for working with me on this critical legislation. 
   I look forward to Senate passage of its long-term FAA reauthorization bill and sending a bill to the President in the coming months. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3540.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Texas, for yielding the time and compliment her and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker), the ranking member of the subcommittee, for developing this legislation and preparing it and bringing it so early in the session to the House floor. I also appreciate the bipartisan cooperation with the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the ranking member of the full committee, and it is good to have the gentleman from Arkansas on the floor and managing the bill. I thank the gentleman for his ever thoughtful approach to legislation. 
   This alternative water sources initiative is not something that we developed in the course of this Congress. It started way back in 2000, in fact, earlier than that, as the committee held hearings over a period of several years to raise the visibility of issues of water supply and groundwater withdrawals and needs of communities well off into the future. 
   In fact, I should point out that a former colleague of ours, later Speaker, Jim Wright, in 1958 wrote a book entitled, ``The Coming Water Famine,'' where then new Congressman Wright gathered enormous amount of data about water usage by industry, by agriculture, by homeowners, and did a calculation that showed the rising use of water intersecting with a line of steady availability. 
   All the water there ever was, there ever will be, is available now. We will not create new water, and he showed that in the 1980s the lines would intersect, and that, at that point, the Nation and the Congress need to face up to the need to assure the continuity of availability of water supplies, that continued withdrawal of water from the Ogallala aquifer that covers west Texas and eastern Oklahoma, a huge area of the central portion of the United States, could not continue forever. That water would be withdrawn, and there would be no further water available, just simply was not replenishing as fast as surface needs were drawing upon it. 
   That was the background. That was the stimulus for the alternative water  sources program that our committee included in the Estuaries and Clean Water Act of 2000, which passed the House, the Senate and was signed into law. 
   The legislation was developed to address the concerns by communities all across the country over availability of water to meet their future requirements, especially in the more arid regions of the country, as we have already heard from the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney) and Mrs. Tauscher, also from California, who was the initiator of this legislation in previous Congresses. 
   I have read a great deal about climate change that followed the enormous amount of scientific data pouring forth from the international geophysical year by the United Nations scientific panel, scientists in the U.S. who are reporting on global climate change, and the effect that it is having upon weather and the increasing volatility and variability of the amount, timing and distribution of moisture, not just rainfall but moisture that comes in the form of snow or freezing rain. There is consensus among the climatology scientific community that the timing, intensity and duration of floods, droughts and high-intensity storms are going to continue to plague us over the decades ahead. 
   Pressure for additional sources of drinking water, usable water for industry and agriculture will only grow and magnify across this country, putting greater pressure on reclamation, on reuse, on advanced wastewater treatment, and even on desalination, as many countries in the world are doing. 
   In the 1970s, there was an experiment by a Saudi prince who chartered a vessel to go to Antarctica and harness an iceberg, put a huge plastic wrap under that iceberg so it would not melt and had it towed by tug boats to a point off the shore of Saudi Arabia. Then they drilled a hole in the center of it and pumped the water out for several years to bring fresh water to Saudi Arabia. There are not going to be very many icebergs left to be towed as the polar caps melt faster than we can harness the icebergs. 
   Furthermore, that experiment proved enormously expensive. It also demonstrated that there is a considerable amount of loss of iceberg water capability as the 'berg is towed. 
   We have to do much better than just towing icebergs. We create with this legislation a modest start on a program to help communities provide for their current needs, for household requirements, industrial needs, for agricultural uses of water, well off into the future.     
   This is but one important step in the long-term effort we must make to ensure the availability of water supplies and the viability of those water supplies off into the future in this time of highly uncertain climate conditions.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The gentleman raises a very important issue, one that has been of deep concern. He raises two aspects of a question, one that raises deep concern among communities along the Great Lakes who do not want to see waters of the Great Lakes pumped west to quaff the thirst of arid western States. 
   Several years ago, there was a proposal for a coal slurry pipeline to bring coal in a slurry pipeline from the Powder River Basin to the western end of Lake Superior to ports of Duluth and Superior; and we vigorously opposed it, because that pipeline, if it pumps east, can also pump west and could suck water out of the Great Lakes in vast amounts.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, subsequently, in a Water Resources Development Act, I succeeded with legislation to prohibit any withdrawals from the Great Lakes unless there is unanimous agreement among the eight Governors and the Province of Quebec and the Province of Ontario. That language is current law, but it is not strong enough. It really needs to be reinforced. Now that I am in a position to do that, we are going to reinforce it. 
   The second concern of the gentleman is private companies profiting from the public sector provision of water supplies, and I think we should find a way in which we can limit the profiteering while not interfering with private sector developments. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) has again expired.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. For example, the little town of Buhl, population 900 in my district, has on its water tank the slogan, ``The Finest Water in America,'' and the city began bottling that water for sale. They are using their open resources to bottle this water in these little 8-ounce and 16-ounce bottles. I wouldn't want to prevent Buhl, which has fallen on hard times, from drawing on its resources. But they are using their own money to do that. 
   What the gentleman is concerned about is a public, federally funded process that might stimulate the private sector. I commend the gentleman for his concern, and we shall work together to address the situation.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   I appreciate the fashion of the gentleman from Georgia, and I respect his consistency. He offered the same amendment yesterday. We had quite a thorough and extensive discussion and a recorded vote, which ended 166-260. 
   Again, I appeal to the gentleman, Mr. Chairman, that we are dealing with an authorization. Tomorrow we will be dealing with a different bill that does result in a direct spending reduction as determined by the Congressional Budget Office and for which the committee created an offset and reduced the size of the bill. 
   This bill, H.R. 700, is not a direct spending bill, and has been so verified by the Congressional Budget Office and by the Office of Management and Budget. It is not subject to the so-called PAYGO rules. An appropriation subsequently could well be subject to PAYGO, but we have yet before us the congressional budget process. We have to vote on a budget, and then we consider the appropriations. If this legislation is enacted in time for the appropriation process, hopefully it could be considered and included, and then there is a question of whether it is subjected to the PAYGO rules. 
   But in its present form, this is an authorization. It is not a direct spending. It is not subject, as Congressional Budget Office has ruled, to the PAYGO rules. And we made that point yesterday. We make it again today. And I rise in opposition to the amendment, but not in opposition to the approach of the gentleman, who is a true fiscal conservative and wants to ensure that dollars are wisely spent and that we are not overspending. 
   I assure the gentleman, this legislation, modest as it is in its scope of dollars authorized, will be subjected to the  rigorous oversight of OMB, Congressional Budget Office, procedure and the appropriation process in its new course.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. The gentleman from Texas, a member of the Rules Committee, and I had a discussion about the principle involved in the gentleman's amendment in the course of our presentation at the Rules Committee for the rule covering this bill. As a result, the gentleman has offered an amendment that I think is entirely appropriate. But the point at which we are in the consideration of the legislation, and given the time it might take for the other body to act on it, would create a time frame problem through fiscal 2008. I would suggest that the language be changed to reflect two fiscal years from date of enactment, so that we have a precise time but that it is linked to date of enactment of the act, which then would be a very appropriate way to do it.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Both gentlemen offer an amendment, Mr. Chairman, to our bill that is well intentioned to respond to the needs of small communities, to assure that communities under a population of 10,000 are not left behind, as this program is administered. And I certainly am in consonance with that concern. 
   There are only maybe four communities in my congressional district that have population greater than 10,000. I think of Big Fork, population 950, and others of similar size who have needs for water resource as great proportionately as do the major metropolitan areas. 
   In fact, in a drought in 1988, Minneapolis was trying to encourage the Corps of Engineers to draw down the head waters of the Mississippi River to increase the flow to Minneapolis while at the same time not banning car washes, not banning sprinkling of lawns, not taking other water conservation measures and also drawing water from the Jordan Basin Reservoir underneath the Twin Cities, a 50-mile diameter basin that is water left over from the melting of the glacier 10,000 years ago, water that can never be replaced because it is an impermeable area. 
   And I said, oh, wait a minute. It just happened I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Investigation and Oversight; called the Corps of Engineers in and made sure they didn't draw any matter down from the head waters of the Mississippi River to serve the thirst of Minneapolis while at the same time St. Paul was incorporating water conservation measures. 
   Well, I cite that history to show that I am really sensitive to these needs. But we do not want to create in this legislation a preferential consideration. And when the gentleman says consider, when the language of the amendment the gentlemen are offering says consider, I take this to mean a factor to be considered, along with other relevant factors and not a set-aside and not a preference. 
   May I ask the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), and I yield to the gentleman, to be assured that he concurs in that interpretation.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, when I was elected to Congress, took office in 1975, we formed a Congressional Rural Caucus. There were 250 members. We had a voice on this floor, and a presence on this floor. Today there are less than 90 of us representing primarily rural areas, so we do have to be watchful for small towns, rural areas. And in the spirit of our discussion just concluded, I will accept the amendment of the gentlemen. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, this amendment was offered yesterday by a different gentleman from the other side. I just want to read from the legislative language in the act. 
   Subsection F: Uses of Grants. ``Amounts from grants received under this section may be used for engineering, design, construction and final testing of alternative water source projects designed to meet critical water supply needs. Such amounts may not be used for planning, feasibility studies, for operation, maintenance, replacement, repair or rehabilitation.'' Although we do not specifically prohibit use of funds for lobbying, no such authorization is permitted. Nonetheless, the gentleman proposes to close a potential opportunity for money to be diverted, and, therefore, we are prepared, as yesterday, to accept the gentleman's motion.
