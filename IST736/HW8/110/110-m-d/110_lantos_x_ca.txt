<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the images from Burma that have flashed across our television screens over the past two weeks have stirred the conscience of the entire civilized world. Buddhist monks draped in their simple crimson robes, peacefully gathering to press for change. Rangoon citizens pouring from their homes to join their holy men, their numbers swelling to over 100,000. Sandals hurriedly abandoned in the road as peaceful marchers were chased away by baton-wielding police. Soldiers firing automatic weapons into unarmed crowds. The charred body of a Buddhist monk, slain by the ruling junta, lying face down in a pool of dirty water stained crimson with his innocent blood. 
   These indelible images, Madam Speaker, will not soon fade, nor will the anguished cry to us made by the leader of the Burmese Democratic movement, Noble Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and I quote her: ``Use your liberty to promote ours.'' 
   So today, Madam Speaker, we use our liberty here in the Congress of the United States to condemn the violent crackdown on dissent in Burma. We use our liberty to call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, the imprisoned Buddhist monks, and all other Burmese prisoners of conscience. And today we use our liberty here in the Congress of the United States asking our friends in Asia and Europe to join us in using economic leverage to promote democratic change in Burma. 
   Since the last bloody crackdown in Burma 17 years ago, we in the United States have led the way in imposing tough economic sanctions against the ruling junta. Each year, I ask my colleagues to join me and my good friend PETER KING of New York in renewing import sanctions against Burma, and each year this Congress, under both Republican and Democratic control, has responded overwhelmingly to our request. 
   But Burma's elite will only feel the economic squeeze when other countries join us. The enormous flow of aid and trade from China to Burma, not to mention China's political support for the regime in the United Nations Security Council, must come to an abrupt end. The military packages for Burma offered by the world's largest democracy, India, must be removed from the table. And our friends in ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who have begun to speak out for democratic change in Burma, must move beyond words and suspend Burma's membership in this very important regional organization. 
   Madam Speaker, when the generals run out of cash, change will come to  Burma. When military officials cannot send their children to be educated abroad, change will come to Burma. And when the Burmese officials are no longer welcome at the table of ASEAN, change will come to Burma. 
   And to those Burmese military officers who are on the fence deciding whether to join in the violent campaign of repression or to refuse orders to kill and torture your fellow citizens, I have a simple message: Do the right thing. As in Germany, as in Rwanda, as in Yugoslavia, those who commit war crimes will be brought to justice before an International Criminal Tribunal. Put yourself on the right side of history. 
   The crimes committed by this junta, Madam Speaker, stretch far beyond the atrocities of the past few days. This regime has systematically used rape as a means of war against ethnic minorities. Recently released satellite images show that it has burned and destroyed entire villages. And since the regime nullified the democratic elections in 1990 won by Aung San Suu Kyi, it has arbitrarily arrested and tortured dissidents, real and imagined, by the thousands. 
   Just a few days ago, the world caught a brief glimpse of Aung San Suu Kyi peaking out of the gate of her home, which has become her virtual prison. Today, we stand with Aung San Suu Kyi, this courageous woman, demanding her freedom, demanding the freedom of all those prisoners of conscience in Burma, and demanding far-reaching democratic change. 
   Change will not come overnight to Burma, but it will come, and it will be my great pleasure to join our distinguished Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, a true champion for human rights around the globe, in witnessing the inauguration of Aung San Suu Kyi as the true prime minister of a free Burma. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, before yielding to our distinguished Speaker, I would like to say a word comparing our Speaker to the subject of this resolution, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. 
   These are two extraordinary women of deep courage and commitment, but there is one profound difference in their political lives: when Members of this body elected Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of this House, she assumed that position. When the people of Burma elected Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to serve as their Prime Minister, she was subjected to onerous imprisonment and persecution for almost two decades. 
   It gives me a great deal of pleasure and pride to yield such time as she may consume to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, an indefatigable fighter for human rights and the champion of a fellow woman political leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.

   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, before yielding back our time, I would like to make mention of a visit I had yesterday afternoon from the ambassador of China on the subject of Burma. 
   We had a long and difficult discussion. The Chinese Ambassador outlined for me the various steps his government has taken in recent days to deal with the crisis in Burma. I pointed out to him that gestures are not enough, that with the enormous leverage China has over Burma, China must take serious, substantive measures to compel the Government of Burma to give back the freedom to its own people and her freedom to Aung San Suu Kyi, the legally elected leader of Burma. 
   I call on the Government of China, just a few months short of the opening of the Beijing Olympics, to do the right thing, to exert its enormous influence on behalf of the people of Darfur, on behalf of the people of Burma, and by inviting His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, for a dialogue in Beijing. Nothing would make the climate for the opening of the Beijing Olympics more positive and salutary than a serious dialogue between the Government of China and the Dalai Lama. 
   There have been so many negative developments from China's point of view in recent times: the selling of food, the selling of tooth paste, the selling of children's toys, all of them dangerous to consumers in this country. There is a deep concern here that China's insatiable appetite for raw materials closes their eyes and minds to human rights violations across the globe, from Darfur to Burma. 
   This is a glorious opportunity for the government in China to do the right thing, and to do the right thing vis-a-vis Burma is to put pressure on the military junta to ease up on the Burmese people and to give Aung San Suu Kyi her right to live in freedom as the elected leader of the Burmese people.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (IRAN COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will address the United Nations General Assembly in just a couple of hours, the latest step in his campaign to remove all obstacles to Tehran's headlong pursuit of nuclear weapons. We, in turn, must resolve to use every available peaceful means, economic, political, and diplomatic, to put a stop to that deadly, dangerous pursuit. 
   Peaceful persuasion in this instance will require a lot of leverage. Strong international sanctions must be imposed against the regime in Tehran, biting sanctions that will bring about a change in policy. 
   Ideally, Mr. Speaker, such measures would be undertaken through the United Nations. But if China and Russia continue to block effective U.N. sanctions against Iran, the United States must move ahead in the company of as many other like-minded nations as possible. And if multilateral sanctions are not in the offing, the United States needs to be prepared to tighten and to fully enforce our own sanctions without any exceptions. 
   Current law imposes sanctions in the U.S. market on any foreign company that invests $20 million or more in the Iranian energy sector. But the law lets the executive branch, at its sole discretion, waive those sanctions. And for years, Mr. Speaker, administrations of both parties have done so without fail. 
   Since 1999, giant companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total, Italy's ENI, and Inpex of Japan have invested over $100 billion, over $100 billion, in the Iranian energy industry, and the United States has done nothing to stop them. 
   If we wish to impose serious and biting sanctions on Iran, effective measures that will change the behavior of the regime in Tehran, it is clear what we must do. We must take away the power from the administration to waive sanctions we pass. 
   Two days ago on 60 Minutes, the President of Iran had this to say about the issue of nuclear weapons: ``We don't need a nuclear bomb ..... In political relations right now, the nuclear bomb is of no use. If it was useful, it would have prevented the downfall of the Soviet Union.'' 
   I wish that we could take Ahmadinejad at his word, but we obviously cannot. This is the same man who yesterday said, ``Our people are the freest in the world'' and ``there are no homosexuals in Iran.'' We are all aware of the many other absurd and irrational statements that have emanated from Tehran since this man took power. 
   But there is one arena in which I agree with Ahmadinejad: when he says his country has the same right as every other country to use civilian nuclear power. Every country has that right. But if they all decide to get there by mastering the full nuclear fuel cycle, then the door will be wide open to an unprecedented global proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
   That is why earlier the House passed my legislation to authorize the creation of an International Nuclear Fuel Bank under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Every country, including Iran, can draw from that bank the nuclear fuel necessary for the production of civilian nuclear energy under strict IAEA safeguards, but no nation will be able to divert nuclear materials for military purposes. The International Atomic Energy Agency supports my approach, as do all five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, including our own administration. 
   One would think that the decision makers in Tehran would look upon this idea of an International Nuclear Fuel Bank as an elegant way to get Iran out of a difficult, unproductive, and singularly isolated situation. I hope that they will take this road and they will use this opportunity to move away from their current isolation in the international community. 
   And I hope as well that the administration will see its way clear to opening up serious and continuing dialogue with Iran. When I hear it said that it is somehow wrong to talk with Iran, I think back to the days when the Soviet Union had thousands of nuclear-tipped missiles aimed at the United States. Surely, the Soviets then were a great deal more dangerous to us than the Iranian leadership is today, and yet we talked with them daily. We maintained a very active diplomacy vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. We were engaged in trade, travel, and cultural exchanges of many types. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not alone in hoping that relations with Iran can and will be improved. But as long as irrationality prevails in Tehran, we must be prepared to employ all peaceful means at our disposal to ensure that the regime renounces its pursuit of nuclear weapons. 
   Iran today faces a choice between a very big carrot and a very sharp stick. It is my hope that they will take the carrot, but today we are putting the stick in place. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Texas for raising this issue. The Nunn-Lugar program is one of the most valuable international pieces of legislation since the end of the Second World War. It has gone a long ways in preventing nuclear materials falling into dangerous hands. It is imperative that the Russian Federation work together with the international community to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. I very much look forward to working with my friend from Texas to ensure that that goal and the nonproliferation goals are fully met in this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (METHAMPHETAMINE REMEDIATION RESEARCH ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 365, the Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007. This critically important piece of legislation helps detect and safely dispose of Methamphetamine production sites across this nation. 
   The issue of illegal methamphetamines is a top health concern for me and my constituents in the 12th district of California. According to the National Drug Intelligence Center's February 2005 National Drug Threats Assessment Report, the level of methamphetamine consumption in San Francisco is critically high compared with that of most other cities in the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me start by emphasizing the extreme danger that methamphetamines pose on today's youth. Methamphetamine is a drug concocted from a variety of household items including gasoline, paint thinner, battery acid, propane, and lighter fluid among other things, cooked together to form a powder or crystal like substance that is either smoked, ingested or injected. 
   According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy methamphetamines are a highly addictive drug that can cause progressive social and occupational deterioration and lead to episodes of violent behavior, paranoia, anxiety, confusion, and insomnia. Habitual usage can lead to physical complications such as inflammation of the heart lining, damaged blood vessels, skin abscesses, as well as variety of cardiovascular problems that ultimately can lead to death. Doctors have equated damage to the brain caused by methamphetamine use with brain damage caused by Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and epilepsy. Psychotic symptoms can sometimes persist for months or years after drug use has ceased. 
   According to the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health an estimated 10.4 million Americans aged 12 or older used methamphetamine at least once in their lifetimes. The Drug Abuse Warning Network estimates that in 2004 methamphetamine was involved in 73,400 emergency room visits. 
   Mr. Speaker, in addition to the horrific effects that methamphetamine has on the human body the caustic nature of the production of the drug has enormously detrimental effects on the environment. This horrendous drug is produced in what is often referred to as ``Meth Labs.'' These laboratories can exist virtually anywhere, in fact methamphetamine laboratories have been found in all 50 states. They are overwhelmingly hidden amongst residential communities and pose a detrimental risk to millions of Americans. It is estimated that methamphetamine production creates approximately six pounds of waste for every one pound of product. If not properly cleaned, this highly volatile waste product leaves a toxic residue that can threaten the health of whoever may come in contact with it. 
   According to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) there were more then 47,000 reported Meth Lab incidents between the years 2003 and 2005. Nearly one in five of those were fires or explosions caused by the highly toxic and potentially flammable ingredients used to create the drug. 
   Even after these Meth Labs are discovered by authorities and shut down, and the criminals operating the labs are long incarcerated, the effects of their morally reprehensible action can continue to adversely affect the health and well-being of the innocent citizens living and working nearby. 
   While some states including my home State of California have taken the initiative to pass laws that outline methamphetamine laboratory cleanup procedures, there are currently no federal standards for cleaning up these potentially toxic sites. Mr. Speaker, the time is long overdue for us to take action to seek out and shut down these labs in a safe and healthy way. H.R. 365, The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007 will do just that by creating a road map to assure the safety of our children and first responders. 
   The bill authorizes $1.75 million in funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to research best practices programs for detection and proper sanitation of methamphetamine labs. It will also specifically authorize $750,000 for the National Institute of Standards and Technology in collaboration with the EPA to research and develop methamphetamine detection equipment. Thirdly, the bill will direct the EPA to work with the National Academy of Sciences to study the long term health effects of methamphetamine laboratory exposure to children and first responders. 
   Mr. Speaker, the war against meth is being waged on many fronts. This bill is a critical step to ensuring that law enforcement agencies and first responders are provided with the best information and ability to mitigate the numerous detrimental effects caused by methamphetamine production. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation in an effort to rid our communities of this epidemic.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (AFGHANISTAN FREEDOM AND SECURITY SUPPORT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2446 and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Taliban is back, posing not only an insidious threat to the people of Afghanistan but to our Nation as well. We simply cannot allow a resurgence of the Taliban. If we do, al Qaeda will once again be able to use Afghanistan as a state-sponsored launching pad for terror. 
   And so every schoolhouse door in Afghanistan is a threshold to stopping terrorism. Every new power line in Afghanistan is a frontline in the war on terror. Every farm in Afghanistan used for legitimate crops, instead of opium poppies, is fertile ground for peace. 
   So we ought to look at funding Afghanistan as both good foreign policy and good domestic policy. Every dollar we invest now translates into lives and dollars we save in the future, both in Afghanistan and in the United States. 
   Our initial efforts, Mr. Chairman, in Afghanistan must be redoubled. For that reason, it was my pleasure to join with the ranking Republican member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my good friend, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN of Florida, in introducing this crucial reauthorization bill, which clearly demonstrates our long-term, bipartisan commitment to Afghanistan. 
   Our job in Afghanistan is not finished, not by a long shot. Yes, the Taliban was seemingly purged from that Nation in 2001 and a democratic government was established in its place, but we must not have a false sense of security. 
   The effectiveness and very existence of the Karzai government is threatened as we meet here today. As we speak, the volatile southern part of Afghanistan is aflame with clashes between NATO coalition troops and the reorganized forces of the Taliban. Make no mistake: Afghanistan is a brush fire that could ignite easily into an all-out conflagration. 
   Recently, Mr. Chairman, there has been an alarming return to the reign of terror against women in Afghanistan. Just today we learned of the slaying of a pioneering advocate of free speech, a courageous woman who owned a radio station near Kabul, shot to death in her home. This brutal attack shows how difficult the working environment has become for journalists, especially for journalists who are women. 
   So the Afghans need our help as much as ever. The teetering situation there is an echo of the instability just after the United States and our allies invaded that country. Security for the people and stability of the government are paramount. 
   Let me sketch, Mr. Chairman, the basic outline of our bipartisan legislation. The first title of the Lantos/Ros-Lehtinen bill provides much-needed financial aid for health care, energy development, programs for women and girls, assistance to combat corruption, and a crop substitution program to curtail the growing of poppy. Under this section of our bill, the administration will be required to certify whether any senior official in Afghanistan's provincial or local government is involved in the illegal narcotics trade and to take appropriate action. 
   Our bill also requires the President to appoint a coordinator for our Afghanistan assistance programs, including counter-narcotics. We mandate accountability in the effort to eliminate narcotics corruption. 
   Title II of our bill bolsters security and policing in Afghanistan, supporting the international security  force beyond October, 2007, and further training the Afghans. It encourages greater participation from countries in the region, and it mandates the creation of special drug interdiction teams. 
   We must recognize, Mr. Chairman, that security in Afghanistan is inextricably intertwined with the fight against the narcotics trade. 
   Title III of our bill ensures greater planning and accountability for the future of the country, and it fosters regional coordination. A structured blueprint for 2008 will be required, with updates as necessary. Reporting and evaluation measures will be expanded and extended. These are all crucial provisions for meeting benchmarks and assessing progress so that Congress can perform the oversight that is important to our successful effort in a war-torn country. 
   I want to repeat, Mr. Chairman, we will not let Afghanistan fail. The world is watching, and it wants to know whether we have the resolve to fight the terrorist forces threatening Afghanistan, whether we are ready to maintain the country's security and stability. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Committee on Foreign Affairs approved our bipartisan legislation unanimously. I want to repeat this because it indicates the unanimous conviction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, reflecting the view of this body and the American people, that Afghanistan will be a successful endeavor. 
   I want to express my appreciation for the support of not only the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, but also the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Pence. 
   I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in strongly supporting this most important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, before yielding back, I would like to make just a couple of observations. 
   It is such a rare pleasure to manage a major bill of international significance on a bipartisan basis. Our Nation wins when Congress is united. This Congress is united on our policy with respect to Afghanistan. Just as importantly, Mr. Chairman, was my privilege some years back to point out that Afghanistan is not an American problem; it is a problem for the civilized the world. And I called for NATO to take over the responsibility in Afghanistan. 
   NATO is now the principal operating entity on behalf of freedom and democracy in the country of Afghanistan. NATO should be performing this function. It is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world, and it is my earnest hope that, just as NATO has accepted its responsibility in the struggle in Afghanistan, it will do so in other troubled parts of the world.

   With billions of dollars being poured into reconstruction and development assistance, justifiably so, we have a heavy responsibility to the American people to ensure that our taxpayer dollars are being spent in the manner in which they were intended. 
   As the gentleman knows, we just had a hearing with the Inspector General for Afghanistan which was singularly  instructive and illuminating and highlighted many of the problems in the spending of our tax dollars in Afghanistan. This function is the function of the Inspectors General at the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
   Your amendment requires that these officers be permanently deployed in Afghanistan, which they are not currently, so that on-the-ground assessments can be made in real time and with full continuity. Your amendment authorizes additional funds to help ensure that adequate resources are allocated to measure the effectiveness of our aid program without increasing the cost of this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment and urge all of my colleagues to do so as well.

   Currently, there are a handful of NATO countries who contribute to this fund, and it is important for the United States to show leadership in this area. With our contribution, other NATO allies will also be encouraged to participate.

   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I support the underlying premise of the gentleman's amendment that assistance should be provided through organizations that have a cost-effective record of administering programs in Afghanistan. I am also gratified that the gentleman made some modifications to the original version of his amendment. 
   As H.R. 2446 reflects, we must continue to assist the Afghan people in creating and sustaining economic and development systems for themselves. We must continue to endow the Afghan government, Afghan organizations and the Afghan people with the necessary know how, expertise and resources so they can lead a free, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. 
   I believe that this amendment strikes the right balance in calling for USAID to prioritize organizations that have a cost-effective record of administering programs in Afghanistan, while allowing for assistance to Afghan entities as well. 
   On that basis, the amendment is acceptable to our side.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (LIMITING USE OF FUNDS TO ESTABLISH ANY MILITARY INSTALLATION OR BASE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding. 
   I want to thank my good friend and colleague from the Bay Area, BARBARA LEE, for bringing this timely legislation before us today. 
   The last thing Congress and the American people want in Iraq is to keep U.S. troops there permanently. We need a rational and reasonable exit strategy. Yet the administration has signaled that it intends, instead, to put down roots in Iraqi soil, soil that is already soaked with the blood of our soldiers and countless Iraqis. 
   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. Building huge military bases in Iraq to last the ages is not the answer. We want to bring our servicemen and servicewomen home to Nebraska and Idaho and California. Our legislation will prohibit spending funds to establish permanent military bases in Iraq, and I support it wholeheartedly. 
   Let me be clear. This measure does not prohibit us from protecting our embassy and other vital interests and fighting terrorism. It only ensures that our troops do not put down permanent roots. 
   The administration has drawn a parallel between our proposed, sustained presence in Iraq and the U.S. obligation to South Korea after the Korean War. Mr. Speaker, we have been in South Korea for more than 54 years, and I hope we won't be as long as that in Iraq. 
   The Korean peninsula for over half a century was vital to our security interests during the Cold War, but Iraq is not Korea. It is now beyond question that our national security is being harmed, not helped, by our continuing vast footprint in Iraq. 
   As long as huge numbers of our forces are there, the Iraqi Government will limp along, failing to undertake the far-reaching political and security changes desperately needed to promote lasting stability in that long-suffering country. 
   And it will only anger the Iraqi people to promote the erroneous impression that our troops will be there permanently. In fact, a commitment not  to establish permanent bases may facilitate an earlier, safer, more orderly exit, as it will reassure Iraqis that our intention is not to have a permanent presence in that country. 
   I, therefore, strongly support this resolution to ensure that the administration heads in the right direction in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007, I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, James Oberstar, and my friend from Michigan, Bart Stupak, for their work on the Great Lakes Water Quality amendment. 
   This amendment calls for a study to examine the effect that waste water treatment facilities feeding into the Great Lakes are having on the water quality of the largest fresh water system in the world. I want to commend my good friend from Michigan for raising this important issue. I believe, however, that a study of this kind can only be conducted in collaboration with the Department of State, the International Joint Commission, which is a joint U.S.-Canada border commission, and the Government of Canada itself. We must all recognize that this study cannot be completed without cooperation from our friends north of the border. I hope that as this legislation moves through the legislative process we will be able to examine the role that the International Joint Commission can play in I conducting this study and ensuring a bi-national environment open to the research needs of this examination. 
   I thank Representative Stupak for bringing this important amendment to the bill. I also wish to thank Chairman Oberstar for agreeing to work with the Committee on Foreign Affairs as this legislation moves forward on these issues to ensure the most informative outcome for this important study.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding. 
   I must begin by reacting to the two distinguished Republican speakers who preceded me. The distinguished Republican leader recited movingly and accurately terrorist outrages across the globe. Those terrorist outrages make the passage of our resolution all the more urgent and all the more imperative. We are not fighting terrorism in Iraq. We are attempting to referee a religiously based civil war which saps our strength and destroys our fabric as a society. 
   As to the distinguished Republican whip, may I say this resolution does not make tactical decisions. It reverses a mistaken course. The administration is recommending an acceleration of the wrong course. Our resolution reverses that course. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is too late to go back and make right all that has gone wrong in Iraq, and clearly carrying on with more of the same will do no good. But the administration has yet to learn that you cannot unscramble an omelet. Instead, it is trying to add to the mix another 21,500 men and women who deserve better than that. 
   In pursuing its policies in Iraq, the administration cannot unscramble and undo its many mistakes: buying into rogue and flawed intelligence; disbanding the Iraqi Army; conducting mindless and extreme de-Baathification; permitting the early looting and destruction and violence; allowing the growth of a government based on hate-filled sectarianism; allowing waste, fraud and abuse in the use of U.S. taxpayer funds; and on and on ad nauseam and ad infinitum. 
   While we all hope that the goal of a quiet and stable Iraq will be achieved under General Petraeus, I am deeply skeptical. It will be incredibly difficult, if not impossible. The place is just too much of a mess. 
   Our continued heavy presence in Iraq has not forced Iraqi leaders to take the requisite actions on power-sharing, resource-sharing, and national reconciliation. In fact, it has done the exact opposite. They have made minimal and cosmetic efforts in the knowledge that we will fill the gaps. 
   In the meantime, there are so many other fronts, globally and here at home, on which we might have made much more progress if we had not been fixated these last 4 years on Iraq. Domestic and foreign problems have festered while we invested blood and treasure in Iraq. As our Iraq problems have mounted, our commitment and ability to resolve other pressing issues have vanished. 
   Last November, the American people sent a loud and unmistakable message. With the announcement of an escalation of the war in Iraq, it is obvious that the administration did not get it. So we are trying one more time. 
   The resolution before the House is the second chance for this administration to hear a strong and clear message on Iraq, one it ignores at its peril and at ours as a country. 
   The majority of Congress wants de-escalation. The majority of the American people want de-escalation. Many Republicans throughout the Nation, and even our Republican colleagues in this Congress, want de-escalation. Poll numbers show that the Iraqi people want the United States to gradually withdraw, and Prime Minister al-  Maliki has indicated in virtually every way that he can that he, too, opposes the surge. 
   But the administration wants escalation. So it is going its own way, nearly alone. 
   There is a clear-cut policy difference here, Mr. Speaker. It is reflected simply and unambiguously in our resolution. Those of our colleagues who oppose escalation should vote for the resolution. Those of our colleagues who stand with the administration in supporting escalation should oppose it. 
   Along with 52 hearings on Iraq in the House and the Senate over the past 5 weeks, this resolution represents the first phase in a long overdue process of congressional oversight of the war in Iraq. It is not the last phase. Congress will be dealing with the Iraq issue for months to come, in fact, for as long as it takes to end this nightmare. But this simple resolution will establish the first marker. Those who want to draw down the U.S. presence will be on one side of that marker. Those who want to take further steps into the quagmire will be on the other. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are throwing our soldiers into the midst of a civil war, particularly those whom we are sending to Baghdad. It is utterly unrealistic and grossly unfair to expect soldiers straight out of Iowa, Alabama, or California to be able to differentiate between Iraqi Sunnis and Iraqi Shias, much less to be able to tell at a glance which of these groups are with us and which are against us. But that is exactly what we are asking them to do, and we are asking them to do it in an urban terrorist setting and to do it without any linguistic or cultural background. 
   The first sentence of the recent National Intelligence Estimate tells us everything we need to know on this issue: ``Iraqi society's growing polarization, the persistent weakness of the Iraqi security forces and the Iraqi state in general, and all sides' ready recourse to violence are collectively driving an increase in communal and insurgent violence and political extremism.'' 
   Every day we read another article illustrating the impossibility of the situation into which we have inserted our brave men and women. One day, we read how the Iraqi Army is infested with militia members. Another day, we read that countless members of al-Sadr's violently anti-American Mahdi Army have actually been trained by U.S. soldiers unaware of the trainees' true affiliation. On yet another day, we read that U.S. soldiers cannot even tell their Iraqi counterparts the object of their joint military missions for fear that the mission will be compromised. 
   This weekend, we read an interview with a U.S. soldier who acknowledged that he had no idea whatsoever whether an arrest he witnessed by Iraqi security forces was justified or merely another instance of sectarian revenge. 
   Mr. Speaker, Iraq is a hall of mirrors, and the administration has utterly lost its way. More troops will not help. The United States wants Iraq to be a state based on the rule of law, but too many Iraqis prefer score-settling, chaos, and civil war. We cannot create a stable Iraq when the Iraqis themselves do not seem to want it. 
   Let us not leave our finest young men and women literally stranded in an Iraqi maze. Let us make this resolution the first step on their journey home. We must begin a reduction in force at the fastest responsible rate possible, consistent with the safety of our troops. 
   And then it will be time to rebuild our battered military and, just as importantly, rebuild the battered reputation of the United States. 
   For the sake of our troops and our national interests, I strongly support this resolution and urge all of my colleagues to do likewise.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (HONORING THOSE WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO ASSIST IN THE CLEANUP OF THE NOVEMBER 7, 2007, OIL SPILL IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 853 and to honor those selfless individuals who volunteered to help cleanup the recent San Francisco Bay oil spill.  
   On November 7, a cargo vessel inexplicably collided with the San Francisco Bay Bridge, spilling more than 58,000 gallons of toxic bunker fuel and causing one of the worst environmental disasters the region has ever seen. The impact on wildlife and surrounding beaches has been extremely detrimental, with over 28 beaches closing and severely impacting wildlife all around the bay. 
   However, in a strong testament to the American spirit, through this disaster we saw resolve and self-sacrifice. I am extremely proud of the thousands of individuals from around the area who immediately volunteered to assist with the cleanup. Bay Area non-profit community organizations like San Francisco Connect have supported the response and recovery of volunteers, while Bay Area environmental organizations like Baykeeper, Save the Bay, and the Bay Institute have provided invaluable leadership in assessing the damage and remediating this beautiful ecosystem. 
   Specifically, I want to recognize two of my constituents, Lynn Adams and Deborah Nagle-Burks who, with the Pacifica Beach Coalition, solicited volunteers while working through red tape to make sure anyone who wanted to participate in the clean-up was able to. They remain involved, and have advocated for a proactive approach to training volunteers before a spill occurs so that the response of local citizens can be faster and the damage limited. 
   In addition, the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, members of the San Francisco Crab Boat Owners Association, commercial crabbers, and other Bay Area fishermen have all joined the cleanup efforts, making an indelible contribution. 
   The collaborative effort of state and local agencies deserves our thanks as well. The City of San Francisco, particularly through its Department of Emergency Management, has significantly contributed to the overall response. 
   Mr. Speaker, we owe a deep debt of gratitude to all the volunteers who have given their time, the fishermen who have given their boats, and the first responders who have given their expertise to this clean up. Without the extraordinary efforts of these men and women it is certain the scope of damage to the fragile Bay ecosystem would be even greater than what we face today. 
   I will never cease to be proud and amazed by the dedication of my constituents and of the American people. This why I rise in very strong support of H. Res. 853. It is my hope that this resolution will be swiftly passed and the selfless individuals who volunteered to clean up the oil spill will be duly recognized.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.

Our distinguished Speaker, a lady who has just returned from a bipartisan visit to Kuwait, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, met the distinguished Speaker, another lady, another statesman, another political leader of outstanding qualities, the Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament. 
   When these two women met, Nancy Pelosi and Katalin Szili, history was made. We saw two great democratic republics, with parliaments headed by outstanding women, exchange views and plan the future of stronger and even better relations between the Republic of Hungary and the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (ESTABLISHING THE HOUSE DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE COMMISSION FOR THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
   When the Berlin Wall fell, I was there with other congressional colleagues. We experienced firsthand the exuberance of the people of East Germany and across the newly liberated region. 
   But to sustain the momentum of that unique instant in history to commitment on both sides of the Atlantic, commitment not just to elections, but to the development of permanent, democratic institutions that permeate society. Madam Speaker, I vividly recall how excited we in Congress were when we first provided assistance to our new colleagues in democratically elected parliaments across Central and Eastern Europe. 
   That is why I strongly support the resolution before the House today, which reestablishes the House Democracy Assistance Commission. This important body plays a critical role in ensuring that the new generation of emerging democratic institutions get desperately needed assistance. 
   In the 109th Congress, the House created this commission to enable members and staff to assist their counterparts in the parliaments of new democracies around the globe. With our help, they will build strong, independent legislatures. 
   The commission has been led by two steadfast and consistent supporters of democracy promotion, DAVID PRICE, our colleague from North Carolina, and David Dreier, my fellow Californian. I want to offer my sincere gratitude to both of them for their efforts. 
   Under their leadership, the commission took congressional delegations to six new or reemerging democracies and hosted six visiting parliamentary delegations here in Washington. 
   The commission also offered material assistance to several legislatures through USAID, most notably a project to furnish and equip and train staff of the parliamentary library of East Timor with the invaluable assistance of our own Library of Congress. 
   Pending the passage of this resolution by the full House, the commission in 2007 plans to assist the legislatures of Afghanistan, Colombia, East Timor, Georgia--not our own Georgia, but the former Soviet Republic of Georgia--Haiti, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, Liberia, Macedonia, Mongolia and Ukraine. 
   Madam Speaker, in 1918, President Woodrow Wilson expressed the idea that it is in our national interest to encourage free and open and democratic governments. Over the past nine decades, the United States has sustained and expanded this important commitment. The Price-Dreier Commission is an important part of this tradition, and it deserves our continued support. 
   I urge all of our colleagues to participate in the House Democracy Assistance Commission and to support this most important legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I could not think of a person more qualified than my friend DAVID PRICE of North Carolina to chair the House Democracy Assistance Commission. DAVID PRICE is a legislator's legislator. His understanding of the legislative process as a distinguished academic political scientist and his practice as one of the most outstanding legislators in the history of the Congress uniquely qualify DAVID PRICE to chair the House Democracy Assistance Commission. 
   Under his leadership, this body will take to many parts of the world not  only the principle but the practice of the democratic process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. These are promising times for Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein, the party linked to the Irish Republican Army, has just voted to start cooperating with the Northern Ireland police. With this action, Sinn Fein has abandoned decades of opposition to law and order, and vastly improved the chances of a Catholic-Protestant administration in Belfast before long.     
   Yes, Madam Speaker, these are promising times for Northern Ireland. But there are also reminders that the road to reconciliation remains long and tortuous. Last week the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland released a comprehensive report confirming that police in Northern Ireland have colluded with the loyalist paramilitaries over the last dozen years, and that such collusion could not have occurred, and I quote, ``without the knowledge and support of the highest level of the Northern Ireland police.'' Such incidents must be thoroughly investigated and their perpetrators caught. 
   Madam Speaker, February 12 marks the anniversary, 18 years ago, of the tragic murder of Northern Ireland defense attorney Patrick Finucane. He was brutally shot 14 times by masked men before his wife and two young children in his North Belfast home. 
   He was a solicitor who represented republicans in many high profile cases, most notably, IRA hunger striker, Bobby Sands. But he also acted on behalf of loyalists. 
   A wide array of human rights groups alleged that his murder was at the hands of loyalist paramilitaries, colluding with British security officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch. The paramilitaries later claimed that Mr. Finucane was killed because he was a high-ranking officer in the provisional IRA. However, the police indicated at his inquest that they had no evidence to support that claim. 
   Canadian Judge Peter Cory was appointed by the governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom to examine these allegations. In 2004, the report came that sufficient evidence of collusion existed to warrant a full, independent and public inquiry without delay. 
   Madam Speaker, in order to move the Irish peace process forward, the resolution before us today calls on the Government of the United Kingdom to conduct a full, independent and public judicial inquiry into Mr. Finucane's murder, which will enjoy the full cooperation and support of his family and the international community. The time to bring justice and put an end to this tragic matter is long past due. 
   Again, I would like to thank our distinguished colleague, Mr. CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey, for his tireless pursuit of this most important issue. Mr. Smith has been a long-time friend of Ireland, and his dedication to this issue and to human rights across the globe is well known and much admired by many, certainly including myself. 
   I want to thank the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for her strong support for this measure. 
   I strongly support this legislation and encourage all of my colleagues across the full spectrum to do so as well. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I never speak for the whole committee, only for myself, but this is an exception. 
   Jo Ann Davis was respected and admired across the total political spectrum, and as I was listening to my colleagues paying tribute to this extraordinary woman, to this remarkable Member of Congress, to this unique public servant, I, of course, agreed with everything they said. But there is one aspect of Jo Ann's life that has not yet been mentioned, and that is what I would like to address. 
   She loved her district, she loved the State of Virginia, but she was also one of the great Atlantises in this body. She was passionately committed to rebuilding the alliance between Europe and the United States, and she did an extraordinary job over a long period of time successfully doing this. 
   My predecessor, Henry Hyde, and I had many conversations about her little-noticed, but enormously important, work on behalf of our effective foreign policy, on behalf of rebuilding so many of the ties that over the years had been weakened by a variety of actions. 
   Jo Ann will be missed in all of her endeavors, but those of us on the Foreign Affairs Committee will particularly miss her enormous contribution  to building alliances for the United States, for being a multilateralist, for recognizing that while we may be the one remaining superpower, we are a superpower in need of allies and friends and collaborators. 
   I want to express my deepest condolences to her family and I want to express on behalf of all of my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee our respect, our admiration and our love for our dear colleague Jo Ann Davis.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF WORLD WATER DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I would first like to commend my distinguished colleague and a former member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, for introducing this important resolution. 
   Nearly 5 years ago, representatives of governments around the globe, including the United States, stood together and agreed to reduce by one-half the number of people who lack access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by the year 2015. We now stand at the midpoint of that target, and we are no closer to reaching it than we were at the outset. 
   Today over 900 million people lack access to safe water, and over 1.3 billion people do not have access to basic sanitation. Climate change is rapidly depleting the world's already badly stretched water resources. 
   Each year more than 3 billion of our fellow human beings suffer from preventable water-related diseases. As a result of these diseases, 5 million people die. Most of these victims are children under the age of 5. Clearly, more must be done to address this humanitarian catastrophe. 
   Our legislation, H. Res. 196, demonstrates the commitment of the Congress to achieve the goals and ideals of World Water Day to increase the availability of clean water. 
   Collectively, we have the means to address this global crisis. What we need is political will for action. Congress swiftly acted with the passage of the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act in 2005, a critically important piece of legislation spearheaded by the distinguished gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) with the support of my former colleague, Chairman Henry Hyde, and myself. 
   This resolution is another step in improving our commitment to bringing clean water and basic sanitation to the poorest of the poor. H. Res. 196 urges our own government to utilize every resource at our disposal to improve access to clean water and sanitation for those most in need. It recognizes the importance of conservation and sustainable management of water resources to both human health and the quality of life. 
   We must do all we can to provide clean water and basic sanitation for all people across the globe. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this resolution and urge all of my colleagues to do so. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, first I want to thank my good friend from Florida, Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman Donald Payne and Ranking Member Chris Smith, and all the other cosponsors of this resolution for joining me in condemning the egregious violence perpetrated against innocent civilians by the Government of Zimbabwe. 
   For the past 6 years, the Government of Zimbabwe has been on a path of failed policies and distorted vision. As the economy of the country spiraled downward, the Central Bank has been unresponsive and reckless. 
   Zimbabwe was once known as Southern Africa's bread basket. But after years of disastrous misrule, the people there now find themselves eating field mice to stave off hunger. Zimbabwean officials have the temerity to declare to the world that they eat field mice because they are a delicacy. 
   On March 11, many segments of Zimbabwe's society joined together to hold a prayer breakfast to focus attention on the country's desperate situation. The government reacted swiftly, violently cracking down on the gathering. In this incident, six opposition activists were shot, and over 50 had to be hospitalized, including key opposition leaders, many of whom did not get proper treatment for their severe injuries. 
   This latest incident underscores a disturbing pattern of recent years. The Zimbabwean Government pledges peace, then commits human rights violations against its own people, and it precipitates humanitarian crisis after humanitarian crisis. In response to legitimate protests, the government has retaliated with draconian legislation and harsh security enforcement. It transformed Zimbabwe's poor children into violent militia members, not unlike child soldiers in other ravaged African countries. 
   In 2005, the Zimbabwean Government launched its infamous Operation Throw Out the Trash against citizens in major cities, driving some 700,000 innocent people from their homes, businesses, and livelihoods. 
   So I ask Mugabe, the dictator of this country, what kind of human being called himself a ``leader,'' yet is willing to commit atrocities against the very people he is supposed to lead? 
   In spite of Zimbabwe's embittered rhetoric toward the United States, our Congress passed, 6 years ago, the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act, offering significant economic and political aid to Zimbabwe if it would reverse its anti-democratic and anti-people ways. 
   Zimbabwe had invaded a neighboring country, grossly mismanaged its economy, flaunted the rule of law and democratic practices. Using the diplomatic tools at our disposal, our government imposed travel and economic sanctions against individuals who were responsible for the grossest violations. 
   The United States remains open to change in Zimbabwe, hopeful about prospects and ready to reward its arrival. We clearly provided an opportunity for Zimbabwe to reverse course and to reap generous economic benefits from the American people. 
   Unfortunately, the Zimbabwean leaders are bent on a bitter and disastrous course that no sane or rational appeal from its own citizens or the community of nations has been able to reverse. 
   Today Zimbabwe, once one of the most promising countries of Africa, is a dismal shadow of its former self. It faces an unfathomable inflation rate of  3,000 percent, the highest on the planet, and a shocking 80 percent of the people of the country are unemployed. 
   Our resolution condemns the economic and political madness that is gripping Zimbabwe and urges the government to return to sanity, end the state-sponsored violence, and address the needs of its people. 
   I, again, want to thank all of those who cosponsored my resolution and urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of H. Con. Res. 100. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of this legislation. Wherever disaster strikes, the American Red Cross is on the scene to lend a helping hand in any immediate aftermath. In times of crisis, its staff of 35,000 and over 1 million Red Cross volunteers take on the daunting task of translating the compassion of the American people into shelter, clothing, medical help, and food. Be it a fire that puts a family out of its home or a tornado that tears through an entire community, the Red Cross responds immediately, answering the call of an astonishing 75,000 incidents last year alone. 
   The relief work of the Red Cross is not limited to our borders. The Red Cross responds to tsunamis and earthquakes and other natural disasters across the globe, providing much-needed assistance to victims. Earlier this month, the Red Cross quickly mobilized to provide the Solomon Islands with safe drinking water, medical care, and emergency shelter after that country was hit with a tsunami. 
   But the American Red Cross, Madam Speaker, like so many disaster relief organizations, has come under heightened scrutiny after 9/11 and the gulf coast hurricanes of 2005. Particularly, the disaster that New Orleans and the gulf coast suffered and the response to it crystallized the need for reform of this venerable organization, which had not changed its governance structure in over half a century. The leadership of the American Red Cross undertook a 6-month, top-to-bottom comprehensive governance and performance audit. After over 100 interviews of past and present Red Cross officers, volunteer chapter leaders, donors, and many others, the verdict was in: Red Cross governance required a major overhaul. 
   Last October, Madam Speaker, the Red Cross board of governors unanimously approved a series of changes to improve the governance and the accountability of the organization. But such changes cannot be implemented  without amending the Red Cross charter, and for that to occur, congressional action is needed. That is the reason for our legislation. 
   Last month the other body acted with urgency by passing the American National Red Cross Organization Act. This House aims to act with similar urgency as we consider this bill just 3 weeks after it was introduced by my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, and myself. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1681 amends the Red Cross charter in a number of significant ways. First, the board of governors will be reduced to 25 members. Where previously some board members were selected by local chapters, some elected by the board, others appointed by the President, our legislation requires governors to be elected solely by delegates to the Red Cross' annual meeting. The responsibilities for day-to-day operations will be delegated exclusively to the Red Cross management rather than to the board. Our legislation requires the Red Cross to establish an office of ombudsman, who will report to Congress, to raise the profile of the whistleblower process for employees and volunteers and to make improvements to it. 
   Madam Speaker, while these changes would not directly affect the organization's disaster response, it will help promote the kind of leadership needed to make Red Cross management and operations run smoothly and effectively for the balance of this century.     
   I would like to express my appreciation to my friend and distinguished colleague, the ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, for cosponsoring this legislation; and I want to thank her for her commitment to ensuring that the American Red Cross remains accountable to the American people. 
   I strongly support this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (APPROVING RENEWAL OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN THE BURMESE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, let me first express my appreciation to my friend and colleague from Michigan, Congressman Levin, for his help in bringing this important legislation to the floor, and to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Charlie Rangel, for his great assistance and leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, nearly two decades ago, Aung San Suu Kyi embarked on a personal journey that would parallel the terrible nightmare of her people, the people of Burma. That was the year in which she helped found the National League for Democracy, a movement to promote democratic change in her homeland. Her long and torturous journey has led her to both a Nobel Peace Prize and seemingly eternal incarceration. 
   Rather than cede to the widespread calls and massive protests for a free and fair election, a military junta seized and maintained power in Burma. The regime feared the power of one fearless voice for democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi. 
   In 1990, the military junta finally permitted a general election, which the National League for Democracy won handily. The military promptly nullified the results, preventing the daughter of the very general who negotiated Burma's independence from taking her rightful place as Prime Minister.  
   Since then, Mr. Speaker, Aung San Suu Kyi has been tossed back and forth in and out of prison and house arrest as though she were simply a pawn in the tumultuous and chaotic game being played by the corrupt fat cats running Burma. But like the people of her nation, she is in fact much more than a pawn; she is an ardent champion of freedom, an exemplary defender of democracy, and one of the strongest willed moral beacons on this planet. 
   She stands firmly in the tradition of Gandhi, Mandela, Martin Luther King, and all other voices of the oppressed. Those legendary figures eventually delivered their people to freedom, and we in this Congress aim to help Aung San Suu Kyi to do just that. 
   Inspired by her resolve and the resolve of the Burmese people, this Congress has been committed to their cause for many years. Today, we renew import sanctions aimed at forcing democratic change in Burma, which I can say categorically is one of the most repressive regimes on the planet. 
   America's tough sanctions against Burma, including an import ban, export sanctions, and arms embargo and financial sanctions, have spurred the civilized nations of the world to take similar actions against Burma. The European Union recently updated its own set of sanctions, though they need to be even tougher. The leading members of ASEAN, who for years went out of their way to defend Burma's horrendous behavior, are now exercising their significant diplomatic muscle to promote democratic change in Burma and to free Aung San Suu Kyi.     
   The United Nations has held its first ever Security Council debate on the security threat to the Asia Pacific region posed by the Burmese regime. 
   But too many other nations, India and China in particular, continue to prop up the government through shockingly direct, blatant deals, including arms trading with this cruel junta in Burma. 
   Just this past week, Mr. Speaker, the BBC reported that in any major hotel in Rangoon, and I quote, ``Russian arms dealers, South Korean and French oilmen, Singaporean consultants and Chinese bankers are all mingling over cocktails with their Burmese counterparts.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, these despicable deals undermine the entire international effort to help the Burmese people. And so today, as we renew our import sanctions, we aim both to pressure directly the military junta in Burma, and to influence those in the international community who are currently asleep at the wheel of justice and human rights. Oppressive power can only be delegitimized when it is fully isolated. 
   Mr. Speaker, Aung San Suu Kyi remains imprisoned. So do the people of Burma. Even out of power and out of sight, she remains a powerful symbol and, therefore, a leader of the plight of some 50 million people in her native land of Burma. We must do our part to carry her torch. And I urge all of my colleagues to vote today for these sanctions once again.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res, 149, a resolution supporting International Women's Day on March 8, 2007. For several decades the international community has reserved this day to celebrate the achievements and contributions of women around the world. International Women's Day is also a time to recognize and remember the work we still have before us to achieve equal social and political rights for women. 
   Today, women all over the world are becoming leaders in every professional field imaginable. The achievements of women in politics are especially noteworthy. As we celebrate Women's History Month in the United States, it is my honor to recognize this important Day under the historic leadership of the first woman Speaker of the House, my fellow Californian, NANCY PELOSI.  
   The 110th Congress also marks the rise of six women to seven committee chair positions, the most ever held by women in any prior Congress: 
   Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD from California is chairing the House Committee on Administration; 
   Congresswoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER from New York is chairing the House Rules Committee; 
   Congresswoman NYDIA VEL&#193;ZQUEZ from New York is chairing the House Committee on Small Business; 
   Congresswoman STEPHANIE TUBBS-JONES from Ohio is chairing the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct; 
   Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN from California is chairing the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration; and 
   Senator BARBARA BOXER from California is chairing the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works and is currently Acting Chair for the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. 
   These women all honor our Nation with their distinguished service and leadership. 
   I also want to pay special tribute to my distinguished colleague Congresswoman ROS-LEHTINEN who has achieved the distinction of becoming the first woman Ranking Member on this committee. We all benefit from her contributions and those of all of the women Members who are performing important responsibilities on the Committee of Foreign Affairs with honor and distinction. 
   Despite notable political progress for women in leadership positions in the U.S. and around the world, women continue to struggle for equal social and political rights; access to health care, education and work; and freedom from civil conflict, violence, human trafficking and various cultural practices that put women's lives at risk. 
   The theme for this year's International Women's Day captures a critical goal we all must share: ``ending impunity for violence against women and girls.'' 
   While manifestations of violence against women and girls vary across social, economic, cultural and historical contexts, it is clear that violence against women and girls remains a devastating reality in all parts of the world. The global evidence is chilling. Violence against women is a pervasive violation of human rights and a major impediment to achieving gender equality, development and peace. 
   According to the United Nations:  
   Domestic violence is the largest form of abuse of women worldwide, irrespective of region, culture, ethnicity, education, class and religion. Violence against women is the most common but least punished crime in the world. 
   The number of women forced or sold into prostitution is estimated worldwide at anywhere between 700,000 and 4 million per year. Profits from sex slavery are estimated at $7 to $l2 billion per year. The number of women trafficked into forced labor put these numbers at even more astounding levels. 
   It is estimated that more than two million girls are genitally mutilated per year. 
   Systematic rape continues to be used as a weapon of terror in many of the world's recent conflicts--including Darfur, Bosnia and Rwanda.  
   While international, regional and national legal and policy frameworks have been established, to address violence against women and girls, implementation of these laws and norms remains insufficient and inconsistent around the world. Gender inequality, poverty and endless cycles of violence are exacerbated as a result of failures to hold perpetrators of violence against women and girls accountable for their actions. 
   Eliminating violence against women remains one of the most serious and urgent challenges of our time. Each one of us has a duty to support and sustain a political and social environment where violence against women and girls is not tolerated; where friends, family members, neighbors, men and women, intervene to ensure these crimes and acts are not committed with impunity. 
   I will do everything in my power as chairman to ensure that every piece of legislation we consider in this Committee will improve the security, opportunity and prosperity of women and I know my colleagues will share this important goal. 
   I want to thank my colleague Congresswoman JAN SCHAKOWSKY and the other cosponsors of this resolution for giving us this opportunity to recognize the importance of International Women's Day. I am proud to support this resolution and I urge all my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Let me first commend Speaker Pelosi for orchestrating an incredibly complex set of provisions across the full spectrum of issues and committees. It was a masterful achievement, and we are all in her debt.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, climate change presents a challenge to all of humanity. The bill before us today includes several groundbreaking international provisions to ensure America's role as the world's leader in the fight to save the planet, not as a reluctant and grudging participant. 
   Passing our bill will mark a historic turning point in this country's engagement with the international community on global warming. No longer will we debate and delay endlessly dealing with this crisis. No longer will we send low-level bureaucrats to crucial international climate change meetings with express marching orders to muzzle the science and to obstruct action. 
   I am very pleased that my friend from New Jersey, Congressman Chris Smith, joined me as the chief Republican cosponsor of the international provisions included in this bill. 
   Our legislation passed the Foreign Affairs Committee overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis, and I encourage all of our Members to vote for this historic legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, just to summarize briefly some of the comments made by my good friend from Florida, climate diplomacy has been sidelined under this administration to such an extent that expertise and diplomatic stability in climate negotiations is now almost absent in the Department of State. It is long, long overdue that we reinvigorate the capability of the Department of State on the issue of global climate change and our legislation does that. 
   We are also creating a foundation not as a bureaucracy but as an institution to act as a clearinghouse of ideas and the matchmaker amongst foreign public and private actors working on global clean energy technologies. 
   Probably no single item has contributed as much to the decline of the United States' prestige internationally than our cavalier attitude towards global climate change. With a new administration coming in less than 1 1/2 years, we preparing the ground that our global partners will again respect us and look to us for international leadership on this all-important issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3221. I am proud to sponsor this legislation as it moves this country closer toward energy independence amidst the needs of this Nation's entrepreneurs. 
   Small businesses are dramatically impacted by rising energy costs. According to a recent study conducted by the National Small Business Association, 93 percent of small business owners anticipate negative consequences to their businesses because of higher energy prices. 
   This bill includes numerous measures to help small businesses cope with these challenges. Many of these provisions offered by Mr. Shuler of our committee were designed to address the entrepreneurs' role not only as consumers but also as suppliers of energy. 
   It contains key initiatives to increase energy efficiency. With enhanced loan guarantees and lower fees on Small Business Administration loans, more small businesses will be able to purchase energy efficient technology. 
   The bill also requires the SBA to develop a national strategy for educating small firms about energy efficiency. 
   H.R. 3221 will encourage the creation of new energy efficient technologies and increase production of renewable fuels. Small businesses are the primary leaders in renewable fuels sectors, already making up more than 75 percent of biofuel producers. It creates private equity investment companies specifically for the purpose of funding renewable fuel production. 
   This legislation is the giant step forward in increasing the supply of energy while also creating smart usage. By voting for this bill, we can reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions, all while making sure our economy is moving in the right direction. 
   I commend the leadership on this important bill, and I urge its immediate passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. This bill is a result of the tireless efforts of my esteemed colleagues DIANA DEGETTE and MIKE CASTLE. I am proud to count myself among the more than 200 Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who have cosponsored this legislation. It is a bipartisan, bicameral bill that passed both Houses of Congress last year. 
   It was one of the very few truly bipartisan bills to leave this building during the previous Congress. Unfortunately, despite all the public support, despite all the bipartisan support, despite all the hope millions of Americans invested in this legislation, the President decided to invoke his first, and only, veto. 
   This important piece of legislation authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to support research involving embryonic stem cells, regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from an embryo. There are stringent ethical guidelines included in this bill. First among them requires that researchers work only with stem cells from embryos that would have otherwise been discarded by fertility clinics. Furthermore, the legislation stipulates that embryos can be used only if the donors give their written consent and receive no money or other inducement in exchange for the embryos. 
   These strict ethical standards are critical to the advancement of this ground breaking science. The scientific community has the opportunity to ease the suffering of thousands of Americans and their families. A new round of federally funded stem cell research is desperately needed in order to find cures and treatments for diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, ALS, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. 
   The State of California recognized early on the extraordinary significance of stem cell research. The people of California voted for Proposition 71 to provide $3 billion to unleash the dynamic force of medical research and unlock the promise of life saving scientific research. Researchers in my district are already hard at work and with the enactment of this legislation the scientific community in the bay area will be unshackled. They will lead the way to help those who have been stricken with debilitating diseases. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my great hope that this legislation will soon be on the President's desk awaiting his signature. I urge the President to listen to the will of Congress and the pleas of the American people and sign this bill into law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a singularly important piece of legislation which I bring to my colleagues with great personal enthusiasm and some fond memories. 
   Let me first pay tribute to our late colleague, Senator Paul Simon, after whom this legislation is named. Paul was a firm champion not only of education, higher education, but also education abroad, this incredibly important aspect in a growingly interdependent world. It is appropriate that this piece of legislation be named after our great late colleague, Paul Simon. 
   Mr. Speaker, for 10 years, first I established and then I had the privilege of directing the Study Abroad Program of the California State University and College System. When I established that program, it was a path-breaking enterprise because historically study abroad was the privilege of only the wealthy and those who attended uniquely elite institutions. 
   Our legislation expands the opportunity for study abroad that hopefully will involve annually about a million of our college and university students. 
   Not too many years ago, study abroad was the opportunity for some wealthy college students to spend some time in France or Italy or maybe in Germany. But in an increasingly globalized world, our need to have young men and women who are conversant in the languages of many countries and who are familiar with the cultures of many countries is an absolute necessity for our national security and our national well-being. 
   This historic piece of legislation will democratize the program of Study Abroad, which used to be the privilege of a very thin layer of our society. It opens up for every American college student, irrespective of his or her socioeconomic status, the opportunity of spending a year or more involved in serious language and area study all over the world.     
   At a time when new languages are required by vast numbers of our young people, Chinese, Indian, Arabic and others, this will provide a dramatic upgrading of our ability to interact with the rest of the globe. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation which will usher in a new era for American higher education for college students all over the United States.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (RELATING TO THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REUNIFICATION OF JERUSALEM -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join my good friend from Florida, the distinguished ranking member of our committee, in recognizing the 40th anniversary of one of the great military triumphs of the 20th century, the so-called Six Day War. Some of us remember and everybody has read about the attempt of the neighboring Arab countries to annihilate the State of Israel 40 years ago. In a brilliant preemptive move, the Israeli military moved ahead and destroyed the air forces and much of the military of the neighboring countries which were ready to destroy it. 
   The Six Day War transformed the shape of the Middle East and brought about the unification of the city of Jerusalem. Prior to the Six Day War, Jerusalem was closed to Israelis. Following the Six Day War, members of all faiths have had full and free access to the city of Jerusalem, and places of worship, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, are available to all individuals who seek an opportunity for peaceful prayer.  
   This body and the other body some years back called for the proper placement of the United States embassy in Israel's capital in Jerusalem. My good friend, the late Senator Patrick Moynihan, and I introduced this legislation which was strongly supported with significant majorities in both the House and the Senate. But administrations since that time have seen fit to postpone the move of our embassy to Jerusalem. 
   I earnestly hope that with this commemorative resolution we again call the attention of this administration to its promise, clear and unequivocal, to move the embassy to Israel's capital, Jerusalem. Our embassy is in the capital of every single country with which we maintain diplomatic relations and the capital is designated by the country concerned. It is long overdue that this administration honor the President's personal commitment to move the United States embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, before yielding back my time, I would like to make a couple of observations. As my colleagues pointed out, two of Israel's neighbors, Jordan and Egypt, have signed historic peace agreements with the State of Israel. And while this peace is not a full-fledged, blossoming, all-encompassing peace agreement, it certainly has meant the end of hostilities and the beginning of commercial, cultural, educational, touristic and diplomatic relations.     
   The time is long overdue for Israel to be able to reach an agreement with both Lebanon and Syria, as well as the Palestinian people, so this long-suffering area, where all of the people have suffered for far too long and far too severely, at long last can be a region of peace and reconciliation. 
   For this to come about, terrorism must end. You cannot make peace with people who are plotting daily to destroy your very existence. When Israel evacuated Gaza, it expected peace from that area. But, under Hamas, daily rocket attacks are unleashed on peaceful civilian Israeli border communities. Two women were killed just in recent weeks as a result of these monstrousattacks. Hezbollah in the north similarly is sworn to terrorism. 
   This must be put to an end if this important region is to join much of the rest of the world in moving ahead with economic progress, social progress, and the reconciliation of people. 
   I honestly hope that our resolution paying tribute to the victory 40 years ago and reminding ourselves of our formal commitment to move the U.S. Embassy to its proper location in Jerusalem will serve as a reminder that the time is long overdue for normalizing the situation in this region. 
   The end of terrorism, the move of our Embassy, will bring about a long prayed for and hoped for period of peace.

   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the only Member in the history of Congress who survived the Holocaust and was liberated by the Russian Army. I was therefore opposed to the decision and continue to remain opposed to the decision by the government of Estonia to move a memorial honoring Russian soldiers for their historic sacrifice during World War II in liberating Estonia and many other parts of Europe from Hitler's domination. What came afterward, however, is an entirely different issue. 
   On April 27, over 1,000 pro-Russian demonstrators gathered in Tallinn, the beautiful small capital of Estonia. That group soon got out of control. Riots broke out across the city. Finally, over 150 people were injured. One person died. 
   The next day, the Embassy of Estonia in Moscow was surrounded by angry, pro-Russian demonstrators who demanded the resignation of the government of Estonia. The Estonian ambassador was physically attacked by demonstrators during an official press conference. Even the Swedish ambassador to Russia was assaulted when he left the Estonian Embassy in Moscow. 
   Since the initial riots in Tallinn, the Estonian government has reported other coordinated attacks against its Embassies in Helsinki, Finland; Oslo, Norway; Copenhagen, Denmark; Stockholm, Sweden; Riga; Prague and Kiev. 
   The Estonian government, with the assistance of NATO, has also been investigating cyber attacks against the government's Web site, as well as against the computer systems of political parties, banks, and media organizations in Estonia. Cyber attacks in this day and age, Mr. Speaker, can be devastating. The Estonian government estimates that these attacks cost the targets tens of millions of Euros, a significant sum for a small country like Estonia. 
   These incidents of violence have been condemned by a host of European institutions. The European Commission has expressed its solidarity with Estonia and urged Russia to respect its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. NATO has issued a similar statement condemning the violence. 
   So, today, we in Congress join our friends in Europe in expressing our strong disapproval of the unjustified and unacceptable Russian attacks against Estonia, and we express our strong solidarity with the people and government of the great democratic nation of Estonia. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this all-important measure.

   We had high hopes when the Soviet Union collapsed over 15 years ago, but many recent statements by Mr. Putin and many actions by Russia, including the action that we have just heard described against the free and democratic Republic of Estonia, fill us with a great deal of concern and anxiety. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to attend this joint session of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee in a few weeks in our hope that before the President and Mr. Putin meet in Kennebunkport we might have a legislative opportunity of exploring candidly all of the issues that, at the moment, seem to divide us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 427) urging the Government of Canada to end the commercial seal hunt. 
   The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 
   The text of the resolution is as follows 
   H. Res. 427 
   Whereas on November 15, 2006, the Government of Canada opened a commercial hunt for seals in the waters off the east coast of Canada;
   Whereas an international outcry regarding the plight of the seals hunted in Canada resulted in the 1983 ban by the European Union of whitecoat and blueback seal skins and the subsequent collapse of the commercial seal hunt in Canada;
   Whereas the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) bars the import into the United States of seal products;
   Whereas in February 2003, the Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans in Canada authorized the highest quota for harp seals in Canadian history, allowing nearly 1,000,000 seals to be killed over a 3-year period;
   Whereas more than 1,000,000 seals have been killed over the past 3 years;
   Whereas harp seal pups can legally be hunted in Canada as soon as they have begun to molt their white coats at approximately 12 days of age;
   Whereas 95 percent of the seals killed over the past 5 years were pups between just 12 days and 12 weeks of age, many of which had not yet eaten their first solid meal or taken their first swim;
   Whereas a report by an independent team of veterinarians invited to observe the hunt by the International Fund for Animal Welfare concluded that the seal hunt failed to comply with basic animal welfare regulations in Canada and that governmental regulations regarding humane killing were not being respected or enforced;
   Whereas the veterinary report concluded that as many as 42 percent of the seals studied were likely skinned while alive and conscious;
   Whereas the commercial slaughter of seals in the Northwest Atlantic is inherently cruel, whether the killing is conducted by clubbing or by shooting;
   Whereas many seals are shot in the course of the hunt, but escape beneath the ice where they die slowly and are never recovered, and these seals are not counted in official kill statistics, making the actual kill level far higher than the level that is reported;
   Whereas the commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals is a commercial slaughter carried out almost entirely by non-Native people from the East Coast of Canada for seal fur, oil, and penises (used as aphrodisiacs in some Asian markets);
   Whereas the fishing and sealing industries in Canada continue to justify the expanded seal hunt on the grounds that the seals in the Northwest Atlantic are preventing the recovery of cod stocks, despite the lack of any credible scientific evidence to support this claim;
   Whereas two Canadian government marine scientists reported in 1994 that the true cause of cod depletion in the North Atlantic was over-fishing, and the consensus among the international scientific community is that seals are not responsible for the collapse of cod stocks;
   Whereas harp and hooded seals are a vital part of the complex ecosystem of the Northwest Atlantic, and because the seals consume predators of commercial cod stocks, removing the seals might actually inhibit recovery of cod stocks;
   Whereas certain ministries of the Government of Canada have stated clearly that there is no evidence that killing seals will help groundfish stocks to recover; and
   Whereas the persistence of this cruel and needless commercial hunt is inconsistent with the well-earned international reputation of Canada: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,  That the House of Representatives urges the Government of Canada to end the commercial hunt on seals.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA TO END THE COMMERCIAL SEAL HUNT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are all familiar with National Geographic images of fluffy white baby seals nestled next to their mothers. We stare at them on our TV screens or in our magazines and reflexively remark about how adorable they are. But now imagine, if you can, the brutal death that awaits hundreds of thousands of these baby seals every single year. With stunning barbarism, Canadian hunters swoop in with heavy clubs and stun guns to immobilize these little innocent creatures. They are then skinned alive simply so that their soft white fur can adorn winter coats, coats that could be composed of different materials without torturing animals. 
   These gruesome images are sadly commonplace in the Canadian Northwest. The Canadian Government estimates that over 1 million seals have been killed in the most recent 3-year period. Public outcry over this barbarism led to a ban of all seal products in the United States and in the European Union in 1983. Unfortunately, the public seems to have forgotten that the grisly practices of commercial seal hunters still go on, and international pressure on Canada to end the hunt has abated. 
   My resolution brings the focus of the United States Congress back to this heinous yearly slaughter. It urges the Canadian Government to cease this gruesome practice and bring Canadian policy in line with that of the United States and the European Union. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me note that this annual seal slaughter, enacted for mere vanity and vulgar consumerism, is also having deleterious effects on the ecosystem. Nature's careful balance is being thrown off by the depletion of the seal population. The barbaric seal hunt disturbs the food chain, hurting the fishing industry, which is now suffering in Canada. 
   Ending the commercial seal hunt is not simply a matter of saving beautiful and innocent animals that tug at our hearts. It is a matter of intelligent ecomanagement, prevention of cruelty against animals, and helping our friends to the north restore their otherwise pristine international reputation. Killing baby seals echoes the torture and cruel killing of so many other animals around the world. As cochairman of the Congressional Friends of Animals Caucus, I will continue to bring the world's attention to such practices wherever they exist. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important and humane resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (SENSE OF HOUSE THAT JAPAN SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR ITS IMPERIAL ARMED FORCE'S COERCION OF YOUNG WOMEN INTO SEXUAL SLAVERY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 121) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Government of Japan should formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Force's coercion of young women into sexual slavery, known to the world as ``comfort women'', during its colonial and wartime occupation of Asia and the Pacific Islands from the 1930s through the duration of World War II, as amended. 
   The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 
   The text of the resolution is as follows 
   H. Res. 121 
   Whereas the Government of Japan, during its colonial and wartime occupation of Asia and the Pacific Islands from the 1930s through the duration of World War II, officially commissioned the acquisition of young women for the sole purpose of sexual servitude to its Imperial Armed Forces, who became known to the world as ianfu or ``comfort women'';
   Whereas the ``comfort women'' system of forced military prostitution by the Government of Japan, considered unprecedented in its cruelty and magnitude, included gang rape, forced abortions, humiliation, and sexual violence resulting in mutilation, death, or eventual suicide in one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century;
   Whereas some new textbooks used in Japanese schools seek to downplay the ``comfort women'' tragedy and other Japanese war crimes during World War II;
   Whereas Japanese public and private officials have recently expressed a desire to dilute or rescind the 1993 statement by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono on the ``comfort women'', which expressed the Government's sincere apologies and remorse for their ordeal;
   Whereas the Government of Japan did sign the 1921 International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children and supported the 2000 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security which recognized the unique impact on women of armed conflict;
   Whereas the House of Representatives commends Japan's efforts to promote human security, human rights, democratic values, and rule of law, as well as for being a supporter of Security Council Resolution 1325;  
   Whereas the United States-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of United States security interests in Asia and the Pacific and is fundamental to regional stability and prosperity;
   Whereas, despite the changes in the post-cold war strategic landscape, the United States-Japan alliance continues to be based on shared vital interests and values in the Asia-Pacific region, including the preservation and promotion of political and economic freedoms, support for human rights and democratic institutions, and the securing of prosperity for the people of both countries and the international community;
   Whereas the House of Representatives commends those Japanese officials and private citizens whose hard work and compassion resulted in the establishment in 1995 of Japan's private Asian Women's Fund;
   Whereas the Asian Women's Fund has raised $5,700,000 to extend ``atonement'' from the Japanese people to the comfort women; and
   Whereas the mandate of the Asian Women's Fund, a government-initiated and largely government-funded private foundation whose purpose was the carrying out of programs and projects with the aim of atonement for the maltreatment and suffering of the ``comfort women'', came to an end on March 31, 2007, and the Fund has been disbanded as of that date: Now, therefore, be it

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me first commend my good friend and our distinguished colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda), for introducing this very important resolution and for all his hard work to give voice to the so-called ``comfort women.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the true strength of a nation is tested when it is forced to confront the darkest chapters in its history. Will it have the courage to face up to the truth of its own past, or will it run from that truth in the foolish hope that truth will fade with time. 
   The Government of Japan's unwillingness to offer a formal and unequivocal apology to the women forced by its Army to be sex slaves during World War II stands in stark contrast to Japan's positive role in the world today. Japan is a proud global leader and a valued ally of the United States, which makes its unwillingness to account honestly for this part of its past all the more perplexing.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (IRAN SANCTIONS ENABLING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I commend the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, my good friend Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, for authoring this critical piece of legislation, of which I am proud to be a principal cosponsor. This bill, H.R. 2347 the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2007, is a critical element in a network of efforts intended to prevent the realization of a nightmare, a nuclear-armed Iran. 
   Several of us in this body have been working ceaselessly to achieve--by peaceful means--an end to Iran's quest for nuclear status. We have produced several pieces of legislation to achieve that end. The goal of all of this legislation is to deprive Iran, insofar as possible, of the benefit of its cash-cow, oil sales. And the means of doing this is to deter foreign investment in Iran's energy industry. 
   Mr. Speaker, the primary purpose of this bill, H.R. 2347, is to allow state and local governments to contribute to this effort by divesting their pension plans of any foreign entity that invests in Iran. This legislation does not require them to divest, but it would certainly seem to be a wise course for them to choose, since foreign entities that invest in Iran's energy industry are subject to U.S. sanctions and therefore liable to lose a significant part of whatever their prior value may have been. 
   Iran's bid for nuclear arms is the challenge of our age. Iran already seeks to dominate the Middle East through intimidation, including sponsorship of terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. If it achieves nuclear status, Tehran will greatly enlarge its sway in this volatile region and will likely touch off a regional nuclear arms race as well. Worse, at least one of Iran's leading political figures has intimated that Iran would be willing to use those arms to advance its well-known, reprehensible aims, and there is good reason to believe that other Iranian leaders subscribe to the same view. 
   H.R. 2347 helps to fortify the barrier we are trying to erect to deter all foreign investment in Iran's energy sector and therefore deprive Iran's theocratic regime of the funds it needs to pay for its horrific nuclear goals.  
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation, and I urge all my colleagues to do likewise.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference agreement on H.R. 1585 and would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Chairman Ike Skelton, for his hard work and leadership on this important legislation. I am grateful for his partnership on critical matters of national security. 
   The struggle against terrorism requires a global campaign centered on engagement with the Muslim world. It also requires us to strengthen our partners' capabilities to fight terror and to maintain our own military capabilities in this area. 
   I welcome the efforts by the Committee on Armed Services to adjust the Department of Defense's legal authorities to meet this challenge. To its credit, the Department recognizes that ``soft'' power makes the use of military force more effective by fostering stability among vulnerable populations. To that end, the Pentagon has sought a variety of foreign assistance-related authorities traditionally implemented by the State Department. 
   I particularly welcome the Defense Department's efforts to address shortcomings in our national security bureaucracy. In the arena of stability operations, I, more than anyone, am aware of the budget shortfalls confronting the State Department, and I am fully aware that the men and women in uniform do not at times receive the expanded support that they need during stabilization operations. 
   I am also pleased that the Defense authorization bill follows the lead of H.R. 885, the Lantos-Hobson ``International Nuclear Fuel for Peace and Nonproliferation Act, passed by the House in June, to designate $50 million to support the establishment of an international nuclear fuel bank, under multilateral control and direction, to remove any rational incentive for countries to build their own uranium enrichment plants--facilities that can make fuel for both civil power reactors and nuclear weapons. It also supports international efforts to build international pressure on Iran by addressing Tehran's claims that it must build a massive enrichment facility because there is no international assurance of supply of reactor fuel. 
   Notwithstanding these gains, there are a few aspects of this legislation which require continued vigilant oversight by the Foreign Affairs and Defense committees. First, we must ensure that the administration and the Congress work together to develop appropriate nonproliferation safeguards for implementation of the fuel bank. In particular, I look forward to working with the executive branch on criteria for access by foreign countries to any fuel bank established by the IAEA with materials or funds provided by the United States. 
   Second, to the extent that core functions of the State Department are being duplicated by the Department of Defense, both the Defense and Foreign Relations committees must ensure that the national instruments of soft power remain coherent, coordinated and sufficiently authorized and funded. In the words of Secretary Robert Gates:  
   If we are to meet the myriad challenges around the world in the coming decades, this country must strengthen other important elements of national power both institutionally and financially, and create the capability to integrate and apply all of the elements of national power to problems and challenges abroad.  
   We must ensure that the State Department in particular is adequately resourced to maximize its role in the fight against terror. Our oversight must also ensure that assistance is carried out both by the Defense and State departments in a coordinated, unified fashion. In that spirit, I look forward to reviewing the report required by Section 1209 of this bill, which will require the Department of Defense to provide a global snapshot of the foreign assistance activities it currently undertakes. 
   I again applaud the work of my colleagues in producing a bill that is a tribute to our men and women in uniform and advances American security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, as we come to the end of this debate, I want to commend every participant on both sides for conveying powerfully and eloquently their deeply held views. 
   I started this debate in the firm belief that escalation is a flawed idea. After listening carefully for the past 4 days to all of my colleagues, I am more convinced than ever that escalation is a flawed idea. 
   Escalation is not only the wrong policy for the United States, it is also the  wrong policy for Iraq. If Iraq is to succeed as a stable and prosperous state, it must learn to take responsibility. It must learn to make difficult decisions. It must amend its constitution in the interests of Iraqi reconciliation. It must devise an equitable law for sharing its oil and gas revenues. And it must take primary responsibility for its own security. 
   Unless we de-escalate, Iraq will never step up to the plate. But that is not the only reason we must de-escalate. Unless we do so, our great Nation will be unable to fulfill its many far-flung global responsibilities. Unless we de-escalate, we will simply lack the resources for critical tasks here at home and overseas. 
   All of us, Madam Speaker, are passionately committed to supporting and defending our troops. In the coming weeks, my fellow Democrats and I will bring forth specific proposals to enhance this Nation's support and defense of our brave troops. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people are not well-served by the surge and our present course in Iraq. This omelet cannot be unscrambled. There have been far too many mistakes made to undo the damage. 
   For the sake of Iraq, for the sake of our own national interests and for the sake of our incomparable troops, de-escalation must begin, and it must begin now. 
   I strongly support the resolution and urge all of my colleagues to do so. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF CONGRESSMAN HENRY J. HYDE -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join this commemoration of the extraordinary life of Henry Hyde, the late, able chairman of the House International Relations Committee. The United States House of Representatives lost an institutional legend this year, and those of us lucky enough to have served with Henry Hyde lost a treasured friend. Although Henry and I did not always agree on matters of policy, I have a deep and lasting respect for his service to this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, Henry Hyde was a giant. His integrity, intelligence and patriotism were of towering proportions. Our friendship always transcended partisan political considerations and was reminiscent of an era of congressional collegiality. Henry's passionate commitment to public service and to the American people will serve as a beacon for generations. 
   Henry Hyde had a wide variety of legislative feathers in his cap, but I wish today to speak about two particularly notable accomplishments. The first rightfully bears his name--the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act. This bipartisan agreement was done with cooperation in both Chambers. It represents the right way of legislating--ample preparation, consideration of all ideas, bipartisan cooperation, cordial relations with the other body, and keen attention to institutional prerogatives. 
   Also under Henry's leadership, Congress approved groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation to fund the global battle against the scourge of HIV/AIDS. The U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 would not have happened without Henry's strength and persistence, and it stands as a testament to his life and work. Henry memorably--and astutely--compared the scourge of HIV/AIDS to the bubonic plague in its tragic scope. We are now in the midst of renewing the mandate of this vital legislation, and Henry's leading role in it will be very much on his colleagues' minds. 
   A member of the International Relations Committee since 1982, Henry was a key figure in debates and decisions about war and peace, international arms control, the expansion of NATO, and United Nations reform. He also served with distinction on the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, but I will let others speak to his achievements there. And of course, the continued, devoted support by his constituents through 16 terms in Congress speaks volumes about his work on behalf of his district. 
   Mr. Speaker, Henry chaired the International Relations Committee for 6 years, through some of the most pivotal and riveting challenges of our times. He wielded his gavel with fairness, intellectual honesty and no small amount of wit. Some of us may disagree with some of his policies, but he was a true gentleman of the House, and he will be deeply and sincerely missed.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 11 AS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have before us today a resolution whose purpose is, ``Recognizing September 11 as a day of remembrance,'' extending sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, ``honoring the heroic actions of our Nation's first responders and Armed Forces, and reaffirming the commitment of defending the people of the United States against any and all future challenges.'' 
   Certainly, Mr. Speaker, I remember. Like millions of others in this country and around the globe, I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I first heard the news of this hideous atrocity. 
   Like millions of others, I was profoundly shocked, sickened, and horrified by the scenes I saw unfolding that day. And in me there grew a cold anger. We will get those who did this, I said to myself back then. No matter how long it takes, we will defeat them. We will do everything in our power to protect the people of the United States. 
   Recently, Mr. Speaker, we took a major step in that direction by enacting, with bipartisan support, legislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. By so doing, we addressed major security vulnerabilities, improving our homeland security across the board. 
   But much more needs to be done. Al Qaeda remains a serious threat to the United States. The leadership of that group has been reconstituted and the terrorists have formed many small independent cells. One such cell was broken up just within the last few days in Germany. 
   In order to triumph in the war of ideas with the extremists, we need to learn how best to use many forms of soft power, economic, financial, diplomatic, and cultural, which are available to us and to our allies. 
   We in Congress can help by making sure that the foreign operations budget is fully funded, our principle instrument of soft power. We need to stop frittering away our resources, military, diplomatic and economic, on a ceaseless religious war in Iraq. 
   The administration is making its case before Congress this week to stay the course in the Iraq war, which it continues cynically to conflate with the global balance struggle against fundamentalist extremism, even with the 9/11 attacks themselves. It continues to disturb me to hear the administration linking Iraq with the attacks perpetrated by Osama bin Laden and his thugs, especially when they are still at large. 
   The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that we will not forget what really happened on that dark day 6 years ago. We will not forget the victims of 9/11, or the heroic first responders who sacrificed their lives, or the fighting men and women who carried the battle to the mountains of Afghanistan and rooted out the Taliban. 
   We recommit ourselves today, as we have each year at this time for the past 6 years, to continue the fight against those who seek to destroy our American way of life, to deny us our constitutional rights and our freedoms. 
   We will not forget. We will not falter in our resolve to protect our homeland. We shall remember our heroes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a solemn commitment to those who lost their lives in the 9/11 attacks, to the people who lived through those brutal events, and to all of their loved ones. Honoring this commitment will help spare others in our country from enduring similar pain and loss. It is the right and responsible thing to do. 
   We need to apply the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, including the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. 
   Mr. Speaker, until now we in the Congress have only partially met our responsibility to assure that these recommendations are fully implemented. 
   Today on this floor we are adopting the rest of those recommendations as we promised. As the 9/11 Commission recognized, the struggle between the forces of tolerance and pluralism and the forces of nihilism and destruction is not confined to a single dimension. It is a war of ideas as well as a war of arms. It is a challenge of diplomacy and development as well as one of intelligence and ideology. Our bill recognizes this fact in a number of ways. 
   It includes the commission's recommendation to establish an International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund to help expand, improve, and modernize the public education system in the Muslim world, an idea whose time surely has come. 
   Our legislation directs the Secretary of State to develop a 5-year country-by-country strategy of promoting democracy, the rule of law, sustainable development, private sector growth, and open economic systems. This provision will focus on building democratic institutions and not focus on elections alone. 
   We are establishing a Middle East Foundation in order to facilitate the delivery of assistance to our friends in the region who are involved in civil society, to increase political participation and to foster independent media. We have sought to follow the commission's advice to restore the moral leadership of the United States by increasing our public diplomacy efforts, including the expansion of U.S. scholarship, exchange, and library programs in the Muslim world.     
   Mr. Speaker, the treatment of detainees in the war on terrorism has undermined our national security. It has eroded our moral standing in the world and made it more difficult for the intelligence services of our friends and allies to work closely with us. Our bill will provide additional review over what the administration has done to create a common coalition approach on all these matters. 
   Mr. Speaker, our bill also addresses U.S. policy towards three countries whose role is critical in the war on terrorism: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. It reaffirms our commitment to a stable and democratic Afghanistan so that no future terrorist acts may be launched from that country, it provides that the United States must work with Pakistan to end the use of its territory as a safe haven for Taliban and al Qaeda, and it provides us additional oversight tools over our relationship with Saudi Arabia. 
   Our legislation, Mr. Speaker, strengthens our efforts to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. It addresses the emergence of a black market in nuclear technology that has facilitated the development of nuclear programs in Iran, North Korea, Libya and elsewhere. Our legislation provides for sanctions against individuals and corporations which deal in this illegal trade in nuclear materials and technology. It will help us determine which countries are allowing such black markets to operate from their territories. 
   Our legislation makes significant improvements in the effectiveness of U.S. nonproliferation programs. Our bill removes all impediments to securing and eliminating so-called ``loose nukes'' and the dangerous nuclear material that terrorists could use one day against us. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a comprehensive package that has been supported by members of the 9/11 Commission. It is not the end of our work of protecting our Nation's security, requiring constant vigilance by this Congress. 
   I encourage all of our colleagues to look around this Chamber as we conduct this debate. If not for the heroism of a dedicated handful of Americans, this building, this Chamber and this shining monument to democracy might well have been reduced to ashes on September 11, 2001. We have a commitment to ensure that the lessons of that day are a permanent part of their legacy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman), the chairman select of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee, and I ask unanimous consent that he control the balance of our time.

   Mr. LANTOS. Let me first say, I strongly agree with my good friend from Virginia in opposing genocide. Genocide has nothing to do with this legislation. Let's make that clear. 
   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side are misrepresenting provisions in H.R. 1 that strengthen and reform the Proliferation Security Initiative. They are attempting to exhume an old tactic: Scare the American people with the specter of the all-powerful, irresistible military machine that is the United Nations. 
   Of course, Mr. Speaker, this characterization is as absurd as ever and has about as much substance as Shakespeare's Banquo's Ghost. But it is part and parcel of the irrational opposition to all things multilateral even when multilateral and international institutions clearly benefit American interests. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, our bill seeks to use international law to our benefit. Our bill seeks to broaden the Proliferation Security Initiative's authorities under international law to help us convince more nations to support U.S. efforts to stop and prevent the illicit trade in dangerous items of proliferation concern. It does not relinquish any responsibility to the United Nations. 
   Current international law gives no basis for partners in the Proliferation Security Initiative to intercept shipments related to weapons of mass destruction. One cannot overcome this weakness by ad hoc assemblages of coalitions of the willing. 
   Even the White House has admitted that international law is weak in this regard and needs to be strengthened. 
   Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit would in fact weaken U.S. counter proliferation efforts by undermining effective action at the United Nations to increase Proliferation Security Initiative's global legitimacy and authority. 
   Mr. Speaker, we will never allow any other government or international organization to control what actions we take to safeguard U.S. national security, but we will use international tools that are available to us in the real world to protect America regardless of the purely ideological preferences of some on the other side. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit, and yield the balance of the time to my good friend from Missouri, the distinguished chairman of the committee on Armed Services, Ike Skelton.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 884, and I commend the gentlemen from New York and Mississippi for moving this legislation forward. 
   In the war on terrorists, we are often racing against our enemies as they develop new threats and we develop new countermeasures. This has been true throughout the history of warfare and it remains true today, whether we are talking about improvised explosive devices, shoe bombs, or attacks using chlorine gas. 
   In this competition to combat new threats, cooperation on science and technology with our allies is a key force multiplier, and I commend the gentlemen for moving forward with this legislation. 
   But we have to make sure that these cooperative programs are properly coordinated and consistent with existing programs and law. I believe that before the Department of Homeland Security initiates a new program, the Secretary of State should be in full agreement with the proposed cooperation to ensure that there is no duplication of efforts with State Department anti-terrorism efforts. In addition, this new framework should recognize that: 
   In accordance with section 622(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Secretary of State is responsible ``for continuous supervision and general direction'' of U.S. foreign assistance; 
   In accordance with section 504 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal year 1979, the Secretary of State shall have primary responsibility for coordination and oversight with respect to all major science or science and technology agreements and activities between the United States and foreign countries; and 
   In accordance with the Case-Zablocki Act, no international agreement may be signed or otherwise concluded without prior consultation by the Secretary of State. 
   While I do not believe that H.R. 844 is inconsistent with coordination with the Secretary of State or with these authorities and requirements, I look forward to working with the gentleman from Mississippi and gentleman from New York as H.R. 844 moves forward on legislative language to provide for a specific role for the Secretary of State in this process and to reflect these existing authorities. And I appreciate the gentlemen's willingness to work with me on these issues.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (TRIBUTE TO FATHER ROBERT F. DRINAN, SJ -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today to honor a remarkable man, whose recent passing leaves a tremendous void in the world. I am referring of course to Father Robert Frederick Drinan, the first Catholic priest to serve as a voting Member of Congress and a pioneer advocate for human rights. 
   According to news reports Father Drinan passed away from complications from pneumonia and congestive heart failure, but during his life Father Drinan spoke out clearly and loudly on behalf of those without a voice. His passion to protect the fundamental rights of the human condition both great and small was second to none. 
   Mr. Speaker, Father Drinan's was a powerful force on behalf of human rights and he helped pave the way for the establishment of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus. Although I came to Congress after he was forced to resign his seat, I fondly remember working with him in the defense of Soviet Jews in the early 1980s and I recall that he was routinely denied entry into the Soviet Union because of these convictions. 
   I think it is poignant to know that Father Drinan never got caught up in the trappings of power or the personal ambitions of high public office. The best evidence of this fact is that Father Drinan never considered resigning from the priesthood when Pope John Paul II asked him to retire from Congress or resign. 
   Robert Drinan was born in 1921 in Boston and entered the Society of Jesus after graduating from Boston College in 1942. He completed his seminary work at Weston College, where noted activist Daniel Berrigan was a classmate. After earning a master's degree from Boston College in 1947, Father Drinan headed south to Washington, DC, where he received two law degrees from Georgetown University. Father Drinan was ordained in 1953 and completed his doctorate in theology from Rome's Gregorian University. In 1955 he returned to his native Boston to take a position as associate dean and professor at Boston College Law School. He became dean of the law school until 1969, when he left to run for Congress. After besting a 14-term Member in the Democratic primary, Father Drinan sailed to victory to become the first Catholic priest to be elected as a voting Member of Congress. During his 10 years as a Member of the House of Representatives, Father Drinan was an active member of the House Judiciary Committee and brought the first resolution of impeachment against President Nixon. For years after he left office until his death he continued to write and teach as a professor at the Georgetown University Law School. 
   Mr. Speaker, during his time in Congress Father Drinan's dual role as priest and Representative personified the beauty of our constitutional underpinning of the separation of church and state. Using his priestly authority, he easily fit the mold of moral architect on efforts to end the war in Vietnam and to highlight abuses of human rights around the globe. However, he also disregarded church doctrine to faithfully represent the views of his ``pro-choice'' constituency on issues like abortion that rankled and angered many conservative Catholics. 
   Truly, Father Drinan was a beacon to follow for those of us who know the difficulties and challenges of having to fight for sometimes unpopular positions. He fought those fights all of his remarkable life that we will long remember.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Chairman, I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee, my good friend from Minnesota, COLLIN PETERSON, for his outstanding leadership on this critically important bill. 
   Today we reconfirm one of this government's most solemn commitments: reaching out to help the most desperate people on the planet. By reauthorizing and strengthening the longstanding and successful Public Law 480 food aid program, we show the entire world that we are serious about using our vast resources for resoundingly positive action. 
   The 850 million people around the globe without sufficient food cling to a precarious existence: foraging for daily sustenance, unable to take care of their starving families, and locked into a perpetual cycle of poverty and hunger. 
   The lack of food is particularly vicious for HIV and AIDS patients, whose medications often make them even hungrier. They now live longer with the medications the United States has provided under landmark legislation we in Congress passed 5 years ago, but, Madam Chairman, in a cruel twist of fate, they trade the pains of the disease for the pangs of hunger. 
   The plight of the starving represents one of the most disturbing and dire societal shortfalls on this planet, and addressing worldwide hunger represents the most unambiguous American moral obligation that faces us today. 
   That is why the international food aid programs reauthorized in Chairman Peterson's bill we are considering today demand our full and enthusiastic support. We sit here discussing this bill in the comfortable, air-conditioned Capitol, where we cannot really fathom what it is like to be scrounging for food in one of the world's many developing nations. I hope my colleagues will remember this when considering any effort to weaken these indispensable initiatives. 
   Our bill reauthorizes the historic and widely praised Public Law 480 food aid program. Public Law 480 was originally established in 1954, and it propelled the United States into worldwide leadership in the donation of food to developing nations and their millions of people. For more than half a century, our groundbreaking law has utilized the abundant agriculture resources of America to help ameliorate hunger around the globe. 
   Public Law 480 and the other food aid programs are so successful because of a simple recipe: the combination of the American people's compassion, and the dedication of private organizations and the companies that make the programs work. This supply chain highlights the unparalleled productivity of our farmers and processors and the dedication of those who administer, transport, and distribute food aid. 
   This broad and diverse network has enabled Congress and the executive branch to sustain strong funding levels to feed the world's hungry for decades. Our legislation before Congress today maintains this strong coalition; yet at the same time, it updates and modernizes the program to make it more effective. 
   I am particularly delighted to highlight that this bill restores mandatory funding for the landmark McGovern-Dole program, which lives up to the accomplishments of the two great former Senators, one Republican, one Democrat, who created it. This program specifically targets the legions among the world's starving who are least able to help themselves: the children of the poor across the globe. 
   The bill also increases funding for developmental food aid. The administration in recent years has blurred the line between so-called ``developmental food aid'' and ``emergency food aid.'' But with 850 million people starving on this planet and the vast majority of them chronically short of sustenance, the beneficiaries of developmental food aid are just as needy as recipients of emergency food aid. They don't care what pot of money funds the donated food; they only care to see their families fed. 
   The manager's amendment proposed by the distinguished chairman Mr. Peterson includes language that was passed by my Foreign Affairs Committee authorizing a critical $2.5 billion for international food aid programs. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this most important legislation, which will ensure the United States continues to lead the way in addressing the patently unacceptable plight of the world's hungry.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (PAYING TRIBUTE TO REVEREND WAITSTILL SHARP AND MARTHA SHARP FOR THEIR HEROIC EFFORTS TO SAVE JEWS DURING THE HOLOCAUST -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like first to recognize the outstanding efforts of the sponsor of this important measure, Congressman JAMES MCGOVERN, my good friend from Massachusetts, the distinguished member of the Rules Committee, who represents the area where the Reverend Waitstill Sharp, and his wife, Martha Sharp, who are honored in this resolution, lived. 
   Recently, the Holocaust Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem honored the Reverend Waitstill Sharp and his wife, Martha, posthumously, as Righteous Among the Nations, for risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.     
   They are only the second and third Americans to be so honored. Varian Fry, a distinguished American diplomat with whom the Sharps worked, was the first to be so honored. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Sharps' story is one of courage and caring at vast personal sacrifice. They answered the call from the American Unitarian Association and left their two young children behind to travel to Europe twice to save the lives of Jews who were being persecuted and eventually killed. They spent many months in Czechoslovakia in 1939, returned to the United States for a brief period, and then in 1940 again went back to Europe under the auspices of the newly founded Unitarian Universalist Service Committee to aid more people in escaping the horror of the Nazi regime. 
   In all, as a result of the efforts of the Reverend and Mrs. Sharp and their Unitarian colleagues, over 2,000 men, women and children were saved from the Nazi death machine. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is particularly appropriate that this House acknowledge the selfless and courageous actions of the Sharps at this time. In just a few days, on January 27, men and women around the globe will commemorate the Second International Holocaust Remembrance Day. 
   On November 1, 2005, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution and designated January 27 as an annual International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust. This action was strongly endorsed and supported by my good friend, Kofi Annan, the recently retired Secretary General of the United Nations. 
   January 27 was chosen as the day for this commemoration each year because January 27 was the date on which the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz was liberated by Allied troops in 1945 in the closing days of the Second World War. Two years ago on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, along with the chronicler of the Holocaust Elie Wiesel and his wife, my wife Annette and I had the honor to be members of the United States delegation at Auschwitz representing our Nation at the solemn ceremonies marking that historic event with heads of state, diplomats, world leaders, and, most importantly, survivors of the Nazi atrocities. 
   Mr. Speaker, the U.N. General Assembly resolution adopted 14 months ago urges every country to honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and encourages the development of educational programs on Holocaust history as part of our firm resolve to prevent genocides in the future. 
   When this resolution was adopted, Secretary General Kofi Annan said, and I quote, ``There can be no reversing the unique tragedy of the Holocaust. It must be remembered with shame and horror for as long as human memory continues. Only by remembering can we pay fitting tribute to the victims. Millions of innocent Jews and members of other minorities were murdered in the most barbarous ways imaginable. We must never forget those men, women and children or their agony.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is essential that we remember the horror and the reality of the Holocaust. A recent poll taken in the United Kingdom, one of the most advanced countries on the face of this planet, revealed the shocking ignorance of the Holocaust among young children in Britain. The poll reported that 28 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds were not certain that the Holocaust took place. This is both incredible and deeply disturbing. And I fear that the United Kingdom is not the only country where such results could be found. 
   Even more disturbing are political phenomena like Iranian President Ahmadinejad who claim that the murder of 6 million Jews and others targeted by the Nazis and their collaborators during World War II was fabricated. This same Iranian leader recently convened a so-called ``conference'' in Tehran to bring together other Holocaust deniers. 
   As the only survivor of the Holocaust ever elected to Congress, I am outraged at attempts to deny what I experienced and witnessed firsthand. The Holocaust, Mr. Speaker, did take place, and  6 million innocent men, women and children were massacred in this horrific genocide. 
   International Holocaust Remembrance Day is a time for all of us to remember and to honor the victims, but it is also a time to remember those like the Reverend Waitstill and Martha Sharp, recognized as Righteous Among the Nations, who heroically stood up in the face of unspeakable evil and said ``no'' to the horrors of the Nazi genocide. They and the decent people who helped them deserve our gratitude, recognition, and admiration. 
   The Sharps' remarkable story is a powerful reminder that all of us have a moral obligation to take action to end violence and to prevent and stop genocide, genocide which today is taking place in Darfur. We must educate our young people who do not know the significance of the Holocaust, and we must fight against the revisionist historians and phony leaders like Ahmadinejad. The world must be reminded that the Holocaust in fact did occur, that millions suffered untold agony and died. 
   Mr. Speaker, recent atrocities like Rwanda and Darfur in Sudan remind us that our pledge ``Never Again'' has not been fulfilled. Let us learn from the Reverend Sharp and his courageous wife to have the fortitude and foresight to act against such evil. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (PRESERVATION OF RECORDS OF SERVITUDE, EMANCIPATION, AND POST-CIVIL WAR RECONSTRUCTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my dear friend, the distinguished chairman of the committee, for yielding me time and for his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, last week our Nation paused to remember and to recognize the extraordinary life and achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Today I rise in strong support of H.R. 390, the Preservation of Records of Servitude, Emancipation, and Post-Civil War Reconstruction Act, which will help eliminate a little-known and rarely recognized vestige of slavery. This important legislation, which passed the Government Reform Committee last  year by a unanimous vote, will open the way for African Americans to trace their ancestry from the critical period immediately following the end of slavery in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, for most Americans, researching their genealogical history involves searching through various historical records, almost all of which have been properly archived as public historical documents. Unfortunately, African Americans face a unique challenge due to our Nation's history of discrimination and slavery. Instead of simply looking up wills, birth and death certificates, or other traditional genealogical research documents, African Americans are forced to identify the names of former slave owners and then hope that these owners kept accurate records of pertinent property tax and probate information. 
   Compounding the difficulty of this problem, Mr. Speaker, is that many of these records of servitude and emancipation are frequently inaccessible, stored in farmhouses and schools throughout the South. Even when researchers are able to locate the records, they find them poorly catalogued and inadequately preserved from deterioration and decay. 
   While some States and some localities have undertaken efforts to collect these documents, and they need to be commended for their endeavors, a national effort to preserve these important pieces of public and personal history is necessary to ensure that they are readily and easily accessible to all Americans. 
   H.R. 390, my legislation, builds on the success of the Freedmen's Bureau Records Preservation Act, which Congress passed and the President signed into law 6 years ago. That law required the archivists of the United States to catalogue the genealogical and historical records into a searchable indexing system and was the first step toward ensuring easy access. Passing H.R. 390 is the next step necessary to complete this preservation project for our entire Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, my bill tackles the problems of poorly catalogued and inadequately preserved records in two ways. First, it will make sure that the records of servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction currently being stored within the various agencies of the Federal Government will be properly preserved and accessible in a single electronic site. Second, the searchable index will allow individuals to access information in seconds rather than months or years to build their own personal histories.     
   Since many of these records are held in non-Federal public and private collections around the country, my legislation authorizes the National Archives to distribute grants to the States, academic institutions, and genealogical associations to locate, preserve, and establish on-line databases of these important records. These grants will ensure that families doing research in my home State of California or anywhere in the country will be able to find post-Civil War reconstruction items easily accessible in a single electronic site. The searchable index will allow individuals to access information in mere seconds. 
   The Federal and local records covered by my legislation are not only of personal importance to the families involved, Mr. Speaker, they are historically significant to all of us. They document the reuniting of our Nation and the historic moment of transition for slaves from the status of property to citizens, a time when our country finally began to right a horrible moral wrong. We need to take the process another step now by ensuring that those records and the lessons they hold are preserved for all eternity. 
   I want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis, both cosponsors of my legislation, for their continued support of this measure. I also want to thank my friend and colleague Elijah Cummings for all his efforts on this important measure. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense recognition that justice at long last must be made.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I fully support H.R. 556, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. 
   Greater oversight is needed regarding foreign investment in the United States, and I want to commend Chairman Frank and Mrs. Maloney for the work they have done in bringing about this legislation. The Committee on Foreign Affairs has significant jurisdictional interest in this legislation, and I was very pleased at the manner in which our committees have worked on H.R. 556 as it moved through the legislative process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to call attention to two critical issues. First, the treatment that the United States provides to foreign investors is often not reciprocated to United States companies who wish to invest in foreign markets, which threatens bilateral investment relations. The procedures laid out in this bill for the interagency Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS, allow for a responsible and fair assessment of foreign direct investment into the United States. These procedures, however, stand in stark contrast to actions taken by some foreign governments, where expropriations of assets, often in the energy sector, have occurred arbitrarily, without justification, and without full and fair compensation for United States investors. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must continue to seek to ensure that U.S. investors are treated fairly in foreign markets, especially when a transaction being evaluated by CFIUS is for a company whose primary place of business is in a country that does not allow foreign direct investment from the United States in the same business sector as that of the covered transaction. In this way, we can seek to ensure that foreign governments honor their commitments in international agreements and provide for a fair and friendly investment climate for United States companies. I am pleased that the gentlelady from New York agrees with me on this score and that the House reports accompanying H.R. 556 address this important issue. 
   Second, the impact of foreign investments on national security must be considered when reviewing foreign investments into the United States. I am pleased that the Financial Services Committee recognizes the seriousness of how transactions reviewed by CFIUS can impact our national security. The Committee report on H.R. 556 makes clear that Congress expects the acquisitions of U.S. companies, including energy assets, by foreign governments or companies controlled by foreign governments, will be reviewed closely for their national security impact. I fully endorse this view and believe that the United States must remain vigilant in protecting our national security interests. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of reauthorizing a program that has proven to be crucial to the lives of children across the Nation. The State Children's Health Insurance Program--or SCHIP, as it is known--provides access to health care for 6.6 million children. Through bipartisan efforts, Congress is trying to expand eligibility to nearly 4 million additional underserved and uninsured kids, but the President a few weeks ago decided to ignore the will of the people and veto the bill to renew this popular, worthy and socially responsible program. 
   I can't overstate how extraordinarily troubling this veto is. Rather than spending the $3.50 a day it would cost to provide health insurance for these children, the President instead has cynically claimed the mantle of fiscal responsibility. Had he not already presided over the largest increase in government spending since the New Deal, this claim might not ring as hollow as it sounds. Let's be clear: the President has chosen insurers and tobacco companies over the well-being of more than 10 million children and their families. 
   This is the wrong issue and the wrong time to pander to business interests.  
   Madam Speaker, it is unconscionable that American families must choose between buying a warm coat for the winter and having their children immunized. No American families should have to choose between putting food on the table and getting a life-saving operation for their son or daughter. 
   We go back to our respective districts and meet the people who are forced to make these sorts of decisions on a daily basis. We feel and see the utter insanity of vetoing $3.50 a day for health coverage for our neediest children. As members of the House of Representatives, we speak directly for the American people and we come to the floor to vote with their hopes and wishes foremost in our minds. 
   Each day that we fail to provide basic health care to kids, is a day we have failed as leaders. 
   Congress is The People's House, and we have a duty to represent the needs of the American people, not of multi-billion dollar international insurance companies. This administration has sided with big business too many times and at too heavy a cost to the little guy. 
   Republican President Calvin Coolidge once said, ``The business of America is business,'' and it seems that the current President agrees with him. I say that this Congress' business is the people's business. I urge my colleagues to override the President's veto and allow an entire generation of America's children to grow up healthy.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR FUEL FOR PEACE AND NONPROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our resolution, and I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a dramatic step forward in the epic struggle to contain the spread of nuclear arms around the globe. Our bill provides a safe, efficient and collaborative means of getting nuclear fuel to any country that pledges not to develop nuclear arms and delivers on that promise. It will help ensure stability and expose the subterfuge that we know Iran is perpetrating in order to further its nuclear weapons pursuit. 
   We know full well, Mr. Speaker, that Tehran is actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program. But many are persuaded by Iran's argument that it needs access to a reliable nuclear fuel supply to meet its civilian power needs. 
   Now, of course we know that Iran's argument is bogus, but Tehran has used the illusory threat of a global breakdown in the supply of nuclear reactor fuel to argue that it must have its own facilities to guarantee that its reactors are forever supplied with fuel. At the moment, Iran is going to have two of these reactors. 
   We know that the Iranian pretext has been long recognized as a gap in the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. A state can exploit the non-proliferation treaty's recognition of its good standing to develop peaceful uses of the atom and acquire potentially dangerous technology such as uranium enrichment. It could then turn around and use the technology to support a nuclear weapons program. 
   Our legislation, the International Nuclear Fuel for Peace and Nonproliferation Act, addresses this gap in the nuclear non-proliferation regime and removes Iran's pretext for its so-called peaceful enrichment plan. It does so by promoting the development of an international regime of assured supply of peaceful nuclear power fuel to countries in good standing on their nuclear non-proliferation commitments. 
   Our legislation, Mr. Speaker, authorizes $50 million to support the establishment of an international nuclear fuel bank supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency. This money will match the $50 million offered by Mr. Warren Buffett to the Sam Nunn Nuclear Threat Initiative. 
   The Sam Nunn program support is crucial to the realization of this initiative, but so is the political will of countries around the globe capable of cooperating in such a regime. So after this bill's passage today, I intend to work with key nations to establish the international nuclear fuel bank. 
   I am very pleased, Mr. Speaker, that our Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, and our former distinguished colleague Senator Sam Nunn, who has perhaps done more to advance the cause of nuclear non-proliferation than anyone else, have fully embraced this bill, and the administration is on record supporting it. 
   Ours is a broadly supported, bipartisan bill. It would not have come to fruition without the enthusiastic support of my good friend, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, our colleague Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. It was approved by our committee unanimously, a rare phenomenon in this era of divisive partisanship. 
   It is imperative that we keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of Iran and provide a source of peaceful nuclear fuel to all countries that are currently flirting with nuclear development programs. I, therefore, urge all of my colleagues to support this most important measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Lantos-Watt amendment to the Higher Education Reauthorization, H.R. 4137. This amendment clarifies that all graduate degree granting institutions are eligible as lead grantees under the Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program in Title VII of the HEA. 
   Mr. Chairman, as a former professor at San Francisco State University, I know the caliber of student in their graduate programs. And with our proximity to Silicon Valley, many of the leading biotech companies have an embarrassment of riches to select from. Before the Department of Education undermined congressional intent, limiting participation of master's degree granting institutions, SFSU was routinely competing and winning GAANN fellowships. 
   Congress created the GAANN program to provide these fellowships for graduates with superior ability and financial needs studying in areas of national need. Under the original HEA statute and GAANN program regulations, graduate degree granting institutions including those terminating in a master's degree are eligible to participate as lead institutions in the GAANN program. Contrary to Congressional intent and the GAANN statute--which refers to graduate, not doctoral institutions--the Department limited participation as a lead entity in GAANN to doctoral granting institutions only. This action eliminated three master's degree granting programs at San Francisco State University, along with Florida A&M and North Carolina A&T from participation in the GAANN program. Until this action, SFSU had GAANN grants in biology and chemistry. 
   Mr. Chairman, in the President's FY09 budget released a few days ago the GAANN program was tabbed for an increase in funding to stem the long-term decline in the number of fellowships awarded under the program. The President recognized how effective these grants are and provided support for 747 fellowships, including 529 new fellows. 
   Mr. Chairman, GAANN is a competitive program. This provision would not open the program to new entrants. It would merely restore the ability of master's degree granting programs to compete with those granting PhDs. I proudly support the Lantos-Watt amendment and thank Mr. Watt for working with me to give all universities an opportunity to compete.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation and yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in Iraq today a misguided war is raging in our country's name. We in this Congress and the American people across the country are filled with admiration for the heroism and sacrifice of our soldiers on the battlefield. But we cannot fathom the mindless stubbornness of the administration fixated on illusory aids. It is pathologically preoccupied with pursuing that despite all the evidence of how destructive the situation has become. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have seen this movie before, quite literally, as any classic film buff knows: ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,'' an Academy Award-winning tale based on real events in World War II. Alec Guinness plays a British colonel mesmerized and hypnotized by the goal of building a bridge that will last through the ages even though doing so will only strengthen the enemy. For a while Alec Guinness persuades his fellow prisoners of war that completing his weird project will leave a legacy of which they can be proud.  But it soon becomes clear that the real goal is to build a monument to himself as he looks back on his few true achievements in life. 
   At one point this antihero tells his men, We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency that will put them to shame. Mr. Speaker, at this point the audience knows where the real shame lies. 
   The American people know that what happens by our hand in Iraq will be our legacy. We are no longer willing to tolerate keeping our sons and daughters in the midst of a sectarian civil war. The war in Iraq was launched by an administration using faulty intelligence and mesmerized by a dream of some sort of monument to democracy in the Middle East with Iraq at its center. It is past time to stop enabling the construction of this folly. 
   The legislation before us directs that the redeployment of U.S. forces in Iraq be carried out in a safe and orderly manner. It sets a time certain by which that should start, and it is clearly intended to bring about a major reduction in our troop presence by April of next year. And in the meantime, our legislation will compel the administration to come up with something which amazingly enough to date it hasn't had: a comprehensive strategy for Iraq addressing our national security interests not only there but in the entire region and the ways to maintain our interests even as this redeployment is carried out. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the administration issued its interim report on the troop escalation in Iraq. Though the White House chooses to focus on the benchmarks that have been met in what it calls a ``satisfactory'' way, the assessment, in fact, shows that Iraq has made unsatisfactory progress on half of the 18 political and military goals that Congress set for Iraq this spring. 
   The people of Iraq and our fighting forces there know the situation all too well. The index of progress that they face each day tells them much more than a 25-page report can ever say. With every car bomb that takes a civilian toll, every insurgent's bullet that finds its mark, every roadside explosive that maims or kills one of our own brave men and women in uniform, the sacrifices mount; and the result is anything but satisfactory. 
   This is why, Mr. Speaker, our measure deserves our full and unwavering support. We need to direct a misguided administration to face reality and to start the responsible redeployment of our forces from Iraq. By asking this Congress to extend our patience yet again, by pointlessly risking our troops, and by continuing to ignore the will of the American people to end this war, the administration is reaching for a bridge much too far. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (FREE THE ISRAELI SOLDIERS -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I call for the unconditional release of Israeli soldiers still held hostage by terrorists. Exactly one year ago today, Hezbollah terrorists entered territory that unambiguously belongs to Israel under international law, launching an assault into Israel's north that killed three soldiers on patrol, wounded two, and took two others hostage. 
   The two hostages, Ehud ``Udi'' Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, were injured in the attack, and yet Hezbollah refuses to allow representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit them, a flagrant breach of international law and practice. They have also refused to give the hostages' families any indication that their loved ones are alive. This is particularly worrisome, because reports have surfaced suggesting Goldwasser and Regev could have been critically injured in the attack in which they were taken captive. 
   Only seventeen days earlier, fundamentalist thugs launched a similar raid out of the Gaza Strip to take hostage another young Israeli soldier on patrol in Israel's south, Corporal Gilad Shalit. He has now been held hostage in Gaza for more than a year. Just two weeks ago a recording of him pleading for help was released on a Hamas website. In this recording, Shalit says that his health is deteriorating and he is in pressing need of long-term hospitalization. It should come as no surprise that his terrorist captors have failed to allow him adequate medical treatment. 
   Mr. Speaker, Hezbollah and Hamas are clearly to blame for the outbreak of violence in the Middle East last summer. They committed acts of war by kidnapping Israeli soldiers who were conducting regular patrol missions on their own side of the border. 
   And while last summer's war has receded somewhat into the past, the initial causes for the violence have not yet been addressed. Chief among these is the fact that these three Israeli hostages remain in captivity and that Hezbollah and Hamas remain committed to Israel's violent destruction. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which imposed a ceasefire on Israel's Lebanon front, emphasized, and I quote, ``the need to address the causes that have given rise to the current crisis, including the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers.'' Unfortunately, that condition remains totally unfulfilled. 
   Mr. Speaker, this House has not been silent on the plight of these victims of terrorism. Shortly after Udi Goldwasser's young wife visited Congress at the start of this year and pleaded for our help, we swiftly passed H. Res. 107, which was sponsored by my good friend Congressman GARY ACKERMAN, the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia. This bill called for the unconditional release of the three kidnapped soldiers and condemned the culpable terrorist groups for their despicable actions. The Senate passed a similar bill, which was introduced by Senator HILLARY CLINTON. 
   Speaker PELOSI has played a particularly admirable role in the global effort to free these three men. When she met with Syrian President Assad in Damascus just this past April, she presented him with a replica of the three hostages' ``dog tags'' as a means of urging him to secure their release from these terrorist groups that Damascus has long hosted and supported. She also made crystal-clear to President Assad that under no circumstances could bilateral relations with the United States improve until Damascus showed its willingness to cease sponsoring terror. 
   To commemorate the one year anniversary of the kidnapping of Goldwasser and Regev by Hezbollah, the United Jewish Communities recently organized a campaign to send copies of these dog tags to every member of Congress. I commend them for their admirable and thoughtful activism drawing attention to the ongoing plight of the three captives. 
   Mr. Speaker, Israel is a steadfast ally of the United States, and it is on the frontline of the war against terrorism. Israeli soldiers face such threats every day, much like our own inspiring and steadfast soldiers who are currently serving in harm's way in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. It is incumbent upon us to give our ally in this fight our steadfast support in the face of such terrorist predations. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of us have been active in efforts over the years to convince our friends in the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist group. A very few EU states do so on a national basis, but the EU collectively continues to view Hezbollah strictly as a political party. This is an absurd anomaly, and I urge our EU friends and allies to reconsider this policy on this sad one-year anniversary. I know of no other ``political party'' in the world that kidnaps and holds hostages--a fairly remarkable innovation in democratic politics. (In contrast to its policy regarding Hezbollah, the EU does designate Hamas as a terrorist group. I am pleased by that, but the distinction between Hamas killers and Hezbollah killers is frankly lost on me.) 
   Mr. Speaker, I have the following message for the terrorists who are holding the three Israeli soldiers: Release these innocent hostages, and do so without delay. Should you not, the civilized world--and certainly this body--will not remain silent.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. I want to thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference agreement. Let me express my appreciation for the fine work of the chairman, the Homeland Security Committee, my friend, BENNIE THOMPSON. 
   When the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks boarded their flights that crisp September morning, they hoped to crush the American spirit. They were profoundly mistaken. 
   In the first few weeks following the terrorist attacks, our Nation rallied to help the victims and their families to reconstruct New York City and the Pentagon, but our resolve did not stop there. We steadfastly committed to the long-term goal of preventing future terrorist attacks on our shores. 
   To accomplish this, we convened some of our best and brightest minds from both the Democratic and Republican parties to map out a comprehensive strategy to prevent another terrorist disaster. With this bill today, we willfully implement the sound recommendations of this bipartisan 9/11 Commission and take concrete steps to strengthen the security of our Nation. 
   I am pleased that the conference agreement contains several provisions authored by the Foreign Affairs Committee to fight terrorism and to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons. The conference agreement will boost our efforts to work with other nations to secure nuclear materials and rein in loose nukes more effectively. 
   It will also increase the visibility of the Voice of America and our other broadcasting services to quickly ramp up their public diplomacy efforts in future crises. 
   With this bill, we will require the administration to develop a better strategy for cultivating U.S. relationships with three countries crucial to our counterterrorist efforts: Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. 
   Finally, I am gratified that the conference agreement includes provisions from the ADVANCE Democracy Act. This important bill firmly affixes the advancement of freedom and democracy as one of our top foreign policy objectives and requires long-term plans to promote democracy throughout the world. 
   Recently, the Department of State has begun drafting strategies for Middle Eastern countries. The conference agreement includes a requirement for new written specific strategies for all nondemocratic and democratic transition countries building on the important work the Secretary of State has already been doing in the Middle East. This method ensures that we focus on institutions, not just elections. 
   As this bill becomes law, our country will begin to turn its thoughts to the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks. We will, of course, mourn the victims, honor the heroes, and contemplate the lessons of that event. But we will also renew our efforts to fight extremism and terrorism around the globe. I urge all my colleagues to support this important conference agreement.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANTOS. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANTOS. I thank my colleague for yielding, and I want to speak very strongly to support her position. 
   The nightmare that is unfolding in Gaza is in no small measure the responsibility of the Government of Egypt. 
   Egypt has a huge military, and it boggles the mind to assume that the Egyptian military would not have been able to seal Gaza from the constant flow of drugs, weapons and persons being trafficked into Gaza had they attempted to do so. 
   Now, we all understand that the prime culprit in Gaza is Hamas, the terrorist organization. A secondary culprit is the previous corrupt regime of Yasser Arafat, which led to the parliamentary victory of Hamas. But the Egyptian Government has a heavy responsibility for what is the present situation in Gaza. It is a terrorist-controlled area, weapons flowing in, drugs flowing in, trafficked persons flowing in. And to have the minimum of a certification by our Secretary of State that at the very least Egypt at long last has decided to control this very dangerous border is an extremely modest measure. I would have preferred far more severe measures in this regard, but I strongly support this measure.

   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, first I would like to thank my good friend from Iowa for providing comic relief at this late hour of this debate. 
   This carefully constructed, exquisitely constructed absurdity masquerading as an amendment, and on the west coast there are still children watching this program, and I hope they are watching it because this is a rare moment in the history of the Congress of the United States. 
   There are 435 Members in this body, every single one of us elected by our constituents. The Speaker of the House, at the moment, happens to be the Representative from the Eighth District of California. Now, if the gentleman were to offer an amendment saying that 434 Members may travel to Cuba and Sudan and Iran and Syria, but the Representative from the Tenth District of Illinois or the Seventh District of Texas may not, he would be laughed out of court. But that is precisely what this so-called amendment purports to do. It says nothing about any other Member of the Congress of the United States.     
   We are free to travel to Syria. We are free to travel to North Korea. But one of our colleagues, who happens to represent the Eighth District of California, may not. 
   Now, San Francisco happens to have two Representatives; Ms. Pelosi, who represents the Eighth District, and I represent the Twelfth District. The absurdity that you pretend is an amendment allows the person representing a part of San Francisco to travel to North Korea, to travel to Syria, to travel to Sudan, but the person representing the other part of San Francisco may not. 
   Now, I really don't think that this amendment can be taken seriously at its face value. There is a hidden message here. That hidden message is a low blow, a pathetically low blow, aimed at our most distinguished Speaker of this body. 
   I was with the Speaker on her visit, not only to Syria, but to Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. She represented the United States with eloquence, dignity and distinction. It turns my stomach that this sickening partisan attempt to get at the Speaker's performance of her legitimate duties is presented here as an amendment. 
   Let me, however, deal with the underlying issue. The underlying issue relates to travel to countries with which we disagree. May I point out, Mr. Chairman, that beginning in 1981, at the height of the Cold War, I was appointed chair of our Parliamentary Liaison to the European Parliament. It became obvious to me that most of our colleagues in 1981 had never traveled in the Soviet Union or behind the Iron Curtain. So, every year I took it upon myself to lead a congressional delegation to the Soviet Union and to all the Communist countries of the Soviet bloc. 
   Many of my colleagues at that time had no passport. But as a result of year after year after year going to these Communist countries, many Members of this body became familiar with the circumstances. Their commitment of anti-Communism was enhanced, and their understanding of the Soviet Union and the Central and East European satellites became much clearer. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman has expired.

   Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, the primitive, absurd, stupid notion that we should not allow Members of Congress to travel to countries with which we have disagreement is really beneath contempt. This know-nothingism has no place in this body. The discriminatory approach of allowing 434 Members of the House of Representatives to travel to the Sudan, to look at Darfur and the tragedy unfolding there, but not to allow the Speaker of the House of Representatives to see with her own eyes the genocide which is taking place in Darfur is not worthy of this body. 
   I hope that my friend from Iowa will withdraw this pathetic absurdity masquerading as an amendment. It is not an amendment. It is a low blow at the distinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives. I hope that if the gentleman does not withdraw it, it will be overwhelmingly defeated. 
   This body is a body of adult men and women who are prepared to go to Syria, Sudan, Cuba, North Korea, and, if the Iranians will let us in, to Iran. At this moment, the Ahmadinejad government does not offer visas to any Member of Congress. I have been attempting to go there for well over 10 years. I hope, one of these days, a group of us will go there. 
   But the notion of proposing an ostrich policy aimed at the Speaker of the House of Representatives, that she may not go to Cuba, while scores of Republicans and Democrats go, while scores of Republicans and Democrats go to the Sudan and to Syria, is a cheap partisan blow. Days before we went to Syria, three Republican colleagues were in Syria, and I salute them; days after we went there, another Republican colleague went there.
