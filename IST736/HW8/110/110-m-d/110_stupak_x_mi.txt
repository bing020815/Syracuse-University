<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (DEMOCRATS ARE PROVIDING SOLUTIONS TO AMERICA'S ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, while Americans suffer pain at the pump, Republicans and President Bush continue every day to spew the same rhetoric about drilling, a move that would produce minimal savings in 10 years. 
   Democrats, on the other hand, are providing short-term and long-term solutions to America's energy crisis. We have repealed subsidies to profit-rich Big Oil, cracked down on price gouging, and invested in clean and renewable energy. 
   We realize that Americans are hurting now, and they can't wait 10 years for relief. So 2 months ago, Democrats forced President Bush to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Now we are urging the President to release oil from the Reserve, which would provide relief at the pump within 2 weeks. 
   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, President Bush and House Republicans are more interested in doing the bidding of Big Oil than actually providing relief to the American consumer today. How else can you explain their fixation with giving Big Oil more land to drill on when they aren't using the 68 million acres they already have? 
   Democrats are taking our energy policy in a new direction, not one controlled by Big Oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Peterson for the time. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 6604, the Commodities Market Transparency and Accountability Act. 
   As the chairman said, for 3 years I have held hearings on speculators in the market, and here is what we have found. Since the Enron loophole became law in 2000, there has been a dramatic shift and physical hedgers continually represent a small portion of the market. The excessive speculation is a significant factor in the price Americans are paying for gasoline, diesel and home heating oil. 
   Since the Enron loophole, what we found as money was shifted in this market, it went from $13 billion to $260 billion in this market, a 1,900 percent increase of money flowing into this market. After the Enron loophole we saw that contracts on oil futures markets went from 700,000 to over 3 million contracts, 425 percent increase. 
   What we also found, the physical hedgers in 2000, had about 70 percent of the market. By 2008, April of 2008, they were down to about 29 to 30 percent of the market. In other words, those who have a bona fide reason to hedge, like airlines, truckers and others, against the increased costs in fuel have been squeezed out of the market by big money and lucrative contracts. 
   While the Peterson bill may not have had all the things I would like to see, and in my legislation to prevent the unfair manipulation of prices, the PUMP Act, it does take significant steps to rein in excessive speculation. 
   The legislation would improve the information available to the Commodity Future Trading Commission, significantly improving the CFTC's ability to monitor energy markets. Should the CFTC find excessive speculation on unregulated markets as a result, they can take the necessary steps to correct it. 
   Well, speculators are not the only factor. We have seen that this Congress is serious about acting to curb excessive speculation in the energy market, and the markets are responding accordingly. Curbing excessive speculation is part of the solution to high energy prices.  
   I thank Chairman Peterson and his staff for working with me and my colleagues to produce this legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 6604.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO THREAT ON SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, during a speech at the 2004 National Convention, President Bush made a promise to cover America's uninsured children. The President said, ``In a new term we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance program.'' 
   Last week, both this House and the Senate passed a bill to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, which provides health coverage for children in low-income families who would otherwise be uninsured. This bipartisan bill will allow 4 million children who are currently eligible for SCHIP, but not yet enrolled, to now receive coverage. In fact, it does just what President Bush said he would do if America reelected him. But despite this election year promise, President Bush is now threatening to veto the bipartisan SCHIP reauthorization act. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the President vetoes this much-needed legislation, he will be breaking his election year campaign promise to enroll millions of currently eligible but uninsured children in the SCHIP program. I hope the President will reconsider his veto threat and instead hold to his promise to strengthen the SCHIP program.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the new Democratic leadership that will finally allow the U.S. House of Representatives to address high energy prices. Under prior Republican leadership in the House, the oil industry enjoyed years of record profits, record high gas prices and minimal oversight and price manipulation. 
   Curiously, in September and October of 2006, just before the November elections, gas prices dropped an average of $.60 per gallon compared to the record high prices of last summer. This $.60 drop in gas prices occurred despite the fact that there were pipeline disruptions in Alaska and indications that OPEC would cut oil production. Department of Energy's statistics show us that while gas prices dropped an average of $.60 a gallon in September and October, the crude oil price only dropped 10 cents a gallon. 
   If you listened to National Public Radio this week, you would have heard that there is evidence that the oil companies intentionally influence gas price fluctuations, and a $.60 drop was done just before the election to influence the November elections. 
   For years, the American Petroleum Institute, the oil companies' main lobbying group, has spent millions of dollars on public relations campaigns to convince the American people that gas prices are a direct result of crude oil prices, not oil company practices. But yet we have a 60 percent drop in gas prices, but only a 10 percent drop in the price of crude. 
   Ignoring their own PR, oil companies were able to significantly reduce the gas prices in September and October without a corresponding decrease in their crude oil price. Some consumer advocates, such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, have accused oil companies of purposefully reducing gas prices in the months before the election to help Republican candidates. 
   Since November, gas prices have already increased an average of 15 cents a gallon. This is not the first time the oil companies have been accused of attempting to manipulate markets for their benefit. 
   Internal memos from several oil companies written in the 1990s have revealed that the big oil companies have worked to limit refinery capacity here in the United States, allowing these companies to control the supply and cost of gasoline. 
   In May of 2006, the Federal Trade Commission released its report titled Investigation of Gasoline Price Manipulation and Post-Katrina Gasoline Price Increases. In this report, the Federal Trade Commission found that after Hurricane Katrina refiners, wholesalers and retailers charged significantly higher prices that did not result from either increased costs or market friends.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which would fund new nuclear weapons development by taking $193 million from the National Nuclear Security Administration nonproliferation account. 
   NNSA plays a very important role in helping us to secure nuclear weapons, ``loose nukes,'' as we call them in committee, around the world. The program helps secure nuclear material in Russia and elsewhere. 
   This funding includes $412 million for the installation of radiation portal monitors at over 200 border crossings in Russia, the Baltic States and the Caucasus region, $293 million more than the President's budget. 
   Rather than commit billions of dollars to manufacturing another generation of nuclear weapons, our existing nuclear arsenal can be sustained using the life extension program managed by NNSA. If we cut $193 million from it, there will be no way we can maintain this life extension program. 
   The JASON Report, a panel of independent nuclear weapons experts, reported last year that the existing plutonium pit will remain reliable for 100 years, far longer than the 45 or 60 years. 
   We don't need new weapons. Let's put the money where it will do the most good, to secure ``loose nukes'' around the world. Support the chairman in this position, and do not support the Udall amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 2602, a bill to name the Veterans Affairs medical facility in Iron Mountain, Michigan, after Oscar G. Johnson. I am proud to have authored this legislation and proud to bring it to the floor. Oscar Johnson was a friend of mine, and he was a legend in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for their support of this legislation. 
   As was mentioned, Oscar Johnson was a Congressional Medal of Honor winner and a Dickinson County native. He was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in combat near Scarperia, Italy, in September, 1944.     
   I will not go through all the details, as that has already been done by the previous two speakers who have eloquently outlined the heroic actions of Oscar Johnson. Mr. Hare and Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite did an excellent job in doing that. I would like to add a few other thoughts. 
   As was indicated, Sergeant Johnson's service to his country did not stop after he returned home from World War II. In fact, Mr. Johnson continued to serve honorably as a foreman of the National Guard vehicle maintenance shop in Lansing, Michigan, our State capital. 
   During his 30 years of service, Mr. Johnson worked alongside and guided young soldiers, Vietnam-era veterans, and newly enlisted women in our military service. Oscar Johnson quickly became a beloved member of his local community and exemplified the dedication and sacrifice made by all the men and women who served in the Armed Forces, especially during World War II. He was a local hero and a great American. Mr. Johnson is one of 68 World War II Medal of Honor recipients to have survived combat. 
   Mr. Johnson passed away in 1998 and developed a reputation for conducting himself with modesty, dignity and honor. 
   At this time, I will enter into the Record an article entitled, ``A Soldier's Story,'' which appeared in the Iron Mountain Daily News after his death in 1998. This article eloquently describes Mr. Johnson's heroic actions during World War II and his commitment to this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (HONORING PRIVATE FIRST CLASS BILLY M<b>AC</b>LEOD -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Private First Class Billy MacLeod. 
   Private First Class Billy MacLeod of Cheboygan, Michigan, was a brave 19-year-old who answered the call to duty and served our Nation during the Korean War. 
   Billy was among the thousands of U.S. and other United Nations servicemembers pitted against the North Koreans and Chinese in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. These men were outnumbered by the Chinese and faced bitter cold winter temperatures. 
   It was in this battle on November 28, 1950, that Billy lost his life fighting for his country. 
   The Army first declared Billy missing in action, but soon after informed his family that Billy was, in fact, killed in action. Unfortunately, Billy's body was not recovered, and Billy's family was never able to welcome him home. 
   After 58 years, and through the use of modern technology, the Army positively identified Billy's remains. Billy's body, along with five of his comrades, was discovered in 2002 by accident when a road was being built near the trench where he was buried. 
   Army officials recovered about 90 percent of Billy's remains and were successful in matching his DNA with that of his half-brother, Burnie Potter. Burnie Potter had given the Army a DNA sample years ago on the chance that Billy's remains might one day be recovered. 
   On October 31 of just last year, Burnie Potter and the rest of Billy's extended family finally received their answers. Billy had been found and was coming home. 
   Since October, the family and the community has been busy planning for his return. Originally, Billy was to be reunited with his family at the Pellston Regional Airport, just a short 20 miles from his hometown of Cheboygan, Michigan, on January 15. 
   However, just a few days short before Billy's expected arrival, his family was informed that they'd have to pick up his remains in Traverse City, Michigan. Traverse City is 100 miles away from his home. This is easily a 2-hour drive, if not more, during the winter months. 
   Upon learning this news from a friend, I offered my assistance and immediately contacted the Army. After numerous phone calls, I learned that repatriated soldiers like Billy are treated differently than soldiers who are killed in active military theaters like Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Under current regulations, the Department of Defense does not use military aircraft to transport repatriated soldiers to their final resting place and instead use only commercial aviation. I was told that the Pellston Airport was too small to accommodate a commercial plane that could transport Billy's remains. I don't buy it. The Pellston Regional Airport is a rather large airport. It is not a small airport. 
   Furthermore, I was told by the Department of Defense that it does not provide an honor guard at the airport when a repatriated soldier returns home. Both policies differ for current theater deaths. For soldiers who are killed in active theater, the military uses both military and civilian aircraft to reach a family's desired resting place and provide a military honor guard at the airport upon the body's arrival. 
   Why does the Department of Defense not treat our soldiers the same way? Why does it matter, or does it really matter, if a soldier was killed yesterday or 50 years ago defending our country? A man died fighting for our country and we should honor him to the fullest possible extent. This means bringing his remains to the airport closest to his final resting place and providing full military honors upon the plane's arrival as well as at the funeral. 
   It was only through pressure from my office that the military provided a nine-member contingent of the Michigan State Funeral Honors Team at the Traverse City Airport. To honor Billy's memory, and to ensure that this does not happen again to another family member, I will work to change the current Department of Defense policy on repatriated soldiers. In my short time in Congress, this has been the third repatriated soldier. Whether it was from Vietnam or World War II or now the Korean War, each and every soldier should be treated the same and should be given full military honors when they return home after sacrificing their life for their country. Every soldier should be treated the same, with the same honors and respect upon their homecoming. 
   The Korean War, Mr. Speaker, is often referenced as the United States' forgotten war, but Billy MacLeod will not be forgotten. I know all of Cheboygan County and northern Michigan residents are proud of Billy and are pleased that this brave soldier will be coming home to his northern Michigan home. 
   On behalf of a grateful nation, we say thank you and may God bless you, Billy MacLeod. You were never forgotten.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, allowing me an opportunity to speak about this issue here before us. 
   I want to thank Mr. Waxman and the committee for reporting an excellent bill. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act is a long overdue piece of legislation that will go a long way towards correcting some of the abuses of the past and updating the whistleblower protection system to face the challenges of the present. 
   For too long protections passed by Congress for good-faith whistleblowers have been chipped away by executive agencies and the courts. Court decisions have limited the scope of whistleblower protections in a way that betrays the spirit of the original law. This bill will clarify the rights of whistleblowers, including the right to a prompt court proceeding if their employer challenges their right to the protection. 
   The bill also protects whistleblowers who work in the national security sector or who work for Federal contractors. This is a critical provision. Under current law, national security employees have next to no protection if they are retaliated against for reporting waste or corruption. This is an extremely dangerous situation. If corruption or abuse of power is happening in our intelligence and security agencies, it should be a concern for all Americans. Employees who report abuses in these sectors are doing a service to our national security. I am glad to see that this bill would finally protect them. 
   I am also pleased to see protections strengthened for Federal contractors. The growth of contracting under the current administration has been astronomical. Under President Bush the Federal Government is now spending nearly 40 cents of every discretionary dollar on contracts with private companies, a record level. Much of this money has been spent without any kind of oversight that would apply within a Federal agency. 
   Protection for whistleblowers in the contracting sector is key for improving congressional oversight and bringing potential waste and mismanagement under control. 
   Let me be clear. This bill doesn't just protect whistleblowers. It protects all Americans. 
   As chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I know that every congressional investigation relies on the willingness of individual witnesses to speak up about what they have seen. These individuals risk their careers and their reputations to expose instances of corruption, waste, and abuse within our government. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their courage. This bill is an important step towards making sure that those individuals have the protection they deserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing me an opportunity to address my amendment, and I thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order. I want to recognize Mr. Waxman, Mr. Braley, Mr. Davis, and others of the Government Reform Committee for advancing a good bill, and I want to thank Mr. Markey for his help with this amendment and for his previous work in protecting the right of government scientists to publish their findings. 
   One of the most important sections of H.R. 985 deals with protecting the integrity of the scientific process by shielding whistleblowers who report tampering with government scientific investigations. My amendment would enhance whistleblower protection by including in the list of reportable actions any attempt to suppress the right of government scientists to publish or announce their findings in peer reviewed journals or public meetings with their fellow scientists. 
   In science, one of the strongest signs of credibility in a study is that the scientists are given a right to publish their rights freely, whatever those results may be. Completed studies are  submitted to peer-reviewed journals for consideration, allowing the scientific community at large to review, challenge and incorporate new findings. 
   The peer review process is a critical step in the development of scientific knowledge, and the transparency inherent in the process is one of our strongest safeguards against corrupted or misleading scientific claims. 
   Scientific studies funded by the taxpayers should be held to this same high standard. Political pressure on scientists to suppress or hide the results of their research is a direct attack on the public interest, and employees who report suppression of their scholarly publications should be given the same protection as those who report other kinds of corruption or abuse of authority. 
   My amendment would protect science in the public sector and has been endorsed by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to issues of scientific integrity. 
   Congress has already had some experience with this issue. In November 2004, the Senate Finance Committee heard testimony from Dr. David Graham, the whistleblower in the Vioxx case. Dr. Graham described how senior managers within the Office of Drug Safety of the FDA attempted to block publication of his study on the dangers of Vioxx, even going so far as to call the editors of The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, to attack Dr. Graham's work. 
   Dr. Graham's case is not an isolated incident. In a recent survey by the Union of Concerned Scientists, 150 of 279 government scientists reported some sort of political interference with their work. When asked whether they believed they were free to publish results that might go against the political positions of their agency, a majority of those scientists who answered the question felt they were not free to publish. 
   We all know how important good science is in helping us make good public policy. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I am especially aware of the critical role whistleblowers have in rooting out abuses of power and aiding Congress in its oversight responsibilities. 
   My amendment helps to make the important scientific integrity section of the base bill more comprehensive and more clear. My amendment will protect the public's right to know the results of publicly funded research, and will help make a good bill even better. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. 
   I sat for 12 years on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Oversight and Investigations, and I cannot tell you how many times we have dealt with scientists who have come forward under a whistleblower status, or will call us up in cases like the Vioxx that I mentioned. 
   I have an article I will include for the Record where a scientist said, ``FDA Called Journal to Block Vioxx Article.'' Thousands of people have died because a drug was put forth on the market because the scientist within the FDA was not allowed to publish the results of his study and was not allowed to speak at advisory panels. 
   We also see that in a drug called Ketek. It is a drug we continue to do investigation on, and we will have further hearings next week on it, how fraudulent studies were put forth before the FDA. The scientists knew it, and the FDA suppressed the evidence and allowed the drug to be approved, to the detriment and the death of many Americans. 
   And there is the drug Accutane which has many mysterious questions surrounding it, and people have not been allowed to testify at advisory panels which must approve a drug before it is put forth for public use. 
   This is a safety issue, and 150 of 279 government scientists reported political interference with their work. 
   My amendment protects the public right to know the results of taxpayer-funded research. What is wrong with that? 
   This amendment is a good amendment. It will make the bill better. I ask that my amendment be approved.  
   Scientist Says FDA Called Journal To Block Vioxx Article  
   Just days before a medical journal was to publish a Food and Drug Administration-sponsored study that raised concerns about the safety of the arthritis drug Vioxx, an FDA official took the unusual step of calling the editor to raise questions about the findings' scientific integrity, suggests e-mail obtained by USA TODAY. 
   Lead author David Graham says the call was part of an effort to block publication of his research, an analysis of a database of 1.4 million Kaiser Permanente members showing that those who took Vioxx were more likely to suffer a heart attack or sudden cardiac death than those who took Celebrex,  Vioxx's rival. Graham had reported his study in August at an epidemiology meeting in France, but publication in a medical journal would have exposed it to a wider audience. 
   Graham, associate director for science and medicine at the FDA's Office of Drug Safety, says The Lancet, a medical journal published in London, had planned to post the study on its Web site Nov. 17, a day in advance of his appearance before the Senate Finance Committee to testify about the FDA's handling of Vioxx. 
   Merck had pulled the drug from the market Sept. 30 because of safety concerns. Publication of the study could have embarrassed the FDA, which was being criticized for not warning patients sooner of Vioxx's cardiovascular risks. 
   Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said Sunday that Graham's charges are unfounded. ``We didn't make any efforts to block publication in The Lancet,'' he said. ``What we did is let The Lancet know that the paper was submitted in violation of the agency's clearance process.'' Graham had sought to publish his study before getting the FDA's OK, Galson said. 
   And in a written statement, FDA Acting Commissioner Lester Crawford said that Galson contacted Lancet editor Richard Horton ``out of respect for the scientific review process.'' 
   Galson said he would like to see the paper published some day but didn't see the value of timing its release to the Senate hearing, ``not exactly a scientific imperative.'' 
   Graham says he pulled his paper at the last minute because he feared for his job. Following is a chronology of the events surrounding the paper's withdrawal: 
   Nov. 12. Galson called Horton to tell him that the FDA had not cleared Graham's paper for publication. He then e-mailed Horton a link to a document describing the FDA's internal review process for journal articles. ``As you will see, there are some ambiguities here,'' Galson said in his e-mail. 
   In a later e-mail to Horton that day, Galson brought up points from a nine-page review of Graham's study by Ann Trontell, deputy director of the FDA's drug safety office. Galson and Trontell noted discrepancies between the article submitted to The Lancet and an abstract of the study that had been submitted in May for presentation at a second scientific meeting, an American College of Rheumatology conference. Trontell's review, which Graham had forwarded to Horton, refers to ``potential charges of data manipulation.'' 
   Graham says he had already explained the discrepancies to his superiors at the FDA. After the abstract was submitted to the rheumatology group, Graham says, he discovered two problems: A computer program had misclassified the amount of Vioxx some patients had taken; and one of his co-authors noticed that an analysis Graham had done was incorrect. 
   Graham says the rheumatology group told him that it was too late to correct the printed abstract, but that he could present the corrected analysis at its annual meeting in October, as he had at the epidemiology meeting in August 
   Nov. 14. In an e-mail to Galson, Horton wrote, ``You will not be surprised if I say that I was a little taken aback to get your call on Friday (Nov. 12). It is very unusual indeed for a member of the employing institution of an author to contact us in the middle of the review and publication process of a manuscript.'' 
   Horton wrote that Galson's call could be perceived as an improper attempt to interfere with The Lancet's review process. Raising the possibility that a scientist manipulated data ``is an extremely serious allegation,'' Horton wrote. ``One could read such an allegation as an attempt to introduce doubt into our minds about the honesty of the authors--doubt that might be sufficient to delay or stop publication of research that was clearly of serious public interest'' 
   Nov. 18. Graham told a Senate panel that the FDA is ``virtually defenseless'' against another ``terrible tragedy and a profound regulatory failure'' like Vioxx.  
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And congratulations on a well thought of, well put forth piece of legislation, and I strongly support this legislation. 
   I want to address the Davis-Bacon issue I have heard so much about in the last few days. I represent one of the more rural, disadvantaged districts, and we should not be taking away Davis-Bacon. To take away Davis-Bacon because a district is small or rural or may be considered disadvantaged as some people say is just purely hogwash. Davis-Bacon is good for rural America. Davis-Bacon is good for urban America. Davis-Bacon is good for all Americans. 
   In my congressional district, which is comprised of mostly seniors and veterans and households with income around $38,000, my district can't afford not to have Davis-Bacon. My district needs to keep wages up, not lower our wages. There should be no retreat, no surrender on Davis-Bacon. We should stop this madness. We come here, and it is always like a race to the bottom: Who can do it for cheaper? Who can do it for lower? Who are we affecting? The men and women who I represent and all the men and women who built this country. We should pay them a decent wage so they can afford a decent standard of living. Take health care. If you are going to try and do health care in this country, you better have $48,000 a year minimum income because the insurance premiums are $12,000 to $14,000. Davis-Bacon allows you a fair wage so you can afford health insurance so you can provide for your family. 
   When we take a look at this, Davis-Bacon provides nothing more than quality work for decent pay. We have got to stop the race to the bottom, do not drive down wages. There should be no retreat, no surrender. Support Davis-Bacon. Support this bill, H.R. 720. I compliment the chairman; it is a great piece of legislation. 
   I have been here now for a while. We are finally going to put money back into the water system, to our wastewater treatment systems to clean up our environment, to clean up public health so our people can have a safe quality of life, but they can't do it without an adequate income. Support this legislation. Reject the Baker-King shallow argument about rural America needs a special exception in order to afford it. Rural America supports this legislation. We cannot afford to walk away from Davis-Bacon. We must have Davis-Bacon in this legislation.

   Mr. STUPAK. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 
   I thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order. I rise today to continue to protect the Great Lakes, as it is the source of drinking water for 45 million people and the recreational and economic livelihood of the region which depends heavily on a healthy Great Lakes. 
   There are a large number of wastewater facilities in both the United States and Canada that discharge treated and untreated sewer water into the Great Lakes. While these facilities do everything they can to prevent polluting the Great Lakes, there are times  when untreated or undertreated wastewater is released. 
   Once this pollution occurs, it can be difficult to determine that a wastewater treatment facility is the source, the effects of these discharges on the Great Lakes, and the steps needed to stop the pollution and clean up any damage.     
   For example, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, have faced tremendous problems with E. coli, coliform, and other bacteria in the water near a wastewater treatment facility in Ontario, Canada. These two cities are separated by the St. Mary's River, which connects Lake Superior to Lake Huron. 
   Under the direction of the EPA, the Chippewa County, Michigan, Health Department has undertaken significant monitoring of the St. Mary's River. The Ontario Ministry of Environment has also begun testing. 
   However, because there is disagreement about the source of the pollution, there is little to be done to correct the issue. Even though both sides are now beginning to monitor the river, a lack of communication and cooperation still presents a significant roadblock in accomplishing a solution. 
   My amendment would require the EPA, in consultation with the State Department and the Canadian government, to study wastewater treatment facilities that discharge into the Great Lakes. The study would include recommendations on ways to improve monitoring, information sharing and cooperation between the United States and Canada. The U.S. and Canada must work together to limit harmful wastewater discharges into the Great Lakes. 
   My amendment will allow the EPA to offer solutions to the notice, protocol and information sharing problems the U.S. and Canada face. By improving monitoring and communication, the U.S. and Canada can work together to solve problems created by wastewater treatment facilities discharging into the Great Lakes. The Congressional Budget Office has indicated there will not be any direct spending as a result of my amendment. 
   I wish to thank the staff of Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as well as the staff of the Foreign Affairs Committee and my personal staff for their assistance in crafting this amendment. I look forward to continuing with them as this legislation moves forward.

   Mr. STUPAK. Let me thank Mr. Baker and Mr. Oberstar for their help in support of this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, we do realize we have to make some minor modifications in this amendment, and I look forward to their continued help and support in that direction. I am always amazed at the knowledge of the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, as he went back 20 years to recite language. 
   He was absolutely right about the flow of the St. Mary's river, 130,000 cubic feet per second. I am always amazed at his knowledge of the Great Lakes and his support for the Great Lakes. 
   All this amendment is saying is that the U.S. and Canada must work together to prevent harmful discharges into the Great Lakes. My amendment will allow the EPA to offer solutions to notice, protocol and information sharing between our two countries in the face of monitoring, communicating and eventually working together to resolve the problems created by waste charge facilities which discharge treated and untreated water into our Great Lakes. Again, no direct spending will result as a result of my amendment or in the CBO, and I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, for too long Big Oil has benefited from weak royalty laws, huge tax breaks, and subsidies. Last year, the five biggest oil companies' profits were $97 billion, nearly five times their profit in 2002. These record profits were bolstered by excessive tax breaks, generous subsidies, and being allowed to drill on public land without reimbursing taxpayers. 
   In the meantime, Americans are being taken at the gas pump as gas prices rose to over $3 per gallon last summer. Rather than helping oil companies' bottom lines, these tax breaks and special subsidies will be reallocated in H.R. 6 to promote and develop clean and renewable energy to end our Nation's addiction to oil. 
   Under prior Republican leadership, the oil industry enjoyed years of record profits with minimal oversight, resulting in price manipulation and record gas prices. The American people have chosen a new direction, and under Democratic leadership we will end the tax breaks and the subsidies to Big Oil. 
   America will begin to end our addiction to foreign oil, improve our environment, and promote our economic and national security through clean and renewable energy. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (HIGH ENERGY PRICES -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, the price of crude oil has doubled over the past year. Oil is now at $136 a barrel, gasoline is at $4.11 a gallon, diesel prices are at $4.73 a gallon. As a result, citizens and industries across Northern Michigan and our great country are hurting. Airlines are eliminating service to 100 cities, laying off thousands of workers, and projecting up to $13 billion in losses due to jet fuel price increases that cannot be passed on to consumers. Truck drivers are going out of business, and many more are just parking their trucks because they actually end up losing money after paying so much money for diesel. Loggers and farmers face increased costs at all stages of their operations, from planting and harvesting, to transporting their product to market. As a result, high energy prices have caused significant increases in the cost of food. 
   There is no way to justify the doubling of oil prices based simply on supply and demand. And despite the false promises by the minority party here in Congress, Democrats in Congress are addressing the energy issues. We are looking for more areas to begin immediately drilling for oil, conservation of energy, passing gas price gouging legislation, and ending excessive speculation in the energy futures trading market. 
   The Government Accountability Office found that the volume of trading in energy commodities has skyrocketed, specifically after the Enron loophole was enacted in 2000. The Government Accountability Office also found that, while trading has doubled since 2002, the number of Commodity Futures Trading Commission staff monitoring these markets has actually declined. 
   Between September 30, 2003 and May 6, 2008, traders holding crude oil contracts jumped from 714,000 contracts to more than 3 million contracts. This is a 425 percent increase in trading of oil futures in less than 5 years. Since 2003, commodity index speculation has increased 1,900 percent, from an estimated $13 billion to $260 billion. The 1,900 percent increase in commodity index speculation has inflated the price of crude oil by approximately $37 a barrel. Other experts estimate it could be even more. 
   On June 23, 2008, the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee that I chair held a hearing on the effects speculators have on energy prices. This was the sixth hearing that the Energy and Commerce Committee has held on gas prices over the past 2 years. Fadel Gheit, managing director and senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, testified that, ``I firmly believe that the current record oil price in excess of $135 per barrel is inflated. I believe, based on supply and demand fundamentals, crude oil prices should not be above $60 a barrel.'' 
   In 2000, physical hedgers, businesses like airlines that need to hedge to ensure a stable price for fuel in future months, accounted for 63 percent of the oil futures market. Speculators accounted for 37 percent. By April of 2008, physical hedgers only controlled 29 percent of the market. What we now know is that approximately 71 percent of this market has been taken over by swap dealers and speculators, a considerable majority of whom have no physical stake in the market. Over the past 8 years, there has been a dramatic shift as physical hedgers continually represent a smaller and smaller portion of the market. 
   The New York Mercantile Exchange, NYMEX, has granted 117 hedging exemptions since 2006 for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, many of which are for swap dealers without physical hedging positions. This excessive speculation is a significant factor in the price Americans are paying for gasoline, diesel, and home heating oil. 
   In May 2008, the International Monetary Fund compared crude oil over the past 30 years to the price of gold. Gold prices are not dependent on supply and demand, and have been viewed as a highly speculative commodity. The IMF analysis shows that crude oil prices track increases in gold prices. 
   What this means is that oil has been transformed from an energy source into a financial asset like gold, where much of the buying and selling is driven by speculators instead of producers and consumers. Oil has morphed from a  commodity into a financial asset, traded for its speculative value instead of its energy value. Even the Saudi oil minister has argued that high oil prices are due to excessive speculation in the markets. 
   As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich noted on National Public Radio a few weeks ago, the problem is the government's failure to curb excessive speculation. 
   There are significant loopholes that exempt energy trading from these protections against excessive speculation: The Enron loophole, the Foreign Boards of Trade No Action letters, the Swaps loophole, and the Bona Fide Hedging Exemption. While the recently passed farm bill addressed the Enron loophole for electronic trading of natural gas, a significant portion of the energy trading continues to be exempt from any Commodity Futures Trading Commission action to curb excessive speculation. 
   For 3 years, I have looked into excessive speculation in the energy markets. My latest bill, the PUMP bill, H.R. 6330, would end all of these exemptions to ensure that excessive speculation is not driving up these markets beyond the fundamentals of supply and demand.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First of all, I would like to associate myself with the comments of Mrs. Miller and Mr. Ehlers from the other side as they talked about this very important Coast Guard bill. I am from the Great Lakes State. In fact, I have more shoreline than any other congressional district in the continental United States. I have over 1,600 miles of shoreline on the Great Lakes. It is critically important that we pass this Coast Guard bill. 
   But on this point, my colleagues on the other side use a very important bill like the Coast Guard bill to talk about energy, that somehow Democrats are not doing enough and somehow the Speaker is responsible for high oil prices. If you take a look, the Republicans have been in charge, until last year, for the last 12 years. What was their policy? Their policy has been no policy, do nothing, let the oil companies get away with it, record profits, record pensions to their CEO. Remember the $400 million pension for ExxonMobil? 
   I guess I agree with Mr. Peterson, the last speaker, maybe we ought to lock them up. We ought to lock them up when you see oil prices, when President Bush comes in, at $27 a barrel, we're up to $119. And where is it going to stop? Why do you see this rapid increase? Well, an ill-advised war where everybody said when you get involved in a war in the Middle East, the longer you're there, the prices are going to go up. When you have no policy, sure oil prices are going to go up. When you pass, as the Republican Party did, the Enron loophole which allowed speculators to come into the market and drive up the price of oil, you're going to get these criminal record prices we're paying. So Mr. Peterson is right, we should lock them up. We should lock them all up. 
   What have the Democrats done? Well, we've passed price gouging legislation, not once, but twice. And most of my friends on this side of the aisle, like Mr. Sessions and others who spoke here today, voted against it. How about the PUMP Act, Prevent the Unfair Manipulation of Prices. We have that legislation, all sponsored mostly by Democrats. I think we had two brave Republicans who came forward to help sponsor it. 
   So what do we have here? You talk about refinery capacity. I'm chairman of Oversight and Investigations. A 1995 memo from the American Petroleum Institute to all the big oil companies was to say, shut down the refineries. You want record prices? Shut down the refineries. We have those memos. They're part of the Congressional Record. And what did they do? Between 1995 and 2002 they shut down over 30 refineries, including one just outside my district in Alma, Michigan, which used to refine 51,000 barrels a day, that's over 1 million gallons of gas, because there's 33 gallons of gas in every barrel of oil, they shut it down to increase the price so they could have their record profits, so they can pay their CEO a $400 million pension plan, so they can have $40 billion in profits, as we saw with ExxonMobil just last year. 
   Democrats have been in charge now for, what, 16 months? What have we done?

It was the President of the United States who said he would jawbone the Saudis to produce more oil to bring down our prices. He jawboned them all right, they jawboned right through to our pocketbook, with record prices at the pump, record prices of oil coming into this country. 
   Pass the PUMP Act. We can reduce the price of oil by $30 a barrel, as testified on December 12, 2007 by experts before our committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee. Stop the unfair manipulation of prices. Lower the price of oil. Give the American taxpayers relief. And pass the Coast Guard bill to clean up our environment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am proud to come to the floor to talk about solutions that the Democratic Party has put forth and this House has tackled in the last year. But let's not try to rewrite history, as we see being done on the other side. 
   Let's remember when President Bush came to office in 2001, crude oil sold at $25.88 a barrel. When the Iraq war began, that terrible, misguided war, crude oil was $35 a barrel. Gas was approximately $1.56. In my district today, gas is $3.56. Crude oil is over $119. That is what the Republican policies have brought us, a bad war and gas and oil that we cannot afford. 
   The Energy Information Agency says gas will be $4 this summer. Diesel is already $4. So what have the GOP and this President said they are going to  do? Remember? He is going to jawbone his friends the Saudis to produce more oil so we would have it here in this country. 
   Oh, he jawboned all right. He jawboned all the way up to record prices, record profits, where ExxonMobil can pay its CEO a $400 million pension with $44 billion in profits last year. Oh, boy, they jawboned all right. Their jawbone is chewing on our pocketbook and is hurting the middle class in this country. 
   What have we done? The energy price gouging bill, H.R. 1252, which we passed last May 284-141. One hundred forty-one on the other side wouldn't even vote for us to stop the gouging of prices that we see day in and day out. This legislation would have provided the Federal Trade Commission with the authority to investigate and prosecute those who engage in price gouging, predatory pricing and other unfair practices. 
   I don't know about you, but I am tired of seeing gas go up 30 cents like it did earlier this month in my district. One day, 30 cents. Now, if that is not excessive pricing, predatory price gouging, I don't know what it is. 
   Let's take a look at the PUMP Act, a piece of legislation we have been working on since April of 2006, and we have plenty of cosponsors. We had a hearing last December, December 12. What did they say? Pass the PUMP Act to prevent the unfair manipulation of prices. Professor Greenberg said we could save $30 a barrel. For every barrel of oil that comes into this country, we can save $30 by getting the speculators out of the market. 
   Why do we continue to allow speculators to run this country? They sure did a good job with mortgages, didn't they, with the subprime mortgages. That is why the values of our properties have gone down. Now the speculators are in the oil field, in the energy field. And why is that? Because of a little thing when the Republicans were in charge called the Enron loophole. The Enron loophole in 2005 allowed the speculators to come into the energy field, and therefore they have run up the price. What did the hearings show?

   Mr. STUPAK. Ninety-five to 98 percent of those playing in this market have no intentions of taking possession of oil or providing a product. They are there for one reason, to rake all the profits off the American people that they can through their excessive speculations. 
   This Democratic Congress has also passed a Renewable Energy Tax Act to help lessen our dependence on foreign energy sources. 
   Look. Since this war started in Iraq, everything has doubled and tripled. We have heard nothing from the other side. This Democratic Congress continues to do things to try to curb the abuses we find in the energy field, that we find in manipulation of prices and speculation. We will continue to work towards that. 
   To come down here and somehow try to rewrite history, it is just not going to work. It is important to note that tax breaks that are eliminated in the Renewable Energy Tax Act are equivalent to less than 1 percent of the oil companies' net income, but yet they complain.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, it's my pleasure to join Mr. Kagen in offering this resolution, and I want the RECORD to reflect that my friend and colleague Mr. Kagen is the second-biggest Packer fan in Congress. Being from the upper peninsula of Michigan, all of us UPers are known as Packer fans. Actually, Green Bay is only just over an hour's drive from my home, where the Detroit Lions are more than 10 hours away from home, so we are all Packer fans in northern Michigan. 
   On Sunday, September 30, with a 16-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings, Green Bay Packer Brett Favre broke Dan Marino's career touchdown pass record with 421 touchdown passes. 
   Playing in his 17th season in the NFL, Brett Favre has consistently shown Packer fans and the Nation that hard work, dedication and determination lead to continued success. 
   The fact that Brett Favre threw the record-breaking touchdown in Minnesota against a tough divisional rival shows that his hard work and determination does pay off. 
   Throughout his career, Brett Favre has proven that his perseverance and love of the game have helped him overcome adversity and succeed at such a high level. 
   Most importantly, Brett Favre has remained humble while leading the Packers to four wins and only one loss so far this season. I realize my good friend Mr. Souder has already given the Packers their fifth win. That will come this Sunday against the Washington Redskins. After his record-breaking performance, Brett Favre said the last thing on his mind was the record. That truly sums up how this individual approaches the game. It's not for personal glory but for team pride and continuing on their winning ways. 
   Favre's teammates and coaches credit his work in the off-season and between games as the reason the three-time NFL Most Valuable Player has remained successful. 
   Favre's leadership has helped the Packers to start off the year on top of the division.  
   Favre has been a leader off the field as well. This resolution honors Brett and Deanna Favre's work supporting the Special Olympics, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Boys and Girls Club of America, breast cancer patients and those affected by Hurricane Katrina. 
   In a year plagued with sports scandals, Brett Favre sets a positive example for all Americans that there is still honesty and dignity in sports. 
   I'm proud to join with all my colleagues and the Members of the House of Representatives to salute Brett Favre's continued success on and off the field, and I look forward to another MVP year.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee. 
   I rise in support of the Miller-Stupak amendment to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007. 
   This amendment makes two important clarifications. First, our amendment asserts and clarifies that any religious organization that is currently covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would be exempt from the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This will continue to protect religious organizations, including corporations, schools, associations, and societies from religious discrimination claims.  
   For the past 40-plus years, religious high schools, colleges and other organizations throughout the Nation have been allowed to hire individuals based on that institution's religious principles. 
   Today, as we adopt employment protections based on sexual orientation, these principles should be upheld. 
   Continuing America's long-standing separation of church and State, this amendment will ensure that the Federal Government does not unconstitutionally infringe on religious organizations' hiring practices. 
   Religious schools and organizations throughout my district and throughout this Nation will continue to freely practice their beliefs without being afraid of being charged with discrimination. 
   Several major religious organizations support the inclusion of a religious exemption in ENDA, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, and the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
   The Miller-Stupak amendment also upholds the Defense of Marriage Act. It also clarifies that any reference to ``marriage'' within ENDA refers to the legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife. 
   In 1996, a bipartisan group of 342 Members, including myself, voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. Marriage is between a man and woman. I support including a clear definition of marriage as a union between a man and woman in this legislation. 
   No American should have to face discrimination in the workplace, regardless of their race, gender or sexual orientation. However, religious organizations should be able to hire individuals who agree with their religious beliefs.     
   It is also important to make it explicitly clear that marriage is a union between a man and a woman and that no part of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act could be misconstrued to undercut the Defense of Marriage Act. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me and the chairman in voting for this amendment. With the inclusion of this amendment, I encourage Members to vote for final passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 
   I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the Miller-Stupak amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and the United States-Peru Free Trade Act. 
   In the past few weeks, I have heard time and time again from many of my colleagues that the Peru Free Trade Agreement is a groundbreaking agreement crafted by the Ways and Means Committee and the Bush administration. I've been told that this agreement incorporates enforceable obligations that require Peru to adopt and enforce labor standards and uphold international environmental standards. That is a start. But I ask my colleagues, who will enforce the labor standards? Who will enforce the environmental standards? The Bush administration? I don't think so. This administration has a disgraceful record of enforcing trade agreements and trade laws. We cannot assume this administration will now start to enforce trade agreements. Furthermore, this agreement doesn't provide the administration any funding to enforce the free trade agreement if they wanted to. Most importantly, the Peru Free Trade Agreement fails to address food safety, toy safety and drug safety concerns facing our constituents. 
   As chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I have conducted numerous hearings and investigations on drug and food safety. Our committee found that products are entering our country every minute without appropriate inspection. We found that importers don't know how the product was made and whether the imports are safe. Why do we Americans allow countries to bring their inferior, unsafe toys, food and drugs into our country? 
   The Peru agreement includes the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement. By incorporating the WTO's Sanitary Agreement, the U.S. will be giving up the ability to increase inspection of imports to ensure safety. 
   The goal of the WTO Sanitary Agreement is to allow free passage of food. This means our food can move freely between the two countries without proper inspection and without proper regulation on how the food is grown, processed, stored or shipped here to the United States. 
   At a time when we're questioning the ability of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the FDA to protect the health and well-being of our children, our seniors and, indeed, all Americans, I don't think we should be allowing Peru ``free passage'' of food and drugs into the United States.  
   We simply cannot afford to pass another harmful trade agreement that fails to protect our families from contaminated foods and drugs and toys. 
   The changes the proponents of the Peru Free Trade Agreement keep touting are minimal at best, and are inadequate to assure a level playing field for American businesses, American jobs and the American economy but most importantly it does not protect the American people. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against the Peru Free Trade Agreement. 
   Protect the American consumer. 
   Vote no on the final passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, and I ask them to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit. 
   The House bill is stronger than the Senate bill. The House bill provides stronger parity protections than the Senate bill for the same cost. The House bill requires parity in out-of-network benefits. The Senate bill does not. Out-of-network care is important where plans cover a limited number of providers and there are long waiting lists to access the care. 
   The House bill requires coverage for all clinically significant disorders if the insurer chooses to provide coverage for mental illness. The Senate bill lets health plans pick and choose which diseases they will cover, so they could deny care for autism, eating disorders, alcoholism and more. 
   And also, on this motion to recommit, when it comes to protecting human life, I stand with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. But this abortion provision in this legislation is a red herring. If this abortion provision was a problem, why would my colleagues, our colleagues, our friends in the Senate like Senator Coburn, Senator Brownback, Senator DeMint vote for it? 
   I sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee where this bill came from. The abortion issue never was raised. 
   Under the House bill, health care plans retain the right to make decisions about medical necessity, and nothing in this bill would overturn the ability of health care plans to impose a conscience clause and not cover certain services due to religious or moral objections. This was made part of Federal law in 2005 under the Abortion Nondiscrimination Act authored by Congressman Dave Weldon. That is the law today. Nothing in this bill would affect the Weldon amendment as we know it. Nothing in this bill would affect the ability of a plan to prohibit coverage of abortion either on medically necessary grounds or on a conscience clause. 
   The bill provides for treating mental health services and physical services with parity. It doesn't address how plans cover physical, i.e., abortion  services. The bill addresses the diagnoses plans must cover, but does not tell plans what specific benefits they have to provide for those diagnoses.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank Mr. Rush for yielding me time. I'd like to respond to the gentleman from Texas and some of the claims he made. 
   First of all, Democrats have only been in the majority for 4 months, and we are looking for ways to end this pain that motorists are feeling every day when they fill up their car at the gas pump, and that is, to bring forth the price-gouging legislation you see before us. 
   Now, Mr. Barton says we should not pass this for this reason or that reason. These are just excuses. He complains about the process. With all due respect, we learned the process from Mr. Barton. 
   Last year, they brought forth a gas price bill, was introduced on Tuesday, May 2, 2006. Wednesday, May 3, 2006, we voted on it. We never saw it. This bill has been around for over a year. So let's stop the excuses. American people don't want arguments about what process. They want relief at the pump, and that's what we're doing. 
   Lookit, today Members of the House have a very simple choice. Vote to stand up with consumers, your constituents, who are paying record gasoline prices, nationwide average, record prices, or vote to protect big oil companies' enormous profits. 
   My bill, H.R. 1252, which has over 120 bipartisan cosponsors, would give the Federal Trade Commission the explicit authority to investigate and punish those who artificially inflate the price of energy. The bill would provide a clear, enforceable definition of price gouging; focus enforcement on the worst offenders, especially companies that sell more than a half billion dollars a year of gasoline. We strengthen penalties, both criminal and civil, with up to triple damage for those who would price-gouge us; and direct the penalties collected to go into the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. 
   Congress must pass without any more excuses this legislation. Today's legislation is truly a first step in addressing the outrageous prices we're seeing at the gas pump. 
   We'll be working to protect consumers from high natural gas prices. We've introduced the Prevent Unfair Manipulation of Prices legislation to improve the oversight of energy trading in this country, and I hope we can move this legislation later this year. 
   Last year, the House of Representatives actually voted on a weaker bill, on May 3 as I indicated, brought forth by Republicans on price gouging. We passed that bill under suspension, like we are today, 389-34. The Senate didn't do anything with it. 
   I'm proud to announce that since the Democrats are in charge, the Senate bill, very similar to my bill, has already made it out of committee, and we expect a vote on it next month. So we can actually bring relief to consumers now that the Democrats are in charge. 
   Today, every Member has a choice. Side with big oil or side with the consumers who are being ripped off at the gas pump. 
   I'd like to thank Speaker Pelosi for her work and leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor, also Chairman Dingell of the full Energy and Commerce Committee, and his staff for their help in putting forth a very fine piece of legislation that is much broader in scope than what we voted on last year, has stronger penalties and will truly give the American people relief at the pump. 
   Before Members leave for the Memorial Day recess, vote to provide your constituents with some relief at the gas pump. Vote for H.R. 1252.

On page 12 of his testimony, footnote number 24, I would like to quote the following: The statute mandating post-Katrina price investigation effectively defined price gouging as an average price of gasoline available for sale to the public that exceeded its average price in the area for the month before the event, unless the increase was substantially attributable to additional costs in connection with production, transportation, delivery and sale of gasoline in that area, or to national or international markets. 
   When questioned yesterday, Commissioner Kovacic said, We've used it. We have the definition. 
   My legislation makes it clear to take these factors into consideration when you determine whether price gouging is going on: How much did it cost delivered at transportation? What was the bill of sale from the supplier. These are factors in the legislation. 
   The FTC clearly understands it. Members of the House should be able to understand it. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1252.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (HISTORIC INCREASES IN VETERANS FUNDING -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, when America's troops volunteer to serve our Nation, they do so believing that the government that sends them into harm's way will live up to its promise to care for them when they return home. However, as we have seen from the debacle at Walter Reed and the current backlog of 400,000 benefits claims pending at the VA, our veterans do not always receive the level of service and care they deserve. 
   Today, this Democratic Congress is taking a vital step in addressing these issues by bringing up a Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill that provides the largest increase in funding for veterans health care in the VA's 77-year history. The funding bill also allocates much-needed funding for mental health and PTSD services; additional funds for construction and modification of extended care facilities; and critical funding for the operation and maintenance of the Armed Forces Retirement Home. 
   This legislation is critical to providing our Nation's veterans with the benefits their service entitles them to and gives the VA the resources necessary to ensure we meet their growing needs. It deserves strong bipartisan support today; and under Democratic leadership, they will receive it.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (AMERICAN VETERANS DISABLED FOR LIFE COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, let me compliment the sponsors of this bill, Mr. Moore from Kansas and Mr. Kirk from Illinois. I am down here on another bill, but I felt compelled to say a few words, if I may, on this piece of legislation, which really honors American disabled veterans with this commemorative coin. This will help us raise the money to build this monument, which is long overdue. 
   Whether you are talking about my father-in-law, Ken Olsen, up in Escanaba, who was disabled in World War II, or the recent disabled members of our Armed Forces coming back from Afghanistan and Iraq, I think we can all personally relate to different stories. 
   Today, Derek Gagne, who spent quite a bit of time at Walter Reed Army Hospital, is coming back to the upper peninsula of Michigan, where family and friends will be waiting to greet him home. Unfortunately, as Derek has left his bed at Walter Reed for an amputation he had to have because of injuries sustained in Iraq, unfortunately, that bed is being taken by another member from my district who also was wounded in Iraq. 
   We talk about our disabled veterans and we honor them throughout our time, especially in the summer months through the Memorial Day and 4th of July and all the holidays we celebrate in parades and ceremonies like that, but it is time that we have the memorial here in Washington, so those of us who make decisions on war understand that it is more than just sending an army here or there, but that there is consequences of it.     
   Whether the injury is an amputation or a closed-head injury, which we are seeing so much of in the war in Iraq, each and every injury serves to remind us of the horrors of war but also that these men and women and their families and their spouses deserve our utmost respect. 
   So I am very pleased to see this memorial start to take on more and more life, to become a reality. And the work of Mr. Moore and Mr. Kirk will certainly help bring forth this memorial. I am very honored to not only cosponsor H.R. 634, but also to support the American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As author of H.R. 692, the Army Specialist Joseph P. Micks Federal Flag Code Amendment Act of 2007, I urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
   Madam Speaker, those who make the ultimate sacrifice for our country deserve our country's utmost respect. H.R. 692 will ensure that our fallen troops and their families are provided the appropriate respect due. 
   The Army Specialist Joseph P. Micks Federal Flag Code Amendment Act of 2007 would require all Federal Government agencies in a State to comply with a Governor's proclamation to fly the national flag at half-staff in honor of those who lose their lives serving our country. 
   H.R. 692 is named after Joseph P. Micks, a soldier from Rapid River, Michigan, who was killed in Iraq last July at the age of 22. Specialist Micks was an all-American soldier and citizen. He was an altar server at church, an Eagle Scout from Troop 466 in Gladstone, Michigan, loved to collect sports memorabilia, and fixed the computers of his neighbors. He joined the Army to help others, to make a difference. 
   His death was not only mourned by his family and friends, but also by the citizens of the rural communities which make up and comprise Delta County, Michigan. As his funeral procession progressed through several rural communities in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, citizens were upset to note that some Federal agencies had not lowered their flags based on the Governor's proclamation in honor of Specialist Micks. 
   There have been several other instances in my district, unfortunately, when a Federal agency has not lowered its flag in accordance with Governor Granholm's proclamation. 
   When I have learned of Federal agencies, offices and buildings that have not lowered their American flags, I have contacted the agencies. I have been told that the directive to lower the flag has not come from the district office or the regional office or from Washington headquarters. It is regrettable that this legislation is even necessary. Last year I wrote the President asking him to issue an executive order to have the flags lowered. He has not responded. However, as there have been not one but multiple instances where Federal agencies have ignored the Governor's request to lower flags, it is important that Congress address this issue.  
   In a recent example, when Navy SEAL Joe Schwedler was killed recently in Iraq, it was the Veterans Affairs hospital that refused to lower its flag. Veterans presented officials with the article from the local newspaper, the Daily News from Iron Mountain. It says: ``Flags Lowered for Crystal Falls Hero,'' and still the Veterans Administration refused to lower the flag. 
   I include this article for the Record.  
   Flags Lowered for Crystal Falls Hero 
   HALF-STAFF ON FRIDAY  
   Lansing.--Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm has ordered United States flags throughout Michigan and on Michigan waters lowered for one day on Friday, April 13, in honor of Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Joseph C. Schwedler of Crystal Falls who died April 6 while on active duty in Iraq. 
   Flags should return to full staff on Saturday, April 14. 
   Schwedler, 27, died from enemy action while conducting combat operations in Al Anbar province, Iraq. He was assigned to the East Coast Navy SEAL Team. 
   When flown at half-staff or half-mast, the United States flag should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff or half-mast position. The flag should again be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. 
   A military funeral will be conducted at 1 p.m. Saturday, April 14, at the Forest Park High School gymnasium in Crystal Falls. 
   A scholarship fund will be established with the Crystal Falls Area Community Fund, Post Office Box 269, Crystal Falls, Michigan 49920. 
   The Jacobs-Plowe Funeral Home, Crystal Falls is in charge of arrangements.  
   The inconsistent patchwork display of respect is particularly hurtful to rural communities where the funeral processions of fallen troops often travel by several Federal facilities, some with flags lowered, others without. 
   Rural Americans disproportionately fill the ranks of our armed services and have disproportionately paid the ultimate sacrifice. Almost half of U.S. military casualties have hailed from towns fewer than 25,000 people; one in five from towns smaller than 5,000 people. It is important that when one of our own perishes serving our Nation they receive the proper respect. 
   I am joined today in support of this legislation by the Military Order of the Purple Heart and Society of Military Widows. In endorsing the legislation, the Society of Military Widows stated: ``We strongly feel that Federal agencies within the State should comply with this order to honor fallen native sons and daughters. As military widows, we can especially appreciate this visible show of respect.'' 
   I would like to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this legislation and those who have helped champion its passage, including Chairman Conyers, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Franks, as well as Congressman Pastor, Congressman Visclosky, and Congressman Lamborn. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I would like to close. 
   I close by saying there is no more powerful way to honor the death of an American than flying our Nation's flag at half-staff. Recognizing this, Governors across this great country have issued proclamations to honor servicemembers from their States who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   This quiet sign of respect is a powerful message to the family that a grateful Nation and a grateful community mourns and honors the sacrifice made by their fallen hero. It is also representative of the shared loss felt by our communities who mourn a family member, a friend, a neighbor and a colleague. 
   The Army Specialist Joseph P. Micks Flag Code Amendment Act will ensure that each of our fallen heroes receives the ultimate honor due to Joe and his family; his wife, Romona; and parents, Ken and Amy Micks. To them we owe a great debt of gratitude. I hope this legislation passes the House today and moves to the Senate, and we can get it completed by Flag Day on June 14.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (COPS -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, in 1994 President Clinton, with the help of congressional Democrats, established the COPS program. The COPS program changed the way we fight crime in this country by giving local jurisdictions the support they needed to put over 100,000 new police officers on the street. The results were clear: a nationwide drop in crime and safer streets in our communities. 
   Having been a police officer for 12 years, I proudly support the continuation of the COPS program. Unfortunately, the President and the Republicans have cut and gut the COPS program. 
   The COPS program is needed now more than ever. The threat of terrorism has put new burdens on our first responders, and recent news reports show violent crime in our cities is again on the rise. As a result, the Democrats will seek to put $1.5 billion forth in the budget to hire more police officers where they can do the most good, on the streets in our communities. 
   The COPS program is a proven concept that has the full support of the law enforcement community. The Democrats will make the program even better. 
   Let us work together to put cops back on the streets and give them the tools they need to keep us and America safe.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (COPS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, today, the House of Representatives is doing the right thing for our Nation's police and first responders by passing the COPS Improvements Act. This bill will improve the safety of communities across our Nation, and will help to reverse the damaging budget cuts that our first responders have suffered in the past 7 years. 
   In 1994, President Clinton's COPS program changed the way law enforcement in this country operates, by giving local departments the resources to fight crime and put 100,000 new law enforcement officers on the streets. The COPS program helped transform our major cities, and gave rural police and sheriffs the resources needed to fight the growing problems of drugs and violence. 
   As a former law enforcement officer, I know how important the COPS program has been to local communities. Its federal-to-local structure puts resources where they are needed: cops on the front lines. 
   As co-chair of the Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus, I work with law enforcement professionals from around the country, and they are unanimous in their verdict: COPS is a program that works. 
   Unfortunately, the current administration disagrees with the approach that was so successful in reducing crime during the Clinton years. The administration has repeatedly attempted to cut and gut the program, in spite of repeated endorsements from every major law enforcement organization and the proven success of COPS in reducing crime. Under the Republican Congress, COPS funding was reduced from its Clinton-era high of $1.42 billion to less than $500 million in 2006, a cut of two-thirds. 
   These cuts had a severe impact on local departments in my district and in districts around the country. Attempts to keep officers on the street, protect our schools, fight drugs and improve our homeland security were all undermined. Republicans in Congress and the Bush administration have been full of rhetoric about the heroism of local first responders and the importance of fighting terrorism, but the budget numbers tell a different story: for the Republican Congress, local cops simply were not a priority. 
   Now we have a chance to set things right. The law enforcement community has a tremendous need for this legislation to be enacted and fully funded. Experts have said that it may cost as much as $18 billion to fully upgrade our first responders to interoperable  communications; this bill will provide money for technology grants to help close that gap. News reports show that the violent crime rate has begun to rise again in our cities; this bill will help local departments deploy more officers to fight violence and make our streets safe. 
   The COPS Improvements Act represents our commitment to listen to our local police departments and give them the resources they need to do their job. I am proud to support this bill, and I urge the President to sign it into law, so that our law enforcement officers can again receive the support and assistance they deserve to keep us and America safe.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of Mr. Whitfield's amendment that would amend funding for the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act, or NASPER. 
   Two years ago, Congress passed NASPER and it was signed into law, making it the only statutory authorized program to assist States in combating prescription drug abuse of controlled substances through prescription drug monitoring programs. Congress realized that more needed to be done to aid States to set up or improve State systems that enable authorities to identify prescription drug abusers, as well as the problem doctors who betray their high ethical standards of their profession by over or incorrectly prescribing prescription drugs. 
   The new law, NASPER law, authorized $10 million in fiscal year 2008 and $10 million each year through fiscal year 2010. Although NASPER has been signed into law, Congress has yet to appropriate funds to the HHS for this program for the past 3 years. Given the existence of this authorized program, it would seem to be inappropriate not to fund NASPER, while funding unauthorized prescription drug monitoring programs. By doing this, Congress sets a bad precedent in sanctioning the creation and continued operation of Federal programs through the appropriation process. 
   NASPER was passed with bipartisan support after many years of hard work by many Members on both sides of the aisle and those of us who are on the Energy and Commerce Committee. NASPER is the only solution which will assist physicians, establish minimum standards for State prescription drug monitoring programs, and substantially reduce prescription drug abuse. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support the Whitfield amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, during the past 4 years big oil companies have seen their profits quadruple, while gas prices doubled and America continues to depend on foreign oil to operate our cars and our economy. 
   Yet, the Republican Congress did not think this was enough. They chose to give Big Oil billions in tax breaks and outrageous royalty incentives, instead of working to protect consumers and promote alternative energy. 
   Today we are sending $800 million per day to the Middle East and other oil producing countries. America now has record high dependence on foreign oil, and the need is growing. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress must support consumers instead of Big Oil. Democrats have put forth a bill to increase our investment in renewable energy and put our Nation on a path to energy independence. The first step is to repeal the billions of dollars in subsidies given to Big Oil so that America can instead invest that money in clean and renewable energy sources. 
   Beginning the process of curbing our addiction to foreign oil is one of the main priorities of the Democratic Congress during the first 100 hours. I hope Democrats and Republicans will come together and pass this commonsense legislation that will promote our national and economic security.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment, labeled Stupak #39, to extend eligibility for disability pay to certain cadets at our military academies. 
   Each year, a small number of enlisted military personnel voluntarily separate from the military in order to attend one of the military academies. In doing so, they give up many of the privileges and protections that came with their regular military status. 
   In the Fiscal Year 2005 Defense Authorization Act, Congress recognized the sacrifices and risks that military cadets undergo by bringing them into the military health care and disability system. However, this protection is effective only from the date of enactment, which was October 2004. 
   Enlisted soldiers who choose to leave the service today to attend a military academy will be covered by the military disability system, but soldiers who attended before 2004 are not. 
   A problem with this arrangement came to my attention in 2006 and I have been working in Congress since then to make an effective change. James Hildgendorf, a constituent of mine, was serving as an enlisted soldier, and was selected to attend West Point. He de-enlisted and became a cadet. However, while at school, he sustained severe injuries that ended his military career. 
   Because he had given up his enlisted status to become a cadet, and because he graduated prior to October 2004, he was found ineligible for the disability pay that he would have received as an ordinary soldier. 
   My amendment would rectify James' situation and that of soldiers in the same situation, by taking the changes made by Congress in 2004 and pushing their effective date back to January 1, 2000 for personnel who gave up their enlisted status in order to attend a military academy. The amendment effectively extends eligibility for military disability retired pay to individuals who left enlisted service in order to attend a military academy between January 1, 2000 and October 28, 2004, and who suffered a disabling injury while attending the academy. 
   This amendment would not affect all cadets, but it would give recognition to the special risks taken by those enlisted men and women who gave up their enlisted status to attend an academy prior to 2004. 
   The affected population would likely be relatively small. The Congressional Research Service estimates that fewer than 575 individuals gave up military status in order to attend an academy between 2000 and 2004, and only a small percentage of those individuals incurred a disability at the academy. Additionally, a preliminary cost estimate conducted by the Congressional Budget Office shows this amendment would result in less than $500,000 in direct spending. 
   However, for those individuals to whom this amendment does apply, it will make a big difference. The soldiers who are chosen to attend the military academies are the best and brightest from among our enlisted ranks. Congress should not continue to deny them their disability benefits. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment and I encourage members to vote for final passage of the Fiscal Year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. 
   Vote ``yes'' on the Stupak amendment.

   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, this weekend, communities throughout our Nation honored the brave men and women who have defended our Nation in previous wars, as well as those who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. While parades, speeches and ceremonies are important, I believe it is more important for the U.S. Government to properly care for and honor our veterans. 
   Recently, the Department of Defense has instituted a new policy on bonuses, which does not provide servicemembers with their full enlistment bonus, reenlistment or other bonuses if they are wounded while in combat and cannot return to duty. This means that combat wounded veterans who are discharged from the military because of their serious injuries will not receive their full bonus. This policy is unacceptable and disgraceful. It is unbelievable that the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our Nation are being shortchanged and denied the bonuses they were promised by their government. 
   Congressman Jason Altmire has legislation to correct this inequity, but we should not have to rely on legislation. I call upon the Commander in Chief, President Bush, to reverse this policy immediately. We have a letter going to the President asking him to terminate this policy and ensure all outstanding bonuses be paid promptly.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (S.J. RES. 45, GREAT LAKES-ST. LAWRENCE RIVER BASIN WATER RESOURCES COMPACT -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, today the House will vote on the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resource Compact. I am asking Members to vote ``no'' and slow down the approval of this compact. 
   I am deeply concerned that this compact would allow Great Lakes water to be defined as a ``product.'' By allowing water to be defined as a ``product,'' the compact could subject the Great Lakes to international trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA; or the World Trade Organization, WTO. 
   There is also no language in the compact that recognizes that Great Lakes water is held in public trust. The public owns the waters of the Great Lakes, and anything Congress passes should preserve this principle. 
   The compact was created in response to the first large-scale threat of privatization of the Great Lakes. In 1998 the Ontario Minister of Natural Resources granted a permit to a private firm, the Nova Group, to ship millions of gallons of Lake Superior water to China. I led the fight opposing the sale of our Great Lakes water, and we were successful in pressuring the Canadian Government to suspend this permit. This case exposed the region's vulnerability to private and public entities who wished to commercialize the world's largest body of fresh water for financial gain. While the original intent of the Great Lakes Compact was to protect our water from diversions, the compact the States have sent to Congress may unintentionally have the opposite effect and set a precedent that would open up the door to water diversions. 
   The Great Lakes Governors have spent more than 3 years addressing the local and State implications of the compact. Unfortunately, we have not undergone the same deliberative process. We have spent less than 20 legislative days since the introduction of this legislation. We have conducted no hearings to consider the Federal and international implications. Congress is rushing to a vote when one of our Nation's most precious natural resources, the Great Lakes, is at stake. So before we ratify the Great Lakes Compact, the following questions must be fully investigated: 
   First, how does the compact's exemption of water in containers smaller than 5.7 gallons affect the Federal prohibition on diversions under the Water Resources Development Act? 
   Second, will creating a Federal definition of Great Lakes water as a ``product'' subject it to international trade law or agreements such as NAFTA or WTO? 
   Third, what actions taken by the Great Lakes States to protect the Great Lakes from international commercial entities who seek to privatize the Great Lakes ever be subject to claims under GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; or the WTO? 
   I have asked these questions to the International Joint Commission, the United States Trade Representative, and the Department of State before Congress adjourned for the August recess. While these agencies have acknowledged my requests, they were unable to provide any substantive answers. Without answers to these questions, Members should vote ``no'' on this legislation. I do not know how any Member in good conscience could vote to approve legislation that may unintentionally open the Great Lakes water to diversions through privatization, commercialization, and exportation. So I urge my colleagues to slow this process down. There is no time limit on this agreement. We can take our time. 
   So I urge you to vote ``no'' on Senate Joint Resolution 45 so we may fully address the questions and pass a compact that truly protects the Great Lakes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, this legislation does one simple thing--it requires health insurance companies to be up front and honest with their policyholders when they place limitations and restrictions on benefits prior to selling them an insurance policy. 
   Currently, the way insurance regulations are set, many Americans are unaware that their health insurance may not cover injuries resulting from certain recreational activities because their policy is unclear or very broad. 
   This lack of clarity has created a confusing situation for individuals that may ride motorcycles, horses, snowmobiles, or participate in other recreational activities. 
   While millions of Americans enjoy these activities safely every year, when an individual is injured, they often find that their insurance will not cover their medical expenses until it is too late. 
   H.R. 6908 would require that any limitations and restrictions on insurance benefits be explicit and clear. Insurance companies would be required to make available to participants and beneficiaries in an easily understandable manner a description of the limitations and restrictions included in the policy. 
   By passing this straightforward legislation, we will protect our constituents that ride motorcycles, horses, snowmobiles, or participate in other recreational activities from being caught by surprise when they thought that their policy covered any possible injuries from their accident. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation. 
   I want to thank Congressman Burgess for his work on this legislation as well as Chairmen Dingell and Barton. 
   I also want to thank Bridgett Taylor, Ryan Long, and Josh Martin with the Committee staff and Erika Orloff of my personal staff for their hard work on this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Much has been said about this legislation, my legislation. I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Mr. Young for their leadership in helping me correct a grave injustice, not just for the Native Americans, but also for the non-Native Americans, my constituents. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, H.R. 2176, which is a commonsense fix of a very serious matter. The bill would provide for the settlement of certain land claims of the Bay Mills Indian Community and of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe in Michigan. 
   I have been working on this problem for over 10 years, and I first introduced legislation in 1999 in an effort to resolve this issue. I became involved in this land claim dispute at the request of the property owners at Charlotte Beach, not of the Native American tribes. Tribal claims to the land have created a cloud on their title, owned by my constituents in Charlotte Beach. 
   As a result, local assessors have reduced the property values of the Charlotte Beach land owners by 90 percent because of the valid clouded title created by the Indian land claim dispute. 
   The tribes' claim to the land in question dates back to 1855, when the U.S. Government signed the Treaty of Detroit, deeding the land to the tribes. However, the land was later sold to non-native land speculators without the Native Americans' consent, eventually resulting in an eviction of the tribal members. 
   In order to finally resolve this land claim dispute, a settlement agreement was reached in 2002 between former Governor John Engler and the tribes. The settlement agreement has been reaffirmed by Michigan's current Governor, Governor Jennifer Granholm. 
   After years of extensive negotiations between the parties, this bill represents a straightforward solution to this localized problem in my district. 
   In order to implement this agreement, Congress must approve the negotiated land settlement. Unfortunately, incumbent casino gaming interests are opposed to this commonsense solution, and they have circulated misleading information in an attempt to derail this legislation. So let me take the opportunity to set the record straight on my legislation. 
   First, this bill has nothing to do with ``off-reservation gaming acquisitions.'' It is a land claim settlement. Off-reservation gaming occurs when a tribe purchases private land and petitions the Secretary of Interior to place the land into trust for gaming purposes. This legislation ratifies a land claim settlement negotiated by the State of Michigan. This was done under the authority granted in IGRA's land claim exception clause. 
   Second. In regards to the argument against the location of these lands, the selected lands were chosen by Governor John Engler in consultation with local communities, not with the tribes. The sites were selected for economic development. Local support had been expressed through a local referendum and through unanimous resolutions by the cities and counties, and it has an existing gaming market on the Canadian side of the border where U.S. dollars are being spent. 
   Our legislation follows, rather than sets, congressional precedent for settling land claim disputes. Congress has passed over a dozen settlement acts on which replacement lands are eligible for gaming, including two that specifically state that the land is eligible for gaming, most recently that of the Torres Martinez Tribe of California and that of the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, in 2000. 
   Our legislation does not violate the wishes of Michigan voters. Opponents have attempted to confuse Members about the wishes of Michigan voters on this issue by citing passage of the 2004 referendum, which seeks to limit the expansion of private gaming in our State. The actual wording of the referendum states, ``A voter approval requirement does not apply to Indian tribal gaming.''

   Mr. STUPAK. So the actual wording of the referendum states, ``A voter approval requirement does not apply to Indiana tribal gaming.'' 
   By passing H.R. 2176, Congress will bring about a final resolution to this land claim dispute that has been going on for more than 100 years. Without congressional approval, the land exchange cannot be completed, and the residents of Charlotte Beach, my constituents, will continue to face clouded land titles and economic hardships. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ignore the rhetoric from those attempting to protect casinos. 
   Support this land claim settlement. Support H.R. 2176.

   Mr. STUPAK. On the Federal claim brought forth by Bay Mills, the Sault tribe was not part of that action, and the Federal court said, your cousins--the Chippewas of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe--must be joined. Go back and get joined and come back later. In the meantime, they started negotiations in the State court. The State court said, you have a valid land claim, but we cannot give you economic damages because the 6-year statute of limitations has run. This claim should have been brought 100 years ago. 
   So that's the injustice we're trying to correct; they could not be given money damages because more than 6 years had lapsed. The statute of limitations had run.

   Mr. STUPAK. Because they began the negotiation under IGRA, as required under section 20, to begin a negotiation with the Governor, and they had to make a settlement with the Governor, who can do it. So, instead of going back to court, they used the legislature and the Governor's office to work out a settlement to avoid further litigation.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   This debate is really one of the most fundamental, important debates this body can undertake. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker: I support stem cell research using adult stem cells, cord blood, and amniotic stem cells. I do not, however, support destroying life in the name of research. 
   H.R. 3 fails to address the most basic essential ethical question of when does life begin and when should life, including human embryos, be open to experimentation and scientific research. 
   As elected representatives, we have been cloaked with America's legislative responsibility. With this responsibility we are entrusted to determine the ethical and moral bounds of scientific research and to determine what value America places on human life. I believe our work today must reflect America's belief that all life has value, from the human embryo to those in the twilight of their life. We must not legislate shortcuts for one life over another. 
   Embryonic stem cell research requires the killing of human embryos, which if left to grow would become children. Where do we as a Nation draw the ethical and moral line on scientific research as to when life begins, and at which stage of human life are we willing to sacrifice one life to promote the life of another? 
   The good intentions of the proponents of H.R. 3 do not answer these questions. The proponents do not allow us, as America's elected representatives, to draw the ethical and moral line for human life. Under H.R. 3, when do embryos become human life? After 40 hours? After 2 days or 14 days? 
   H.R. 3 leaves the research guidelines to an administration official. As elected leaders, we should not entrust an unnamed individual to set America's guidelines on the value of human life. Mr. Speaker, I believe that human embryos, as life, should be treated and valued with the same respect as you and me. 
   While the promise of embryonic stem cells is still questionable, adult stem cells are being used today to save lives. Recognizing this, the National Institutes of Health spent $568 million in fiscal year 2006 on adult stem cell research. 
   Adult stem cells are being used today in clinical trials and in clinical practice to treat 72 diseases and injuries. As science learns more about the building blocks of life, researchers announced this week that stem cells found in the placenta and the amniotic fluid hold the key stem cells for research. These stem cells can be obtained while protecting life. This research offers science the ability to provide hope to those who suffer from disabling injuries and diseases while protecting all human life. 
   Let me be clear: I am committed to funding ethical scientific research that will unlock the origins of diseases and develop cures that can help my constituents. We cannot, however, let science leapfrog our ethics. I urge Members to protect life at all stages and vote ``no'' on H.R. 3.  
   Mr. Speaker, this debate on H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, is really one of the most fundamental, important debates that this body can undertake.

   Under H.R. 3, when do embryos become human life? After 40 hours? After 2 days? H.R. 3 is silent on when embryos become human life--it doesn't specify how long these embryos are allowed to grow before they are killed--2 days, 5 days, 14 days, or more! 
   Proponents of H.R. 3 will claim that this legislation will leave the research guidelines to an unelected and unnamed administration official within 60 days. A bureaucrat will set the guidelines, for scientific research and experimentation on human life! 
   As elected leaders we should not entrust an unnamed individual to set America's guidelines on the value of human life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that human embryos, as life, should be treated and valued with the same respect, as you and me.

   As science learns more about the building blocks of life, researchers announced this week that stem cells in human amniotic fluid hold the key stem cells for research. These stem cells can be obtained while protecting human life. 
   These stem cells are found in the placenta and the amniotic fluid of pregnant women. These stem cells hold the same promise as embryonic stem cells, including an ability to grow into brain, bone, muscle and other tissues that could be used to treat a variety of diseases. This research offers science the ability to provide hope for those who suffer from disabling injuries and diseases while protecting all human life. 
   Let me be clear, I am committed to funding ethical scientific research that will unlock the origins of diseases and develop cures that can help my constituents. 
   We cannot, however, let science leap-frog our ethics, our morals, and our responsibility to protect human life at every stage of development. I urge Members to protect human life at each stage of development. Vote ``No'' on H.R. 3.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the new Democratic Congress which will finally address high energy prices. 
   Many Americans have a hard time understanding what often seems like arbitrary reasons for fluctuations in gas prices. As the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I look forward to bringing transparency to the oil and gas markets to clarify their effect on gas prices. 
   A recent example of confusing market behavior was in September and October of 2006, just before the November elections. Gas prices dropped an average of 60 cents per gallon. This 60-cent drop in gas prices occurred despite the fact that there were pipeline disruptions in Alaska and indications that OPEC would cut oil production. 
   While gas prices dropped 60 cents a gallon in September and October, crude prices only dropped 10 cents. For years, the American Petroleum Institute, API, the oil companies' main lobbying group, spent millions of dollars on public relations campaigns convincing the  American people that big oil companies are victims of international crude oil prices and have little to say in the final price of gasoline. 
   API insists a price of a gallon of gas is directly related to the price of a barrel of crude oil. Yet before the election we have a 60-cent per gallon drop in gas prices and only a 10 percent drop in the price of crude. 
   Consumer advocates have accused oil companies of purposely reducing gas prices in the months before the election to help Republican candidates. Earlier this month, National Public Radio featured a representative from the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights who argued oil companies intentionally reduced the price of gas to influence the November elections. 
   After the elections, gas prices have increased an average of 15 cents a gallon. Oil companies were able to significantly reduce the price of gas in September-October, then increase the price right after the election, without a corresponding change in the price of crude oil. 
   This is not the first time oil companies have been accused of manipulating gas prices. Internal memos from several oil companies written in the 1990s have revealed that big oil companies limit refinery capacity in the United States to control the supply, cost, and price of gasoline. 
   After Hurricane Katrina, the government found that refiners, wholesalers, and retailers charged significantly higher prices that were not the result of either increased costs or market trends. However, because there is no Federal energy price-gouging law in place, the Federal Trade Commission cannot even prosecute this price-gouging practice. 
   For too long, oil companies have benefited from tax breaks, government subsidies, and lack of oversight. At the same time, oil companies have made record profits at the expense of the American people. Next week, the U.S. House of Representatives will consider legislation to end the tax breaks and special subsidies for Big Oil. 
   Rather than helping the oil companies' bottom line, these tax breaks and subsidies will be reallocated to promote alternative energy sources to end our Nation's addiction to oil. 
   Later this year, I look forward to having an open and honest debate on my legislation to create a Federal law against price gouging for gasoline, natural gas, propane, and other fuel. I will continue to work towards greater oversight for oil and gas trading, especially off-market trades, known as OTC trades. 
   I will be reintroducing my legislation, the Prevent Unfair Manipulation of Prices Act, to improve oversight of oil trades and strengthen penalties for traders who attempt to illegally manipulate these markets. 
   Under the Republican leadership, the oil companies enjoyed record profits while Americans suffered with record high gas prices, minimal oversight, and price manipulation. The American people have now chosen a new direction, electing Democrat majorities in both the House and the Senate. 
   I look forward to being able to address high energy prices, to stop price gouging, market manipulation, and to stand up for the American consumer.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (GREAT LAKES--ST. LAWRENCE RIVER BASIN WATER RESOURCES COMPACT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resource Compact. I am deeply concerned that this compact would allow Great Lakes water to be defined as a product. By allowing water to be defined as a product, the compact would subject the Great Lakes to international trade agreements, such as the North America Free Trade Agreement or the World Trade Organization. 
   There is also no language in the compact that recognizes the Great Lakes waters held in trust. The public owns the water of the Great Lakes, and anything we pass should preserve this. 
   While the original intent of the Great Lakes Compact was to protect our water from diversion, the compact that the States have sent to Congress may unintentionally have the opposite effect and set a precedent that would open the door to diversions. 
   The Great Lakes Governors have spent more than 3 years addressing the local and State implications of the compact. Unfortunately, we have not done the same deliberative process. We have spent less than 20 legislative days since the introduction of this legislation. We have had no hearings in the House to consider the Federal or international implications. We are rushing to a vote when one of our Nation's most precious natural resources, the Great Lakes, is at stake. 
   Before we ratify the Great Lakes Compact, the following questions must be fully investigated. How does the compact's exemption of water in a container smaller than 5.7 gallons affect the Federal prohibition on diversions of water under the Water Resources Development Act? 
   Will creating a definition of Great Lakes water as a product subject it to international trade law or agreements such as NAFTA? 
   Would actions taken by the Great Lakes States to protect the Great Lakes against efforts by international commercial entities who seek to privatize the Great Lakes ever be subject to claims under the general agreements on tariffs and trade or to WTO? 
   I have asked these questions of the International Joint Commission, the United States Trade Representative and the Department of State before Congress adjourned for the August recess. While these agencies have acknowledged my request, they were unable to provide me with any substantive responses. This alone should be reason enough to vote on this legislation until we have the answers to my questions. 
   I cannot in good conscience vote to approve legislation that may unintentionally open the Great Lakes to diversions through privatization, commercialization and exportation. It is imperative that we take our time to ensure that the legal protections we seek to enact and preserve to restore the quality and quantity of the Great Lakes water be done properly. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on Senate Joint Resolution 45 so that we may fully address the questions and pass a compact that protects the Great Lakes. 
   In my 16 years here in the House of Representatives, I have fought to protect these Great Lakes. Why are we rushing now to do a compact that we have not had time to examine, when the State Department cannot answer our questions, when we don't have the answers? 
   After we pass this legislation, it will be too late to say, oh, we might have made a mistake here. Let's not open up our Great Lakes water to commercialization and to international agreements we have no control over. Let's get the answers before we pass this legislation.

But once the law is passed, you can't go back and amend it, unless the States take the initiative, because under WRDA and what you are verifying here, the States would have control over it. So even if the Congress wanted us to change the compact because they are diverting our water, we can't do it unless the States act first. You are giving up the right. You are ratifying this compact, and the only way you can only come back into this compact is through the States, and not necessarily the Federal Government.

   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, back in 2003, congressional Republicans supported the Bush-Cheney energy bill that was written in secret by Big Oil. And, boy, are we paying. 
   Three years later, we have record prices for consumers and record profits for the oil companies. Since taking control of Congress last year, Democrats have worked hard to reverse these failed energy policies. 
   For the first time in 32 years, we increased the fuel efficiency standards for vehicles so they will be more efficient, which will save Americans about $1,000 a year. We also made a historic commitment to investing in biofuels and increasing domestic oil supply and drill responsibly. 
   This is a good start, but more needs to be done. That's why House Democrats brought eight pieces of legislation up in July to cut the high cost of gas, and Republicans opposed every one of those bills. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's time for House Republicans to work with us Democrats to provide the American people lower costs at the pump and lower costs in the grocery store by ending the excessive Wall Street speculation in our energy markets and increasing our energy and food costs. Mr. Speaker, it's time to end the manipulation of prices by Wall Street and the excessive speculation, to lower prices and save this American economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Mr. Dingell and Mr. Pallone on crafting a well-balanced bill and for all of the hard work you and your staff have spent on the CHAMP Act. 
   The State Children's Health Initiative Program was enacted with bipartisan support a decade ago to reduce the number of low-income, uninsured  children by expanding eligibility levels and simplifying application procedures. 
   In 2006, SCHIP provided insurance to 6.7 million children. In Michigan, roughly 118,000 children are enrolled in SCHIP. Eighty-six percent of these SCHIP children are of working parents who are unable to afford private health insurance for their children. 
   SCHIP is vitally important to children living in our country's rural areas. Of the 50 counties with the highest rates of uninsured children, 44 are rural counties. 
   This legislation commits $50 billion to reauthorize and improve the SCHIP program to protect and continue coverage for 6 million children. In addition, this legislation ensures coverage for an additional 5 million children that are eligible but currently uninsured. 
   I am also very pleased to see the rural investments in the CHAMP Act which maintains Congress's commitment to rural America by extending a number of provisions that, if left to expire, would negatively affect rural beneficiaries' access to Medicare health services. 
   The CHAMP Act provides health care for children, expands preventive Medicare medicine for our seniors and helps make health care more affordable, available and accessible in rural America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.

   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the chairwoman for yielding me time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6460, the Great Lakes Legacy Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   Since coming to Congress, I have made it my mission to protect and promote one of the Nation's most precious resources, the Great Lakes. I am a cosponsor of the Great Lakes Legacy Act and can speak personally on the positive impact it has had on my district. 
   Tannery Bay, located in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, suffered from pollution from byproducts left behind by the Northwestern Leather Company, which operated in the area from 1900 to 1958. On September, 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency, through the Great Lakes Legacy Act program, completed remediation of the Tannery Bay industrial site. In total, the clean-up removed 880,000 pounds of chromium and more than 70 pounds of mercury from the bay and the wetland on Tannery Point. 
   Success stories such as these demonstrate the need for continued support for the Great Lakes Legacy Act. The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that more than 850,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment has been removed since 2004. However, an estimated 75 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment remain in the Great Lakes. 
   This legislation would reauthorize the Great Lakes Legacy Act for an additional 5 years and triple the authorized funding levels for remediation in the Great Lakes up to $150 million per year. 
   I strongly support H.R. 6460 and look forward to the continued success of this program.

   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, this week the House is conducting the most important debate of this Congress, whether Members will support the President's plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq. I oppose the President's plan, and during this debate I am hoping that those who support the escalation of the war can answer a couple of questions. 
   First, if the President is allowed to move forward, how do we guarantee these troops have the protective armor they need? Earlier this month we learned that troop escalation would create logistical hurdles for both the Army and Marines, which are already short thousands of vehicles and armor kits. Members who support the President's plan need to explain how do we provide the troops the equipment they need. 
   Members who support the plan also need to explain where do we come up with the additional troops that will be needed to support 21,500 combat troops. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates as many as 48,000 troops may be required to implement the plan. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are questions that supporters of escalating the war in Iraq should ask before they vote to escalate the war in Iraq.

   After 13 years--this bill will finally make its way to the President's desk, to help protect families from genetic discrimination. 
   Congratulations to the Congresswoman from New York, Ms. Slaughter, for her work in drafting this bill and guiding it through the cumbersome referral to three committees. 
   Together, with Chairman Dingell, Ms. DeGette and Mr. Smith, we were able to include an important provision to protect families from unfair treatment on the basis of the genetic material of their fetuses or children in the process of adoption. 
   Without this bill, families may face genetic information discrimination from testing of embryos and fetuses, as well as children who are in the process of adoption. 
   As genetic testing becomes increasingly common, these provisions will ensure that genetic material gathered through pre-implementation genetic diagnoses, amniocentesis, or other future techniques is not used to limit families' access to health care. 
   Again, I thank Ms. Slaughter for her commitment to reflect these changes throughout the bill in order to avoid any further confusion as to whether or not families can be discriminated against on the basis of the genetic material of their unborn child or child under consideration for adoption. 
   I was proud to work with many Members to include this provision. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote for this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of extending the H-2B returning worker program this year. 
   The H-2B visa program was created to provide access to nonimmigrant temporary workers for seasonal and peak load needs when no American workers can be found. Foreign workers offer small and seasonal businesses short-term help and return to their home country at the end of the season. 
   H-2B visas are capped at 66,000 visas per year. Even with 66,000 visas a year, it still does not meet the labor needs of seasonal businesses. To help fill these additional needs, Congress established the H-2B returning worker program in 2005. This program exempts returning workers who have received an H-2B visa in one of the three previous fiscal years from counting against the 66,000 cap. However, this program expired on September 30. 
   On September 27, 4 days before the season even started, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service had already received enough visa petitions to exceed the cap for H-2B visas for the first half of fiscal year 2008. The application process for the second half of fiscal year 2008 began on December 3, two days ago. 
   Without extending the returning worker program, it's expected that the visas will go quickly, leaving many businesses without the workers they need to fulfill their business needs. This demand highlights the immediate need for Congress to extend the H-2B returning worker program to help small and seasonal businesses fill their seasonal labor needs and keep full-time Americans and their businesses working. 
   These returning workers have provided relief to small businesses throughout the Nation, covering a broad spectrum of industries like landscapers, tourism, seafood processors and carnivals. 
   At this time, I will enter into the Record a letter from the H-2B Workforce Coalition in support of extending the H-2B returning worker program.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Stupak/Barrow amendment No. 16 would prevent any funds appropriated or made available under this Act from being used to increase the deductible veterans must pay to receive their mileage reimbursement. 
   Currently, veterans driving to a Veterans Affairs facility for an examination, treatment, or other medical care receive a mileage reimbursement rate of 28.5 cents per mile. However, the 28.5 cents per mile benefit is subject to a $7.77 deductible for each one-way trip and $15.54 for a round trip with a maximum deductible of $46.62 per calendar month. 
   Now, in a vast rural area where I live, many of my veterans drive more than 100 miles for an examination or treatment. So if a veteran lives 70 miles round trip from a VA facility, they would file a request for reimbursement for $19.95 minus the $15.54 deductible. This would mean a veteran would receive a mere $4.41. Even today's most efficient vehicles cannot make a 17-mile round trip on $4.41 when the national average price for a gallon of gasoline is $3.96. 
   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill, as it is currently written, would increase the mileage, and I'm appreciative of that. It would increase the reimbursement rate from 28.5 cents up to 41.5 cents per mile. And I support this increase, but the Act does not address the subsequent required increase in the deductible. 
   Under law, each time the mileage reimbursement rate is increased, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to proportionately increase the deductible veterans must pay to receive this benefit. The amendment offered by myself and the gentleman from Georgia would freeze the deductible and prevent the secretary from increasing it when mileage reimbursement is increased. 
   In these times of rising gas prices, it's hard to justify an increase in the deductible veterans are required to pay for mileage reimbursement they receive. While I support the mileage reimbursement included in the bill, we need to make sure that the required increase in the deductible doesn't eliminate the benefit the veteran would receive from this policy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to give the balance of my time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Barrow), the co-author of this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, as we wind up this debate on escalating the war in Iraq, I wish to thank Speaker Pelosi for allowing Members of Congress to express themselves on the most serious debate that will occur in the 110th Congress. Perhaps more importantly, we should thank the American people for voting for a new majority which has allowed a free and open debate on the President's plan to escalate the war. With their votes, the American people have clearly demanded a new direction for the war in Iraq. Today's debate symbolizes more than just a debate on escalating the war, the debate symbolizes a new direction for America's policy in Iraq driven by the American people, not by a President who has lost touch. 
   In October of 2002, just before the general election, President Bush insisted a vote be held on Resolution 114 which would allow the use of Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in Iraq. At that time, I argued that the United States did not have the moral, legal and ethical authority to go to war with Iraq and that our Nation would lose its moral authority to speak out against aggression throughout the world. 
   It would be very easy for me to stand here and remind my constituents that I voted against the war in Iraq. It is sufficient, however, to simply note that the evidence to justify the war has been repudiated. Rationale for this war has been inadequate. And our Nation's credibility has been eroded. 
   While some of us opposed the war in Iraq, our support for our troops has never wavered. Congress has appropriated the supplies and the resources to assure that our troops have what they need to accomplish their mission and return home safely. We know too painfully that more than 3,100 Americans have not returned home and more than 23,000 have been wounded. We have visited with the wounded and comforted the families of the fallen. We simply cannot allow the President to continue to fight this war as if there were no consequences for our troops, their families and our country. By standing up against this escalation of the war, we are supporting the troops. 
   Because of this war, many lives have been shattered and broken. I speak of the lives of family members who have lost loved ones. I speak of the brave troops recovering from their wounds at Walter Reed Army Hospital or the recently dedicated amputee clinic in Texas. As a Nation, we are comprised of a reasonable, noble, compassionate and determined people. 
   I believe that it is not in our Nation's best interest to leave a shattered and broken Iraq behind. Still, we cannot continue with a policy of military might and no diplomatic foresight. Instead of military escalation, our Nation should embark upon a diplomatic and political escalation. The current administration with its ``military might makes right'' philosophy is no longer applicable in Iraq. This administration has not seriously focused on the diplomacy and political persuasion necessary to end this war. 
   I am struck by the recent news out of Korea. It is reported that after years of negotiation, the administration may have reached an agreement with North Korea on its nuclear threat. The journey was long, discussions were difficult, diplomacy was frustrating, but we may have accomplished our goal without having to go to war. There is a lesson to be learned here, reflected in the words of an American journalist, Anne O'Hare McCormick, who said: 
   ``Today the real test of power is not the capacity to make war but the capacity to prevent it.'' 
   I call on the Bush administration and this Congress to escalate diplomacy. I call on the Bush administration and this Congress to escalate political pressure. This war is a mistake and what we need now is a President who has the courage to admit his mistake. We need a President who will bring peace and stability to Iraq through diplomacy rather than military force. 
   In an earlier time, in an earlier war, a young man spoke out. That young man was Bobby Kennedy and his words have lived with me for many years. So to our service men and women, to my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives, and to those whose hearts are burdened by war, I leave you Bobby's challenge: 
   ``Diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped each time a man stands up for an ideal or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest wall.'' 
   Our vote for this resolution will not stop the war in Iraq. It will not restore the shattered and broken lives here in America and in Iraq. It will not bring peace and stability to Iraq. But it will send a tiny ripple of hope. 
   I still believe in that tiny ripple of hope. 
   I still believe in diverse acts of courage. 
   I still believe in the greatness of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (VETERANS GUARANTEED BONUS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I rise in support of the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007. Currently, when a servicemember is wounded in combat and cannot return to duty, the Department of Defense allows each military branch to determine, in their discretion, whether to pay a servicemember any portion of a bonus still due to them. As a result, some members of the Armed Forces, who have served their Nation bravely, sustaining severe injuries, are not receiving their full bonus. 
   In the last month, I have written to the President on three occasions urging him to immediately terminate this disgraceful policy. In response, I received conflicting information from the Department of Defense regarding this policy. Deputy Under Secretary William Carr wrote me on December 12, in a letter, and he stated: ``The Army pays all unpaid enlisted and re-enlistment bonus installments.'' Not true. 
   In conversations with the Department of the Army National Guard Bureau, my staff has been told that instead of paying the full bonus due, the Army prorates a soldier's bonus based on the number of months the soldier served before their medical discharge. It's still unclear as to what the policy is with the Army. This is why we need to enact a Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act. We need to establish a uniform Department of Defense policy to ensure all outstanding bonuses are promptly paid to our deserving heroes. Bonuses should be paid in full, without question. 
   I was first alerted to this program by an Iraqi war veteran in my district, Derek Gagne, from Wilson, Michigan. Derek, an Army National Guardsman, had been denied the remainder of his bonus after suffering a severe eye injury, losing part of his foot and his leg when his Humvee struck an IED in Iraq. Only after numerous calls and questions from my office is Derek now receiving his bonus. Our veterans should not need to fight so hard for something they are entitled to. 
   I am pleased to join my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire) in cosponsoring the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act. This bipartisan bill, supported by over 200 Members of Congress, would require the Department of Defense to establish a uniform policy which provides veterans who are discharged from the military due to combat-related injuries or service-connected injuries their full payment of any bonuses within 90 days of discharge. 
   This legislation should not be necessary. As Commander in Chief, the President has the ability to correct this policy by requiring all military branches to provide severely wounded members with their full bonuses. This administration is quick to go to war, but slow to respond to the needs of our veterans. 
   Our Nation must be committed to caring for and honoring our veterans not just with words, but with deeds. Ensuring that our soldiers receive the bonuses they were promised is the least we can do for those who put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms.

   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, or GINA. Congratulations to all who have worked for the last number of years on this legislation, especially Ms. Slaughter. 
   In reviewing this bill, I was concerned that families may face genetic information discrimination from testing of embryos and fetuses, plus I was concerned about children who are in the process of being adopted. As genetic testing becomes increasingly common, GINA protections must be extended to genetic material gathered through pre-implementation genetic diagnoses, amniocentesis or other future techniques. 
   Together with Chairman Dingell, Ms. DeGette and Mr. Smith, we were able to close this loophole, which could have been exploited against families on the basis of genetic material of their fetuses or children in the process of being adopted. 
   I am proud to have worked with so many Members to correct the concerns I had on this bill. I support the passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, communities across our Nation have felt the effects of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but rural communities have been hit especially hard. A recent Associated Press story reported that nearly half the casualties in Iraq have come from towns of fewer than 25,000 people, and one in five come from towns of 5,000 or less. Rural States have had some of the highest per capita loss rates. 
   I have certainly seen this in my own district. Each loss from a small town affects not only the family but the entire community. In light of these facts, we need to make sure that we are taking care of all the families who have lost loved ones in military service, whether those families live in cities or in small rural communities. 
   In the past year, I have encountered several disturbing cases in my own district in which families had to fight to have the remains of their loved one flown to an airport near the intended place of burial. The military advised the families that the bodies of their loved one would be flown to the nearest major urban airport, which in some cases, as in my district, are hundreds of miles away. 
   In order to meet the remains at the airport, one of the families would have been required to drive over 4 hours each way through a snowstorm. There is no reason to impose these kinds of burdens on a family that has already made the ultimate sacrifice. This kind of treatment is disrespectful and unfair. Families should not have to bargain with the military in order to have the remains of their loved ones flown to a location where they can meet their fallen hero. 
   In many cases, veterans organizations and other community groups want to show their respect when a fallen soldier arrives at an airport. We  should encourage these demonstrations of respect, instead of discouraging them by forcing community members to drive to urban airports hours away from home. 
   Last year, as part of the fiscal year 2007 Defense authorization, the House passed a similar provision that would have required the military to fly the remains of a fallen soldier to the military airfield nearest the place of burial. Unfortunately, this provision was not included in the final conference version of the bill; however, I think it was a good provision, and Members of the House were right to support it. 
   My amendment would provide greater flexibility. It would require that, whenever possible, the Department of Defense fly the remains to the nearest military or civilian airport. The amendment would allow the military to use any of the numerous small airports that exist in rural districts, so long as the remains are delivered to a place that is acceptable to the family of the fallen soldier. 
   Mr. Chairman, the problems I speak of are not only in my district, but we have seen reports from New York to California where this has occurred in the smaller rural districts. 
   As Americans, we owe a tremendous debt to those families who have given up a loved one in war to protect our freedom. This amendment will eliminate an unfair situation that those families have faced and will help to show our respect and gratitude for the sacrifice they have made. 
   I ask Members to support my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the words of the ranking member, Mr. Hunter. The difference between what I'm doing here tonight and an amendment we did last year, last year was the closest military airfield. There are no military airfields in my district. My district is 600 miles from one end to the other, and when they want to bring the remains of our soldiers to Detroit or Milwaukee, it is 4, 5, 6 hours for people, for my constituents to go to greet this fallen hero back on U.S. soil. And you have your local groups, your American Legions, your veterans who'd like to welcome that fallen soldier back home, but to drive 4, 5, 6 hours, and one we had last winter was through a terrible snowstorm. 
   We have had to intervene. We have worked with DOD and others, and they've been pretty good about trying to accommodate everyone. We realize it's hard and it's difficult. 
   So the only difference is this amendment goes a little farther, not just military airfield but civilian airfields. We have plenty of civilian airfields throughout my district and rural America that can accommodate the planes necessary to bring home our fallen soldiers. 
   So I would like to thank Mr. Skelton, Mrs. Tauscher, Mr. Hunter and Mr. Saxton for their help and support. This is an amendment that we're glad we can do to honor those service men and women and also their families and the local communities when they've fallen in service in honor to their country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. STUPAK. Before I get into speculation, because we want to address speculation, but because my friends on your side keep saying it is only an 8-percent increase in oil company profits. I agree, it might be 8 percent from 2006 to 2007, but when you make $118 billion, the most ever of any corporation, to top it the next year is pretty darn hard. 
   But 8 percent on $118 billion is $123 billion, where 5 years ago they were at $30 billion. They doubled it in 2003 and went to $60 billion. That is a 50 percent increase. Then you go to $82 billion, and I am no math major, but that is about a 25 percent increase. And then from $82 billion to $109 billion, that is a 20 percent or 21 percent increase. And then $118 billion, I guess they had a bad year, they only made $8 billion more than the previous record year. That might be 8 percent. 
   But look at these numbers, they are staggering. They are absolutely staggering. That is why we think on this side of the aisle you have to have a short-term policy and a long-term policy, and how to lower those excess profits from the $118 billion, or the $36 billion we have seen already in the first quarter of 2008, there is just no way to justify the doubling of prices based on supply and demand. Oil company profits are excessive, and we think speculation is part of the reason.

What I'm saying in my role as chairman of the Oversight Investigations Subcommittee, and for 3 years holding hearings in this area, let's end the excessive speculation in the market that runs up the basic price of crude that results in these record profits because corporations, not only do they have a responsibility to their shareholders, they also have a responsibility to this country to be a corporate citizen.

   Mr. STUPAK. Because high energy costs kill our economy. Every aspect of our economy is being strangled while they make record profits and pay obscene pensions to their CEOs. 
   So I believe one of the ways we can in the short term bring down these prices is take out the excessive speculation. 
   If you take a look at it, the Government Accountability Office released its report on the ability of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to properly monitor the energy markets, to monitor what they are making here. What they said, the GAO said they found that the volume of trading in energy commodities has skyrocketed, exploded, especially after 2002 when we enacted the Enron loophole. 
   The GAO also found that while trading has doubled since 2002, notice that's when the profits start doubling, in 2002, the number of staff to actually monitor what is going on in the markets has declined. 
   If you take a look at this chart here, if you will, this is the evolution of speculation, trading on west Texas intermediate crude, average open interest on NYMEX long and short positions. 
   Between September 2003 and May 2008, traders holding crude oil contracts jumped from 714 to more than 3 million contracts. That is a 425 percent increase in trading oil futures.     
   Since 2003, the commodity index speculation has increased 1900 percent. It used to be a $13 billion market, now, today, it's a $260 billion market. By Lehman Brothers estimate, that 1,900 percent increase in commodity index speculation has inflated the price of crude oil by $37. Other experts say it could be even more. 
   So on June 23, as chairman of Oversight Investigations of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I held my sixth hearing on gas prices over the past 2 years, Fadel Gheit, the managing director and senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Company testified, and I quote, he said ``I firmly believe that the current record oil price in excess of $135 per barrel is inflated. I believe, based on supply and demand fundamentals, crude oil should not be above $60 a barrel. 
   We are at over $136 per barrel today. It should be no more than 60, says Mr. Gheit. In 2002, here is what is happening. Over here on the yellow side, these are the commercial hedgers. These are the airline industries, these are trucking companies, these are the Big Oil users. They want to hedge. 
   The blue area, pink area or blue area here, purple area, that's the nonhedgers. They have no interest in hedging; they are just in to play the market. Sixty-three percent in 2000 were legitimate hedgers, 22--about 37 percent--were not. Come fast track April 2008, the legitimate hedgers are down to 30 percent, the swap dealers and the noncommercials, if you will, are 70 percent of the market. 
   So what's happened? By April 2008 the physical hedgers only controlled 29 percent of the market, those who really do need the supply. What we now know is that approximately 71 percent of the market is taken over by swap dealers and speculators, a considerable majority who have no physical interest in the market. Over the past 8 years, there has been a dramatic shift of physical hedgers continuing to represent a smaller and smaller portion of the market. 
   NYMEX, we have talked about the that tonight, New York Mercantile Exchange, has granted 117 hedging exemptions since 2006 for the West Texas intermediate crude oil contracts, many of which are for swap dealers without any physical hedging position. This excessive speculation is a significant factor in the price Americans are paying for gasoline, diesel and home heating oil. Even the executives of major oil companies recognize this. 
   At a May 21, 2008, Senate judiciary hearing, Shell Oil President John Hofmeister agreed that the price of crude oil has been inflated, saying that the proper range for oil prices should be somewhere between $35 and $65 a barrel. 
   In May of 2008, the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, compared the price of crude oil over the past 30 years, crude oil for the past 30 years, to the price of gold. Gold prices are not dependent upon supply and demand and have been viewed as a highly speculative commodity. The IMF's analysis shows us that crude oil prices track increases in gold prices. The big spike right here, that's the oil embargo. 
   Look what happened as soon as you had the oil embargo in the late 1970s there, mid 1970s there, gold shot way up. Look at the track, look at the last 5 years of gold how they go hand in hand one over the other. What this really means is that oil has been transformed from an energy source into a financial asset like gold, where much of the buying and selling is driven by speculators instead of producers and consumers. Oil has morphed, has morphed from a commodity into a financial asset traded for its speculative value instead of its energy value. 
   Even the Saudi oil minister has argued that high oil prices are due to excessive speculation in the market. Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich noted on National Public Radio a few weeks ago, the problem is government's failure to curb excessive speculation. 
   Now, the Commodities Future Trading Commission has the authority to set position limits and to take other action necessary to curb excessive speculation. Unfortunately, they have not done it. There are significant loopholes that exempt trading from these protections against excessive speculation. You have the Enron loophole, you have the Foreign Boards of Trade, no action letters, issued by the Commodities Future Trading Commission. 
   You have the swaps loophole, you have the bona fide hedging exemption. While the recently passed farm bill that both Democrats and Republicans voted for and overrode President Bush's veto addressed the Enron loophole for electronic trading, only for natural gas, a significant portion of the energy continues to be exempt from any commodities future trade action to curb excessive speculation. 
   As I said earlier, for 3 years I have looked at excessive speculation in the energy markets. In my latest bill to prevent the unfair manipulation of prices, the PUMP Act, H.R. 6330, would end or take away all these exemptions, to ensure that excessive speculation is not driving these markets beyond the fundamentals of supply and demand. 
   We would crack down. The PUMP Act is the most comprehensive energy bill, and we would crack down on energy speculation through a bilateral trade, we would address that. We would take the Foreign Boards of Trade, and we would clarify the CFTC's jurisdiction over these Foreign Boards of Trade. The PUMP Act would give the CFTC the authority over the exchanges, if they are using computers here in the United States, or they are trading energy commodities that provide for delivery point in the United States. 
   The swaps loophole that we talked about over here, that would be closed, you see, 32 percent right now, right now our swap dealers would close that loophole because there is no requirement for position limits. These swaps have grown exponentially, driving up the price of crude. By limiting this exemption, swaps would be subject to position limits to prevent excessive legislation. 
   Bona fide hedging exemption, those who really need to have supply of oil, we would make sure that they are, we would limit businesses to hedge their legitimate anticipated business needs. 
   I have trouble with the Harvard University needing a legitimate hedging exemption, which they certainly enjoy right now. What does Harvard University need to hedge on oil? The PUMP Act would also clarify that legitimate anticipated business needs does not mean energy speculators. Strong aggregate position, you have the NYMEX, you have the Intercontinental Exchange and now you have the Dubai exchange coming on. If you are going to have a limit, position, limit the position, it should apply to all three of the, the aggregate of all three, not just one or two. 
   So if you see, if we would close these loopholes and set strong aggregate position limits, the Commodities Future Trading Commission would be better able to monitor trades to prevent market manipulation and help eliminate unreasonable inflation of energy prices caused by excessive speculation to help out the American people. 
   If you don't believe excessive speculation is causing a problem, look at today's business news, especially in the New York Times, they are talking about home heating oil. And at our June 23 hearing that we held, Oversight Investigation, we had the home heating oil companies there. On that day home heating oil was $3.98 a gallon. 
   Three days later, 3 days later I introduced the PUMP Act in the Senate with Senator Cantwell. Home heating oil then jumped to $4.60 a gallon. If you want to lock in, or if you want to hedge, you want to hedge your home heating costs for this winter, it's $5.60 a gallon, a 20 percent increase in about 4 or 5 days. That's excessive speculation gone wild. 
   Our PUMP Act has 60 cosponsors, bipartisan piece of legislation, endorsed by agriculture, airline, labor, industry groups, trucking industry. So I urge my colleagues in this House, and I have enjoyed this discussion here tonight, to take seriously a look at excessive speculation. 
   When they testified on June 23 in our committee, I know Mr. Barton was there and some others in this room tonight, Mr. Masters, Professor Greenberger, Fadel Gheit and others all indicated that if we would pass the PUMP Act the way it is right now, the most comprehensive legislation on excessive speculation, we could lower the cost of oil, of a barrel of oil coming into this country, by 50 percent, they said, within the next 30 days. 
   I believe it might be 30 to 50 percent, but the point being, in the short-term, as we started this discussion, we could do something right now. I would take the excess of speculation, all markets, all commodities, be liquidated, although they will need some speculation. 
   But when the physical hedgers are 2-1 being outbid by the swap dealers and the noncommercial people, the floor traders that manage money, the nonreportables, then we have a market that has been turned upside down, and we have turned supply and demand into really a financial asset and not really looking at the needs of the American people, or the U.S. economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Thank you. 
   On that point, there is some skepticism on the majority side that somehow we're going to drill our way out of this or that somehow we'll just increase supplies, because if you take a look at it right now, according to government statistics, 82 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf is available for drilling for gas. Seventy-nine percent of the Outer Continental Shelf is available for oil exploration and is leased. The last time was in 2006. We went along with it. We voted to extend in 2006, not even 2 years ago, more of the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas exploration. 
   What happened between 2006 and 2008? Profits kept going up. Costs kept going up. We didn't see a tangible result. 
   So, when you have 82 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf already available for leasing for natural gas and when you have 79 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf available for oil already available for leasing and as we had just relaxed the standards in 2006 and you do it 2 years later to get the last--what?--18 percent, 21 percent, how is that going to change the costs we're paying at the pump? How is that going to come down? We don't see the investment of these record profits into getting that oil up. 
   In fact, we're saying use it or lose it. You have record profits. You have more of the Outer Continental Shelf than ever in the Nation's history available for exploration, and you're not doing it. So use it or lose it. So that's why we look at speculation as, maybe, one way to bring it down. 
   I thank Mr. Barton for his willingness to work with us on speculation legislation. At my June 23rd hearing on excessive speculation in the market, he was actively engaged in that, and he asked a number of good questions. I agree that we might not agree on 100 percent of the PUMP Act, but I think there is enough common ground there, and I've enjoyed the discussions we've had in recent weeks on the PUMP Act. Hopefully, we can do something. I've really enjoyed the discussion here tonight. 
   I thank Mr. Altmire and others for having this discussion because I think it has been a good discussion. We've had some disagreements, yes, but I think it's all fair in what we're trying to do and in how we view things, and we are looking at the short term, what we need in the short term and in the long term, and I think there is more agreement than disagreement between the two sides.

   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman. 
   I just want to make a couple of points. Mr. Westmoreland seems to indicate that if we would just increase drilling somehow, we would increase supply and everything would be wonderful. But as chairman of Oversight and Investigations, we saw articles earlier this year which indicated that refineries were cutting back on their production. 
   So myself and Mr. Shimkus from Illinois, the ranking member, we wrote to  the Energy Information Agency and asked them: What is our gas supply? Take a look at the first 3 months of 2008, compare it to previous years. Is it a supply-and-demand problem? 
   Now, it's not a Democratic issue or Republican issue. The Energy Information Agency puts forth these facts, and here's what they said. 
   Gasoline inventory actually peaked on March 7, 2008, of 22 million barrels more than March of 2007. Gasoline imports were higher than they've been in the last 5 years when we looked back. Gasoline demand in the U.S. is actually down eight-tenths of 1 percent. So you have more than adequate supply, the most we've ever had in this Nation's history, at 22 million barrels in March 
   of 2007, more than what we're using, but yet the price has still skyrocketed. 
   Now, I think all of us, Democrats, Republicans, we're all willing to put more supply forward, trying to increase production, and in the 2005 Energy Policy Act, that Mr. Barton led that Energy Policy Act, I was a conferee on, we streamlined a way for refineries to produce more if they wanted to. 
   But you see from the Energy Information Agency, the first 3 months of this year, there's more than adequate supply. When it comes to diesel, we actually exported 335,000 barrels out of this country to Western Europe and Latin America.

   Mr. STUPAK. I think the gentleman misunderstood. The diesel is produced here in this country. We could have used it here in this country because home heating oil took off. Home heating oil took off for the east coast. We could have used it, but to keep that price, to artificially inflate the price of home heating oil, we exported 335,000 barrels: 93,000 to Western Europe and 182,000 barrels per day to Latin America. 
   So, I mean, we refined it, we produced it, we had it all right here. But what did we say? We can get a bigger buck overseas than to provide a service to the American people. That's what happened, according to the Energy Information Agency, not me, Energy Information Agency.

There's nothing I can think of we did recently, and as the former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee knows, Mr. Barton and I have done a lot of work on this issue in the last 3 years. That's why I was surprised when you're saying new diesel standards. I wasn't aware of any so it must have been something that came back a couple of years ago when you-all were in charge.

   Mr. STUPAK. I know Western Europe is very concerned about their diesel standards. In fact, they have the clean diesel, as we like to call it, here in Europe and that's why they rely more on diesel than gasoline. So when we export 92,000 barrels a day to Western Europe, obviously that diesel is meeting their standards, which are probably higher than ours. I'm making that assumption.

   Mr. STUPAK. And when you take a look at it, what we expect our refineries to do is refine enough for each day as we go along. And they did, and we had more than the previous 5 years ever. So if this supply crisis, as you seem to indicate there was, 5 years ago we should have seen it--4 years, 3 years, 2 years, 1 year. This is the most we've ever had, and they're claiming there's a supply problem?

   Mr. STUPAK. Sure. And I thank the gentleman for his comments because he's absolutely right. The refineries are getting squeezed. In fact, some of the smaller refineries are actually refining diesel and gasoline at a loss because the base price of crude has skyrocketed. And as the gentleman is well aware because he has attended the hearings we've held jointly when you were Chair, and now as I'm the Chair of O&I, it's the excessive speculation. I know that's the second half of our comments here tonight, so I look forward--but the gentleman is right. And that's why so many of the refineries and the Members who represent the oil patch parts of our Nation have supported my legislation, the PUMP Act, Prevent the Unfair Manipulation of Prices, that take out the excess speculation which is causing the base product, crude oil, to just skyrocket. 
   So I thank the gentleman for his comments. He's right. I would agree with him. And later on we'll get to talk about speculation, and I look forward to the comments.

   Mr. STUPAK. I don't disagree with Mr. Westmoreland, what he had to say there. The only thing I would say is that's why we are saying we've got 68 million acres, let's drill or not. 
   You know, I come from northern Michigan; we have no oil, we have a lot of trees. And when you get a contract to cut timber on the Federal forest, you get your current year plus 5, if not, you lose that right. Because in order to grow our trees and have a prosperous forest, you've got to prune it out and we have to cut. Same thing with oil. If we want to access U.S. oil, why are they sitting on these leases when the leases have been approved for drilling and all the environmental standards have been met? And if supply is the problem, as you claim--and I'll grant you, that's part of it--then let's do it. No more excuses, let's drill. 
   You've got 22.8 million acres in Alaska that can be drilled on right now, but instead we seem to be focused on ANWR. I'm not even talking about ANWR, I'm talking about the Alaska Petroleum Reserve area, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve area, National Petroleum Reserve area. In Alaska, 22.8 million acres we could actually drill on right now today, permits are approved, everything is ready to go. Do it. Use it or lose it.

   Mr. STUPAK. Very briefly, I would just ask, whether it's ANWR or the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, would the other side, would the minority side agree and put into the legislation that all oil or gas discovered there or produced there would come strictly to the United States? Because what we see in ANWR and Prudhoe Bay, that oil goes around Laotian islands, it goes to Japan and China because it's actually closer and they get a higher price. 
   So will you say that the oil in Alaska will come for U.S. citizens to be used for American energy?

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Chairman, my amendment will facilitate a simple land transfer between the U.S. Coast Guard and the city of Marquette, Michigan. 
   The Coast Guard is currently located at the Coast Guard Station Marquette and Lighthouse Point in Marquette County on nine acres of land east of the Marquette Maritime Museum. This facility was originally constructed in 1891, and is the oldest of all U.S. Coast Guard lifesaving facilities in the Nation. 
   The Coast Guard is in the process of relocating to a new location just south of the Marquette Maritime Museum. This location will bring the Coast Guard closer to where their boats are docked and will help the Coast Guard respond to emergencies more quickly. 
   The City of Marquette sold this property for the new facility, 1.5 acres on the waterfront, to the Coast Guard for $1. In addition, the City of Marquette has committed $170,000 to reroute bike trails, make roadway improvements and other necessary infrastructure improvements in order to prepare the property for the new Coast Guard facility. 
   On April 7, 2008, the City of Marquette signed the official documents to turn over the City property to the Coast Guard. Upon moving to this new property, the Coast Guard will vacate their existing location. 
   My amendment will convey the property of the old Coast Guard facility to the City of Marquette. This is a straightforward amendment. The Coast Guard supports the conveyance of the existing property to the City. The City of Marquette is also in support of the land transfer, which would assist in accomplishing the goals outlined in the City's strategic Harbor Master Plan. 
   The Coast Guard Station in Marquette plays a vital role in responding to emergencies in the City of Marquette, the surrounding area, and on Lake Superior. This land transfer will facilitate a continued Coast Guard presence within the Marquette area. Without a well-equipped and state-of-the-art Coast Guard Station in Marquette, there would be virtually no presence of the Coast Guard between Sault Ste. Marie and Houghton, Michigan, which represents a stretch of at least 300 miles of shoreline on Lake Superior. This is a win-win for the Coast Guard and the City of Marquette. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment, and I encourage members to vote for final passage of the Coast Guard Authorization Act. 
   Vote ``yes'' on the Stupak amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his work to craft the Coast Guard Authorization Act, and for recognizing the need for a Coast Guard presence on the Great Lakes. 
   The Coast Guard Cutter ACACIA was decommissioned on June 7, 2006, after over 60 years of service to this country. The ACACIA has been stationed in Charlevoix, Michigan since 1990. 
   The ACACIA provided essential navigational and search and rescue services in the northern Great Lakes. This work is important for the safety as well as for businesses and individuals that rely on the Great Lakes. This year's cold winter showcased the need for a cutter presence when Beaver Island once again had to make an emergency call to the Coast Guard to break ice for a shipment of fuel for the island. This, unfortunately, is a common occurrence during the cold winter months, and this winter was exceptionally long and cold. 
   It is important that this new Coast Guard cutter or similar asset be stationed in Charlevoix. To facilitate this, I worked closely with the chairman to include language in the Coast Guard Authorization Act 2006 to require the Coast Guard Station to sustain icebreaking vessel capabilities in the Great Lakes. Unfortunately, the Coast Guard has ignored congressional intent. 
   I appreciate the chairman's support in our efforts, and I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member, and the chair of the Coast Guard subcommittee, to ensure that the Coast Guard honors congressional intent and provides adequate icebreaking services in the Northern Great Lakes. 
   I yield to the chairman for comment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me as I rise in support of the H.R. 1 legislation to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   For far too long, police officers have not been able to communicate directly with firefighters, EMT, and other emergency personnel. This is called interoperability. This lack of the ability to communicate with each other resulted in the deaths of 121 firefighters on September 11 because no one could tell these firefighters to get out of the building before the World Trade Center fell upon them. 
   The 9/11 Commission concluded that the inability to communicate was a critical element in the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, crash sites. Federal funding of such interagency communication units should be given a high priority, so said the 9/11 Commission. 
   I have been down to this floor repeatedly since then trying to increase money for interoperability so we could communicate with each other. Last year, I actually introduced an amendment which asked for $5.8 billion of the $18 billion estimated for this interoperability program, and, unfortunately, my Republican colleagues defeated the amendment on a tie vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a minimum, we owe our first responders the tools they need to do the jobs they need to do so that they may protect the American people.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, legislation to implement the 9-11 Commission's recommendation. 
   For far too long, police officers have not been able to communicate directly with firefighters or EMT in their own city or just across jurisdictional lines. This lack of the ability to communicate is called interoperability. The lack of interoperability resulted in the deaths of 121 firefighters on September 11th because no one could tell these firefighters that the World Trade Center was about to cave in on them. 
   The 9-11 Commissioners concluded:   
   The inability to communicate was a critical element of the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, crash sites ..... Federal funding of such (interagency communication) units should be given high priority--9-11 Commission Report   
   In 2005, the 9-11 Commission gave Congress and the Administration an ``F'' for failing to address our nation's interoperability problem. 
   H.R. 1 would establish a grant program within the Department of Homeland Security dedicated to interoperable communications and require greater accountability at DHS. 
   In the past, I have offered an amendment to apply $5.8 billion dollars to the new grant program, but my Republican colleagues defeated my amendment on a tie vote. 
   Republicans defeated similar Democratic efforts in the Homeland Security Committee. Time and time again, the Republican-led House blocked more funding for interoperable communications. 
   Mr. Speaker, at minimum, we owe our first responders the tools they need to do their jobs to make America safe--our first responders must be able to communicate. Today, Congress is taking steps to provide those tools and ensure we never repeat the mistakes of 9-11.

   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, in its final report, the 9/11 Commission concluded, and I quote: 
   ``The inability to communicate was a critical element of the World Trade Center, Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, crash sites where multiple agencies and multiple jurisdictions responded. The occurrence of this problem at three very different sites is strong evidence that compatible and adequate communications among public safety organizations at the local, State and Federal levels remains an important problem. Federal funding of such interagency communication units should be given high priority.'' 
   The lack of interoperability among first responders has plagued our Nation for too long. Today Congress is taking an important step to give our first responders the tools they need to do their jobs and keep our Nation safe. 
   The fact is that, since September 11, the Republican administration and Congress failed to make adequate investments in interoperable communications for our police, firefighters and EMTs. After September 11, President Bush said, ``We want to spend money to make sure equipment is there, strategies are there, communications are there to make sure that you have whatever it takes to respond.'' Yet under President Bush and the Republican-led Congress, the money was not allocated, the equipment was not there, strategies were incomplete and first responders still could not communicate across agencies and jurisdictions. 
   Today, Congress will consider the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act which will create a stand-alone grant program for interoperable communications. Today, the Democratic Congress starts a new direction for public safety and to keep America safe.

   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this resolution, paying tribute to one of Michigan's greatest sons, a man who dedicated the best years of his life to public service, President Gerald R. Ford. Those who knew Gerald Ford remember him for his humility, his understanding of the virtue of public service and his dedication to his family. Michigan and America have lost a statesman who truly believed in the honor of public service. 
   President Ford will be remembered not only for his Presidency but also for his distinguished career representing Michigan in Congress and for his service as minority leader of the United States House of Representatives. He believed deeply in this institution, and he served his State, his party and his Nation skillfully as a Congressman for more than a quarter of a century. President Ford exemplified the values both of this institution and the great State of Michigan with humility, good humor, faith and persistence. 
   Gerald Ford did not seek power or fame, but he answered the call of our Nation's highest office when our Nation needed him. He was selected to be Vice President because of his high character, bipartisanship and integrity. Eight months later, these qualities were evident when President Ford helped heal a divided nation after the Watergate scandal. 
   There can be no better demonstration of a tribute to President Gerald R. Ford than the outpouring of gratitude and respect from ordinary citizens when he was laid to rest on January 3. The people of Michigan remember him not only as President or minority leader but as a constant presence in our lives and as a selfless, dedicated public servant who talked about the values that unite us in the most divisive of times. 
   President Gerald R. Ford represented us with honor and courage, and he will be deeply missed. To Betty and his children, Michael, Jack, Steven and Susan, thank you for sharing the President with us.

This Democratic Congress has been dedicated to making sure the needs of all America's veterans are fulfilled. 
   So far this year we've passed legislation providing the largest funding increase for veterans in the 77-year history of the VA. This funding will allow the VA to keep up with the growing number of veterans who need care, maintain its health care facilities, and treat veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who are suffering from PTSD and traumatic brain injuries. 
   We also voted to increase military pay by 3.5 percent, as well as special pay and bonuses to combat troops, putting an additional $7.3 billion in military paychecks. Unfortunately, the Bush administration is now reneging on these enlistment bonuses to those severely wounded combat veterans. 
   Madam Speaker, this Democratic Congress has made meeting the needs of the veterans and our military a top priority. This weekend, and every day, let us all remember the service of our Nation's veterans and commit ourselves to keeping this country's promises to them.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Consumer Protection Safety Modernization Act, of which I am a cosponsor. There is no better time to pass this legislation than right now before the holidays when parents are buying toys for their children. 
   After months of recalls of Chinese-manufactured toys, it is evident that the Consumer Protection Safety Commission lacks strong authority and needs additional resources to protect the safety of our children and loved ones. 
   This legislation will implement a graduated reduction of lead standards, reducing 100 parts per million, a level unmatched anywhere in the world. 
   The bill will also require manufacturers to include tracking labels to aid in the event of a recall on all toys intended for children 12 and younger, and mandate third-party testing of toys for lead by labs accredited by the CPSC. 
   This legislation strengthens the commission by authorizing significant increases in funding levels over the next 3 years, allowing the Product Safety Commission to hire additional employees, which has been at an all-time low since their inception. Furthermore, this legislation provides an additional $20 million to modernize CPSC's testing laboratory to ensure safe products.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment would require the Environmental Protection Agency to hire the appropriate number and amount of criminal investigators as required by law. EPA's criminal investigators play a critical role in protecting public health and the environment from the most serious offenders. That is why the Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-593) specifically requires that not less than 200 special agents be assigned to environmental criminal enforcement. This requirement helps ensure that EPA has the number of investigators and adequate resources necessary to enforce the criminal provisions of our environmental law. 
   EPA's criminal investigation division, CID, is currently at less than 200 special agents. Already understaffed, seven agents from CID are permanently assigned to the EPA's administrator's personal security and do not conduct any investigation work. Additional agents are assigned to provide security when the administrator travels outside Washington, DC, requiring them to abandon any investigation work during that period. 
   The assignment of the EPA's criminal investigators to provide personal security to the EPA administrator diverts resources from the investigation of environmental crimes. While I understand the desire to protect a member of the President's Cabinet, criminal investigators at EPA are doing so at the cost of protecting public health. Because of the additional strain that using CID criminal investigator agents for security has on EPA's ability to investigate criminal violations, it is extremely important that CID be properly staffed. 
   The underlying bill, the bill before us today, provides an increase of $11.8 million for enforcement compared to fiscal year '07. The EPA should have no difficulty in meeting the requirement of 200 criminal investigative agents, which is the standard that was set in 1990. My amendment would not reduce the security provided by the EPA administrator. It would only make certain that the EPA uses this funding provided in the bill to meet their requirements under the Pollution Prosecution Act and their responsibility to the American people. 
   I want to thank Chairman Dicks for consideration of this amendment along with Ranking Member Tiahrt. I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment.

   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. 
   I hope we will defeat this motion to recommit. I sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I've done a lot of work on oil and gas, and I was in my office when I heard all these myths coming from the other side, and I thought we had to come down and refute this. 
   My friends on this side of the aisle keep saying Congress needs to open more areas to domestic drilling. The U.S. has already increased domestic drilling, and gas prices have continued to climb. 
   Since 2000, the number of wells drilled on Federal lands has increased by 66 percent, from 3,000 to nearly 5,000 wells. During that same time, the price of gas has doubled. 
   According to the Federal Government, 79 percent of the oil in the Outer Continental Shelf is already available for leasing. Eighty-two percent of the gas in the Outer Continental Shelf is available for leasing. And still, we open up more lands to leasing in 2006. The U.S. cannot drill its way out of high energy costs. 
   The other fact that my friends always try to put forth is that environmental laws are stopping oil companies from building refineries. Completely false. In the 2005 Energy Policy Act, we actually put in there a section that, as Secretary of Energy Bodman said, eases the constraints that have strangled new refinery construction. We put that in in 2005; yet no one has ever come forward and said we want to use that provision to put forth more refineries.

   Mr. STUPAK. Gasoline inventories actually have a surplus. March 7, 2008, we had a surplus of 22 million barrels of gas more than the previous year. Gas supplies are up. Oil gas demand is actually down. And what do we have? We have a 51 percent increase in that same period of time. Gas went from $3.10 to $3.61 since April 1. 
   Look, we've had mergers. We've had refineries not being built. We have more exploratory. We have more supply. Supply is up, demand is down, the prices have gone sky-high. Why is that? Look at the profits. 
   ExxonMobil, first quarter of 2008, $10.9 billion; Royal Dutch Shell, $9.1 billion; BP, $7.6 billion, up 63 percent from last year; Chevron, $5.2 billion; Conoco Phillips, $4.1 billion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the U.S. House of Representatives has an opportunity to vote on my legislation, the Federal Gas Price Gouging Prevention Act, H.R. 6346. Every Member of the House will face a simple choice: Vote to stand up for consumers, your constituents, who are paying outrageous gas prices at the pump, or vote to allow oil companies to go on setting them unchecked. 
   As of last night, the national average for a gallon of gasoline, regular gasoline, was $4.07. With rising prices, it makes sense that we vote on this legislation before the House leaves for the 4th of July holiday and millions of Americans fill their gas tanks and hit the road. Or even as we look forward to this winter, with home heating oil at $3.98 per gallon, it will be impossible for people to heat their homes this winter. 
   The high cost of energy produces more opportunities for multiple opportunities to have price gouging and price manipulation. Unfortunately, with these high prices, fewer families will be traveling this year, and that takes an especially hard toll on districts like mine that rely on tourism. 
   As I travel my vast northern Michigan congressional district, I have heard from everyone from clergy to farmers to seniors who are outraged by prices at the pump. They are shocked to learn that there is no Federal law against gas price gouging. Just as speculators are driving up prices on the global energy markets, unscrupulous wholesalers, retailers and refiners operate without the Federal oversight to ensure prices are fair and justified. 
   Twenty-nine States and the District of Columbia have put their own price gouging laws into place, but there is no uniform standard as to price gouging. Absent Federal action, Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm is pushing State legislation that would give the Michigan Attorney General full authority to investigate price fixing and gas gouging at Michigan's gas pumps. 
   In Michigan, in fact, in my district, we have seen recent evidence of price gouging. An energy company of Kansas City, Missouri, opted to settle a class action suit brought under the Michigan's Consumer Protection Act in May over charges that they charged at least $1 above the State average over energy this year. I am pleased a deal was reached that will provide Michigan consumers with recourse, but I have a hard time believing this is an isolated case. If price gouging is occurring in my district, I have to believe it is not happening in other parts of the country and we need a uniform law to prevent it and enforce penalties on those who violate it. 
   Because there is no Federal law against price gouging, the Federal Trade Commission has never prosecuted a case of gas price gouging. Let me give you an example. 
   After Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Trade Commission at the request of Congress examined gas prices and found 23 percent of the refineries looked at, 9 percent of the wholesalers looked at and 25 percent of the retailers that were reviewed had increased prices that ``were not substantially attributed to increased costs'' and ``could not be attributed to national market trends.'' 
   In other words, they were price gouging after Hurricane Katrina. Yet, the FTC was still powerless to act because there is no law against gas price gouging. I hope my colleagues in the other body will take action and join the House in passing this bill and work toward giving Federal agencies the tools to provide effective oversight of energy companies. There is no reason for my colleagues on either side the aisle to vote against my legislation. 
   Today, every House Member has a choice: Side with big oil companies who are making obscene profits, or side with the American consumer.     
   A vote against my bill is a vote against consumers and a vote for Big Oil. I am pleased to be joined by other Members and colleagues who are here to work very hard on this issue with me. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to Mr. Markey of Massachusetts, if I may just respond a little bit to my good friend, Mr. Barton. 
   I agree with him, we need to have a short-term and long-term strategy. And as the former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, my friend Mr. Barton knows that this is my third bill we have had on price gouging. And the reason why we have it is short term, like in Midland in 2005 where gas went up 75 cents in one day, that is price gouging. Or in Escanaba, you wake up and it is 30 cents in one night. What happened in that one night? Or if you take a look at it, the  reason why we need a Federal law, because as we see in the bill it is wholesale. So when refineries increase their prices 255 percent from September 2005 to September 2006, for a State like mine to enforce a price gouging legislation we need a Federal law to help them out. 
   And the Presidential emergency the gentleman brought up; we need that because, as you know, before Hurricane Katrina gas went up over $5 a gallon before the hurricane even struck. Therefore, you need a President who can step forward and say that is excessive, that is not necessary in this region, we will keep gas prices at a reasonable price. 
   As far as the millions of acres and the drilling that should be done, and I know the Republican Party has been advocating we should drill more and drill more and drill more, but I would remind the gentleman that for the last 6 years, when the Republican Party controlled the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, you never sought to open up those areas now, because there is about 48 million acres of oil leases unused. I hope later this week we will have a chance to vote on a piece of legislation called Use It Or Lose It. It is unfair for oil companies to tie up our areas and refuse to drill in it when they have leases on it. So if you don't use that lease, let's give it up to someone who will drill, who will bring the oil to the surface, and therefore we can help to address our energy needs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey).

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me just once again reiterate today every Member of the House has a choice. He can side with the big oil companies and the record profits, or you can side with the American consumer. A vote against my bill is a vote against consumers and a vote for Big Oil. 
   I am pleased so many of my Democratic Members came and joined me. This legislation is necessary. As I said, this is the third time I have had legislation on price gouging. As I pointed out earlier, this winter we experienced price gouging for energy needs, it was a dollar more than the rest of the region in Michigan and the area was being charged. The attorney general in Michigan, because we don't have a price gouging law, had nowhere to go. 
   Here's the bill that the Michigan legislature--House bill 6249--just introduced 2 weeks ago, tried new price gouging because we see it going on and on and on; and it's going to continue as we see these record prices and further chances to manipulate the market and to charge excessive prices to support these excessive profits of the oil companies. 
   Underneath the Democratic House, and I feel I have to say this, we have done a number of things in the last 18 months: Renewable Energy and Jobs Creation Act, which extends tax incentives for renewable energy. We had the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act, which combats record gas prices. We have the energy price gouging bill we're doing today. We put forth the first new vehicle fuel efficiency standards in 32 years. We have a commitment to affordable American-grown biofuels which are keeping gas prices down. They are lower now than what they would have been if we did not pass this legislation. Action for lower gas prices by suspending oil purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Later, hopefully the next month or two, we will see the bill on speculation that Mr. Barton has mentioned. That is a piece of legislation we're looking at for excessive speculation which is driving up record profits for the price of oil. 
   But in this Democratic-led Congress, we will continue to invest in clean American renewable energy. We will boost energy technologies. We will help Americans struggling with the high energy prices. We will reward conservation. We will promote efficient vehicles, we will reduce mass transit fares and build infrastructure. We will further close the Enron loophole and speculators in dark petroleum markets which is driving up prices. We will encourage safe domestic drilling by forcing Big Oil to use it or lose it on Federal drilling permits. 
   I am perplexed that there's 68 million acres that we are not even drilling on because the oil companies have them tied up in leases. And what we are saying is if you're not going to drill to help the American people, then give up your lease. Let's give it to oil companies that at least drill. Democrats aren't against drilling. Let's at least go in these leases, which have been approved, environmentally sound, let's drill, let's bring that energy to the surface. If you're not going to use it, then we're going to pass legislation to say you lose it. 
   And last but not least, Democrats are leading the way to transition America to a more affordable energy future. But right now, as we go fill up this 4th of July weekend as we travel our parades in our districts and enjoy the summer months, can't we at least make sure that the price we're paying at the pump is based on a reasonable basis, reasonable factor, reasonable cost for taking that oil out of the ground, for shipping it, for refining it, for distributing it and putting it in your gas pump? We should not have to worry about being gouged tomorrow. We should not wake up on July 3 and find that gas went up 40 cents overnight for no reason other than someone needs a few more pennies to pay for their 4th of July. I don't want to pay for the big oil companies' 4th of July. I want the American people to enjoy this 4th of July and to know when they fill up at the pump, it's based on a fair, reasonable price. 
   Let's finally pass, after some 3 years of arguments on this floor, a Federal price gouging legislation that the other body will take up and we can present to the President. Let's have a reasonable basis for our pricing, and let's try to give the American people some relief from these high excessive energy prices we are experiencing.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (SUPPORTING NATIONAL NIGHT OUT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Stupak/Ramstad resolution, House Resolution 1324. Our resolution would commemorate the 25th annual National Night Out event, which is sponsored by the National Association of Town Watch. 
   I would like to thank my Law Enforcement Caucus Co-Chair, Congressman Jim Ramstad, for introducing this legislation with me once again this year, and all members of the Law Enforcement Caucus who co-sponsored this resolution. 
   This bipartisan resolution has had strong Congressional support for several years running and I am pleased we have another opportunity to highlight this important event again this year. 
   National Night Out, an annual nationwide grassroots crime prevention event, will take place on Tuesday, August 5th. 
   The event brings together involved citizens, law enforcement agencies, and civic groups throughout the United States to heighten crime and drug prevention awareness and to strengthen neighborhood spirit and police-community partnerships. 
   Since its inception in 1984, National Night Out has become a crime prevention fixture that is enthusiastically supported by citizens, law enforcement and local officials. 
   It is the Nation's largest, most cost-effective crime prevention campaign. By building community watch groups and police partnerships at an average cost of about $27 per community, National Night Out allows local law enforcement to extend its reach without incurring additional costs. 
   Whether it is stopping illegal drug sales, making schools safer, locating missing children, or remaining vigilant against terrorism, local law enforcement officials depend on the support of community networks to succeed. 
   The active involvement of citizens and the presence of local law enforcement in communities is a winning combination that makes and keeps neighborhoods safe. 
   Last year's National Night Out campaign involved citizens, law enforcement agencies, civic groups, businesses, neighborhood organizations and local officials from over 11,130 communities in all 50 states, U.S. territories, the District of Columbia, and on U.S. military bases worldwide. 
   In all, over 35.4 million people participated in National Night Out 2007. 
   National Night Out is an integral part of America's grassroots efforts to fight crime and create safer neighborhoods. 
   The Stupak/Ramstad resolution expresses Congress' support for community crime prevention and asks that the President focus Federal attention on the issue. 
   With this in mind, we hope that you will show your support for the community crime prevention efforts of citizens and police in your district, and across the Nation. 
   Vote for the Stupak/Ramstad National Night Out Resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (CARBON MONOXIDE IN MEAT -- (House of Representatives - July 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, carbon monoxide added to meat packaging is deceptive for consumers. Blasting meat with carbon monoxide makes spoiled meat appear to be red, wholesome, healthy when its really dangerous to eat. 
   Although it is well known that consumers rely heavily on color to evaluate the freshness of meat, the FDA has not required the use of carbon monoxide in the packaging of meat to be labeled. 
   Consumers, therefore, have no way of knowing whether the meat has been treated, and they can no longer rely on color to judge the freshness and safety of treated meat. 
   Here's meat we left out for 27 hours. The top's been treated with carbon monoxide, the bottom has not. The bottom is brown and nasty. The top looks fresh and wholesome. Eat either one of these packages of meat and you'll become very ill. 
   For this reason, I will today introduce the Carbon Monoxide Treated Foods Safe Handling, Labeling and Consumer Protection Act. This legislation is needed to help prevent consumer deception and serious risk to our public health. 
   Given the recent events that have highlighted food safety risks to public health, the Carbon Monoxide Treated Meat Safe Handling, Labeling and Consumer Protection Act takes the important step in helping inform and empower consumers to ensure their food is safe and wholesome.

   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, today the House will put the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court back in business after being shut down for the past 6 years. House Democrats know that our highest duty is to defend this Nation and protect our citizens. And we also know we can keep this Nation safe without our own government trampling the civil rights of our citizens and the principles upon which this country was founded. 
   Before 2001, the FISA Court served as a check and balance to the administration to ensure that critical individual rights were not trampled. Such checks and balances have not been in place for the last 6 years. Today, by passing the RESTORE Act, we restore the true role of the FISA Court by addressing the concerns we have with the Bush administration ignoring the FISA Court, jeopardizing our rights, violating our Constitution, and our core principles. 
   Mr. Speaker, the RESTORE Act is a bill that all Members should be able to support. It provides a proper balance of giving our government the legal tools to go after terrorists without trampling our American beliefs and values.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, in fiscal year 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Office of Management and Budget set new guidelines for maintenance dredging of commercial harbors in their budget for fiscal year 2006. The Corps excluded harbors that move less than 1 million tons of cargo each year. 
   The House is on record that the Corps' neglect of these harbors is unwise and unreasonable. With Members' help during consideration of WRDA, the Stupak-Hoekstra-Delahunt amendment to prohibit the Corps from using a tonnage-based standard was included in the House bill by voice vote. 
   Now the Corps is back with a similar tonnage-based formula. This formula essentially credits $2 for maintenance dredging for every ton of product moved. The harbor is then provided only the amount from the formula, regardless of the actual cost to dredge a harbor. This policy not only discriminates against rural America by significantly limiting dredging of harbors in smaller communities, but it is pound wise and penny foolish. 
   For example, under the Corps proposal, my harbor in Ontonogan, Michigan, will move just over 300,000 tons of material, so the Corps will provide $643,000 worth of maintenance dredging, even though its dredging cost is more than $1 million. 
   Again, there are almost 300 harbors across this country that face the same problem. Our small harbors will never be able to adequately dredge, but will silt in with each passing year. Thus, pound wise, penny foolish. 
   These Corps guidelines will have a detrimental effect on small-town, rural America, causing job losses, increased hardship for business, and endanger our Nation's entire shipping infrastructure. 
   Each harbor that has been maintained by the Corps for years has unique characteristics other than just the amount of tonnage it moves. For example, annual dredging helps prevent flooding in Ontonogan, and dredging plays an essential role in preserving the economy and lifeline of this harbor town. By only considering the amount of tonnage a harbor handles, the administration ignores the benefits provided to businesses and residents that depend on electricity, flood mitigation and other purposes beyond the tonnage handled. 
   With this new policy, the Corps also disregards the fact that approximately two-thirds of all shipping in the United States either starts or finishes at a small port. By ignoring the smaller communities, the Corps is also significantly harming the Nation's economy. 
   With the Corps' proposed maintenance dredging guidelines, in each year our small harbors' maintenance remains uncertain. Without this Stupak-Hoekstra-Delahunt amendment, the economic vitality and the dream of economic expansion for these 300 communities remain uncertain. 
   As the House considers this WRDA legislation, I am again offering this amendment with Congressmen Hoekstra and Delahunt, which keeps the maintenance dredging the same as it has been before the Corps and OMB came up with these tonnage proposals. 
   For the sake of our Nation's small harbors, from which two-thirds of all shipping in the United States either starts or finishes at small ports, I encourage my colleagues to adopt our amendment, which would ensure that all harbor maintenance is funded fairly, regardless of the amount of tonnage a harbor handles. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   It is a bipartisan piece of legislation. I would hope that the Members support it.

We need support on this amendment, and I ask for your support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in honoring the Michigan State University Men's Hockey team in winning the Frozen Four, becoming the Men's National Collegiate Hockey Champions. 
   On Saturday, April 7, 2007, a record crowd of 19,432 witnessed Michigan State defeat Boston College, 3-1, in the championship game of the 2007 NCAA Men's Frozen Four in Scottrade Center in St. Louis. 
   During the first period, neither team was able to push the puck past the opposing goalie. As the championship game progressed into the final period, most fans thought the game was headed to overtime. MSU then ``exploded'' with three goals in the final 10 minutes of the game, icing the championship for MSU. 
   This victory constituted MSU's third national championship, and the first since 1986. Each member of the MSU Hockey organization made essential contributions to the team's success. 
   Justin Abdelkader, who was named the team's Most Outstanding Player, snapped a 1-1 tie with 18.9 seconds to go, seconds after ringing a shot off the goalie post. 
   Jeff Lerg made 29 saves, and Chris Mueller added an empty-net goal with 1.2 seconds left to clinch it for the 3-1 Spartan win.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the author of H.R. 2121, and I'd like to thank Chairman Rahall and ranking member YOUNG and their staff on the Natural Resource Committee for assisting and moving this legislation forward. 
   H.R. 2121 is a straightforward bill that would allow the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society to implement a new Human Use/Natural Resource Management Plan for the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Chippewa County, Michigan. 
   While this legislation was approved by the House of Representatives in September of 2006 in the 109th Congress, but the 109th Congress ended before the Senate had time to consider the bill. By acting on this bill now, I am hopeful the House will allow the Senate ample time to consider and approve this legislation. 
   The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the history of shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. Since 1992, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society has operated the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum to educate the public about shipwrecks in the region. 
   The museum provides exhibits on several shipwrecks in the area, including an in-depth exhibit on the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, which was lost with her entire crew of 29 men near Whitefish Point, Michigan on November 10, 1975. Among the items on display is a 200-pound bronze bell recovered from the wreckage in 1995 as a memorial to her lost crew. 
   In 2002, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society, working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Michigan Audubon Society, and the local community, finalized a new management plan to improve the experience at the museum. 
   The new management plan, which was signed and agreed upon by all the parties, will allow the Historical Society to expand the museum exhibits while addressing concerns about parking and access to surrounding wildlife areas. 
   However, because the original land grant patent references the previous management plan, legislation to amend the patent is necessary before the new management plan can be implemented. In response, I've introduced this legislation, H.R. 2121, to amend the land grant patent to allow the new plan to be implemented. 
   Congressman DAVE CAMP from Michigan has joined me in cosponsoring this legislation, and I thank him for his support. 
   The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society has continuously improved the experience at the museum since it was established in 1992. With the approval of H.R. 2121, Congress will allow the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum to further develop this cultural and historical resource. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this simple legislation which will improve the opportunities available to visitors of Chippewa County, Michigan, and the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. 
   I thank all Members for their cooperation with this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7321, the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act, which would provide $15 billion in bridge loans for the Big 3 domestic automakers, to help them weather the current credit crunch and financial crisis. 
   These loans are critical for the survival of our domestic automakers, our manufacturing sector, and the American middle class. 
   One in ten American jobs are linked to the auto industry. Chrysler, Ford and General Motors support about 5 million American jobs. More than 1 million American workers and retirees are directly employed or supported by the major automakers. Two million Americans receive health care benefits through the auto industry. An estimated 3 million jobs would be lost in the first year if the American automakers collapsed--nearly three times the jobs lost nationwide this year. 
   The Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research estimates that the collapse of the domestic auto industry would mean an estimated 2.5 million jobs lost over the next year, costing Federal, State, and local governments a total of $50 billion next year and $108 billion over the next 3 years. 
   In my district, the dramatic drop in demand for new cars and trucks is already taking a toll on parts suppliers and our domestic steel industry. At Cliffs Natural Resources' Tilden and Empire mines in Marquette County, reduced demand for iron ore to produce steel for the automakers has led to the layoff of 350 workers. The closure of the Dura Automotive Systems plant in Antrim County caused 300 jobs to be lost. Lexamar in Boyne City had to layoff 90 workers, Northern Tool in Mio laid off 68 workers, H&H Tube in Cheboygan closed causing 60 jobs to be lost, and layoffs at more than a dozen other suppliers to the automakers across northern Michigan are the result of the current economic crisis. 
   What we are debating today is not new. In 1979, the Federal Government provided Chrysler a $1.5 billion loan. Chrysler paid back the full amount with interest in 4 years, and operated successfully for 2 decades because of this assistance. 
   Why are some of my colleagues so willing to spend more than $700 billion to help Wall Street, but so hesitant to assist an industry that creates so many middle-class jobs? 
   According to data analyzed by ABC News, in 2007, Wall Street's five biggest firms--Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley--paid a record $39 billion in bonuses to themselves.  
   Those 2007 bonuses were paid, even though the shareholders in those firms last year collectively lost about $74 billion in stock declines--their worst year since 2002. 
   If split equally among the approximately 186,000 employees at the former Big Five Houses, that bonus money means an average of $201,500 per employee--almost six times the $34,076 median household income in my district last year. 
   Instead of preserving $200,000 bonuses, Congress should be preserving American middle class jobs. 
   In addition, the legislation we are considering today has greater oversight and stronger taxpayer protections than the Wall Street bailout. 
   There were four main principles that should have applied to the Wall Street bailout: transparency and accountability; no windfalls or golden parachutes for executives; strong oversight by Congress; and effective taxpayer protections. The Wall Street bailout final bill did not contain these safeguards. 
   The auto loan legislation Congress is considering today provides greater transparency, stronger restrictions on executive compensation, tough oversight provisions, and more taxpayer protections. 
   This legislation requires a commitment on the part of auto executives, employees, labor unions, dealers, suppliers, creditors and shareholders to participate in the restructuring efforts that will ensure the long-term viability of an industry that helped create this Nation's middle class. 
   The jobs of millions of middle-class Americans and the pensions and benefits of millions more depend on a vibrant domestic auto industry. 
   The automakers are not asking for a handout. They are asking for a loan, which in the current credit crisis only the Federal Government can provide. 
   This legislation includes strong protections for the taxpayers and I have every confidence the loans will be paid back with interest and the result will be a stronger auto industry and a stronger American economy. 
   As the automakers implement restructuring plans and the economy improves, these loans will have laid the groundwork for the recall of laid-off workers and the creation of new jobs. 
   Doing nothing is not an option. Inaction by Congress would cost the American taxpayers more than this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important loan assistance for the automakers, to preserve middle-class jobs and improve our economy while protecting taxpayers!

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman. I thank him for his assistance and for pinch hitting for me tonight until I could get here. 
   Madam Chairman, the Stupak-Visclosky amendment would require that all steel and iron used under the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public Schools Facilities Act be produced in the United States. Cheap imported steel is a danger to our children and is compromising their safety. 
   In April, during the Congressional Steel Caucus hearing, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Assistant Commissioner David Baldwin testified that Customs and Border Protection does not conduct compliance tests to monitor the strength, durability, or hardness of the steel imported into the United States. 
   Until the Federal Government can make sure imported steel from China and other countries meet safety and quality standards, we should not let any of it be used in our schools, or in any other buildings, as a matter of fact. 
   We must make sure that the steel used in these projects meets the proper standards in the first place. The Stupak-Visclosky amendment would require educational agencies to use American steel and iron for modernization, renovation, or repair projects at a public school facility. 
   The amendment also includes a provision that will ensure that schools can comply with these standards. If steel and iron produced in the U.S. will increase the cost of a project by more than 25 percent, and iron and steel from elsewhere is proven safe, then agencies can use steel and iron from other sources as long as it is safe. 
   To protect our children, we must ensure that the steel used in our schools is from American companies that meet proper safety and quality standards. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Stupak-Visclosky amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I want to thank Chairman Thompson and the Homeland Security Committee for their work on this bill. I think it's an excellent piece of legislation and will go a long way towards making the Department of Homeland Security more accountable and effective. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to ask my colleagues to support my amendment to H.R. 1684, which would require the Secretary to conduct a study on ways to improve the effectiveness of the Integrated Border Enforcement Team, or IBET program. IBETs are already one of the border's great security success stories of the post-9/11 era. The program grew out of a history of informal cooperation between American and Canadian border protection officers. 
   In December 2001, the IBET concept was made official as part of the Smart Border Declaration signed by the United States and Canada. As a former law enforcement officer, I know that access to timely, reliable information is one of the most effective, important tools an officer can have. IBETs allow law enforcement officers from along our northern border to collaborate in real time and share information and expertise with their Canadian counterparts. 
   This strategy has paid off along our northern border. In the past year alone, IBETs helped to break up several organized criminal operations that were smuggling drugs and people into the United States, leading to dozens of arrests and confiscation of millions of dollars in drug and cash. 
   I have seen firsthand how important this program is to local border protection officers. One of the 15 current IBET sites is in my district in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. 
   The IBET consists of area law enforcement officers from the United States and Canada, including cooperation with county and local police officers, Customs and Border Protection agents, the Coast Guard and Canadian border officers and police officers. The officers involved in this IBET have been unanimous in telling me how much IBET has improved their ability to police the border and make our homeland more safe and secure. 
   I am concerned, however, that the potential of the IBET has not been fully realized at Sault Ste. Marie and other sites. The Department of Homeland Security has not assigned a full-time officer to monitor and lead the IBET, instead defining IBET as ``collateral duty'' for an officer who already has a full-time job. The previous IBET chairperson was transferred to a post in Miami, leading to a loss of valuable institutional knowledge. 
   Finally, there is no specific funding line for IBET activities; and direct funding has been minimal, in fact, only $5,000 for 15 IBETs for 2006. 
   My amendment would require the Secretary to report to Congress on the resources currently being devoted to the IBET program. In addition, the amendment asks the Secretary to make recommendations to Congress on how to make the IBET program even more effective in the future. It is clear that when the IBET program is fully funded and staffed it can be a powerful tool for law enforcement. My amendment is intended to improve accountability and oversight for the IBET program and ensure that all IBETs, not just some, receive the resources they need to be truly effective. 
   Once again, I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their outstanding work on this bill and for their willingness to support this amendment. I urge support of the Stupak amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, the key words to this whole amendment are ``in the near term.'' Unfortunately, it's been 25 years since the Air Florida accident. We've been talking about interoperability, and nothing ever gets done. 
   The time for studies and promises are over. If you listen to the program that DHS has, according to them, it will take us 20 years and $100 billion to achieve interoperability. That is not the case at all. We don't need 20 years. We don't have 20 years to wait in this country to have interoperability. 
   Last Congress, we passed the National Telecommunications Information Agency, which is advancing technologies that are available today to solve the interoperability problem, technologies that don't cost $100 billion and 20 years. 
   And what has happened, though, the $1 billion we put in the NTIA grant program, the administration used it to make further cuts in the Department of Homeland Security. So $1 billion that should have gone to interoperability has cut off other DHS programs. 
   This administration has ignored congressional intent on interoperability. It's time for the excuses to stop. The administration has to put forth a reasonable plan to achieve interoperability in this country, and that's what the Cardoza amendment does, and I fully support it.  
   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that I am able to revise and extend my remarks. 
   I rise today in support of the Cardoza Amendment, which expresses the Sense of the Congress that efforts to achieve interoperable emergency communications in the near term should be supported and are critical in assisting communities properly execute their interoperability plans. 
   The key words in this amendment are ``in the near term.'' It's been 25 years since the Air Florida crash on the Potomac. It's been over 5 years since September 11th, when over 120 firefighters and hundreds of civilians lost their lives due to a lack of interoperability. 
   Terrorist attacks, man made disasters, and natural disasters are a certainty. Yet, we still do not have nationwide interoperability in this country. 
   This problem has been studied and studied. 
   In its final report, the 9/11 Commission concluded:  
   The inability to communicate was a critical element of the World Trade Center, Pentagon, Somerset County, Pennsylvania, crash sites ..... The occurrence of this problem at three very different sites is strong evidence that compatible and adequate communications among public safety organizations at the local, state and federal levels remains an important problem ..... Federal funding of such (interagency communication) units should be given high priority .....  
   After September 11th, President Bush said, ``we want to spend money to make sure equipment is there, strategies are there, communications are there to make sure that you have whatever it takes to respond.'' 
   Yet, under the President and the Republican-led Congress, the money was not allocated, the equipment was not there, strategies were incomplete, and first responders still cannot communicate across agencies and jurisdictions. 
   DHS has testified it will take an $18 billion to $100 billion investment to make our first responder communications fully interoperable. 
   DHS's plan to achieve full interoperability is 20 years. We do not have another 20 years. 
   The time for study and excuses is over. This bill and this amendment represent action by the Democratic Congress. 
   This bill reverses the draconian cuts to first responder grant programs made by this administration. And this amendment tells DHS to advance solutions that help first responders in the near term. 
   The Energy and Commerce Committee created, and Congress enacted, a $1 billion interoperability grant program at the National Telecommunications Information Agency (NTIA), in 2006. 
   Our intent was to advance new approaches to solve the interoperability problem; approaches that don't cost $100 billion and take 20 years to implement. 
   Yet, the administration seems to be missing the point. The administration's budget proposal justified the DHS grant cuts by ``offsetting'' those cuts with the $1 billion NTIA grant program. 
   Our committee has heard testimony from experts, industry, and first responders that there are new technologies today that can help our first responders at a fraction of the cost. 
   Again, this amendment tells DHS that Congress has lost its patience with excuses. It says invest in near term solutions that are available today. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, today Democrats are keeping another promise to the American people as we bring H.R. 4, the Bipartisan Prescription Drug Negotiation authority to the floor. 
   While Members may not agree on how best to address the health care needs of America, one thing is certain: the United States has the highest drug prices in the world, and those prices keep going up. Today's legislation is a first good step to help lower the costs of prescription drugs for Americans. We can, and Democrats will, do more to lower the cost of prescription drugs in this country. 
   In America, everyone pays something different for their prescription drugs. If you have private insurance, your health plan negotiates lower drug prices for you. If you are covered by Medicaid, each State Medicaid program determines its own drug acquisition costs, and your State may negotiate additional rebates or discounts from drug manufacturers to further lower the price. If you are a veteran receiving health care at the VA, the Federal Government negotiates drug prices for you. 
   According to a recent Families USA study, the lowest price charged by the largest part D Medicare insurers for prescription drugs is at least 58 percent higher than the price under the system used by the Veterans' Administration. 
   It makes no sense for one Federal program to use its purchasing power to leverage lower prices, while another Federal program, Medicare, is forbidden by law, Republican law, from acting on behalf of its beneficiaries. The result is windfall profits to the drug companies. 
   The current Medicare prescription drug law prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from conducting low cost-reducing negotiations. Today the House will repeal that provision. 
   I urge the Members to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4, as it is a good step, the first step in lowering the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Chairman, the loan forgiveness programs under the Ford Direct Loan Program and Federal Family Education Loans encourage teaching professionals to take positions in low-income schools. 
   Like teachers, qualified school administrators and principals are crucial to creating an effective learning environment. Unlike teachers, however, school administrators and principals at low-income schools are not given access to the same loan forgiveness programs. In fact, under current law, if a teacher is eligible for loan forgiveness but is promoted to an administrator or principal in that same school, the newly promoted teacher loses access to the loan forgiveness programs for which they were previously eligible. As a result, low-income school districts often have difficulty recruiting talented principals and administrators to their districts. 
   My amendment would extend eligibility of the Ford Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family Education Loans to full-time school superintendents, principals, or other administrators after completing 5 consecutive school years in a school district in which at least 30 percent of the schools are defined as low income. 
   This amendment is supported by the National Education Association, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and by the American Association of School Administrators. Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office has indicated that this amendment will not violate the pay-as-you-go rules. 
   I urge Members to support my amendment to help recruit and retain talented and qualified school administrators and principals. 
   Also, Madam Chairman, I include for the Record a letter from the National Association of Secondary School Principals in support of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation which would reauthorize the Beach Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act, or the BEACH Act. 
   My district has over 1,600 miles of beach frontage on the Great Lakes, and the BEACH Act has been instrumental in providing funding to protect beachgoers from bacteria and other dangerous pathogens. 
   Michigan residents rely on BEACH Act funding to protect them. In my district, residents on Sugar Island near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, depended on this important funding to monitor water that had been contaminated with E. coli, coliform, and other bacteria. Without the support of BEACH Act grants, the Chippewa County Health Department would not have been able to determine that the pollution was originating from a wastewater treatment plant in Canada. 
   This legislation would improve the BEACH Act program to ensure a fairer distribution of funds. In July of 2007, the Government Accountability Office released a report at the request of myself and several other Great Lakes colleagues. This report found that the EPA was using a funding formula that prioritizes States with warmer climates, ignoring other important factors such as beach miles and beach use. This formula put Great Lakes States like Michigan at a distinct disadvantage, making it more difficult for these States to protect their beachgoers. 
   This legislation addresses this problem by instructing EPA to revise its funding formula to take factors such as beach miles and beach use into consideration. 
   While monitoring water quality and tracing the sources of pollution to its origin are important steps to keeping our beaches clean, knowledge is only half of the battle. The July 2007 GAO report also found that while the BEACH Act has helped protect beachgoers from polluted waters, States still do not have the resources they need to clean up the pollution and prevent future problems. 
   The latest survey by EPA has estimated that an additional $181 billion is needed nationwide for infrastructure projects eligible for funding under the State revolving fund. I look forward to working with Chairman Oberstar and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee later this year to address our water and wastewater infrastructure needs and provide resources for the State revolving fund. 
   I appreciate the work of Mr. Pallone and Mr. Oberstar on this important legislation, and look forward to working with them as we continue to address important Great Lakes issues.

<DOCNO>Mr. STUPAK. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON H.R. 3121, FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I was not going to speak here this morning, but I have heard the rhetoric on the floor and it is really sort of disheartening to be a Member of this body and see all the pointing of fingers going on on energy. I sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee and in my role as the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, we have held six hearings in the last 2 years about what is happening with gas prices, oil supply, and what is happening in our markets, especially with speculators. We continue to work on legislation to do a number of things. 
   But I think the honest thing we have to tell the American people, any Member of this House, Democrat or Republican, if they had it within their power to lower a price of a gallon of gas, they, we, would do it. We would have done it. We realize the pain that is being felt by the American people. 
   When I was home doing my Fourth of July parades, people demanded we do something. I finally said to one of them, ``Don't you think if Congress had the magic wand and could lower gas prices tomorrow, we would have done it?'' There are some things that are out of the hands of the U.S. Congress at this point in time. 
   So what is our strategy to move forward? What can we do immediately? Supply and demand. It is more than just supply and demand. The price has doubled within a year, and there have been no shortages in the supply. 
   If you take a look, when we were doing these Fourth of July parades, oil was $145 a barrel. Today, Thursday, July 10, USA Today, Moneyline, it is $136.05. Why did it drop $10 in less than 7 days? That's the volatility we see in the market right now. It is a very volatile market. Some of us want to bring stability to the market and lower these prices. Why the $10 drop when nothing has really happened? There is no more supply that came on the market. We do have more speculators. We do have this Democratic Congress holding hearings, like in the Ag Committee, regarding excess speculation in the market. Some of us have been working on that angle since 2006. 
   We have had legislation, the PUMP Act, to stabilize prices and to lower prices. So if you take a look at the PUMP Act regarding how we get these prices down from $136, it is to close the Enron loophole. The Enron loophole says the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will not deal with energy or energy derivatives. We had turned a blind eye to what happened in the market. 
   We should close the swaps loopholes. Eighty-five percent of the trades now on energy are going through a swap loophole. 
   We should enforce the aggregate position. You're only supposed to hold 20,000 contracts for oil on NYMEX. So I hold 20,000 on NYMEX. I hold 20 on Dubai, I hold 20 on the London exchange, the ICE Exchange, as they call it. There are 60,000 contracts. Every contract represents a thousand barrels of oil. 
   The foreign boards of trade. You set up a foreign board of trade and you give it a name like the London Exchange or ICE Exchange, and guess what, we outsource the enforcement of the trading that is going on in this country for West Texas intermediate crude oil. That's what has happened. We've outsourced our responsibility, and we rely on London and Dubai to enforce laws to make sure that the markets are performing accurately and not these wild swings we see each and every day. 
   So I don't care if you're Democrat or Republican, if we had a way to lower gas prices, we would do it. 
   I believe one thing we can do to immediately bring some relief, without drilling all over the world, is close these loopholes, the Enron loophole, the swaps loophole, enforce aggregate positions, close the foreign boards of trades. We can do that. We are having a hearing today, and it will be going again tomorrow, and hopefully next week we can bring forth this legislation. So let's take the speculators out of the market so we bring a stable price and less volatility in the market. 
   And then let's look at opening more areas for drilling. Democrats are for that. We are for that when we take a look at the long term. And why don't we streamline. In fact, we did. In 2005, the Energy Policy Act, passed under the Republican majority, I was a conferee to that bill, we streamlined so we could bring more refineries online, but no one has done that. We streamlined the process so it is easier. 
   So all of this finger pointing going on here is not doing the American people or any of us a lot of good. 
   We have to look at alternative fuels. The first commercial bio-diesel fuel in Michigan is in my district. I am proud of that. Is it enough? No, but it is a start. 
   So we need a short-term strategy and a long-term strategy. I think the PUMP Act prevents an unfair manipulation of prices, gives a short-term strategy, stabilizes the prices, and gets the volatility and excess speculation out of the market. And then let's look at long-term solutions. 
   So instead of coming down here and saying one side is going to do this and one side can't do that, that is hogwash. None of us have within our power to lower gas prices today or tomorrow. Let's be honest with the American people. What we can do is get the speculators out of the market, do a reasonable approach, and let's take a look at some long-term solutions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Smith-Stupak amendment, which is the only amendment before the House that would restore the Mexico City Policy. This policy is a vital, pro-life provision intended to protect the integrity of U.S. family planning programs around the world by establishing a clear wall of separation between abortion and family planning. By directing support to organizations that agree not to promote or perform abortion as a method of family planning, we ensure that U.S.-supported programs are not in the abortion business. 
   Let me be clear: Our amendment does not, does not, reduce international family planning funding for services or contraceptives by a single penny. Instead, the policy that we are promoting improves the credibility of international family planning programs by ensuring that they are entirely separated from abortion activities. 
   Despite misleading statements to the contrary, the previous Lowey amendment is not about contraceptives or HIV. We have provisions in the legislation where that language can be put, and it would be perfectly acceptable to all of us. Instead, the Lowey amendments are a direct assault on the Mexico City Policy. 
   The Smith-Stupak amendment restores the Mexico City Policy and in no way reduces funding for contraceptives. U.S. family planning funded in this bill at $441 million should be directed to organizations that do not promote or perform abortions. 
   The effort to prevent unplanned pregnancy by providing contraceptives continues robustly under the Mexico City Policy. As you can see from the chart here before me, U.S.-funded family planning increased dramatically in countries where USAID has found the need to be the greatest. 
   Mrs. Lowey claims Ethiopia and some of these others have actually decreased money. It is simply not true. If you look, in Ethiopia funding has nearly quadrupled, increasing from $4.9 million to $19.5 million under the Mexico City Policy. In Uganda, funding has almost doubled, from $5.2 million to $9.8 million. 
   International family planning is funded at $441 million in this bill, and it will still be funded at $441 million in this bill under the Smith-Stupak amendment. 
   I would give the previous speaker, Mrs. LOWEY, credit for being ingenious. It is an ingenious amendment which really undermines the Mexico City language. 
   I urge all Members to support our pro-life and pro-family amendment. Support the Smith-Stupak amendment.
