<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (MAJORITY MAKERS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Congresswoman Sutton. 
   It's a pleasure to serve with you and the other 54 Members of our class. They call us freshmen. Some people call us freshmen. Some people call us majority makers. But clearly we're new Members, and I think that as new Members we probably have heard through some very active campaigns a very clear message from our communities and, that is, what's going on in Iraq, this is back in November, but continues to today, as your point is, is not working. And it's not working on a number of levels. 
   The way I sort of focus on this is the notion that all this should be about the national security of the American people. This is about what makes us safe in our homes, our communities, our States, our country. And yes, we obviously have interests around the world in other places as well. But first and foremost, what's important to us is at home, that we know our families and that we are protected. 
   The problem as I see it, and I think it has now been confirmed, and I'm on the Foreign Affairs Committee, so I've had the opportunity, as many of the Members of Congress have had, to get the briefings of a number of people, including members of the State Department and others, and we've all had the chance to go over and speak to the Joint Chiefs of Staff over at the Pentagon to get a firsthand question-and-answer about what the assumptions were in the surge and what the assumptions were in adding or subtracting military personnel and how our commitments were affecting the rest of our military and the rest of the commitments that we as Americans have internally. National Guard. I come from Florida. We have hurricane season, and are we at risk in terms of being able to respond, or anywhere in the world where our military is needed. 
   I think it's very clear, and I think most Americans understand this, that al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, the people that perpetrated 9/11, it wasn't Iraq, it was Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was not in Iraq at the time of September 11. 
   The bottom line is Osama bin Laden is still operating. Al Qaeda is still operating. And it's not operating in Baghdad. Sure there are cells in places in Iraq, and it's up to our military, and our military understands its responsibilities to root them out. Those are specific engagements and we should find those cells and root them out. 
   But al Qaeda is not limited to Iraq. They're operating in different parts of the world. Afghanistan is at a tipping point, as we understand it. Nobody, no Democrat or Republican, seems to be contesting that issue. Americans understand that the Taliban and al Qaeda are re-emerging in Afghanistan. Yet, our assets, our men, our women, our military hardware and equipment are saddled and stuck in Iraq. That's not to say that there's not a terrible situation in Iraq. It is a terrible situation. 
   But as Americans, we have to put ourselves first and say, what's in the best interest for America? Both here at home, and dealing with Afghanistan, dealing if there's a problem in Pakistan, dealing with Iran, dealing with North Korea. These are the potential hot spots around the world, where there are potential nuclear issues and things like that. 
   My biggest concern all along, and I know I shar 
   this with certainly all Members of our Democratic side, and I know many Republicans. This is not a Democrat-Republican issue. This is an American issue. It's what is the right thing to do. I think it's very clear, based on everything we've seen so far, is that this is not going to get resolved now, 6 months from now, a year from now, 5, 10 years from now, with just a military solution. 
   Senator LINDSAY GRAHAM, a Republican from the Carolinas, was before our Foreign Affairs Committee today, and he said he was there. He also specifically said, listen, our generals are generals. He comes from a military background. He did work in the legal corps of our military. He said, but, you know, generals are not always necessarily right. Ask them the tough questions. I know when General Petraeus came before our committee and many of us listened very carefully as to what he had to say, many of us were not quite fully satisfied that the answers were consistent. On the one hand he said, yeah, we're going to draw down. On the other hand he's saying, we need power, we need troops, we need, you know, the power to make sure that everything is there. It didn't all sound consistent to me. 
   But the bottom line is I think we need to be strategic and smart. And redeployment is not a question of getting everybody out immediately. Nobody is suggesting that among our group here today. What we are saying is be smart. Secure the borders. Do some things to make sure this doesn't spill out. Really double and triple our efforts to retrain the military, and there are other ideas not limited to anybody in this room. There are lots of generals out there, retired and active, that are coming up with good suggestions. 
   But repackaging the stay-the-course approach, which is what is going on right now, is not the answer. We need to have a better answer to protect our men and women in the field, and protect America most significantly, at home and abroad.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, when President Bush announced that he was keeping the troop escalation plan in effect until next summer, it was clear that he had no plan for ending the war in Iraq. In fact, the administration admits that they see our troops remaining in Iraq for at least 10 more years. 
   President Bush continues with the status quo in Iraq even though the Iraqi Government is not fulfilling its promise to meet the political benchmarks that were outlined by President Bush himself earlier this year. 
   House Democrats are not going to tolerate another decade of our troops serving as referees in a civil war. And while this Congress cannot force the President to change course in Iraq until some of our Republican colleagues break ranks with the administration, I think that they even see the value in forcing this administration to finally come up with an exit strategy that is strategic in purpose. 
   Today the House will vote on legislation that would require the President and his administration to develop and submit a comprehensive redeployment strategy within the next 60 days. This war cannot go on indefinitely, and this administration needs to begin preparing for the day that we can finally bring our troops home.

Lloyd Beach State Park was honored on the national news program Good Morning America as one of the four most unique and scenic parks in the entire country. 
   We're lucky in south Florida to have miles of beautiful coastline, but the John U. Lloyd Beach State Park truly stands out. In addition to sandy beaches, the State park features a coral reef ecosystem just 100 yards offshore and a mangrove swamp with a variety of plant species. Wildlife sightings are common for visitors to the park, and few will forget watching sea turtle hatchlings crawl down the beach. 
   I would like to commend the hardworking park rangers who care for our State park, as well as Bob and Barbara Magill, who submitted footage of the beach for national recognition. 
   Mr. Speaker, the John U. Lloyd Beach State Park is truly a national pleasure, and we are committed to preserving this site for future generations to enjoy. We welcome all Americans to come down and visit.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (SENSE OF HOUSE OF ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL TEACHER DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res 952, legislation calling for the establishment of a National Teacher Day. Few professionals touch as many lives as teachers do. They provide us with the knowledge and skills that we need to succeed in life, and their compassion, sacrifice, and dedication to their profession deserves national recognition. 
   As the son of an elementary school teacher, I was proud to introduce this resolution calling for the establishment of a national day of recognition for our Nation's teachers. My mother and so many other teachers across the country spend their lives working to inspire children and open their minds to new ideas so that they can grow up to be successful in whatever path they choose. 
   I am sure that each and every one of our colleagues can identify a teacher from their past who left a significant mark on their lives. I know that I would not be here where I am today without the motivation and encouragement of teachers from my past who challenged me to aspire to greater things and pursue my dreams of public service. 
   For me, the teacher who provided the greatest impact of my life is Dr. Leatrice Rabinsky, a teacher at Cleveland Heights High School in Ohio. She was one of the pioneers of Holocaust education. Her teaching and experience left an indelible mark on me and led me to introduce legislation, as a State Senator in Florida, requiring the teaching of the Holocaust in all of Florida's public schools. Florida was one of the first States to pass and implement this policy which is now considered a model for Holocaust education across this country, and I attribute that effort to Dr. Leatrice Rabinsky. 
   I believe it is important to recognize the hard work of our Nation's teachers who prepare our students to build a stronger America. The education of our children is critical to the success of our country, and despite limited compensation, in many cases, and increasingly high expectations, our teachers rise to the challenge each and every day. 
   In Florida, the average teacher earns about $43,000 per year, and nationally, teacher salary growth continues to lag behind inflation. This day of recognition is critical for bringing national attention to the pressing need to invest more in our teachers and our public schools. By providing teachers with the support, professional development, and compensation they deserve, we will retain more teachers in the profession and see significant gains in our public schools. No longer can we ask our teachers to increase their workload and raise academic achievement without providing them with the resources they need to do so. 
   Teachers are a critical component to our increasing global competitiveness, and once again establishing our country as a world leader in the global economy, teachers will play a central role. 
   I'm proud to have voted for the passage of legislation that invests in our Nation's math and science teachers this year providing roughly 25,000 teachers with assistance in pursuing graduate degrees, summer training, and other types of professional development. I am confident that this is just the beginning of new Federal support investing in science, technology, engineering, and math education and providing incentives to teachers who wish to engage in these specialty areas. 
   Our teachers are charged with a very difficult task as the pressure continues to grow across the country to increase student achievement. However, they have taken on the challenge with incredible perseverance and determination, and their dedication to our students and their profession deserves thanks and recognition. 
   I'm hopeful with the passage of this resolution, every American will take time from their day to acknowledge the teachers in their lives, both past and present, for their commitment to this important profession. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank my distinguished colleague, Congressman Roskam, for joining me in introducing this legislation, and I thank the overwhelming number of Members who have joined me in support of the establishment of a National Teacher Day. 
   I urge passage of this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (CLEAN BOATING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2766, the Clean Boating Act of 2008, and to applaud my good friend and the bill's lead sponsor, Senator Nelson, who has been a tireless advocate on this issue for Florida's recreational boaters. 
   I also want to thank the distinguished chairman of the full committee and my good friend from Minnesota, Mr. Oberstar, for fulfilling a promise he made on the House floor when we considered the Coast Guard bill back in April. He promised then to take up this issue on behalf of recreational boaters before the September 30th deadline, and once again, the distinguished Chairman has proven that he is one of the truly great leaders of the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, in a mere 70 days, the nation's 73 million recreational boaters will face a huge and unreasonable regulatory burden as a result of a recent U.S. District Court decision. The underlying decision dealt primarily with halting the spread of invasive species through commercial ballast water--an effort I support, having seen firsthand the ravages of invasive species on Florida's environmental treasure: the Everglades. The U.S. District Court, however, did not limit its decision only to ballast water. Instead, it struck down a longstanding exemption for recreational boaters from obtaining a permit for incidental discharges. 
   As a result, 73 million boaters will be forced to obtain permits from the EPA or face fines as high as $32,500. To be frank, this is a ridiculous scenario. We don't need a new DMV for our recreational boaters, especially since the EPA feels ill-equipped to handle this new regulatory responsibility. 
   We must also not forget that this new permitting system will hurt an industry that is already suffering as a result of our country's economic downturn. In particular, the marine industry is a major economic force in my home state of Florida, responsible for over $18 billion of revenues and 220,000 jobs statewide. It's critical to note that $13 billion of the economic impact and 162,000 of those jobs as well as almost half of the industry's gross sales come from the tri-county region, much of which is in my Congressional district. 
   But this great industry is not without its own perils. People don't need boats, and they generally buy them when they are comfortable with the necessities of life. The industry is also affected by high interest rates, record insurance costs and rising property taxes, particularly for those on the waterfront. We must not add to their troubles this new regulatory burden that could prevent potential boaters from buying or using a boat. That's why I cosponsored the House version of the Clean Boating Act and have supported its swift passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Senate already has acted earlier this morning by passing S. 2766 and the next bill up for debate, S. 3298. I strongly support that bill as well because it provides a two-year moratorium for certain small commercial vessels and all fishing vessels from the regulatory permits. I urge my colleagues to follow suit and adopt both bills so we can stop this logistical and regulatory nightmare.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would first like to commend the distinguished chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (Mr. Oberstar) for his support of House Resolution 505 and for his leadership on the committee. These days we face mounting challenges to improve our infrastructure and protect our highways and waterways from expanding populations and from terrorist attacks. Personally, I can think of no other person better qualified to lead this important committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 505 to highlight the important contribution of the recreational boating community and the boating industry to our quality of life and to our continued economic prosperity and to urge the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the American people to observe National Boating Day. 
   Boating is a famous symbol for south Florida, where I am from. Millions of residents and tourists take to the waters of south Florida by boat to fish, dive, snorkel, and view scenic tours along our pristine coastline and unique intracoastal waterway. Palm Beach County alone has over 40,000 registered boaters, and Ft. Lauderdale's majestic canals have earned it the nickname the ``Venice of America.'' 
   But the significance of the boating community is not only symbolic. The recreational marine industry is a major economic force in Florida, responsible for over $18 billion of revenues and 220,000 jobs statewide. And I should note that $13 billion of the economic impact and 162,000 of those jobs as well as almost half of the industry's gross sales come from the tri-county region of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties. 
   As many of our colleagues know, the contributions of the recreational boating community extend far beyond the Sunshine State. The boating population exceeds 73 million individuals in our country and an estimated 18 million recreational watercraft. In addition, the recreational boating industry provides more than $39 billion in sales and services to the U.S. economy and provides nearly 380,000 manufacturing jobs. Altogether there are approximately 1,400 active boat builders in the United States with contributions from all 50 States. 
   One need only look at the geographic diversity among members of our Congressional Boating Caucus, of which I am a proud member, to measure the broad influence and contributions of the boating community and the boating industry to our country and the quality of our life. Members come from 38 States, including Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Kansas, and West Virginia. Clearly, boating is not just a coastal pastime; it is an American pastime. 
   In addition, boating also brings us closer to our national treasures. I strongly believe that an appreciation for environmental stewardship comes through interacting with nature. For example, it is hard to comprehend the beauty of coral reefs until you see them underwater with your own eyes.  Once you do, you begin to understand their importance and the need to protect them for the continued health of our oceans. 
   Boating gives us these cherished opportunities to commune with nature. It should be no surprise that boaters can be impassioned stewards of the environment, teaching future generations of boaters a healthy respect and appreciation for our natural resources. 
   It is for these and other reasons that I introduced House Resolution 505, recognizing the contributions of the recreational boating community and the boating industry to the continuing prosperity and affluence of the United States. This resolution calls upon President Bush to issue a proclamation to observe National Boating Day with an appropriate time being July 1. 
   I was happy to have so many of our colleagues from the Boating Caucus join me in supporting this resolution, including the distinguished co-chairs of the caucus, the Honorable Gene Taylor from Mississippi and the Honorable Candice Miller from Michigan. I am sure that they can attest that boating is an integral part of our economy and our quality of life not just for those along the coast but for the entire country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for adopting this resolution today and recognizing the contributions of recreational boating and the boating industry.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I would like to speak about the budget this morning and the concern that I have that the budget President Bush has proposed makes it very clear that his priorities are out of touch with everyday Americans. President Bush would rather maintain his tax cuts for the wealthiest in our communities, while leaving seniors, veterans and working families behind. 
   He also believes that his budget will rid our Nation of debt in 5 years, even though he wants to keep spending billions of dollars in Iraq and maintain these tax cuts for the most wealthy. 
   Further, President Bush continuously fails to be up front with the American people about the true cost of the war. Even in the supplemental that he proposed, he fails to acknowledge the additional cost of the troops and support personnel that will be required by the troop surge. Folks, the numbers simply don't add up. 
   I am disappointed that the budget fails to include ample funding for the Everglades restoration and beach renourishment, which are an important asset and resource in our country. The Everglades and our beaches in Florida are not only important to Floridians, but also national treasures enjoyed by millions of Americans each year. 
   It is time for our government to step up to the plate and fulfill its commitment to the Everglades, our beaches, and all our other natural assets; I am going to fight to make this happen. 
   President Bush's priorities are out of step, and as we continue to debate his budget, I am confident Congress will restore funding to many of the programs our American families deserve and depend on.

   Today, I am honoring the city of Dania Beach, a community in southeast Florida, for investing in a $1 million solar energy system to power the city's streetlights. Not only is this an innovative and environmentally sound decision made by the city of Dania Beach, but it is also a decision that will strengthen the safety of the community. 
   After Hurricane Wilma struck, Dania Beach could not restore its power and the pole damage quickly enough, leaving the city streets without lighting for a lengthy period of time. With the new solar panels, the streetlights will not be dependent on electricity, and the panels will be mounted to withstand even the most fierce hurricane winds. 
   I applaud this sort of ground-breaking, innovative way of thinking. Alternative energy sources are the way of the future. If more communities around the country would follow Dania Beach's lead, we would leave our environment in a much better condition for our children and our grandchildren.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. 
   Stem cell research has the capability to cure our most common and pervasive diseases and conditions. From Alzheimer's to Parkinson's disease, cancer to juvenile diabetes, the potential of stem cell research presents one of humanity's greatest leaps toward the ultimate goal of preserving, prolonging and improving life. 
   As a member of the Florida State Senate for 10 years, leading efforts to utilize and fund embryonic stem cell research was not just a priority of mine, it was a mission. 
   A large part of my passion and drive toward funding stem cell research is driven by people like Adam Susser, a young boy from the town I reside in, Boca Raton. Adam was asphyxiated at birth and, as a result, is cortically blind with quadriplegic cerebral palsy. 
   It is driven by Matthew Romer, a young boy in south Florida who died from a fatal genetic disease, despite both parents being told they did not carry the gene. 
   Both Adam and Matthew suffer from illnesses that stem cell research could find cures for. 
   Today, I encourage my friends in Congress to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The passage of this Act is vitally important to the millions of Americans who suffer today from incurable disease and to the millions of Americans who will suffer from incurable diseases in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, in my district, which stretches along the coast line from West Palm Beach to Fort Lauderdale, we have a number of veterans who have served in wars for this country, ranging from World War II to Iraq and Afghanistan. These veterans have been served well in most cases by clinics in our district, such as the VA Hospital and other outpatient facilities in Fort Lauderdale. But like many places around the country, these facilities have their share of problems as well, largely due to a lack of adequate Federal funding. These facilities are not always able to see and treat the veterans as quickly as they would like to, and of course we all know what is going on at Walter Reed, mold seeping from the walls and ceilings, rats and roaches running freely. These conditions are fit for no one. 
   This is no way to treat our men and women in uniform who have sacrificed their families, their jobs, their lives, everything to serve our country. We must change the way we are treating our veterans when they return home, and that starts with providing critical funding for health care services and infrastructure needs. To ask them to sacrifice so much for us, only to find when they come home they are treated inadequately on so many fronts is nothing less than immoral.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to Mr. Peterson's amendment, which would end the longstanding moratorium of new drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   For the past 25 years, bipartisan legislation and executive memoranda have kept this area off limits, preserving one of the most sensitive ecological areas off limits to oil and natural gas drilling. The Peterson amendment would open new areas to natural gas drilling. 
   Although at first glance natural gas drilling may seem favorable to some, but I urge my colleagues not to be tempted by this fool's gold. There is no guarantee that natural gas drilling will only get natural gas. In fact, according to the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, when drilling for natural gas, ``There are a lot of times when you drill for oil and find gas instead, and the other way around. You  never for sure what you're going to find until you're in there.'' 
   And certainly I think we all understand very clearly what would happen if oil was found instead of natural gas. 
   Mr. Chairman, as a representative with over 75 miles of coastline along South Florida's east coast, new drilling could be a death knell for our environment, for our economy, and our way of life. 
   During my time in the Florida legislature, I worked with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to keep the moratorium in place. I pledged zero tolerance then, and I still pledge that same zero tolerance against any attempts to open up drilling off Florida's coast. And, of course, it is not only Florida's coast we are talking about. I said I would not compromise and I would not capitulate; so I am here today with my Florida colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   But, most importantly, now that I am here in Congress along with many others, this is a false choice. It is a false choice of saying either we have oil or gas to cool hotels or to provide energy or we do something different. I don't know about many of the other Members of this body, but I think there are a lot of people that have a lot of passion about this issue not only to stop drilling off the coasts but a passion to expand into alternative energy sources. 
   As a matter of fact, this Congress has already taken steps to say instead of huge billion dollar subsidies for oil companies, let's focus those resources on our scientists, our universities, our business entrepreneurs, whether it is wave power or ethanol, wind power, solar power, coal liquefaction, nuclear power. There are a whole lot of ideas. I don't know if any of them are good and any of them necessarily are not the right answer. But it could be any combination of sources of alternative energy that will get us through this. 
   So let's not put this as a question of it is either we drill off the coast or we don't have adequate energy for this country. We have the ingenuity. We have the innovation. We are very smart people. And there is nothing that Americans can't do if they put their nose to it. 
   So I would suggest today that this amendment is not a good amendment and, rather, we should focus our attention, our passion, our science, our energy, and our resources toward alternative energy sources to take this country into the next generation.

   And as you and I have talked about this this year, I have learned a lot from you. I know that I personally have had 20 years of my own personal beliefs that Americans can accomplish anything. You've talked to me about the Manhattan Project. We all know about Sputnik. 
   And these were callings of a generation ago to say when America wants to do something, we want to focus our scientists, our education, our entrepreneurs, all the elements that come together so that Americans can accomplish anything, we did it. And this is the moment in time in the national security side in making sure that we never have to make another foreign policy decision based on where the next drop of oil is coming from; the new economy side, and that's the job creation that you are talking about and many people are talking about, the entrepreneurs at home in our communities that are developing the GM Volt and the other car companies and all the entrepreneurs that are developing the alternative means of furnishing energy that are different from fossil fuels; and certainly the environmental side. 
   And being from Florida and your being from the other corner of our country, we have a great sensitivity to our environment. And I represent a coast of 75 miles at sea level; so we are particularly sensitive that we do everything we can to make sure that our environment is protected, that we don't do things to affect the global temperature, which may, in fact, change the level of the ocean and, of course, do a lot of other damage. 
   These are very exciting times. And, again, as a member of the freshman class and with Democrats and Republicans in our class, we have all come to that same conclusion that you have come to along with many others and the leadership of this Congress to say this is not a choice of drilling more off the coast of Florida or in Alaska. Those are false choices. When you hear the discussion that we have to drill or we can't become energy independent, that's ridiculous. What we really need to be doing is focusing, as this bill does, on alternative renewable energy sources. 
   And one of the things that I am very excited about also is the correcting of something that Congress did a year or so ago, and I know you were against this at the time, but it was passed by the leaders at that time in the Congress and the President signed it. The President correctly said a couple of years ago in his State of the Union we are addicted to oil. 
   So what did Congress do over your objections and others? They basically gave some $15 billion or some number like that to the oil companies to subsidize them for more oil drilling. Now, we all believe in a capitalist system. We believe in for-profit and companies prospering. And the oil companies right now are making more money than any company in the history of the United States. So I find it particularly offensive as a taxpayer like everybody in the country to have to add frosting on the cake and give Federal tax subsidies to those oil companies over and above that. That's not right. 
   And what this bill does, and I know you are going to talk about this, is it redirects that type of incentive, those tax incentives, to change consumer behavior, to incentivize our entrepreneurs and our scientists to come up with the kinds of products that will move us toward energy independence, because it is all about this next generation. And when I speak to kids in school, I know we charge them up and say this is your calling. This is something that we as adults and our children have to really work together to make sure that we do this together. 
   So I'm very happy to be here in support of what you are doing tonight. And I look forward, when you are done with that, talking about a specific kind of energy alternative that is very exciting that I have been watching in my community. But I appreciate your bringing this up tonight.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I would like to thank the gentleman for the recognition about solar. Being from Florida, we call ourselves the Sunshine State. It seems like one of the most appropriate places to be one of the founding areas of solar, and yet many other States, including the State of Washington, which has a fairly active solar program, have been developing this further. But I am very excited about this project that you have mentioned in Florida or anywhere in the United States. Of course, we all know about wind power. We have large utilities in the country. We have one in our area, Florida Power and Light, FPL, that is one of the largest wind generators in the country, in Texas and other places, California. There is no one solution here. 
   The good news is there is a competitive economy out there. There are competitive scientists that are coming up with different ideas. I am going to mention another very interesting one. 
   Part of what this bill does, as you correctly mentioned, is it provides grants and seed money and challenge grants to new industries and entrepreneurs that are developing new ideas. The Gulf Stream, we have all heard about the Gulf Stream, it is a current that runs along the eastern United States from the southern part all the way up to the eastern coast of the United States and Nova Scotia. It's a fast-moving current. Billions of gallons per minute pass off the coast of Florida, for example. We have a Centers of Excellence at Florida Atlantic University that has been developing, and there is a program out in Oregon that is doing something similar, where with turbines in the Gulf Stream itself, they can generate enough electricity, they believe, over time, to power one-third of the power needs of the whole State of Florida. 
   Now, we have 18 million people that live in the State of Florida. Think about that opportunity. And there are other places along the eastern seaboard of the United States that if this technology can be captured and the electricity can be generated, again, as you point out, no greenhouse gas emissions. This is totally 100 percent clean, renewable. They are working through all the environmental issues right now. They believe there will not be any as they continue to develop this.     
   It is still at midstage testing, but the opportunity is there. 
   And again, what's exciting now is we're capturing this excitement. The American people understand this is a necessity that we have to do these kinds of things. This is one particular program I'm interested in because I've already seen the potential that it may accomplish. 
   But along with solar, along with some of the other things that we're going to talk about, there are great opportunities for the United States to become energy independent in a relatively short period of time, no different than Brazil, no different than other countries around the world that have found their own natural resources that can be used, Iceland and other places, that can be used to generate the power needs for growth, for success, for a clean environment. And again, it's just very exciting. 
   I'm glad to be here to support this bill and encourage not only the Senate, but the President, too, when this bill gets to him, because I'm confident that Congress is going to pass a bill that's going to include most of these items that we're talking about today. When it does pass, we are going to really get the American people behind this. So, Mr. President, I hope that as we get this to you, that you join us in really taking this mission that we have to the American people and our next generation.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. If I can just add something to the gentleman's thoughts about that. 
   Part of what we're doing here is creating market. That is the exciting part. Obviously entrepreneurs are going to invest and make the capital investments if they know that they can sell the product. As you said with the windmills, the turbines, a market has been created. It has now justified itself to the point where the price is actually going up because the demand is there, which is great. That's great news. And some of these technologies that are being developed are at different stages. But the whole notion of creating an obligation to have 15 percent of the electricity we generate, instead of from fossil fuels, coming from these renewable energy sources will, again, move in a way which are your public utilities will come together and find ways to enhance and encourage companies to come forward and provide these products. 
   We are behind the curve in Europe. Europe is way ahead of us on this. Most European countries already generate a much larger percentage of their energy from renewable energy sources. And they have recognized and they've taken it upon themselves to do this, by law, voluntarily, or otherwise. 
   The whole notion of the environmental impacts of global warming and things like that, these are not limited to anybody's border. They're not limited to the United States' borders. They're not limited to any State. They're not limited to China. It's a worldwide issue. But Europe, in fact, has shown some good leadership here. And I think that the United States, and I know that Americans, as I said before, are very innovative people who respect their environment, that we can all work together. And this notion in this bill of making the 15 percent obligation is good because it not only makes the statement, but it creates the market which will in turn create the jobs and the new economy that will sustain and build these types of products, which is very exciting.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. And to further your point, the supply is indefinite. It's infinite. It's perpetual. It's forever. Oil is not. And it's not a question of whether there is going to be enough oil on the ground for the next generation; it's the question of the people that are supplying the oil are not reliable sources, they're not necessarily friends of the United States. We're at their whim. We've seen the statistic, when President Bush was sworn into office in 2000, oil was at $28 a barrel. It is now $90 to $100 a barrel, depending on what day is going on here. OPEC, we have no control over that. This is a cartel of people that are not acting in our best interests at best, and at worst, in some cases, some of these organizations, these countries are financing people who are out to harm the United States. So, we are totally off in the wrong direction in terms of oil, and that has obviously been a mainstay. 
   Now, oil will continue to be part of our source, and that's fine. But in terms of our future, as you correctly said, where do we want to put our efforts, our resources, our energy? It should be in these renewable resources because they are coming to the point where there is going to be a crossover, and the sooner we have total control over our energy destiny, the better off we're going to be from a national security point, from an economic growth point, and everything else.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I am going to add another form of ethanol out there that I think people around the world are familiar with in Brazil, which is a very large country, it is a fully industrialized country. They decided a generation ago to move towards energy independence for the same reasons we are having these discussions here today in this country. And they have oil. They have lots of other things, but they use sugar-based ethanol, a different type of ethanol based on a sugar product, and it is cellulosic based. 
   I have heard and some of the research that has been done, well, it is not as efficient, and there are food-chain issues and everything else. As far as I am concerned, and I know that many Members of Congress and most Americans believe, where there's a will there is a way. If there are any technological limitations to anything we have talked about tonight, they can be overcome. I think this entire conversation needs to be about how can we move forward in all these areas. If there is a limitation, let's figure out how to overcome that. 
   Again, sugar-based ethanol in Brazil, their ethanol that is a big part of their production. The cost is slightly different from here, but, again, let's figure it out. It could be a question of production; it could be a question of greater efficiency of production of sugar cane, where in Florida we have a very large production of sugar cane, and obviously most of it is used for production of food. In other parts of the country, sugar beet and other things are used to produce sugar. 
   But the point of all this, and I think the part that is so interesting, is that various types of alternative or renewable energy sources are already in production as you have in Washington in different stages. And we are allowing every one of these to compete. That is the greatest thing about our economy. It is a system where the great ideas, the great science will move forward and whatever is most efficient over time, it could be any combination of ways that we are going to achieve energy independence in this next generation, we will do it. So when I hear people, the naysayers, the people who say, oh, we can't do this, there is this problem, there is that problem, we can do it. We are going to do it. We will do it. It is going to require everybody to partner together, consumers to drive this, industry to drive it, education and scientists to drive it, government partnering with the private sector to drive it. It is going to happen. 
   Again, I am so proud to be part of a Congress that recognizes this and is moving this notion forward, and I'm proud the American people are finally coming together and saying, hey, this is something that is all about who we are, how we define ourselves, we being the great leaders in the world; and science and other things are going to use our scientists and our technology to achieve these great goals. It is exciting to see a plant like that with all the silos and all the great things going on there. They are already the largest in the world. That is pretty exciting.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I am going to give you a plug because not only did Al Gore obviously earn the Nobel Prize for what he did, but Mr. Inslee you have also taken upon yourself not only to work in this Congress, but you also have independently written about this subject and you have brought forward a publication called ``Apollo's Fire.'' I don't know if you talked about it in the very beginning. I am going to give you a little plug because I have had a chance to take a look at it. It is an inspirational book that talks about what we have talked about tonight and where the country is going. 
   I will read one quote which I thought was very self-descriptive, and this is a quote out of your book. It says: ``A new Apollo Project for energy is really a mission to rebuild our economy. Smart energy policy is, in fact, good economic policy. The two are inextricably intertwined. Done right, solving our crisis of climate change and oil dependence can create tremendous opportunity for America and the world, not only by avoiding the severe economic harm of climate disruption, but also by driving new investment into local and metropolitan economies, increasing social justice and reducing economic disparity by creating new career ladders and skilled domestic jobs across the economic spectrum.'' 
   And I think in that quote you have captured a lot of what America is interested in: the environmental issues, the impact on our whole society and the job opportunities that go on. It doesn't touch the national security issues because I think people clearly already know it is a bad deal for us to depend on other countries. But the internal things that operate inside the United States, our economy, our daily lives, our jobs, the fact you are spending $60 for a tank of gas on something that is creating problems in the economy, in the environment, and instead we can go in a totally different direction. The book you have entitled ``Apollo's Fire'' I think lays it out very nicely. And I just wanted to mention that because I commend you and I recommend the Members of this body to take a look at that because I think it lays it out very clearly in a very simple fashion so that Americans can take that charge and move forward with it.

I certainly am going to recommend to our colleagues here in the Congress, the House and the Senate, while we go home and have a chance to have some working days at home during the holidays, to speak to our business entrepreneurs in our local communities, speak to our universities, speak to the scientists, speak to consumers. 
   I think, number one, that people are excited about these ideas; but as you are suggesting, this is just the first step. Whatever law we pass ultimately you can pass all the laws you want and it is up to Americans to say, this is our priority. This is something we are going to embrace. And this is something we are going to follow through. The private sector ultimately is going to drive this. We encourage our businesses. We encourage our academics to work together and come up with new ideas, express those ideas to the extent that government can partner, if there are things we can do to eliminate regulation or change policy to make things easier to move it in a direction where businesses and homeowners can do things to create more environmentally friendly pieces of property improvements, things like that and industry. It is good for all of us. 
   So I look forward to working with you and the rest of the Members of Congress and moving our country forward on this very important topic.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the President's 2008 budget proposal does not properly address the concern of American families. President Bush once again proposes substantial cuts to programs so important to our districts like Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. He then uses those funds not to offset our country's massive debt, but instead to fund expensive tax cuts that do not grow our economy and give it to people who need it the least. Unfortunately, budgets like this are what we have come to expect from an administration with the worst financial fiscal record in our Nation's history. 
   During the 6 years of the Bush administration, the government has posted the highest deficits in history,  squandering billions of dollars in budget surpluses and making massive cuts to vital programs. The President's misguided priorities have forced him to borrow money from foreign nations like China and Japan, more than all of 42 Presidents combined. This is not a record to be proud of. 
   Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot handle more of the same, and unfortunately that is what this budget proposes. I stand ready to work with Democrats and Republicans to take our Nation in a new direction of fiscal responsibility. We plan to do that.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise for the purpose of engaging in a brief colloquy with the subcommittee chairman and the ranking member regarding the Corps' regulatory program. 
   As you are aware, shore protection is a concern not only to residents along the coast but to all residents, all Americans who come to our beaches to relax, fish, boat, and dive. But our coasts are facing a real crisis. They have become seriously eroded, endangering both the personal property and personal safety of countless residents. 
   This is not a crisis limited to my constituents in south Florida. In my conversations with other Members representing coastal communities, I know that shore protection is a major issue facing our great country. 
   Mr. Chairman, among its many duties, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is entrusted to regulate the permitting of projects affecting U.S. waters. Comprised of many honorable and hardworking civil servants and military officers, the Army Corps has a long history of dedicated service towards the preservation of our natural resources. 
   I reluctantly rise today to voice my grave concern that the regulatory process under the Army Corps is simply taking too long. Critical erosion control projects that local communities wish to undertake to protect their people from the very real dangers posed by hurricanes or other deadly storms are languishing under the inertia of bureaucracy. 
   Mr. Chairman, the residents of Singer Island in Palm Beach County where I reside cannot wait 2 years for the Army Corps to complete their environmental impact statement. That means two more hurricane seasons and two more chances to have their lives literally washed away. 
   Singer Island isn't alone. Up and down the coast, local communities are in the same dire situation waiting for the Army Corps to act upon the regulatory authority. I know that you have heard the identical concerns during the many lengthy hearings that the committee has held. I understand that the chairman is willing to work with me to bring transparency and efficiency to the Army Corps regulatory process when you go to conference. 
   I want to thank you for your leadership on this issue, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to our working together. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana.

From the U.N. General Assembly, Mr. Ahmadinejad flew to Bolivia and then to his friend, Hugo Chavez, in Venezuela. 
   Ahmadinejad, with his hate-filled rhetoric and his funding of global terror, is too close for comfort. I rise to urge our friends in Latin America to refuse the Iranian president's advances and see him for what he is: a bully who disregards international will and who ignores our efforts against terrorism. 
   The 1994 bombing of the Argentine Jewish Community Center shows that the Iranian presence in Latin America has been dangerous in the past. This week, Argentina called on the U.N. General Assembly to urge Iran to more fully cooperate with the investigation so that justice can finally be served for this heinous act of terrorism. 
   Coming from south Florida where I live, when something happens in Latin America, we feel it. My district has many economic and familial ties to Latin America. Our friends in Latin America have been our partners in fighting terrorism, and we look forward to continuing our mutually beneficial partnership with these countries to make our areas safe and more secure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman for the time and thank you for the opportunity to speak to this very important issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, the rising cost of gasoline is causing huge problems for families throughout south Florida, which I represent, and certainly throughout the whole country. In south Florida a gallon of gasoline is well over $3.25 and rising. In fact, there is gas even at $3.59 per gallon in my local area. 
   What is the excuse this time? Is it disruptions of oil in the Middle East? Not that I am aware of. I haven't heard. Hurricane damage to refineries? No, again. How about the summer driving season? Seems to me this is May. So, again, no excuses, no excuses, but we just hear more and more excuses from oil companies that it's the drivers, it's this or that. 
   Yes, there are a lot of answers here, but let's focus on where the market manipulation is going on. 
   In my area, tourism drives the economy. When gas prices go up, the first thing families do is they stay within their budget and cut back on their vacations, vacations that many times are planned to Florida. When gas prices go up, families and businesses feel it, and it negatively impacts every part of our economy. 
   That's why I am here today to show my strong support for the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. This bill, authored by my friend Mr. Stupak and others, would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to crack down on the people who price gouge. This bill is an excellent step in the short term because it protects consumers and gives the government the teeth it needs to go after market manipulators. 
   In the long term, we are only going to solve this problem by moving towards energy independence. American families can no longer afford to rely exclusively on oil for their energy needs. We all know that investing in alternative fuel sources is vital to our national security and to our economy. 
   Being energy-independent is a goal that many of us have been talking about and working on for many years. That goal has never been more important than it is right now. But today is the time we need to make changes that will reduce gas prices for American consumers now, and in the future let's work towards energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure and an honor to be here tonight with the Members of the freshman class. All of us were elected this past November with great ideas brought to us by the people that we represent; lots of good suggestions on how to solve some of the problems that our country, of course some of them are overseas and some of them are home, but the great news is all of them are solvable. Every problem that we have in this country is something that there is a solution to. And it typically requires good faith, working together, Democrats and Republicans, Independents, people of good minds and good faith, to solve the problems. 
   Tonight we are going to start out our conversation as the freshman class with something that all of us came to this Congress to talk about and to work on and to solve. And it has unfortunately risen up as another significant problem that I think that we are very unhappy about right now, and that, of course, as everyone who has filled up their tank lately knows, is gas prices. 
   I am from Florida, the 22nd District, which is parts of Broward and Palm Beach Counties in southeast Florida. It is fascinating to me because I have watched gas go up and down and up and down over the years, and Congress has never seemed to have the backbone, if you will, the President and this administration hasn't shown much interest in dealing with gas prices. Maybe it's because of the backbone of some of the people of the administration, or maybe not; but the bottom line is that we have a situation now where gas prices in my area are at about an average of $3.25 a gallon, and as much as $3.59 a gallon. 
   We understand what this means. This is a real problem for consumers, it is a real problem for our businesses. Whether you have transportation, whether your personal transportation to and from work or the shipping of goods to and from a location, this is something that is beginning to affect our economy. 
   And I think I am going to throw it over to my colleagues here, but I just want to throw out a few rhetorical questions, because every time we go through this and the price spikes, we hear excuses. You know, last time the excuse was we had a hurricane called Katrina, and it shut down refineries. No hurricane this time. Last time we heard there is a disruption in the oil deliveries out of the Middle East. No disruption. Last time we heard, well, there is a summer spike because of demand during the summertime. It's May, no summertime. What is the excuse? What is the bottom line? 
   What I am so pleased about is the fact that our freshman class, along with a more senior Member, Mr. Stupak, took on this issue this year and passed today, out of this Congress, in a bipartisan way, I am very proud to say that all the Democrats and I think 70 or 80 Republicans, I think, joined us and passed something called the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. The purpose of this act is to allow the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, to go in with some teeth and enforcement authority, to go in and investigate what's wrong. If the price of oil per barrel is the same or even less than it was last year at this time, how could gas prices be so much higher? And all the commonsense things that we know. 
   What I am going to do is I am going to introduce each one of you, and I am going to ask you all, I know you all have your own perspectives and some thoughts on this. I am going to start out with Congressman Perlmutter from Colorado. Please give us your thoughts.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, I think it is fairly clear. Unfortunately, what has happened in this industry is there is a consolidation. Do you remember there was a term a number of years ago called the seven sisters? That was a term many years ago talking about large oil companies. Well, there has been big consolidation with multinational oil companies that obviously have lots of different people that are tending to their interests. And at this point in time, if you look in any community, I can look at my own community in Palm Beach and Broward Counties, there are fewer competitive stations, company stations versus independents, fewer independents, you don't see a lot of independents at all, which really drives the market a little bit. Then, at the end of the day, there really is very little activity that would show there is true competition. 
   But I think the real question, of course, and what this law is going to get to, is there is market manipulation, are there antitrust violations. We are going to define it, we are going to strengthen it, and there are consequences. 
   By the way, don't let anybody tell you, some of the Republican debate on the floor, some of the Republicans that opposed it said, oh, we are going to knock down the independent service stations, the little mom and pop groceries that have a pump in front of them. 
   We are not talking about them. The minimum size of activity that can become subject to this is a company that sells $500 million of fuel.     
   So we are not talking about the mom and pops. We are the one who are protective and interested in our communities in the mom and pops. 
   I think there are lots of questions out there that need to be answered. Again, I think the consequences of violating our Federal law is what is going to change this.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. When we went into Iraq in the first place, they were supposed to be able to pay for their entire rebuilding through their own oil revenues. Unfortunately, that has not happened.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Another big issue that many of us ran on was ethics reform and lobbying reform and the whole notion of this connection between lobbyists and legislators and Members of Congress. 
   I know in Florida before I left Florida, and I was in the Florida Legislature for a number of years, we passed a law that said you can't take a cup of  coffee. It used to be fancy meals, fancy trips and wine. You know something? The average person and most of us who ran said that was not necessary. It creates an impression that there is this unholy connection between a lobbyist and a Member of Congress.     
   Of course, we also know that many people who give us information are lobbyists, too, but they come in the unpaid variety. One of my teachers talked to me about No Child Left Behind. That's a lobbyist as well. We're talking about the paid ones. 
   I'm very proud that this Congress, this House, in the earliest going, one of the first packages we passed out of this chamber was to change the rules that this House governs itself by, and the freshmen of this class, of course, once again took the lead because we felt we were the closest ones, having heard the most from the public that we said no more cups of coffee, no more fancy meals, none of that. 
   You know something? It works just fine. I think all of us can buy our own cup of coffee. We had a little cup of coffee before. Mr. Welch and I, we had our dinner together and were glad to pay for it ourselves.

It's wrong in any community whether it's done person-to-person, and certainly when you run for higher office in Congress, you have a higher responsibility to make sure that you do the people's business and you're an independent thinker.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. If you think about accountability and confidence, if you have confidence in the people that are representing you, you will certainly have a lot more confidence in the policies and the things that they do in Washington. 
   And what happens in Washington, whether it's dealing with Iraq or whether it's dealing with the cost of health care, which is another huge issue which hopefully we're going to start tackling soon, or whether it's dealing with any number of issues that we are talking about right now, I feel so much better now just watching the process than looking last year and seeing the Medicare bill that was drafted by pharmaceutical companies that had a big donut hole and really took advantage of people's good intentions of needing health care at an elderly age. And certainly in Florida, in all of our communities, we have a lot of senior citizens. 
   So the Medicare and the pharmaceutical issues unfortunately were not handled the right way, you know, the energy issues. These are solvable problems. We started talking about that in our opening tonight, solvable issues. 
   Little bit of backbone, little bit of roll up your sleeves, and turn off the air conditioning, and put a coffee down and nobody's getting up and out until you finish the job, that's the kind of can-do attitude that I 
   think we have and we're going to continue to have over the next year.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I was just thinking as you're talking about the economic dream and the responsibility, and one of the things that I heard on the campaign trail over and over and over again, and I just felt that in my own heart as a small businessman, we had 75 employees in our business, was the fact that this government, for so many years, was just operating in this deficit higher and higher, spend and spend and spend. 
   And it's one thing we talk about lower taxes, which obviously we want lower taxes, but you have to have lower spending. It has to balance, and it still just goes beyond my imagination as to why Members of Congress over the last number of years could spend and spend and borrow 10s of billions of dollars.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. PAYGO, pay-as-you-go. You can't keep borrowing, you can't keep spending, adding new programs unless there's money in the budget. You can't pretend there's some trickle-down future great thing. If it happens, wonderful, but you know something, we all want lower taxes. We all want a reasonable amount of spending, but you've got to be fiscally responsible. 
   I'm just proud that we're getting things back on track. So maybe like in the 1990s, when we moved into a budget surplus, which we should have been proud of and sustained that over time, we want to go back to the old ways of the 1990s and certainly not the way of the last seven or eight years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, this summer the Democrat-led House completed work on all 12 appropriations bills that fund the Federal Government for the upcoming year. Each bill restores fiscal responsibility, ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, and was passed with bipartisan support. Our bills will not add money to the Federal deficit because we kept our promise to adhere to pay-as-you-go rules. 
   Yesterday, financial watchdogs, including the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget praised the new Congress for our strict adherence to the PAYGO rules. 
   Contrast that praise with the Bush administration's record of turning record surpluses into record deficits. President Bush has borrowed more money from foreign nations than all 42 of his predecessors combined. 
   Yet the President threatens to veto our appropriations bills because he says they are excessive. Does he really oppose important investments in veterans health care, pay raises for active duty soldiers, funding for more cops on our streets, and funding for life-saving medical research? 
   Americans need to send a message to President Bush to get his priorities right.

We know that our friends and neighbors are celebrating the holiday with their families, but we are going to talk about a little trick or treat, if you will, tonight. In addition, we are going to talk about some things that tie into a little bit of a Halloween theme and what is important in America right now. Back on the streets and back in the homes of the families that are very, very concerned about our country and the opportunities that their children have, taking care of their parents and grandparents, these are things that we recognize as all Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, that we have a responsibility to work with our businesses and our community leaders and our families to make sure that we make life a little bit better.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota. I think you  have provided great leadership for all of us in our freshman class. We are freshmen now for 9 months. 
   As you said, what the President categorizes as wasting time and the notion that nothing is getting done, well, there are some things that are getting done. Most importantly, there are some things that are on the brink. We will talk about a couple of those things. 
   Before I turn it over to the gentleman who is going to talk about the balance of power and how we are going to get to where we want to go here, because that is the American value of our democracy, I am going to list a few of the items that we have passed in this Congress with Democrats and Republicans, Democrat leadership but Republicans coming together, many of them, and the President signed them. A couple of things that are very, very important, I know many of these subjects were talked about in our campaigns. 
   Many people said 9/11. The 9/11 Commission Report, a thorough report that unfortunately most of it was not adopted. It has been adopted by this Congress in full and paid for. 
   I come from an area in Florida where we have ports, two major seaports in my district, and many airports. Many of you from all over the country have the same thing. It's now fully funded. We are making sure that the cargo is screened and all of the cargo, whether seafaring or air, is moving along. 
   PAYGO. We all believe in strong fiscal management. You only pay as you go. No more guessing we are going to have all this money in the future. No more taking the war and not even counting it against the national deficit. We now have a standard that was passed unanimously in this Congress. You can only spend what you have, just like you balance your books at home. 
   We made ethics and lobbying a reform priority. We now have gift bans. I don't need a cup of coffee from a lobbyist. I can buy my own cup of coffee. It is a standard everybody should have, and now it is in place. 
   We passed America COMPETES which is an innovative agenda supported by Chambers of Commerce all over the country, putting our priorities first in math and science and making sure the high-tech jobs will stay here. 
   We have lower interest rates for education. We all know the importance of a college education is crucial. Every one of these bills I have ticked off so far, I have listed so far, were passed by this Congress and signed by the President. We are very, very proud of that. Again, we have to talk about it. 
   There is a water resources bill for those with water projects. In my area, it is the Everglades. Many have polluted rivers and lakes and water issues. That bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Congress. It is on the President's desk. He has said he may veto it. If he does, that may be the first bill that gets overridden because I think there are enough votes. 
   And we will come back to SCHIP. It is a bipartisan supported bill written by Democrats and Republicans, and it is a wonderful bill. But before we get to SCHIP, I want to turn it over to Mr. Yarmuth of Kentucky to talk about what our democracy is all about and how this balance of power needs to come through.

   And I know the gentleman from New Hampshire has also taken a real lead in explaining and talking about the application of this and how the abuses have just been out there. So, if the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes), would share some of your thoughts with us.

I think you bring up something that although back home when people are thinking about these issues, they don't necessarily think about the battle between the President and Congress or the battle between the agency head and Congress. 
   But I think the bottom line is what you just said. It's about the rule of law. I mean, every American accepts the fact we're a Nation of laws, we live by the rule of law, and there's nobody that gets excepted from that, whether it's someone who's cleaning an office or whether it's someone who's an accountant or whether it's the President of the United States. We're equal, and it doesn't have to mean somebody's been elected or not. We're all under the same law. I think that's the bottom line of this whole consideration. 
   I now would like to bring into this conversation a colleague of ours from the freshman class, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).

There have been so many members of our class that came in with the criticism of our campaigns that we had heard from so many people back home, who is the check and balance? Who is minding the store? What happened to that $8 billion of cash that disappeared on the streets of Iraq? What's with Blackwater? What's with all these kinds of things? Who is checking what's going on here? 
   You know, it's one thing to say you are going to run things like a business, it's another to do it. Businesses have known checks and balances, shareholders, managers, things like that. Unfortunately, it wasn't happening with this government. It's now changing. 
   I am very proud of you and the others. I am very proud to have another gentleman with us, the gentleman from Vermont, who has been at the forefront of the committee itself, working with Mr. Waxman. I know you have been very vocal on these issues, so I am going to turn it over to the gentleman, Mr. Welch, from Vermont.

   He has been unwilling to come out of his corner. A lot of alternatives have been offered on the war, a lot of alternatives have been offered on SCHIP which we are going to talk about in a minute, a lot of alternatives. 
   As we have talked about already, there have been a lot of accomplishments, student loans, minimum wage, people competing in business. We have had a lot of good things so far which the President has signed, which is good. But there is more to do. We need to get him sort of out of the view that it's him versus the Congress, or his ideology versus the rest of the country. People want consensus. They want solutions. 
   I would like to turn to Mr. Solution himself here, because Mr. Ellison from Minnesota has really totally been bringing a lot of consensus on a whole lot of issues, from our foreign policy issues to our domestic issues. I want to bring you into this conversation and please add some value to it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Ellison. 
   Just to follow up on the point, a number of our colleagues have been talking about the idea of oversight and accountability. Well, the simple answer is not just for the exercise of bringing people in by subpoena or asking them to come in and talk, it's to learn from your mistakes. 
   It's a very simple principle. What do we teach our children? Learn from your mistakes. What do you do in business? You want to learn from your mistakes. That, of course, is what the whole purpose of this is. If we see something has gone wrong, accountability, some bad business practices that the government is involved with or paid for something they shouldn't have paid for, let's not let it happen again. That's the simple bottom line. 
   I would like to shift, because many of our Members are interested--thank you, Mr. Hodes, otherwise known as Vanna White--Mr. Hodes is holding up a little poster here which talks about the children's SCHIP plan. The SCHIP plan, as I think everyone is now familiar with, or many people are in our country, or certainly Members of Congress are, it's about making sure that children, low-income children can participate in a health care plan that's private health insurance. 
   It makes the parents pay on a sliding scale what they can afford. It leverages tax dollars. It does everything it's supposed to do. Our business community back home in my area loves it. It's very popular because instead of kids going to the emergency room, they are going where they should go, and that is to get doctor and preventative health care. 
   We have had a bipartisan plan that has now been passed twice out of this chamber, and the President vetoed it one time, and I guess he is going to veto it again, but bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans coming together, not everybody, but all the Democrats, I think, just about all, and many Republicans. 
   In the Senate, I think the Republicans are the ones who helped draft this. It really brings it together. A quick little fun thing on Halloween here, it talks about the trick-or-treat and the Republican plan, we are just sort of joking around a little bit, but we are calling it the trick, and the bipartisan plan the treat. 
   The Republican plan, which we are calling the trick, covers 8.3 million children. The treat, the plan that most of us are pushing, Democrats and Republicans, covers 10 million. This is an additional number of children that we believe are part of this plan that we want to get covered. 
   The targeting of low-income kids, in the Republican plan it targets fewer lowest-income children. In the Democratic plan, the one we just passed, it enrolls the lowest-income kids first, a goal that we all want to make sure that we are covering.     
   And of course there is a cigarette tax in both plans, the exact same cigarette tax to pay for it. The question though is, if the same amount of money is being raised, why are we covering 10  million in the Democratic bipartisan plan and we're only covering 8.3 million in the Republican plan? Where's the money going? So we obviously want to have the lowest taxes possible, but we want to cover the most number of children. And I know that that's something that I know the president of our class has been very interested in. 
   I know that Mr. Perlmutter from Colorado has joined us in our freshman class, has taken a lead in, and I know your experiences in Colorado. Maybe you can share some of your thoughts on the SCHIP plan with our group here in the Chamber today.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, last weekend, I participated in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Walk to Cure Diabetes in my hometown of Boca Raton, Florida. I participated in this walk to help bring attention to the urgent need for finding a cure for juvenile diabetes. 
   I also walked in honor of two children in my district, Sydney Lubetkin and Nicky Pollack. Nicky was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes as an infant, and Sydney was diagnosed with the illness just this past year. 
   Juvenile diabetes is a serious disease that inflicts tens of thousands of children across the United States. Not only does this illness cost us $100 billion in health care costs alone, but living with juvenile diabetes requires 24-7 care. Children must constantly take insulin shots and have their blood checked numerous times a day, and their diet and exercise regimen must always be under strict surveillance. In severe cases, juvenile diabetes can cause blindness, heart failure, stroke and, worst case, death. 
   This is why I signed on as a sponsor of House Resolution 4 that urges Congress to appropriate $1.6 billion annually. I thank Members for their support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I would like to thank the gentleman from Kentucky and all of my colleagues here in our freshman class. We all ran in these difficult elections almost a year ago, but I think the very strong message that came out of all of us coming to Washington was a very strong message from back home, and that is the responsibilities, as was suggested by our colleagues, that we all know, from our civics classes back in high school and elementary school, that the beauty and the strength of the United States and our democracy is all about checks and balances. It's what makes our system a democracy. We can look at other models in Europe and Asia and around the world and dictatorships and things like that, but the strength of what works in this country is checks and balances. 
   What we believe is going on and the reason this emphasis on article I is so important and for our public and the people in this country to jump on this and work with us and recognize this and talk about it is because there has been a falling down of one side. We're out of balance. There are three legs to the stool. Each one has a specific set of authority. The judges, the judiciary, interpret. The legislature, that is, the Congress, has the authority to make the laws. And the executive has certain authority into executing and following and, through the agencies, doing certain things. But when one branch gets out of whack, it means the power is coming from another branch. This isn't about personal power. This is about the strength of our democracy. That is the exciting piece here.  
   So this check and balance is not about President Bush, or any President. It's not about anybody in particular because there are future and past leaders that have all tried to exercise in certain ways. This is about where we are going in the future. I think as the gentlewoman from Ohio has already correctly mentioned, there has been a failure over the last number of years in the legislative branch, the Congress, in fighting back and asserting itself in terms of oversight and accountability and follow-through to make sure that the executive branch, the President and the executive branch, are doing what they are supposed to do, whether it is executing the war in Iraq and making sure that billions of dollars are not flowing out without any follow-up, whether it is an Attorney General that may not have necessarily been following some of the laws as we understand them or at least having the opportunity to ask the questions and not be stonewalled by the executive branch. This is what it's all about. It is a balance. It's a beautiful thing, truly, but it has got to work. 
   As the gentleman from Kentucky has correctly stated, and I thank him for bringing up in our discussion article I, this conversation that is going to happen throughout our country for the next couple of months is, let's make sure Congress does its job, let's limit the executive branch to do what it has to do, and make sure that our system works in its form of accountability that we have.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, the gentleman from Kentucky and the gentleman from Minnesota. It was great. It reminded me of being back in school of reading the Federalist Papers and those kind of things. But for those folks listening in this room and around the country, I think we all understand very clearly this is a living, breathing document, the Constitution. It has changed over the years, not the language, but the belief, but the fundamental goals and the values behind it are all the same. I think when I speak to people back in Florida, and they say to me, ``Get control over the problems in Iraq,'' whether that is changing the policy or making sure that the armor is there and that our military is properly supplied. ``What happened in Katrina? How could our government, when we saw those pictures on TV, how would could this be the United States?'' We look at third-world countries around the world and surely we go and support them, and yet in our own cities we saw the failure of the government. And unfortunately, at that time, very little ``buck stops here'' kind of response. People died unfortunately, billions of dollars in property loss, and just the bruising of the American psyche, not to mention the loss of personal lives in New Orleans and other places. It was so wrong on so many levels. I think that hurt America. But the key in what our responsibility is, Members of Congress and Americans together, is to say, let's learn from the errors. Let's learn from our mistakes. That is where the accountability, the balance of power, asking the questions, getting the answers, learning from those mistakes, whether it is in Iraq and finding out where those billions of dollars of cash have gone so it doesn't happen again, whether it is foreign policy or whether it is policy that affects everything in this country. We saw a bridge collapse. Are we looking at all the bridges in the United States to make sure that our infrastructure is safe? 
   Mr. Ellison obviously is deeply involved and truly has been a great leader and hero to your community because you obviously knew exactly what needed to be done there. But these are the questions. Where is America today? And the only way we are going to continue to be this great country, this beacon around the world, is to be able to have a thriving democracy that doesn't let one end of the spectrum, in this case the executive branch, run over and not allow the Members of Congress and the American people to ask the questions, get the answers, learn and move forward in a very, very positive way, which is the American value that we all have. 
   Americans can do anything they want. We know that. But you can't have Washington stopping it. Unfortunately, until this most recent Congress of which we are all privileged to be a part, we had year after year after year where Congress unfortunately didn't do its job in many of our opinions. I am very proud to say that we are making many of the right moves here. We have a lot more work to do. Let's make no mistake about it. Americans demand and expect us to do our job, to do it with fervor and excitement and make sure we correct some of these mistakes and move forward. 
   But we need help from the executive branch. They have to realize there are limits to those responsibilities. There are no personal issues here, but responsibilities of moving this country ahead.  If everyone will get out of their corner a little bit and come together, I think we can solve all these problems and do it in a very positive way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the chairman. 
   I rise to support the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. This bill is a real comprehensive energy solution, one that will bring down gas prices in the short-term and, most importantly, end our national addiction to oil in the long-term. 
   This is the energy plan that Americans have been waiting for since the oil embargo of 1973. The sooner we take oil out of the equation, the better it will be for our economy and our national security. 
   This legislation has the potential to dramatically reduce gas prices and set our country on a path to energy independence with real investment in clean technologies and provide tax breaks for individuals and businesses which make smart energy choices. 
   In this package we treat oil as a transition to the innovative technologies of the future, but it is only a transition. Congress has finally learned through the American people that we cannot continue to feed our oil addiction and remain competitive in a global economy. 
   This package opens up new parts of the Outer Continental Shelf for drilling, 85 percent of it, and it also includes the drill-it-or-lose-it provision that I have supported. This basically says that Congress is telling the oil companies that they must drill on the land or offshore areas that they already control, or step aside and let someone else drill on that area. 
   I have always believed that most Americans believe that that ingenuity that put a man on the Moon can and will solve our energy crisis, and this package provides the necessary incentives for our scientists, researchers and entrepreneurs to perfect the next generation of clean, affordable energy sources. America is well ahead of the Bush administration on energy policy, and is more than ready to embrace this comprehensive energy plan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the health of the American economy depends on having a highly educated skilled workforce, but studies show the number one reason that students fail to attend college today is cost. 
   In addition to tuition, fees, interest rates on student loans have also risen. Over the last 5 years the interest rates on student loans have jumped by almost 2 percentage points, further increasing the cost of college. Many of us were dependent on student loans to go to college in the first place. I am one of them. 
   Recently, when I visited Pompano High School in my district, I met many exceptional students who were concerned that they would have difficulty managing tuition costs. These students in Pompano High School deserve better, as students do all over the United States. This Democrat bill would cut the interest rate in half from the current 6.8 percentage to 3.4 percent over the next 5 years. 
   This proposal will help over 5.5 million low- and middle-income students and their families afford a college education and a way to a better life. As a case in point, a study this year by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group estimates the average cost for a Florida student, what it will save over the cost of its life is $4,400. That is a powerful incentive, and I ask everyone to join us in passing this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is a pleasure to be here with Mr. Hall, my good freshman friend from New York, and my good friend from the State of Washington. I know you have been leading the fight for a number of years and trying to get our focus, not only in your State, but throughout the country on the idea of renewable energy sources. 
   Many of us in the freshman class came to this year's campaign and this Congress with a view that this is an opportunity of historic proportion. This is an opportunity for us to recognize that this is a once-in-a-generation calling, no different than our predecessors had with the Manhattan Project. I know that many seniors in my district in south Florida have talked about that, the calling of their generation to make sure that World War II would end  with an atomic weapon. Of course we all know that when Sputnik went up in the early 1960s, a little before my time, but at a time when this country saw this little tin can up in space and thought this could be a threat of possibly bombs coming from outer space into our country, and John F. Kennedy saw this as a time and place for us to engage our private sector, our universities, our public, to create a new generation of scientists and mathematicians who would put a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s. By 1969, they did that. And now the science and technology that came out of the space program has broad applications to our daily lives. 
   I view this, as do many Democrats and Republicans, as a time in our country's history when we need to make ourselves energy independent. I believe it. There is nobody in this room or in this country who doesn't believe that Americans, when they put their nose to the grindstone, can't accomplish anything. We can. We can and we will. 
   This has the unbelievable capacity of recognizing three great elements in this day. One is national security. We should never, ever have to make another foreign policy decision based on where the next drop of oil is coming from. That is a strategic mistake of unbelievable proportions. To have to import 60 percent of our oil from unstable countries around the world that in many cases are taking some of the dollars that we send over, the millions and billions of dollars, and financing both sides of the war on terror is wrong. 
   Recognizing that is something we need to do for our own national security, inside the United States, is crucial. 
   Secondly, we all understand the environmental impacts. I know my colleagues that are speaking tonight have led the fight on this, and many others. And recognizing whether it is global warming or any of the other environmental impacts of some of the technologies that are used today with oil and other things, these are issues that we need to take up. 
   I live in Florida. We have had a battle in Congress, and I was not in Congress last year, but many of us fought the fight back home: We don't want drilling off the coast of Florida, or in Alaska in the refuge. Those are false choices made by the administration. 
   The right choice is we don't have to have more oil drilling. Oil drilling will be a part of our energy solution, but we don't need drilling in places which will have a potential of having a tremendous long-term environmental impact. Off the coast of Florida, we have a very large tourist industry. We have wonderful reefs. We have a beautiful environment in our oceans and bays and the Gulf Coast. We can't afford to do that. It is not good for anybody in this country. There are choices that allow us to have alternative energy. 
   And of course the last thing is the new economy. Many have talked about the fact that in this economy today we have lost jobs overseas. We don't have steel manufacturing like we used to. We don't produce a lot of the products. The science of alternative energy sources and the commercialization of that technology and those products can once again be our big technology boom like we had in the 1990s in this decade, and for decades to come. It will make us energy independent, and it will be exportable science to the rest of the world.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. One of the beauties of what we are talking about, and what Americans are talking about, is there is a lot of technology and a lot of science and businesses that are already out there doing these things. That is a very exciting thing. If you listen to the national picture that 60 percent of our oil is imported, and that is a major source. And we obviously have lots of other fossil fuels being burned at this point, but there is solar power. 
   I am from Florida, and we call ourselves the Sunshine State. And we constantly hear in Florida you can't use solar effectively because the panels are too big and they can't store the energy. 
   My personal feeling, and I think you believe this, if we put our mind and science to this, we could probably have a solar panel the size of this 8 1/2 by 11 piece of paper on every house that powers that house. Individual power plants, and it will happen. It is going to happen. There is wave power. There is wind power and corn-based ethanol and sugar-based ethanol like they use in Brazil. 
   Again, they may not be perfect in their present form. That is the point. Let's further them and use our innovation agenda that we are pushing in this Congress to get all of the economic incentives in place to encourage the businesses, to encourage our science and university academics as well as business leaders to come together.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman, and I think that is exactly the point. The point is, there is not necessarily one source of energy alternative that is going to be for everyone. We have a big country, with lots of existing resources that have been mentioned by the gentlemen on the floor this evening, and the choices and the competitive ways that we as a country can competitively grant resources to companies, to scientists to come together and say, listen, we think there is enough coal in this country to power the country for 300 years, but we have a high sulfur and carbon dioxide problem. Is there a solution? If there is a solution, that can be a wonderful thing. So there is coal in certain parts of the country and maybe that works there. 
   Wave power, wind power, all the things we are talking about, it is this competitive way of approaching this. Not one solution necessarily to fit all. There is still going to be oil out there to some extent, but the point of all this is, it is there. And the most exciting part about this is that there is a solution, and Americans need to engage this. 
   The Congress is way behind the American public, and the administration is even further behind. And the part where we, I think, are coming together tonight and tomorrow, as you and many others are going to be leading this fight for energy independence in the first step we are taking now, which will continue with additional steps, is, we want to ask the American public to come forward to their Members of Congress, to their business leaders, and to their Chambers of Commerce and start talking about the technologies that they have. What can we do to collaborate with each other to take some of these ideas and make them commercially viable? The more competition out there, the more resources in, the lower the price will be. 
   It is almost like the discussion we have had for so many years, public transportation versus road building. People have said, well, you have to subsidize public transportation. Well, absolutely you do. But guess what road building is? Who pays for the roads? It is your gas taxes in every State of the country and the Federal Government that pays for that. So it is a question of reordering our priorities. 
   In this case, it is the reordering of priorities from more oil drilling and giving those types of resources and support to putting that into places and with people that can create the new generation of energy alternatives, and it is very exciting.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. If the gentleman will yield for a second, the next level of this, just like any start-up business in this country and the success of the capitalistic system that we have is, business entrepreneurs realize value. What we are talking about here is start-up capital for many of these businesses. We are not talking necessarily the United States taxpayer funding these things indefinitely. 
   The great part about this is that many of them are already in place. They just need a little additional push or a little additional resource, and then you will see venture capital and lots of business entrepreneurs, and probably even oil companies who will see a good opportunity, who will even invest. But whoever it is, we want to see the direction of this jump-started, and that is what the gentleman is talking about.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, exactly. And the incentive that is being used to encourage a company to make the investment in some type of scrubber or some type of way of reducing the amount of carbon dioxide should be just that. It should be an incentive to do that and make that capital investment in that technology, versus not having to pay for it. There is no economic incentive to change. Obviously there is a huge environmental impact for all of us who are breathing the air and the entire impact on the climate and the environment. But those companies that continue to burn coal don't have an incentive. So if we flip it around and say, all right, there is going to be a charge, in order for you to do this there is going to be an expense associated with it, whereas if you invest, if you are going to have to pay something in, if you are going to invest in something that is good, good for the environment, good for you. You get some type of benefit out of it then it is a good swap for the company, and it is a particularly, it is exactly what we need in terms of our encouraging private investment in technology that will clean our air.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. To follow up, if, the whole idea of gas, miles per gallon, which people have a tendency to look at cars today and look at the miles per gallon, there have been a lot of games that have been played with that over the years, sport utility vehicles being viewed as trucks, therefore, not having the same limitations that most automobiles in the United States have. 
   As the gentleman from New York mentioned, there are many cars made in other places around the world that have figured out how to make 40, 50 miles per gallon, base car and some hybrids as well. I don't believe there is any inhibiting factor in the United States for our car companies to do the same. 
   Now, do we need to give a little incentive? Maybe. I think we have all seen the statistics. For every couple of miles per gallon you increase in efficiency, we are dropping some amount of oils per barrel, gas that has to be imported from the Middle East or wherever every day. So there is a trade-off here. 
   There is also this issue of importing, which is a current issue which we need to reduce. The technology is going to take a little bit of time. We need to do exactly what we are doing tomorrow and over the next number of weeks and months. But there are some immediate things we can do. 
   I certainly would suggest to Americans on a patriotism basis, on a smart basis on the thinking of your children  and your grandchildren and what's right, we will sacrifice. We are all in this together here. Let's make the right decisions, do what you can. It's not the right thing for everybody. But to the extent that you can buy a car that gets better gas mileage and focus on that cars that maybe use regular instead of premium. Those are all choices that people make. Everybody is in this together. Let us make some smart decisions.

   Although some of my colleagues and I have differing views on our strategy in Iraq, one thing is clear: after five years and $600 billion of American taxpayer dollars spent, ``enough is enough.'' 
   That is why Mr. Yarmuth and I are offering this amendment today. Our amendment declares that any future Status of Forces Agreement that is negotiated between Iraq and the United States must include cost-sharing measures so that that the Iraqi government can take more responsibility. 
   With an expected Iraqi budget windfall of some $60 billion this year, it is time for Iraq to stand up and take responsibility for its own future. 
   All of our districts are feeling the pinch of tough economic times here at home. Critical domestic priorities are being underfunded or not funded at all. 
   Our amendment would help put our economy back on track and would send a message to the Iraqi government that they must participate in their own future.

My name is Ron Klein, and today I am proudly sworn in as all of us were in the new Congress, and I represent Florida's 22nd district. I believe I can speak on behalf of all my fellow freshmen colleagues today in saying that we are all truly honored to be here to represent the value of America's families. 
   It is time to bring a new direction to Washington and promote honesty, integrity, and real leadership in the United States Congress. That is why we have introduced an ethics reform package that will restore the public's trust and confidence in Congress. Those of us who were just recently on the campaign trail heard that frequently, and we know we need to do something about it. 
   One of these reforms has been introduced by my colleague, Zack Space from Ohio's 18 district, and it is a measure banning Members of Congress and their staff from accepting gifts from lobbyists. This bill will also put a stop to the common but inappropriate practice of allowing Members of Congress to use money from their campaign coffers to pay for corporate jets for travel purposes.     
   Letting special interests run the Congress is simply not right, and we have a responsibility to put a stop to this unscrupulous practice. 
   Simply put, it is time to return Congress to the people's House, not the auction house. I congratulate Speaker Pelosi, and all of the Members of Congress who were sworn in today, and I ask all Members to join us in these new policy changes.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 1361, a resolution that urges the U.S. government to prevent the upcoming U.N. World Conference on Racism from being hijacked by those seeking to spread anti-Semitism and hate. The theory behind a conference on racism, where members of all nations come together to fight hate and promote diversity, is an important goal. Unfortunately, just as they have in the past, the organizers of this U.N. conference on Racism seem to have buried the task at hand. 
   In 2001, the conference was held in Durban, South Africa, and was hijacked and transformed into an anti-Israel tirade. While racism and the promotion of hate are taught in many classrooms around the world, the organizers of this U.N. conference unfairly chose to single out Israel. This must stop. 
   The United States must take a leadership role now, while the conference is still in planning stages, to ensure that such a despicable charade will not be repeated. The administration must work with our allies and use its leverage to ensure that this conference lives up to its name. And, if it seems that the conference is going to mock the world's fight against racism and it becomes clear that the conference will become a forum to promote hate and anti-Israel sentiment, then I urge the administration to pull U.S. support and work with our allies to show the conference for what it is: a sham. 
   Finally, I join the sponsors of this legislation in commending the efforts of our allies, France, Canada, and Israel for declaring their intentions not to participate in Durban II if its agenda is diverted. 
   It is imperative that the United States not stand idly by while countries around the world belittle the fight against racism. I look forward to working with my colleagues, the administration and countries around the world until we get this right.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am Ron Klein, and I represent Florida's 22nd Congressional District in Congress, which is southeast Florida, Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach area, and I have the privilege of anchoring tonight's freshmen's Special Order. We decided as a group of freshman, and there was a large group of us that were elected this year, to meet on a regular basis and to discuss policy, those of us who had contested races, those of us who did not have contested races, but all of us new with this process coming in with a fresh perspective and the belief that hopefully we could influence the process in a way that would move things along, which is, I think, the loud message we heard from the people that elected all of us, both Democrats and Republicans this year. 
   Tonight our Special Order is going to focus on the importance of accountability and oversight within our Nation's government. There is no question that the ability to exercise accountability and oversight among the executive and legislative branches, that is our branch and the President's branch, is vital to making sure that our government is operating and governing within the highest ethical and moral standards, and makes sense. It is also important to make sure our government is doing the right thing for our people. 
   It seems that every time we are turning on the news lately or pick up the newspaper, there seems to be some story about where there is no accountability. And the oversight and lack of accountability seems to be the prime topic of conversation back home in our districts, in our offices, in our supermarkets, in our churches and synagogues. If you just think about the most recent one, the United States attorney scandal, where a number of U.S. attorneys were fired; and, of course, there is a question about for what purpose they were fired and whether there is a reason, and now there is a question of getting all the information out on the table. 
   The ongoing concerns over Valerie Plame and the outing of Valerie Plame. And, of course, I think most of us as Americans understand, when someone works for this country as a member of our intelligence services, we owe that person the highest degree of respect and integrity and make sure that their position is held confidential. And certainly anybody who is responsible for outing that person should be held accountable and punished. 
   Conditions at Walter Reed Hospital. And we are going to talk about that a little more tonight, and, unfortunately, other veterans hospitals. And I am happy to say that in my area and in many other parts of the country that there are some very good things going on in our veterans hospitals and our veterans outpatient clinics, but many times it is a matter of having the resources to have enough doctors in place. And I know I have heard from time to time about long waiting lines. But there are places like Walter Reed and other places that have now been identified where you had mold and you had ceilings falling in and lack of care, and people that were working there that were overworked and unfortunately not providing the type of treatment that should be awarded. The highest level of respect should be awarded to our men and women who are our heroes in this country. 
   And, of course, the no-bid government contracts being awarded to companies doing business in Iraq to the tune of billions of dollars of waste, and certainly not accomplishing the major goals. One of the goals we went in there with, of course, was to take out Saddam Hussein, but I think everybody understood very quickly that if we were going to be successful in changing the hearts and minds, that some of the rebuilding activities, getting electricity on, getting hospitals up, creating jobs, those kinds of things would be very, very important to making the people of Iraq feel that this was a worthy cause to set up their own government. Unfortunately, we have spent billions of our money over there, and, unfortunately, the condition is in many ways worse today than it was with the fall of Saddam Hussein. 
   The news on these subjects is everywhere. So tonight we are going to talk about accountability and oversight, and my colleagues who are going to join me tonight as freshman Members recently elected are going to be talking about how we are working to restore those features of accountability and oversight to Washington and our government. 
   A couple things I just want to touch on before I turn over to my colleague Congressman Hodes. On November 7, which was last year's election, we believe that the American people, I know we all heard this as we walked door to door and heard from the American people, they wanted change. It wasn't necessarily Democrat or Republican; they wanted people to come together, find common ground, and move forward. And fortunately for this country, this House has, in fact, started that process. There were six items very quickly that were passed in the beginning called the 100 Hours, the Six for '06, everything from fixing the Medicare prescription drug program, which I know many of our seniors are concerned about making it easier to use, less costly to the taxpayers; minimum wage, making the minimum wage higher, of course, is a key issue; lower student loan rates; and a number of other issues like energy policy. These are the things that we came to work on and that were done. 
   We also passed the lobbying reform bill and a full disclosure bill which has already significantly reduced the influence that lobbyists have on this legislative process. We need to do more, but we certainly took a lot of the right steps by not allowing lobbyists to take Members of Congress out to lunch. We had that in Florida, we changed that, and I am glad we changed that here, too. 
   And, of course, the earmark process. And for those of you who don't know what earmark is, that is this idea: In the past, Congressmen, Members of the Senate and House, would go behind closed doors and add millions and tens of millions of dollars, even hundreds of millions in some cases, of special projects in the dark of night to the budget without any consideration by all the Members of Congress. And that needs to change, and I am very happy to say that with new earmark reforms in place, that will change. 
   The way it is changing is very clear: Anything that is presented needs to be presented in the light of day. It needs to be publicly disclosed and laid out for the Members of the Congress so that a legitimate project in Alaska should be a legitimate project in Florida. Even though it may benefit one State, we all  represent this country, but it has got to be done the right way. 
   This week we passed important legislation which curbs waste in Federal contracting; strengthens protection for whistleblowers, and those are, of course, people that discover and come forward when there is waste and corruption in government; and also provides long overdue of the veterans health care crisis and other Federal issues. We are going to talk about accountability of tax dollars. We are going to talk about a number of other things. 
   I am joined by some colleagues here, and I would like to introduce them. We have got Congressman Ellison, who is going to join us and talk to us a minute; Congressman Hodes. Congressman Welch is going to join us for a few minutes. 
   You look like you are poised and ready to go, Congressman Hodes, so why don't you kick off and give us a little oversight on what you are going to talk about on oversight and accountability.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Hodes. I think you laid it out very well. 
   I think the average American believes very strongly in accountability and oversight because they understand, that's how they live their lives. If you have a business, you can't do anything without keeping track of your books, keeping track of you inventory, keeping track of your personnel, your employees, and knowing that there is an end-point. And you will make money or not make money by running it efficiently with oversight. And I think that nobody is asking for any more than that in government. And, unfortunately, as you have pointed out very eloquently, that is exactly what has gone on without anybody looking after it. And many of the committees were either not operating or were abolished in the last number of years, and that just doesn't make any sense. 
   So I think you pointed out very appropriately that we are glad I think in a way that the Democrats are leading, but I think the Republicans are now joining us. And, again, this is a bipartisan approach to fixing this. 
   Mr. Ellison, I know that you have been leading and talking about this as well, so give us some of your thoughts, please.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Ellison. 
   I think that, again, the example you gave is something that is on our front pages. We are hearing about it and we are listening. 
   Some people have said, well, what is the difference if someone is coming forward or if they are coming forward under oath. Well, I like to see, when someone comes forward, that they put their hand up and say, I swear to tell the whole truth. I can't imagine somebody wouldn't want to do that and what are they hiding if they are not prepared to do that. That seems to be a little battle going on between the Congress and its investigative authority and the President. But, again, I think you put your hand up, we are expecting the truth anyway, and I think that is an appropriate thing to do. 
   Mr. Welch, our representative from Vermont in our class, why don't you share with us some of your thoughts on this.

When you make decisions, use common sense. When you follow up, use common sense. I mean, the examples that you have cited are so extraordinary, they defy common sense.

And, by the way, we have our checks and balances with the President. There are also checks and balances with all the agencies. And those are some of the things we are talking about tonight, to be sure things are operating the way they should. A big budget. A lot of money. It has to be spent properly.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Obviously there are so many things to talk about in terms of the oversight and accountability. One of the things that I think really hit hard for a lot of the people, particularly if you served in the military, was the Walter Reed Hospital revelation. 
   Many of us have not served in the military. We may have some family members that receive veterans benefits and things like that. We think of people we ask to serve our country or may have served in the past. They are American heroes on so many levels, and they deserve the highest level of care. So it was shocking, and then shocking even more so when we found out this has been going on for a while. 
   I think this oversight we have been talking about, the accountability, the proper funding, the proper level of care, doctors, nurses, things like that, so many people in the system are doing good jobs, but there are clearly deficiencies. 
   Mr. Welch, you have some thoughts on that.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank you, Mr. Hodes, for being part of our freshman class and our working group that is going to be here every week. The 110th Congress is strengthening oversight, and the proof is in the pudding. 
   People can say, I have lost confidence in Congress, but look at what we are doing. We have had dozens of hearings in the Foreign Affairs Committee just on the ability of working with our diplomatic efforts and all of the strategies in dealing with Iraq on the nonmilitary side. In the past, there have not been enough opportunities to do that. 
   We've had hearings on the veterans health care crisis and Walter Reed, the politicalization of the Justice Department and how wrong that is and that needs to be cleaned up, the Hurricane Katrina response and the things we are doing right now, passing legislation to truly get people back up on their feet. Global warming and energy independence was mentioned, and the fact is that we are getting down to the things we need to do as Americans to deal with our energy needs and the fact that there is an environmental impact. And, of course, upcoming hearings of oversight on everything from Valerie Plame to oil and gas royalties and National Guard and intelligence. 
   This is part of the mandate of the last election. I look forward to working with our freshman class. We will be doing this every week. We certainly want input from our constituents back home. Tell us what you think we can be doing. We look forward to working with both Republicans and Democrats to build on this theme of accountability and oversight.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (THE BUDGET AND NATIONAL DEBT -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky and the gentleman from New York. I certainly agree with all the statements you have made and would just share a few of my own thoughts on the budget. 
   A budget is a statement of our values, as Americans, collectively. We are not Democrats, we are not Republicans, we are not independents, we are Americans. We all are putting a lot of money, hard-earned money into the government. The question is what's going to be done with it. What is the best value that can be used to help people achieve a better life, help our economy, help job creation and all those things that are important to our communities.     
   The biggest concern that I have with the budget that is being proposed by the administration is to me it is more of missed opportunities. We know that we have a difficult economy right now. Certainly in Florida where we have had tremendous growth over the last number of years, all of a sudden things have stopped. The real estate market and all of the various businesses that are affected, and homeowners that are affected by a real estate market that has slowed to a standstill, we need to help people through the foreclosures and various other things. But what does this budget do, something that all of us said we were going to change. 
   In this body we have PAYGO, pay as you go. We can only pass legislation that is paid for in advance. My two friends here are fiscal hawks. We believe in a deficit that has to be brought down and a balanced budget. That is the way we live our personal lives. In the State legislature, we had balanced budgets. That is the way you run your business. 
   What does this budget do? First of all, it is over $3 trillion. The amount of money going into the Federal Government is extraordinary from an administration that said they wanted smaller government and less spending. 
   Put that issue aside for a second, this continues the budget deficit and increases it by another $400 billion. This is after, as the gentleman from New York said, this does not stop the biggest tax increase, the alternative minimum tax, which we tried to fix. We had a very good way of fixing it this year, and the President refused. Some people on the other side of the aisle in the Senate refused to do it. It has to be fixed. 
   The President in his proposal cuts Medicare and Medicaid. I don't know about you; I am sure you are hearing the same thing I'm hearing. Our doctors, our hospitals, our providers, they are taking care of our Medicare population in our communities, and they are feeling it. They have been cut and cut and cut, and it is not keeping up with the cost of operating a practice. We know that they need to receive fair compensation. That is unacceptable. I don't think that is something that this Congress is going to support. So again, an assumption that doesn't have any bearing on where things are going. 
   The President, who has been a big supporter of the Iraq war, as we know, and has continued to ask for more and more money, hundreds of billions of dollars, interestingly enough, in this budget sets it up for $70 billion of additional expenditures only through January 20. Now, what is January 20? That is Inauguration Day of a new President, whoever that may be. 
   But boy, is that an unrealistic way of looking at it, particularly after he has been criticizing Members of Congress saying that you can't put a date at the end of funding because you are going to cut off our troops, cut off funding of the bullets and all of the necessary support, which we are not prepared to do, but he is doing. 
   He is saying on January 20, if you pass this budget, there is no more money after that date to fund the Iraq war, not because he doesn't want to fund the Iraq war, but that is how he is creating a smaller amount of a big deficit. Instead of $400 billion, it would be $500 billion or something like that. 
   So the question is what can we do, because I think there are a whole lot of assumptions here that are incorrect. 
   I have a chart here that I have talked about before, and I think this is totally unacceptable. The lack of fiscal discipline of this administration over the last 6 or 7 years has resulted in increasing debt to an unacceptable amount in terms of us bringing our budget in line. 
   So, although the financing of the war, which has been off the books, the financing of all of these various things that the President wanted to fund, instead of cutting spending or being a little more fiscally responsible, we have been borrowing, and borrowing from foreign investors. Those are foreign countries. We are a debtor country to China and Mexico, and the list goes on and on. 
   Under this administration, in trillions of dollars we are talking about, in 2001 the amount of foreign-held Treasury securities was $1 trillion. That is a massive amount of money. In the last 6 years, it has now doubled to $2.3 trillion. Just to put it in perspective, the amount of interest that we are paying this year, strictly interest, not principal, not amortizing of the principal and interest together, just interest is over $300 billion. To me, that is money we are just flushing down the drain. 
   If there was some fiscal discipline like the House leadership has been pushing, we could take that money and do a number of things. We could take care of Americans first. How about all of us, whether it is health care, job creation, job training, so many infrastructure issues in our communities; these are the issue of our day. 
   And instead of sending that money overseas to pay interest, not even principal, that is $300 billion that is being thrown out the door offshore to some other country because we don't have the wherewithal, as we do in this House, because the President hasn't been willing to work with us in bringing this budget in line. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are many Republicans as well, but certainly the Democrats have stood together on this, and we welcome everyone as Americans to focus on this together. We have to get the budget in line. The budget that is being proposed by the President right now is something that is relying on a lot of unrealistic assumptions that will never pass because the American people don't want them to be cut, whether Medicare and a number of other things, and we have to find a way to get the budget deficit under control. That is essential. We can't mortgage the future of our country. We cannot allow our children to have to pay and our grandchildren to have to pay for something that this generation wasn't prepared to stand up and say, Yes, we can live within our means. Yes, we can have a strong economy and fight wars when necessary. And yes, we will take care of Americans when there are natural disasters, and it can all be done under a fiscally responsible way, and that has not been the record of this administration. We are going to work hard in a bipartisan way to get this under control. 
   I appreciate the fact that the gentleman from Kentucky brought this to us, and I look forward to working with him and the gentleman from New York on fixing this problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (THE BUDGET AND NATIONAL DEBT -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you. I think both of you were talking about two priorities of our country and the shortfalls and where we need to be, where we've been, and where we are going as a country. And I think we look at ourselves, and you hear this in the Presidential debates right now about the vision. And any Presidential candidate that comes forward and talks about the vision of what our country needs to be, where we need to go, the heritage of our country, the legacy of all of the great innovation that's happened and the fact that maybe we've missed a couple of steps. Not to say we can't regain and continue to move forward, because that's exactly what we are going to do. But it is going to take some new leadership through the Congress, through the Presidency and through the American people, and through our business community as well. It is a cooperative effort. 
   And I think about a few of the things that are the priorities that help us get there. Education, as you just said, is one of them. And one of the things that concerned me about the budget was the fact that the President had dropped the amount of college grants and the tuition assistance programs in the budget. And again, once again, this Congress, bipartisan, came forward and increased the Pell Grants and increased the college tuition, because if there's one thing I think we can all agree on as Americans, every student, every teenager, every adult who wants to get a higher level of education and create a greater level of workforce training which will only make their lives more productive and make their country more productive, that's a good thing. It always has been. Education has been the great equalizer in the United States, and we ought to be doing everything we can to make sure that we are giving that access and that opportunity for every student. 
   So, again, a misdirection in this budget which needs to be corrected.  
   Another thing that I think is extremely important, and all of us have some family history of illness whether it is Alzheimer's, whether it is kidney disease, or whether it is cancer or heart disease. And one of the things that our government has consistently done working with the private sector is research, basic research, which will hopefully find cures. 
   I know my mother passed away at a young age of 52. She was a very vibrant person and developed cancer, and after she went through some treatments over a period of time, we lost her. But it certainly gave me that commitment, and I know I fought along with many Members of the Congress, and the people who are listening tonight have their own family histories. And we know that collectively, we have to find ways of curing diseases. 
   Cuts in this budget to the grants for research, wrong direction. Really wrong direction. I feel extremely strong about this that we need to have the National Institute of Health grants to work with scientists or universities in our health institutions to find the therapies, to find the cures, to help make people's lives better. It's also a wonderful way of expanding our economic opportunity in exporting and licensing and creating technologies to help people around the world and selling those products around the world as well. So, again, something we need to fix in this budget. 
   I think the gentleman mentioned the COPS program, which is something that is very much on our streets, and that's, of course, the ability to have safety and public safety and security in our communities. I know in my local community, $8.5 million in our area would be cut from that funding. That's real dollars that affect real people in terms of putting police and security on our streets. It is one of the most important things our government can do to provide for the public safety. 
   These are the kinds of things that are misdirections. They can all be fixed. It is a question of all of us coming together, putting a budget together, hopefully persuading the President that these were mistakes and we need to come back and fix them. 
   And lastly, of course, I just want to touch on the fact of our economy, and the people back home are hurting right now. And we hear it every day, whether it is subprime, whether it is foreclosures, any number of things; and the Congress is working right now, and we will be passing, in the next number of days, an economic stimulus, which is designed to be short term. It's designed as a little bit of a prop up and a support of people. It will give them some cash and hopefully retire some of those responsibilities and pay for some of the necessities. 
   But long term, we have got to work together on energy issues. It's already been discussed. Paying $50, $60 for a tank of gas on someone who is earning $30,000 a year is a real issue. And at a time, as we already talked about, when energy companies are making incredible, historic amounts of money, we need to work together to substitute those resources for renewable energy programs, which I know the Congressman from New York has been all over and all of us feel very strongly about. 
   This is our moment. This is our time. This is our ``Sputnik'' moment. This is our putting-the-man-on-the-moon moment. This is the time for the American people to work together with the business, private sector, and government to create the markets and to do it. But we have to do it and start that process now. 
   So I think there are long-term and short-term issues on our economy. I look forward to working on infrastructure issues with everyone else, recognizing, as our Speaker said last week, in 1806 you had the Louisiana Purchase period of time, and that was a moment when President Jefferson said, This is the time we are going to start building our country: the Erie Canal and the canal systems, the road systems that got our country going in the industrial revolution. 
   A hundred years later, 1908, President Roosevelt coming forward and saying, This country is building and developing. Let's preserve some of our great areas, and we developed the National Parks System. 
   Now 100 years later, to her credit, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi saying this is our time to now focus on rebuilding this country: our road systems, sewer systems, bridge systems, all of those kinds of things. It has everything to do with the economy. It has everything to do with the quality of life. Our commerce, people's quality of life, these are the things that we need to be working on together. Where there's a will, there's a way is my attitude, and I know we are going to do this all together.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, my name is RON KLEIN, and I represent Florida's 22nd Congressional District, which is in Southeast Florida. I am truly honored to be here today and to be part of this incredibly important effort led by Congresswoman DIANA DEGETTE and Congressman MIKE CASTLE, both of whom have been relentless crusaders toward leading this bipartisan effort in Congress to expand the use of embryonic stem cell research. 
   As a member of the Florida State Senate for the past 10 years, leading efforts to utilize and fund embryonic stem cell research was not just a priority of mine but a passion. We all have our own family stories about why medical cures need to be discovered today, not 10 years from now. 
   In my district, which includes Ft. Lauderdale, Boca Raton, Pompano Beach and West Palm Beach, we have so many retirees who moved to Florida to live out their golden years. But as they age, as we know with our own  families, many of them are afflicted with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and many other serious ailments. To them, the stem cell battle is critically important, and every day that passes without scientists and researchers having all the tools at their disposal is another day of suffering. 
   From juvenile diabetes to paralysis, the potential of stem cell research in all of its forms presents one of humanity's greatest leaps toward the ultimate goal of preserving, prolonging and improving the quality of our lives. 
   Funding stem cell research is also a great investment in our future, not only from a personal health standpoint but also from an economical and cost-efficiency perspective. Finding cures and therapies may reduce the cost of hospitalization and other expensive aspects of our health care system. It will also create careers and jobs in the 21st Century that will lead the world. 
   I am incredibly proud to be part of this effort to increase stem cell funding resources, and I look forward to casting my vote and doing whatever is necessary to support comprehensive stem cell research and funding in the United States. 
   Thank you for your attention, your vote, and thank you to the millions of Americans who are watching and waiting.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes). 
   I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight as members of our freshman class. We try to get together about once a week to speak to each other and to speak to the Members on the floor here about the importance of what we were elected to do, along with every other Member, Democrat and Republican, in this Chamber. 
   Certainly this last election had a lot to do with the war and the strategy of the war and whether waging the war in the way it was being waged was successful. And of course success, at least in my view and the people that I have spoken to, is what can we do to enhance and protect the American people? All of us, in our homes, our cities, our country, and certainly our friends abroad. 
   At this time, it seems pretty clear, and I think it's been pretty clear to the American people for a long time who have been ahead of the President and ahead of the Congress in their thinking about this, that the national security of our country, of course coming first, is not being enhanced by having our fighting men and women, our brave men and women fighting a war that by and large is the participation of a civil war, a civil war among groups of people that unfortunately have been fighting each other for a long, long time; that by us dropping in our own form of democracy in that region, it just doesn't necessarily work that way. Although we would like to believe as Americans, and we know that we have the best system in the world, it just can't be planted in some other part of the world and just accepted as it is. 
   So the reality is, what can we do? What are the choices? And I have not been one who said immediate withdrawal. There are some in this Chamber that believe in immediate withdrawal, there are some that say we should be there for 10, 20, 30, 50 years, as long as it takes. 
   I think the reality is, there has to be a better way. And I think that we've heard from many of our military experts. When President Bush says, let's listen to the military experts, I agree. But it's not just the military experts that are telling you what you want to hear, it's the military experts that have been our generals, people that have served in that region, continue to serve in that region, and not just as soon replace them if they don't agree with the present administration. 
   There are answers, just like anything else. It doesn't matter if it's health care or energy, there are answers to all these things. People solve problems all day long. Americans are very innovative, energetic people. There are answers to this one as well. They may not be the answers we're looking for that are the ultimate best answers, but there are ways that we can best protect our interests in the Middle East, our support of the State of Israel and other friends in that region, and then most importantly, the people that live in our country. And those may be redeployment, moving our troops out of harm's way and into areas where maybe the borders are secured; or maybe, as we know now, the 
   major mistake was that the entire Iraqi leadership of its armed forces was basically eviscerated, they're gone and moved away. And so the result is you have an Iraqi Army that by and large is leaderless. And they've been trying to make amends on that and trying to deal with that, but they're still way behind their curve. We can probably provide some support in that area. 
   But we do also know at the same time, in terms of our national security interests, if we think about what brought us to this point so far and why we have this threat of terrorism, is because we were attacked on 9/11, nothing to do with Iraq, but Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. That issue has to do with Afghanistan and maybe other areas of Pakistan. That's where our military might, our strength, our troops, our ability to build coalitions around the world, which we've lost along the way here, that's where we can have the most impact. 
   So Mr. Hodes, I would just like to open with those thoughts. I know we're going to have a little bit of discussion on that. But I want the American people to know and I want our Members here in the Chamber to understand, there are choices; there are good choices, there are better choices, and there are choices to move forward. To stand still, to say the surge and all those things, we need to move forward and best protect our troops and best protect Americans.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. And Mr. Hodes, I would absolutely agree with you. And I think the proof is in the pudding back home. When I go back home and I speak to folks in town hall meetings in Palm Beach County and Broward County in south Florida where I live, I've heard from Democrats, Republicans and independents. And nobody wears their party on their sleeve, you just hear from them and they explain how they feel. And they feel very strongly that, as former military, there are a lot of senior citizen veterans in my area, they fought so hard for our country and the values and the strength that they have for the belief in the military and the strength that they have for the belief in our country and doing the right thing as we did in World War II and as we've done so many times since then. And they feel that what is going on right now is weakening the military, weakening America, as a standard bearer for truth and strength in the world, and this hurts. This hurts them, as people who fought so hard for our country.     
   I am not 70 years old. I am not 80 years old. But I have so many people that have expressed that to me as they wear their hats, as they wear their uniform, as they come and talk about their own personal experiences. We certainly have that generation. 
   Then we have the generation of parents whose kids may enlist or are already in the military. Some believe that what the military is doing is just right. Some feel very bad and feel like, not that their sons and daughters aren't doing the right thing on behalf of the country, they just feel like the strategy is not what they have made that representation, that commitment about. 
   I also feel like you do, that I am beginning to see, and I know in some of the committee hearings we have had in the House of Representatives we have heard expressions by both Democrats and Republicans. We are starting to hear from Republicans, too, about questions raised and looking for that accountability. 
   The bottom line is this: This is the Iraqis' war. This is the Iraqis' responsibility to take their own country and build it back up. That is their civilian ability, their ability to put the electricity back on, build hospitals and create jobs for themselves and put down the terror and the people that are harassing them in the cities and the explosives going on. They have got to take their own bull by the horns and do something about themselves. We can't do that. They have to do that. So there is this responsibility that they have to stand up to themselves and recognize. 
   We did what we said we were going to do. We took out Saddam Hussein and gave them a fresh opportunity. Saddam Hussein was a tyrant. He was a bad guy. But let's now look to the next level. The next responsibility is for the Iraqi people to stand up for themselves. We can't fight their war for them. We can't fight that for them. We have our own responsibilities. 
   We have to deal with Iran right now. Iran is a serious threat to Israel and our interests around the world, North Korea, obviously, and Afghanistan. These are places where the United States military needs to be able to be strong and exert itself when needed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you. I appreciate your observing those things that we did, because I think every one of us believes it is the right thing to do. I know, just to share for a moment, the experience that all of us had at Walter Reed Hospital and the experiences that we have all had in visiting our veterans and our folks who have fought for you us so bravely back home. 
   The point you made is that many of these men and women back in Vietnam, back in other wars, would have died based on the injuries they have received. But instead, because of modern science, they are alive today, some of  them. But the injuries are so substantial, loss of both legs, loss of arms, loss of major functions that they have, they are going to require a lifetime of care. And every American needs to understand that is a responsibility we have. When we ask our men and women to fight for us, we better be prepared to make sure they have all the necessary cares, and their families get that same level of care. Because it is that support, that when we ask people to fight for the values and strength of our country, that needs to be there. 
   But that is a cost of this war. And the problem, of course, is that if in fact, as we started this conversation tonight, we are not achieving our national security interests, we are not making Americans safer at home or our friends overseas more secure, if we are not accomplishing any of that, and we are going to wait until September now, and unfortunately there may be another 300 or 400 of our brave men and women losing their lives for something that again is not accomplishing those goals, and we are spending another $40 billion or $50 billion, I think a lot of Americans are saying, what could we do with that amount of money? What could we do with those lost lives back here at home, those lost lives, the lost opportunities for the families and men and women fighting for us? 
   I know when I think about Florida where I am from, they already have 139 men and women killed. We have had 1,196 severely injured. These are our neighbors. These are our friends. 
   We had just tragically this past week, a young man, 25 years old, Daniel Agami, who, unfortunately, was killed recently by, of course, an IED. I know that every one of us in this Chamber, and I think out there in the country, they have been through this loss. They understand what that neighbor, that nephew, that son, that daughter, what it means. 
   A lot of Americans haven't been really affected by this war because maybe the numbers are not as significant as they were during Vietnam or during World War II. But it is an American. Every loss of life is an American, and I think we all share that sense of feeling and, of course, that empathy for the families. 
   The question we are raising now, of course, the national commitment we have to fight wars is there. The strength and understanding our military always has to be at the ready. But we should also understand that when we do fight wars, that we need to win, succeed, do whatever is necessary, but, at the same time, be smart about it. Accomplish the goals that we have and recognize that in this dangerous world that we live in today, in this present strategy that President Bush has executed and is unwilling to change to this point in time, we have made ourselves weaker in other theaters, in other places around the world. That is unacceptable to me. It is unacceptable to every person I would imagine who is concerned about the future of our country. 
   We are prepared to change that. I am very happy that Democrats have changed, as you said, Mr. Hodes, the discussion in Washington, taking the discussion back in our streets at home, our main streets back at home up here, finding even Republicans now who I know believe and, of course, they want to do the right thing as well, but just a blind loyalty to the President's policy at this point is not the right thing to do. We need to think, use common sense, figure out the right way to redeploy, protect our men and women over there, do the right thing so the Middle East can be stabilized and we can fight our real battles and deal with Iran and Afghanistan and other places.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I agree with you, Mr. Altmire. Just the title ``admiral'' speaks of such respect that we have for Representative Sestak. Those of us who did not have the privilege of serving in the military, as you can imagine, there are 435 of us on the floor, we look to each other for advice. We learn from each other. 
   I know I have spoken to you on a number of occasions to get your advice, to be an informed Member of Congress, and I do appreciate that because I think you not only have that lifetime of experience serving in the military, but as a leader, an admiral in the military, you have the high level of understanding of all the issues we are discussing right now. Of course, it is not the end-all, be-all, but it is a tremendous resource for all of us. 
   One of the committees that I serve on is Foreign Affairs, and that committee is responsible for working with the President and the State Department on our foreign policy, whether it is in the Western Hemisphere, Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, or in the Middle East or Russia or China. 
   Our country has been consumed with terrorism since we were attacked on our shores by Osama bin Laden. One of the biggest frustrations we have as Americans, the most powerful nation in the world with the highest level of information and intelligence and reach around the world, the fact that Osama bin Laden is still on the loose is beyond imagination. Every American should demand that that should have been and should continue to be a top priority. 
   I am pointing that out for a reason. That reason is, we took our eye off the ball when we got involved in this in the first place. That has been discussed and we understand that. But that doesn't mean that today we shouldn't still be focusing on where the real threat is. The threat relates to al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden and his henchmen. The threat relates to nuclear weapons. These are the significant challenges of our day. They are challenges as it relates to Russia and loose nuclear weapons. They are challenges as it relates to North Korea and containing North Korea. 
   There was an interesting story that Reuters produced. It talked about the estimated number of nuclear weapons that were likely to have been produced by North Korea during the last 6 years of the Bush administration. This is a rogue country by many discussions, by the United Nations and countries around the world, that has a nuclear weapon, possibly seven nuclear weapons that we know of, all within the last 6 years, which tells us once again that we took our eye off the ball of dealing with the true threats. 
   This is not a question of whether North Korea is going to shoot off an ICBM towards the United States. This is not a stable country and may provide that nuclear weapon to other groups, organizations, countries. That is a threat. That is where our focus should be. Iraq is a different situation. 
   We take a look at Iran and what we know about Iran at this moment. There are an estimated number of centrifuges in Iran, in their main nuclear facility producing reactor-grade uranium. There may be 1,300 of these spread out in Iran. Iran is a threat, in having a nuclear weapon, to Israel and to other countries in the Middle East, and for the same reason, to the United States. 
   This is a serious issue. This is where our foreign policy and military strength and the sharing of intelligence and confidence with other allies around the world, where we have always historically, American Presidents have always led, and we made sure that we had that authority. And it was in our country's best interests. 
   But today we find ourselves in a place because we are mired in Iraq where many countries around the world are not prepared to share that goal of nuclear containment. This is something that we need to focus on. This is another reason why we have to extricate ourselves in a responsible way from a war that is not achieving our national security interests, and refocus our attention on nuclear weapons that may be developed in Iran, and make sure that we are doing the right thing to protect the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I'd like to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio and all my colleague here tonight. I'm going to carry this conversation a little further about fiscal discipline because all of us elected last year, Democrats and, interestingly enough, Republicans, have supported fiscal discipline, but got way off track over the last 10 years. It's now the Democrats, many of us, who are sort of leading the fight. We are the fiscal hawks. We are the ones saying this is totally unacceptable for all the reasons you heard tonight. 
   I think the gentleman from Vermont already mentioned this, but it's worth restating. The Bush administration is responsible for the five biggest deficits, and that total is a staggering amount. But I want to just take that one step further because this is the kind of change that we are going to deliver. 
   Given the opportunities over the next couple of years, hopefully in a bipartisan way, that is the way we get things done here, but looking at this figure here, this is a chart that says: Taxpayer spending on Iraq war versus Federal spending on other priorities. This is for last year, fiscal year. It has the cost of the Iraq war, $150 billion.     
   The cost of NIH funding, that is all the research that government does, all the research on cancer and heart disease and Alzheimer's, all the things that afflict our families and our communities, it is a substantial amount of money. But that figure, plus all the college tuition assistance, everything we do to try to make sure that kids get  into school and get a college education, which we know is so important in the world economy, plus the cost of all the children's health care we provide in the United States, and all the cost of all the bridge repairs and road building and all the things that go on in every single one of our communities, sewers, roads, bridges, all those kinds of things, if you take the cost of roads and bridges, the cost of research, the cost of all the college tuition and the cost of all the health care, that total sum is less than what we spent on the Iraq war. 
   Now, we debated at length whether the Iraq war is a good war or not or has accomplished a lot. I personally believe, and I serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee, that, unfortunately, the real threat against our national security is in Afghanistan. And it still boggles my mind and most Americans that Osama bin Laden, who committed the worst crime against Americans in our history in the United States, is still free somewhere in the world perpetrating additional threats against the United States through al Qaeda. 
   The problem, of course, is that he and others most likely are in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the mountain areas there. Unfortunately, we took our eye off the ball. But let's put that issue aside. Hopefully we will be able to deal with that in the near future with the next President. 
   Let's just talk about, we have spent $650 billion. I want everybody to remember this number, that is $339 million we are spending each day on the war in Iraq, $339 million per day. Let's think about what we could do with that money. I mean, we could have a debate at length here, and I am sure everybody listening tonight on the floor and throughout our country would have lots of good ideas that are legitimate priorities for our country. Yet we are spending that amount of money. 
   Now, is there an answer that the Democrats have put forward? You bet there is. What was this war sold to us on in terms of how it was going to be paid for? Oil revenues. Iraq sits on the third largest oil revenues and reserves of oil in the world; $80 billion, it is reported, in banks, some of which is in New York. Eighty billion dollars. That money was supposed to pay for the cost of reconstruction of Iraq, the cost of our military fuel and the cost also of the retraining of the military in Iraq, our military training their military. All legitimate things. Yet what has happened? President Bush has refused, the Republicans have refused to do that. 
   Now, I introduced a bill, H.R. 1111. H.R. 1111. I said it is number one, put Americans first. I think most Americans would agree with that. Let's take the money that Iraq has, it is $80 billion, and let them pay for the cost of their reconstruction, the cost of our men and women training their military, and our fuel costs. That is common sense. That is what we were told in the beginning. They have got the money. 
   Let's get on with it. That is how we can start putting Americans first and all the priorities that are so important to fixing our economy, getting jobs created, getting an educational system, getting health care put back together, Social Security, Medicare, all the priorities that make America strong on the inside first. 
   So I think that is a very important point, and we finally got a little bit of discussion on this. But the reality is this is the kind of leadership we are offering and we are providing.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you to the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
   Just to pick up on your point on our men and women serving and our veterans, I'm from Florida. Every one of us in our districts has a huge number of veterans--some from World War II, some from the Korean war, some from Vietnam. Many of our Vietnam veterans today are hurting. Whether it's Agent Orange or just age, itself, it has really begun to impact them. Now we're creating a new generation of an upwards of 2 million new veterans. We don't want to create that next generation of homeless. We know there are huge post-traumatic stress issues associated with it, but I'm particularly proud in working with our local veterans' organizations and national veterans' organizations which gave our leaders the recommendations of what they need in order to eliminate the backlog, to make sure that the care was in place for evaluations of post-traumatic stress or to recognize that, of the many men and women coming home today, back in the Vietnam war, they wouldn't have lived with their damage and with their injuries. That's right. Today, they're coming home, and we have a responsibility. I say this and people understand. Americans understand. We stand up for our men and women who put the uniform on. That's something we feel very strongly about, but we have to recognize that we will have to provide for them for the rest of their lives and that we will have to support their families as well. That new GI Bill is key. It was the right thing to do. For many of the people who don't even know this, it even allows the balance of those benefits to go to the spouse and to the children. Isn't that the right thing to do for the families?

I mean that's the ``thank you'' that Americans want to give the men and women who serve us, but when we are asked to serve in our military, we need to make sure it is the right place and the right time and for our national security interests, which is, unfortunately, what went wrong. 
   The gentlewoman from Ohio, you have led the fight in this Congress on jobs. I'm from Ohio originally. You and I talk about that. I grew up in Cleveland. Now, as a Floridian, I know we have a different set of economic issues in Florida, but they're very similar in terms of jobs being lost overseas. I want to point this board out real fast here because it talks about jobs created through August in President Clinton's years. 
   There were 1.47 million jobs created under President Clinton. In President Bush's 8 years----

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Excuse me. In 8 months. Thank you. In these last 8 months, 605,000 jobs were lost under this administration. You'll hear in the Presidential election on the Republican side the same thing again and again and again, the same economic plan. It's an old plan. It's not getting us anywhere. 
   I just want to point this out because we can do better. It's one of those areas again. This Congress has already done a number of things, I think, that are very positive. We've passed the biggest increase in the Pell Grants in years. For those who aren't familiar with Pell Grants, it's those scholarships for great students to get into college. The kids in our communities want to get those great college educations. There are Pell Grants and other types of financial incentives for kids to get into schools. 
   We recognize foreclosures are a big problem in many of our communities. My district in Fort Lauderdale has a huge number of foreclosures. It's not just the individual person who is foreclosed on; it's the neighbors who are impacted, and it's the depression on the value of homes, and it's the communities that are impacted and all of the things that go with it.     
   And we passed something that the Congresses in the past should have done in the last few years to prevent this from ever happening in the first place. We actually did some things now to help get people back on their feet and fix that. 
   But look what happened last week again. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, another multi billion dollar bailout. And why are they doing this? Well, they have to do it is what we're told. 
   But the bottom line is again, a legacy of very, very bad economic planning, very bad policies that this administration and previous Congresses were not able to do anything or had no will to do anything about. 
   The bottom line is, though, we are a resilient people as Americans. We have a resilient economy, and we will get beyond there. 
   So I'm all for the education part; I'm all for the job training part, our community colleges, our universities, our scholarships, the job training, the skill sets to get everybody back to work and the recognition that if we are going to do some economic stimulus thing, let's get our infrastructure, let's go out there in the community.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, I think it's really been an honor and privilege to be with my colleagues tonight. It's been an honor and privilege to serve as the freshman class, as Democrats and serving with our Republican colleagues as well. This is a great institution. Our country is a great country. 
   We've pointed out, as you said from the very beginning, where we're starting from. That's the reality. I mean, as decisionmakers, if you're in business or you run your household, you always have to know where you start from in order to make good decisions going forward. 
   And unfortunately, our next President and this next Congress and our country is going to be saddled for a little while with debt. And that's something we can start to dig our way out. And one thing that we did in this Congress, Democrats leading the charge here on our fiscal conservative policies is PAYGO. And that's a principle that everybody operates. You may not know what that means. PAYGO, pay as you go. It's the most simple principle. If you have a checkbook, you can't spend more money than what's in your checkbook. Or if you have a credit card, you can't spend more money than you can afford to pay back every month. 
   Well, why should Congress, in the last 6 years under the administration, operate under this principle of because we can print money, they just keep printing? 
   Well, fortunately last year a new principle is involved here. And now, when we pass a bill, unless it's an emergency, we have to make sure the money is in the budget. No, based on speculation that in the next number of months we're going to have all this new revenue in here. Things have slowed down a little bit, so we have to be realistic. That's exactly what the American people expect, and that's the kind of leadership we're delivering. 
   So I am pretty excited about the fiscal policies under this Congress, and we're beginning to get them where they should be. A new president with new policies, not tied to the old policies as we've been talking tonight will deliver on that on our health care, on Social Security, on Medicare, veterans' benefits will continue to be the highest priority and understanding that comes first. 
   Getting our foreign policy, which I serve on the committee, and many of you do, getting that re-established in a way that we earn the respect and work well with our partners around the world to really make sure that our national security is protected. And most importantly, get our economy, our American families in Ohio, in West Virginia and Wisconsin and Florida, in Seattle, everywhere, all over the country, that we will get them back in shape and give those Americans the opportunities that they've always had. And every generation, that principle of every generation having it a little better than the last generation. It's what my parents fought for. It's what my grandparents fought for and it's what we fight for our children. 
   So I thank our President, Madam Betty Sutton from Ohio, Peter Welch from Vermont, Mr. Perlmutter from the great State of Colorado, Dr. Kagen from Wisconsin, Mr. Murphy from Connecticut. It's just a small representation of a great group of people that really are working very hard to do the right thing by Americans and get our country back on track. 
   Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule for the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act of 2007, CHAMP. 
   I have been a strong supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance Program for many years, as many of our Members have. In Florida, we call it Healthy Kids; and it provides much-needed health care to hundreds of thousands of children who would otherwise not receive it. Democrats, Republicans, business and community leaders support this program because it empowers families to provide health insurance for their children. 
   The CHAMP Act also addresses another important problem with our health care system by providing a critical payment update for the doctors. In south Florida, we are currently facing a severe shortage of qualified physicians, in part because of the way physician payments under Medicare are calculated. 
   I applaud Chairman Dingell and the other drafters of the CHAMP Act for their immediate action to stave off the unreasonable cuts to physician payments. 
   I am concerned, however, with the way the CHAMP Act addresses the overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans. By scaling some payments back to traditional Medicare fee-for-service rates over the course of 4 years, seniors in my district may be at risk for losing some benefits. There may be some risk of losing some benefits, so I believe a more prudent proposal is to soften the impact of these changes to Medicare Advantage, and I look forward to working with the conferees to ensure that our elderly and vulnerable populations are supported by any changes to Medicare. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this rule and bill.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 6338, a bill to honor the life and legacy of Specialist Daniel J. Agami, who was killed in action on June 21, 2007, while serving his country in Iraq. 
   Daniel Agami was a devoted friend, a loving son and brother and courageous soldier. Growing up in South Florida, Daniel's parents raised him with strong Jewish values, and he was very proud of his Jewish heritage. To his friends, and he got quite a kick out of it, he was known as ``GI Jew.'' A little different. 
   Daniel knew he was meant to serve a greater purpose in life, and in 2005 his love for country and an unyielding drive to serve others led him to enlist in the United States Army. For his heroism in combat, Daniel was posthumously presented with multiple medals of honor, including the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. 
   During his service in the U.S. Army, Daniel worked with local schools, devastated from war and destruction, to refurbish their structures and mentor their students. 
   The communities he served in Iraq and here at home have suffered a tremendous loss. Daniel made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, and it is with great pride that I rise in support of this legislation to recognize his strong moral character and his work to make this world a better place. 
   It is my sincere hope that when the South Florida community utilizes the services of the post office in Coconut Creek, Florida, they will remember and honor Army Specialist Daniel Agami and his exceptional patriotism and courage. 
   I would like to also thank the members of the Florida congressional delegation for their strong support of this legislation. I would also like to recognize the Agami family: Parents, Beth and Itzhak; brother, Ilan and his wife, Elisha; sister, Shaina; and grandmother, Sandy Becker. The Agami family will be in Washington D.C. later this week where they will celebrate and honor Daniel's life and memory. 
   I urge passage of this piece of legislation.

   A nurse of 18 years, Adrianne showed amazing compassion and dedication to a Croatian patient who spoke no English and fell critically ill from cancer while working on a cruise ship. Adrianne, who speaks Croatian, made herself available as an interpreter and would even call the patient's family in Croatia from her personal cell phone to keep them up to date. 
   But Adrianne's support and overwhelming compassion for her patient did not end there. Concerned with his mounting bills, she contacted Croatian churches in New York and California, ultimately raising over $10,000 for his medical expenses. She even took a week off to accompany them back so she could explain his clinical ailments. 
   Adrianne's incredible kindness and dedication is the epitome of a ``Hospital Hero,'' and I am proud to honor her today on the floor of the United States Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to be here. I'm going to be joined by a number of the members of the freshmen class, and I appreciate the Speaker being one of our Members from Ohio. We have a great group of Members from all over the United States who were elected a year ago on certainly a campaign of change and bringing some new ideas, new energy. And energy is going to be the subject tonight because a lot of us have a lot of it. 
   I know Americans are looking for some new ideas on how to solve our problems with energy and how to move our country forward. And the reason it's important, particularly important today is because today this House Chamber took a bold, new step, and we passed the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008. And as I said, many freshmen, and many Members, Democrat and Republican, ran on a platform of change and new ideas. Energy is that idea. It's that platform. 
   And if you're old enough, you'll remember the Manhattan Project. I know I'm speaking to people who are listening in this Chamber tonight that are familiar with that Manhattan Project. It was that great ingenuity that Americans came together and knew what they had to do in order to win World War II. It was done in secret, but it produced the results that were necessary to save lives at the end of the day. 
   More recently, again a number of years but more recently, we had something called the Sputnik that Russia sent up, a little tin can that went up into space. And for those people who were alive at that time, they were frightened, rightfully so, that the Russians had gotten ahead of us and had put something in space that could potentially give the Russians the control, the Soviet Union control, of the space above our heads and maybe they would rain down on us weapons and have other kinds of threats against the United States. 
   And President John F. Kennedy, at that moment in time when Americans looked up and saw that can, that little flash in the sky, and realized that it wasn't the United States that put that up there but a country that at that time was viewed as in competition and the Cold War was just developing, what happened at that moment was John F. Kennedy said we are going to take this moment, capitalize on the concern, and channel that into a new program, a space program that was going to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. And, boy, that was something that was incredible. It was unheard of. Could we do it? I mean, the Moon is up there, and it would take a great amount of technology and science, and maybe it was a dream that our philosophers and other scientists years ago had, but to actually accomplish that in 10 years? 
   And lo and behold, in 1969, in July, I remember the moment. I was in a camp at that time, and I remember watching with my friends. In July of 1969, Americans put a man on the Moon and landed a man on the Moon. What an incredible accomplishment. And today we are still receiving the dividends from a space program that has just had so much impact not only on American ingenuity in terms of the space program and all the great things that have come out of that, but in consumer products, microwave ovens and a whole lot of other things that we take for granted today that came out of the science, and the math and the science and all the great things that went on in our schools to create the future leaders and the science program and the space program that has continued through today. 
   This is that moment. This is that time when Americans need to seize this crisis that has been developing for quite some time, and we need to do something about it. And there are three groups of people in the United States that are all coming together behind renewable energy and making sure that America becomes energy self-sufficient over the next number of years. 
   We have had many people in this country from the environmental community that for years have said that the pollution caused by various types of fossil fuels have clouded our air and damaged and polluted our waters, and it's not only in the United States but throughout the world. The environmental community has been very concerned about this and has tried to build bridges and coalitions, and they've really worked hard on that. And they are now joined by two other groups. 
   All Americans join in the notion that as a matter of national security, and I certainly believe this and I know the Speaker does too, and many of the men and women in this room and most Americans understand this, that for too long we in America have made foreign policy decisions based on where the next drop of oil is coming from. And what a mistake. What a mistake. We've done it over and over and over again, whether it's dealing with Iran in our past history, dealing with Iraq presently, dealing with Venezuela, or any number of other countries in the Middle East, some of whom at best, at best, may not be our friends and, at worst, are our enemies. And yet every time you go to the pump, you're putting money not necessarily in an American company, but you are putting money that is eventually getting into the pockets of some of the owners of these oil wells in these countries that are damaging our interests and in many cases are funneling to the terrorists and the people around the world that are really putting our men and women at risk, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere around the world. This is a very dangerous prospect and it's unacceptable. 
   The third group, of course, and I think this is one of the most exciting things, is the new economy that is developing out of this energy discussion. The job opportunities, the great innovators, the scientists, the American men and women at our universities, our business entrepreneurs that understand that not only is this good for America in terms of our environment and our national security but we could be very successful at it from a business point of view. We can create new technologies. We can do lots of things that create jobs, create revenue, create income, make our standard of living higher and greater. And we cannot only take that and build for America, this can be the next economic boom that exports our technology, our products, our sciences to other countries around the world. It's pretty exciting. 
   And I really believe very strongly that the great notions that have come out of today's bill recognize the fact that a few years ago when President Bush was inaugurated as President, oil was at $26 a barrel. Think about that. That's $26 a barrel. Today it's hovering around $100 a barrel. And I know that every American should say shame on all of us, not only as elected officials, but also as American consumers, shame on us for allowing that to happen. That's not just a political thing; that's literally our responsibility. We have our own responsibility to make a decision and make a difference here. 
   So what we have done today, and I am joined by other members of our freshmen class and others and we are all going to talk about this for a few minutes, is pass a bill that does what we were talking about. It puts the emphasis, it puts the incentives, economic  and otherwise, into the science, the technology of renewable energy sources, whether it's wave power, wind power, any combination of coal, nuclear. 
   And, yes, I hear from so many people that some of these have issues, technology issues, safety issues. And they may. And it's up to us to solve those. Let's think big. I'm not here to advocate for any one of these alternatives. I think all of them have possibilities, and we have to make sure that all of them have the necessary safety and necessary science that goes with them before we move in any direction. But this is the time for us to focus all of our energy, our attention, and our resources on making sure our country is energy independent. And today is the first step where we are going to do that. And I look forward to working with all of our colleagues in the Senate and hopefully get our President to go along with us because I know America is ready, willing, and able to accomplish this goal. 
   I am joined by a good friend, Congressman Ellison. Congressman Ellison has been a very outspoken person on the importance of energy independence, and I'm going to yield to him to give his thoughts on today's action.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Congressman, and I appreciate, I know you come from the Midwest and obviously dealing at this time of the year with the oil costs for people that have to heat their homes and to drive cars, this is a very serious issue. 
   As we take a look at some of these charts that we have here, we already talked about the fact back in January of 2001, it cost $1.47 for a tank of gas. Today, it is $3.13. Now the inflation rate hasn't gone at that pace. The inflation rate is starting to pick up now, but nothing like this. And I have to tell you something, where I live in south Florida, it is not $3.13. It is higher than that. It is $3.40.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Absolutely. And as a matter of fact, we had a discussion in our Financial Services Committee today. I am on the Financial Services Committee with you. And we heard Mr. Bernanke, who is the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is really trying to do the best that he can under difficult circumstances, and he talked about 6 months ago, we talked about the fact that we had a subprime mortgage crisis problem and a couple of other things, but that all the other indicators, inflation and cost of living were pretty okay. Well, guess what? Today, we see the things that really affect families. When we talk about families, we are not talking about Wall Street. We are talking about what it really costs to live day to day. Look through your checkbook, your monthly expenses. Your mortgage or your rent, the cost of utilities, all have gone up because oil prices have gone up. The cost of food, extraordinarily, inflation, big inflation costs of food, a gallon of milk, vegetables, fruits, cereals, all these kinds of things all have gone up. Gasoline now costs $50, $60 a tank, depending on what kind of car you have or how big the tank is. Do you know something? For people that are earning 20, 30, $40,000 a year, it is pretty hard to make ends meet. For people on minimum wage, it is even worse. So I think this is a real economic issue for people at this moment that we have to solve. And there will be short-term issues we put in this bill and some longer term issues we started out talking about today. 
   Let me just talk for a second, Congressman, about the bill itself and talk about what it does. First of all, it extends the tax credit for solar energy and qualified fuel cells. We start talking about some of these renewable energy ideas. I happen to be from Florida, so I'm a big fan of solar. But do you know something? The State of Washington, with all the rain that Seattle gets actually does more solar than other States and Florida does. Nationwide there are opportunities to do solar. Solar power has been around a long time. Many countries depend on solar. The State of Israel, the Middle East, a big portion of their electric grid is supported by solar power. Technology just has to make some changes in the battery capacity and storage and things like that. But these are all solvable problems when we put our minds to it. 
   Again, investment tax credits, using the Federal Government to stimulate market, which is exactly what we want to incentivize the science and business development. 
   We are authorizing over $2 billion of new, clean renewable energy bonds for public power providers and electric cooperatives, again encouraging through market, through incentives, our utilities, to start to convert over to clean, renewable energy products and fuels. 
   We create a new production tax credit for cellulitic alcohol produced for fuel in the United States. Now we all know about corn ethanol, corn-based ethanol. Brazil, the largest industrial country in South America, 190 million people, they are now energy independent. This is not an 8 million person country. This is a country that put its goal on the line about a generation ago and said we are going to do it, and a whole lot of different types, but they use sugar-based ethanol as one way of doing it. We extend the biodiesel production tax credit. We extend the tax credit for purchase of fuel-efficient plug-in hybrid vehicles. We extend the energy-efficient commercial buildings deduction. All these things are designed to create market. We don't have to have the Federal Government involved in all of this, other than to say create market. Federal buildings, let's make them energy independent. And by doing so, as taxpayers, we are getting a better cost for our utility, and we are also creating the products and  encouraging the development of products that are going to save money. 
   So these are the kinds of things that are in this bill. And there are a whole lot of other things we have already done. We have increased the CAFE standards, that is for fuel miles per gallon in automobiles, for the first time in 36 years. Imagine Congresses over the last 10, 20 years that haven't touched that. Technology has grown, but no commitment. So I am really proud that we have worked together in a bipartisan way to do this. 
   And President Bush has gone along. One thing President Bush has not gone along with, and I hope he does right now, is this notion of $15 billion or so of tax rebates or incentives to oil companies for more oil drilling. God bless the oil companies. They are doing just fine. As a matter of fact, I think there is a chart that we have here on oil company profits. This is not a question of bashing oil companies. We are all entrepreneurs. We are all capitalists. We understand what that means. But at the same time, a little fairness here, this is a chart that shows the major oil companies in the United States. In 2002, $30 billion of profit. In 2004, $109 billion of profit, 2 years later. In 2007, $123 billion of profit. That is a lot of profit. That is more money than any other company in the history of the United States has ever made. 
   Now I am not even going to knock that. But what I will say is the American taxpayer doesn't have to put $15 billion of additional taxpayer money on top of that. 
   And when you hear our friends on the other side of the aisle say, oh, well, if you take away the incentives that the Federal Government is giving them, all you are going to do is raise the price at the pump. Excuse me? Lots of profit here to generate more oil wells and things like that, and they will do that because it makes good economic sense, and let them do it. That is good. I just don't think we have to put some frosting on the cake. I would rather take our taxpayer money and put it toward development of energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Congressman, and I just want to touch on, if I can, because this freshman class of ours along with many others in the Congress were very frustrated, along with most Americans, about the way that Congress had been operating for the last number of years. The last 6 years before this past term, Congress was passing these bloated budgets, the President was signing them going deeper and deeper into deficit, and obviously there are a lot of very expensive things going on right now, but no lack of discipline in terms of control of our fiscal house. And I have kids, Congressman, you have kids, we all have children, grandchildren, parents whatever, why would we, as a country, want to continue to put ourselves farther and farther in debt? And that is the direction we have been going. 
   I am very proud to say that this Congress in the first week, we passed something called PAYGO. It's a simple principle, pay as you go. It is no different from when I had a business, if I couldn't meet my payroll, I made cuts. You can't spend more than you have coming in. Maybe you can borrow a little bit. But you have to pay your debt service. You can't keep on borrowing, and in the case of government, printing money. The good news is that this Congress is showing fiscal discipline for the first time in a long time. I am committed to it, I am a fiscal discipline person, a hawk if you will, and I know you are, as well, Congressman, and as we go through this process, this bill is fully paid for. And the rule that we have, PAYGO, is that no bill can pass unless it is fully paid for. So that means no speculation that the budget is going to grow by 3 percent next year and we will have the money next year, and money is going to appear out of nowhere. The money has to be in the budget. We have to make cuts somewhere else or prioritize something. And that is exactly what budgeting is all about. 
   I am proud not only as a Democrat but as an American, as a Member of this Congress, that is the direction we are going. It is going to take time to dig out of this hole, but it is a start. This particular piece of legislation is paid for. The way it has been paid for is in part taking the subsidy I mentioned a few minutes ago which is billions and billions of dollars and saying instead of just giving it to oil companies for more oil drilling, oil is always going to be a part of 
   our national energy policy. But it can't be the only. And just to give more money and flush it in that way, let's bring it in. And so we have taken money from one source and put it in what I believe and I think many of us believe is a higher priority of renewable energy sources and moving in that direction. 
   I will just share this with you real quickly because I thought it was quite unique. A lot of this stuff that we pass out of Washington is viewed in a partisan way, but there are different groups that have different positions on it and different opinions. I am going to read, this is a very long list, I will read just a handful of the supporters, the organizations that are supporting this energy legislation because I think it speaks volumes coming from different points in the country and how important it is.  
   We have the American Institute of Architects, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, the Audubon Society, DuPont, a big manufacturer; Friends of the Earth, an environmental group; Greenpeace, The Home Depot, Florida Power & Light, a big producer in my State of electricity; Macy's, Mitsubishi Electric and Electronics U.S.A., National Association of Home Builders, National Association of Industrial Office Properties, PG&E Corporation, Target Corporation, Wal-Mart, Yahoo. And I can go on. There are pages and pages of groups that are behind this, environmental all the way on one end or wherever you want to place them, to large industrial corporations, entrepreneurs, innovators, venture capitalists, scientists and universities on the other. That to me is the ideal position you want to be in. You want to have an ownership of an idea that we've taken into context all the various ideas and brought in a piece of legislation that is good for everyone. 
   It is not perfect. We are going to continue to build on this. But it is an excellent first step, Congressman.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, I agree with you. And if you think about the bills that we passed, this one and the other one, the other bill we passed, in addition to increasing the fuel efficiency for automobiles, which I think is long overdue, also creates changes in specifications of light bulbs, dishwashers, refrigerators, freezers. 
   These are products all of us have in our home. Many of them, they are inefficient. They may be older, or they may just not be efficient to start with. What we have done is, as the products are now going to come out of the market, they are going to have to have a greater efficiency standard for the amount of power that they use. 
   That is a very important thing, because now what we are seeing is with light bulbs or any other thing that uses electricity out there, that over time we are going to be able to save massive amounts of power, and the amount of power that we save directly goes into the amount of fuel and pollution and hydrocarbons and all of the rest of those things that are produced. 
   This is something that Americans are asking for. And as competition comes into play, more and more companies will be producing these, the prices will come down, the normal competitive forces work. 
   So the fact that if you hear about one company right now that manufactures a refrigerator that uses 30 percent less power but it costs you $1,000 more, well, you are not going to buy it. Some people may, but it is not going to have wide market appeal. But it will when you have 10 companies producing it, and they are all in there trying to make it better than the other companies. 
   This is just like any other product that comes to market. We know that happens with TVs, and even with the flat screen TVs. They are all coming down in price now, and DVDs and VCRs and all those kinds of things. It is the same concept. American people want products that are going to be efficient because they can save money in the long run. If you can pay for it over the next 3 years in savings, it is a wonderful thing. 
   But I think it is very exciting, because we are in there to promote the general idea of renewable energy. There is not one answer for all of this, but there are so many different parts of this country where there is lots of great research going on. 
   Right off the coast of Florida where I live is the Gulf Stream. You may be familiar with the Gulf Stream. It is a current that developed off the coast of the United States and goes all the way up north. 
   I am told by the scientists who are working on this right now that the power of the Gulf Stream, if harnessed with various types of turbines and things like that, and these turbines have to be generated and have to be environmentally friendly and all the rest and all of this is under development, that over time they believe that power can generate enough electricity to power half of Florida's power needs. Wow. I don't know if that is going to happen, but I like the idea that people are thinking and creating and innovating. 
   We have enough coal in the ground in the continental United States to power this country for decades to come, but there are problems with coal. Some of it is high sulfur and it creates pollution problems. But there may be technology that can be developed to scrub the coal. Again, there needs to be this emphasis to say, we are not just going to accept the fact that this is coal and that we are going to continue to pollute. We are going to be able to find a solution here. There are solutions to every problem. 
   As I said before, it is not only the United States, because we can do all that we want to do in terms of leading the world in dealing with these environmental issues and energy solutions, but there are other countries, China and so many other countries, that are huge power users and huge fossil fuel users, that if we can create something that is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, will create a better life for everybody, we are going to have a huge market to sell those products to. 
   So, I am just very excited, and you can probably hear it in my voice because I have been talking about this for many years, but I am so happy to be a part of Congress with our freshman class, Democrats and Republicans and Members who just have been hearing loud and clear from people back home, all over America, that they want change. And this is one of these areas that allows such opportunity for us to come together as a country, solve a  problem, create jobs, fix the environment, and do things that will increase our national security. 
   As we go forward with this, we have so many members of our caucus who have been interested in this. We are joined by another member of our freshman class, I like to call them freshmen, we are still freshmen, it is Congressman Hall from New York. Congressman Hall has a long history before he got to Congress of having a tremendous amount of interest in energy, and he has some personal experiences in work in his own community on energy issues. 
   I am glad you joined us for this discussion. We have been talking about the landmark bill that we passed today and what a great thing it is for America and how we are going to take many, many more steps forward. But please give us your thoughts, Congressman Hall.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, I hope that as we are all discussing this today, it's clear that the level of deep understanding of this issue from my colleagues here and many on the floor of the United States House of Representatives today really gives you the sense that we are moving in a direction that has been well thought out, it has been deliberated carefully.  
   As I said before, you have got a remarkable group of people from one end of our country to the other, the business community, the environmental community that have come to embrace this and break down this, it's either good for the environment and bad for the economy or, you know, bad for jobs and good for the environment. It's a fallacy. It's a false statement, it's a misstatement, and it's just the wrong way to approach it, but it has been that way for so many years. People seem to position it that way in the political environment. 
   As you very clearly made the case today, it's a win-win-win, good for the environment, good for our economy and people's lives and really solves a national security problem that we should have never been in but has now come to the point where we have to listen to OPEC. We have to listen to these countries that are deciding our future. 
   As I said previously in this Chamber, all it's going to take is one super tanker to go down the Strait of Hormuz in the Middle East and we will have a worldwide energy crisis. We can't allow that to happen. We cannot allow that to happen. We will not solve it overnight, we will have to take the necessary steps, but today through your efforts Mr. Hall and Mr. Ellison and so many people in the United States House of Representatives, so many Americans who came forward and said take these ideas and put them in legislation and collaborate together, work with Democrats and Republicans, people from all walks of life to come up with something that is innovative, exciting, forward thinking, progressive, this is what we have today. 
   I thank the gentleman from New York for great insight and great thought, because you are truly one of the architects of the great piece of legislation today. 
   Mr. Ellison, I know you were ready to add something to Mr. Hall's comments as well.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Congressman. Again, Minnesota is well served by great leadership there. You know, it's funny, as the gentleman was talking about our children, I look back and think when I was growing up, and you would drive down the road, and people would just, when they were done with a bag of food, they would just throw it out the window; a can of soda, throw it out the window; cigarettes, throw it out the window. On any side road, you just see garbage. 
   It wasn't until our kids started saying what are you doing, why are you doing this? Then the whole notion of recycling and how that became built in. But it wasn't from parents that came forward or grandparents. It was children. Learning in school, learning about their environment, learning about how important it was to preserve and to protect and clean up and not add to pollution and things that caused environmental problems. 
   Those are the things. Those are the changes. Seat belts, those are another example. Children were taught about it. We as adults, many people didn't do it. Obviously laws were passed later, but it was children. I remember my kids saying to my wife early on, you got in the car, where is your seat belt? Why don't you put your seat belt on? She obviously was not shamed into it but learned from our kids. 
   I think our generation today is a generation, as I started today's conversation, this is the calling of this generation, a calling of our young people to call upon our adults, our grandparents, everyone in America to say this is something that is so important to the United States on so many levels as we have been discussing, that we are going to have to do it. 
   It's the generation that's in school today, that's in college today that are young adults that are driving and realize that they have a lifetime to live. That lifetime needs to be on a planet that is clean, has fresh air, has fresh water and all the things that are important, and, at the same time, we can live in a country that produces high-quality jobs and creates all sorts of products and services that can be done. 
   Last week in West Palm Beach, I was in an office building that's a green building, a certified building. Now some people don't know what that is, and I am learning about this as we go, but this is a building that is designed from top to bottom. Its energy use, the whole construct of the building is such that it is really designed to save energy, to create a much more productive environment. So it's not just the energy side, but it's the whole environment, working and living and all those kinds of things. 
   It was fascinating, because a lot of people say, well, I am not going to go there. It costs a lot more. If you build it from the ground up, it doesn't cost that much more. There are a lot of savings to be generated out of these types of savings, savings of water in the plumbing, savings of water in the energy, the lights, the electricity, the heating, the ventilating and the air conditioning, all very important, lots of opportunity. 
   Market is being created. The support is there. These people are leasing up this building. Things are a little slower for it right now, but this gentleman who has speculated on this building, he is finding tenants because they are saying, you know something, it makes sense. It's good for my corporate image. It's good for my employees, my production. We're going to save money in the long run. Why not. 
   There are lots of ways to retrofit buildings, too, that I know the gentleman is very familiar with. So these are the kinds of things that I know are very 
   important to all of us that are created and encouraged in this bill and in other bills. Of course, as we move forward we are going to look for ideas from our constituents, our business people, our kids, our scientists and what other things we can do for our country, some through legislation, some just talking about it, moving it forward. 
   These are the things, and now we are joined by another Member who is so active, and I know his campaign was heavily involved in environmental and energy issues, the gentleman from California, the Golden State, Mr. McNerney. If you would please join us and give us your thoughts on today's legislation and how you feel about the issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would first like to start by commending Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairman Costello for their leadership in crafting this ambitious bill and taking some of the complex and critical challenges facing our aviation system to a successful conclusion. 
   Mr. Chairman, air travel in our country, unfortunately, has deteriorated in many ways to an alarming and unacceptable state over the past couple of years. According to a recent Reuters article in July, it confirmed that the 20 largest airlines are on pace for their worst year ever in delays, cancellations and congestion. Now, outgoing FAA Administrator Marion Blakey has warned that airport delays are likely to become worse, a distressing admonition from one of the country's foremost authorities on air travel. 
   Clearly, there is plenty of blame to go around. An aging infrastructure, outdated technology, unrealistic flight schedules, an overstretched workforce, along with poor weather, computer glitches, and inadequate space in between planes, have all been cited as contributing to the problems with air travel. With so many deficiencies stressing the system, it is no surprise that we have reached this point. 
   It is also no surprise that the American people are frustrated. We have all heard from our constituents, demanding that we do something with the inexcusable treatment they have received during their air travels. I have heard from one constituent who sat on the tarmac for 3 hours before her flight was cancelled and wasn't able to board another flight until the next day. I think we have all heard those examples. 
   Another constituent told me that his flight was canceled; and instead of rebooking, the airline made him fly standby. He had to wait 36 more hours before he finally got back. Still another had her bags missing for over 6 months. 
   Mr. Chairman, this treatment is unacceptable. The American people deserve better, whether they are traveling for business or leisure. They have paid their hard-earned money to fly on a plane, and they deserve to be treated with a certain level of respect. If they are not receiving that from the airlines, they should be able to turn to someone who can put pressure on the airlines to give them the respect they deserve. 
   That is where my amendment comes in. It would require the Department of Transportation to investigate, subject to appropriations, consumer complaints for a broad range of issues, including flight cancellations, overbooking of flights, baggage problems, ticket refund problems, and incorrect or incomplete fare information to help address the growing unrest among air travelers who receive unacceptable consumer service. 
   I have no intention of reinventing the wheel here, however. The Department of Transportation already operates a division that handles airline consumer complaints, with authority to issue warnings, cease and desist orders and fines. 
   However, because of a variety of reasons, including budgetary constraints, the Department has chosen to greatly limit the number of investigations it pursues, focusing mainly on discrimination and disability claims. Other  types of claims are simply logged and reported monthly, giving consumers with legitimate grievances no recourse or explanation for their treatment. 
   What I am proposing is a simple expansion of the division so that they have the authority and resources to investigate a wider range of legitimate consumer grievances. I think it is a fair and reasonable response to the overwhelming problems the American people have endured. 
   But if my colleagues are still not convinced, I would ask that they listen to the Department of Transportation's own Inspector General. In a report to Congress on April 20, he recommended that the Department ``take a more active role in airline customer service issues.'' This amendment would turn the Inspector General's recommendation into law. 
   Mr. Chairman, we stand here today prepared to pass a far-reaching and well-thought-out bill that addresses many of the critical infrastructure and technological shortcomings facing the airlines, airports and the FAA, as well as adding several critical safeguards for airline passengers. My amendment would add another layer of protection for customers that is practical and fair. I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House passed two pieces of legislation critical to consumer safety, both in my district in south Florida and of course throughout the United States. 
   The first bill, the Product Safety Modernization Act, bans dangerous chemicals in the manufacture of children's toys to keep them safe. The second bill, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, grants the FDA necessary authority to restrict tobacco marketing and sales to children. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the most important responsibilities as parents that we have is to keep our children safe. I'm proud that we passed these bills by a bipartisan majority to demonstrate that we will not allow our children to be exposed to toxic chemicals by unscrupulous toy manufacturers or cigarette company marketers. 
   The rash of product recalls in the last year prove that we must be vigilant when it comes to consumer safety. Thanks to this week's legislation, parents in south Florida and across the Nation can rest a little easier.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (CORAL REEF CONSERVATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Chairwoman BORDALLO, for yielding me time and Congressman Faleomavaega for bringing this important legislation to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, coral reefs are among the most diverse, biologically complex, and valuable ecosystems on Earth. In my home State of Florida, we are fortunate to have the third largest barrier reef in the world. Along with their natural beauty, Florida's coral reef systems serve as a critical place for fish habitat and as a potentially lifesaving barrier against hurricanes as well. 
   But it's only on an everyday level that coral reefs probably have the greatest impact on south Florida, serving as an important source of tourism, jobs and revenue. In Broward County alone, coral reefs contribute over $2 billion annually to the local economy. 
   However, coral reefs are in nothing short of a crisis. Because of a variety of threats, scientists estimate that 60 percent of coral reefs may disappear before 2050. 
   That's why I'm very proud to support all of my colleagues' efforts today to bring this legislation forward. H.R. 1205 will make important changes to the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. One will be able to take advantage of the vast resources and expertise at various coral reef conservation institutions across the country, like the National Coral Reef Institute. 
   The National Coral Reef Institute will be hosting the 11th International Coral Reef Symposium next year in Florida, which will bring together scientists from throughout the world, over 3,000 of those scientists, to discuss coral reef issues. Harnessing their experience and knowledge and other institutions' will be a vital component of any Federal coral reef conservation plan. 
   Another important aspect of this legislation we're considering today will be to authorize NOAA to respond to vessel groundings. Since 1994, we've seen 12 large ships run aground on sensitive coral reef areas near Ft. Lauderdale. The last one, occurring almost a year ago, involved a freighter that left a 20-foot swath of destruction along 100 feet of a coral reef. Whatever coral that once lived there is now, unfortunately, gone. 
   Part of the solution to vessel groundings is adopting better prevention strategies, such as closing anchorage sites in shallow waters that are close to coral reefs. And I'm very proud that the Coast Guard and others have worked to achieve this objective. 
   But we also need to respond faster when a vessel does run aground, because the sooner coral reefs can be restored, the better chances for their survival. Expanding NOAA's authority to act will allow NOAA to utilize their experience and resources to both assess the damage and restore the reefs. 
   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation. I thank the sponsors on both sides of the aisle, and recommend that we move forward.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the lead sponsor of H.R. 5464 to urge my colleagues to vote in support of the A Child is Missing Alert and Recovery Center Act. And before I begin, I would like to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff) and the gentleman from Ohio, as he supported the bill in committee as well; as well as Mr. Conyers of Michigan, the Chair of our Judiciary Committee; and the Chair of the Crime Subcommittee, Mr. Scott of Virginia, for their extraordinary leadership and support in moving this bill out of their committees and on to the floor. And also I would like to acknowledge and thank the ranking members, Mr. Smith and Mr. Gohmert. Mr. Gohmert was especially supportive during the hearing on the legislation in the Crime Subcommittee, and I would personally like to thank him for his remarks and support. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5464 would expand the widely praised A Child is Missing nonprofit organization into a national program with regional centers under the Department of Justice. The authorized funds would allow for the purchase of future technologies and techniques, centralized and on-site training, and for the distribution of information to Federal, State, and local law enforcement agency officials on the best ways to utilize the round-the-clock services provided by the A Child is Missing Alert and Recovery Center. 
   Currently, A Child is Missing is the only program of its kind that assists in all missing cases involving abduction, children who are lost, wander, or run away; and adults with special needs such as the elderly who suffer with Alzheimer's, which is a concern in my district in south Florida. 
   When a person is reported missing to the police, A Child is Missing utilizes the latest technology to place 1,000 emergency telephone calls every 60 seconds to residents and businesses in the area where the person was last seen. It works in concert with the existing AMBER Alert system and all other child safety programs and has the support of law enforcement agencies all across our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the State of Israel on its 60th birthday. Since its inception in 1948, Israel has shared with the United States and the people of the United States an unbreakable bond of democratic freedom and a hope for security and stability in the Middle East. Sixty years later, in a region where fostering democracy and human rights is a top priority, Israel has continued to be a strategic partner to the United States and a beacon of light throughout the world. 
   The United States and Israel are natural allies who share democratic governments' belief in the rule of law and a commitment to protect the human rights of all people. My home State of Florida has a particular special relationship with Israel, and I have made bolstering Florida's economic ties with Israel one of my top priorities when I was in the Florida legislature. I worked with others on legislation that opened the State of Florida's Trade Office in Israel, and in my last visit to Israel, I visited our sister city in Israel, Kiryat Bialik, in order to reinforce that bond. 
   It is with great pleasure that we celebrate today, and coming up, Israel's 60th anniversary, and I join the American people in congratulating Israel on its myriad of accomplishments and achievements. I hope that the next 60 years will bring peace, prosperity, and security to the State of Israel.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (HOMEOWNERS' DEFENSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to discuss H.R. 3355, the Homeowners' Defense Act. This bill responds to the growing crisis in the availability and affordability of homeowners insurance and further works to protect the financial solvency of States. This bipartisan legislation represents many months of deliberation and thoughtful input from members of both parties and across each region of the United States. We recognize that disasters will continue to occur across the country and are moving proactively to ensure that a plan is in place before the next one strikes. 
   Every region of the United States is susceptible to some form of natural disaster, be it earthquakes, hurricanes, blizzards, tornadoes, or wildfires, and we are here to provide relief. 
   It is important to understand that insurance availability and affordability problems have become a national issue. Hundreds of thousands of homeowners across the country have already had their insurance coverage dropped or are currently slated for nonrenewal by their insurance company. Those who remain insured are confronted with crippling premiums, which in some cases is forcing homeowners to make tough decisions about whether to go with or without property insurance, if they have that choice. 
   Insurance problems are not isolated to Florida, Mississippi, or Louisiana. Last year property insurers indicated that they plan to stop offering new coverage in Maryland and Virginia's  coastal markets, and property insurers have also stopped writing new policies for residents in Delaware, New Jersey, and Connecticut, no matter where in the State the property is located. 
   Furthermore, tens of thousands of homeowners in Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Texas have also been dropped as well. And adding to that, even with California's known record of seismic activity, over 84 percent of California homeowners currently do not have earthquake policies. It is simply unacceptable for property owners not to be able to get reliable coverage in these markets, and it is precisely this reason that legislation is necessary. 
   The Homeowners' Defense Act aims to take a twofold approach by establishing a program to help States responsibly manage their risk before disaster strikes while also providing financial assistance to ensure that they can quickly and efficiently respond to homeowners insurance claims following a natural disaster. 
   Specifically, this bill provides a venue for State-sponsored insurance funds to voluntarily bundle their catastrophic risk with one another and then transfer that risk to the private markets through the use of catastrophic bonds and reinsurance contracts. The legislation also allows for the Federal Government to extend loans to cash-strapped States after a large-scale natural disaster so that they can meet their obligations to homeowners. 
   By utilizing new strategies and an innovative capital market approach, the bill allows investors to assume some of the risk currently held by the States in return for an interest payment. The voluntary nature of the program, coupled with the use of the capital markets, ensures that homeowners in less disaster-prone States will not be on the hook if a disaster strikes a neighboring State. 
   I want to emphasize that the opt-in nature of this plan creates no burden or obligation whatsoever on States that do not choose to participate. This is essential. 
   The total economic impact accompanying natural disasters resonates throughout our entire Nation. The total economic damages from the 2005 hurricanes will likely exceed $200 billion, with the Federal Government taking responsibility for paying out in excess of $109 billion for disaster relief.     
   Although we all agree that it is necessary, this Federal spending is drawn equally from taxpayers across the country, not simply from those in affected regions. 
   Through this legislation, we are looking to take a proactive approach where States responsibly plan in advance of a disaster, rather than a reactive approach, where the Federal Government and every taxpayer opens up the Treasury after a catastrophe. It is important to emphasize, however, that the status quo is no longer an option. We must work together to establish a system to make sure that property insurance is both available and affordable for hardworking families and those most in need. 
   I urge Members to vote in favor of this much-needed legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would also like to acknowledge Chairman Barney Frank, who, without his guidance and leadership and thoughtfulness and process of good ideas, we wouldn't be here today, as well as Tom Glassic, Kathleen Mellody, Lawranne Stewart, Peter Roberson, Patrick Givens from Congressman Mahoney's office, and Garrett Donovan from my office, and all the staff and experts from around the country who have participated in this very carefully thought out piece of innovative legislation. 
   We are very honored to be here today, because the bill that we have before us is a comprehensive step in the right direction. As a Member of Congress from south Florida, I have lived under the threat of natural disasters for some time. It was only when I came to Washington, however, that I began to discuss this issue with Members from other parts of country who also shared stories about disasters that their constituents faced, earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes. It was then that I began to realize that this is not a regional problem; it is a national one. 
   I further reflected on the fact that the Federal response following a major disaster is very predictable. We open up the Treasury and start spending. This spending is entirely necessary, but often is delivered with only few restraints and comes equally from taxpayers in every corner of our country. So even if you are not in a high-risk region, you are still impacted by the event. 
   Under this bill, participating States would be better protected, again, States that only opt in on their own if they choose; and they would be increasingly able to provide services for those who are not able to find insurance on their own. The State-Federal partnership would present States with the tools necessary to responsibly, fiscally responsibly, manage their risk before disaster strikes, while also ensuring that States can quickly and efficiently respond to homeowners' insurance claims following a natural catastrophe.     
   This legislation employs several new ideas to help States address the property insurance crisis, such as the transfer of States' insurance risk through the use of catastrophe bonds. By utilizing an innovative capital market approach, the bill allows investors to assume some of the risk, while at the same time putting the burden on local homeowners to do all the necessary mitigation responsibility they have to reduce risk to their own home, to the State, and to the Federal Government. 
   This is a fundamental rethinking of disaster planning and response, and it is long overdue. Our bill works because it's voluntary, actuarially sound, and stabilizes the market by ensuring that homeowners will always get their claim paid while capping the State liability. 
   In addition, our bill is fiscally responsible. The Homeowners' Defense Act will end the policy of Federal bailouts following natural disasters. 
   The steps taken in this bill provide us with a blueprint of how States can responsibly plan for catastrophes ahead while also providing them with a path to recovery. 
   As I have said time and time again, the status quo is no longer an option. I urge Members of this body to vote ``yes'' on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, the amendment before us is testament to the fact that this legislation is truly a work of bipartisanship. Democrats and Republicans came together as this legislation began to work its way through the process. A number of interested Members reached out to us with well-thought suggestions on how to improve the underlying bill. I am pleased to say we were able to incorporate many suggestions into this amendment, including the adoption of a provision that the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite) has been developing over the last couple of years. 
   This amendment would establish a high-level natural catastrophe reinsurance fund which would be authorized to write reinsurance contracts to cover catastrophic natural disasters. The addition of such a fund would add a third layer of protection to the legislation, which could further help to increase availability and stabilize rates for homeowners. The fund would provide reinsurance contracts for coverage that is available after the qualified reinsurance program has sustained losses resulting from a 1-in-200-year event. 
   Coverage would be provided on an actuarially sound basis and would not displace or compete with the private market. This provision will go a long way with providing high-level protection for States coping with natural disasters. 
   The amendment also provides for a study and conditional authorization for the inclusion of commercial residential lines of coverage. It is important for us to make sure that renters are not left behind following a disaster, and this  provision takes us in the right step of determining how capacity restrictions impact housing affordability for renters. I know this was a concern brought up, and I am glad to include it in this amendment. 
   I am also pleased that we were able to include a provision suggested by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Putnam) which ensures that qualified reinsurance programs will engage in responsible reserving. This provision would use an NAIC-developed formula to ensure that participating States will be operating in a sound fashion. 
   We also wanted to make sure that States would not become overly reliant on programs established under the legislation, and this addition will add a safeguard against that concern. 
   Again, I would like to thank those Members who have come forward with suggestions on how to improve the bill. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman from Illinois. And just to respond to a couple of points there, the building up of reserves and the passing of savings to consumers are not necessarily inconsistent points. One of the goals of this bill is not to make more money for insurance companies, many of them are doing just fine, it is to try to create stability in the market at an actuarially sound rate. I take your points, and they are well taken in terms of making sure we learn from mistakes. I commit to the fact that we will continue to work through this and make sure that it is based on sound actuarial principles by which definition usually sound actuarial estimations do take into account future anticipated events. I commit to that point.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman from Illinois. The notion of the terms of repayment are to be negotiated with the Treasury. Each State may have a slightly different scenario in terms of terms and conditions. 
   What I would expect to be negotiated would be, just like any other private sector contract with a set of covenants and defaults in terms of understanding what the expectations are. So I would expect the Treasury, and if we need to get that clarified in the future, I would be happy to, but I expect the terms to be very clear regarding notification and things like that.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman from Illinois. 
   I think the thinking is this is an authorization. It is not an appropriation.  The general notion is in the early stage of this thing, it is a relatively small amount of dollars. It creates authorization if necessary. 
   If you have a number of States that do participate, which we anticipate, I think the language of the bill talks about the fact that they will pay for that. The notion is there is an authorization. And to get more States involved to pay for it, there is this limited amount of Federal responsibility. I think the thinking is that the States will take responsibility.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to my friend, and all of us are freshmen here, Mr. Mahoney and Mr. Roskam, we're all new to this process, but with all due respect to his approach here, the problem with the amendment is that this takes the Federal Government and puts its stamp of approval on local building codes. 
   And from my perspective, I don't think we want the U.S. Treasury or FEMA or anybody else to be responsible for making decisions on local building codes. These are very localized functions, certainly will encourage mitigation, and we've got some standards in place and our colleague from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy) in a few minutes I understand is going to be offering a very good amendment which deals with some Federal standards that are outside the Federal Government's role, but some trade industry standards on building code which relate to mitigation and reducing the hazard and reducing the potential exposure. 
   So while I do appreciate the fact that Illinois may have different issues than Iowa, that has different issues than California, there's different issues in Florida, we certainly, in my view, don't want to federalize, if you will, the building code process. And it's something that I believe that we should allow local governments, within the confines of standards that are adopted by the industry, to reduce exposure to natural disasters. I think that's a better way to do it. 
   So I would suggest that this amendment be opposed and that the Members of the House vote against it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I would like to thank the gentleman from Connecticut for coming up to a response to what I think the gentleman from Illinois was raising; that is, we want to encourage mitigation. We want to encourage reduction of the scope of the hazard. 
   I think all of us understand that the more you can do to protect your home in terms of the roof, if it's an earthquake zone, the foundation, lots of different kinds of risks out there, but the more we can do to solidify that, the less deductible you are going to pay as a homeowner, which is good for you as a homeowner, the less risk you are creating for the insurance underwriter, the less payout, the less the State is going to have to take responsibility if there is a State risk catastrophe fund. With a Federal system to back it up, beyond that, in terms of the State catastrophe bonds, it reduces that as well. 
   The whole purpose of this is to reduce that. What the gentleman from Connecticut has come up with in a broad-based way is to bring in the international code, council building codes, which is an organized effort, well thought out, well designed. Instead of having the secretary of the Treasury, which I am not quite sure who or what qualifications he or she would have to make an independent judgment of whether a building code makes sense or not, let's put professionals, the experts, the people who understand building codes, let's put them in the middle of this thing and say this is the standard by which we will judge whether a State is doing what it is supposed to do to reduce that risk. 
   I think that's a very sound, logical way of solving the problem, encouraging the mitigation, reducing the hazard. I think it's something that deserves to be supported. 
   I would like to thank the gentleman from Connecticut. Hopefully the gentlewoman from West Virginia and the gentleman from Illinois will join us in what I think is something that addresses their concern, and probably we can all come together and say this is a solid way of doing it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, let's get down to the bottom of what we are trying to accomplish here. There is a problem in the United States, in certain parts of the United States, where the insurance market, unfortunately, cannot deal with a very large disaster. 
   Now, some of our colleagues may not have been exposed to this problem because in their markets they haven't had any large-scale natural disasters, but the more time that passes, the more communities are affected by large-scale natural disasters. 
   The impact of a very large-scale natural disaster is that the insurance industry in these areas retrenches, pulls back, cancels policies or they call them nonrenewal. 
   I have to tell you, one of the most frustrating things after living through some hurricanes in Florida was members of my communities calling me up, as a State Senator, saying, I paid my premium for 15 years straight, and now I am afraid to make a claim because I have had some damage, never made a claim before, but I am afraid to make a claim because the insurance company is going to cancel me. 
   Something is wrong with the market, free market, as we like to think of it, if that is happening. People want to know the bargain is if I have paid my premium my insurance company is going be there and there is some stability behind it. 
   What we have tried to do is recognize that in some cases, not many, but in some cases, and the very high scale of large-scale natural disasters, there is some reaction that has to be provided. What we have done, instead of putting the government in the middle of it, which is exactly where it is right night now, no matter how you slice it, every time there is a large-scale natural disaster that the insurance company can't  deal with, the States can't deal with, then the Federal Government comes rushing in, from Washington, with a big check. 
   What we have been trying to do is something proactive, up front. We have come up with some plans from experts in the insurance industry and the consumer side and everything else to balance this out. 
   What this amendment does is it arbitrarily limits the ability of programs to meet the reinsurance needs of the respective States not provided for by the private sector. The limit shows, and it is a 100-year event. Why 100? Why 1 in 100? Why not 1 in 50? Why not 1 in 250? As you can imagine, a 1-in-250-year event really changes the dynamics of the equation of what will have to be paid in reserves and make sure that the money is there. 
   They have chosen 100 years. That is consistent with the way we have very carefully, with a lot of input, chosen to work on this formula. We have chosen events where the losses have exceeded 150 percent of the aggregate amount of direct premium over the prior year.     
   That is a direct reflection of what's going on in that local market, how much premium's been paid. It's a 1.5 factor over and above that. It's very well thought out. It may not be perfect. It may be over time there's a better way to do it, but this is a very consistent approach we've taken throughout the bill. 
   If you adopt this amendment, we are now creating two inconsistent measures which I don't think will ever work together. So I would suggest that this amendment not be adopted. 
   I believe that we have come up with something that is logical, it's common sense, it reacts to the fact that there is a need here. 
   And again, for those folks who live in parts of the country that don't have natural disasters up to this point, let's all continue to pray and hope that we don't have many natural disasters. 
   But we're a country that's in this together. Certainly our insurance is something that we want to make sure everyone has the ability to have private homeowners insurance. But more importantly, every taxpayer is part of a bail out. We're trying to avoid that for the future. 
   So I would suggest the amendment should not be supported. 
   I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Illinois' proposition that if you are in default, you probably shouldn't be able to get anything further because maybe you haven't acted responsibly. But there are two faults that make this amendment unnecessary. 
   Number one, if a State is a recipient of a loan and it has defaulted or hasn't made the terms of payback, that has nothing to do with a State risk catastrophe fund, which is independent of the State. Most State risk catastrophe funds are not backed by the full faith and credit of the State. They're separate, independent organizations. So one has really nothing to do with the other. The fact that the State of Illinois may not have paid back something that it had received from the Federal Government should have nothing to do with an Illinois risk catastrophe fund if it has been doing whatever it's supposed to do. So I think that's number one. 
   Number two, the notion of the one disaster and then the Illinois risk catastrophe fund defaulting or not paying back, we have already taken care of that problem in terms of a future disaster that hits Chicago. And that is the Treasury who would be responsible for authorizing the second loan would not grant that. It is already provided in the content of our bill. 
   So I do support the proposition that if you are in default, you probably shouldn't be a continued further drag. And I think that we have taken care of that in the bill, and I think it's not necessary to pass this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I don't agree with the amendment because what it does is it creates an unnecessary regulatory burden. You already have in place the Treasury. Our Treasury Department in Washington would look at it. There's a default. Under the current language of the bill. Take a look at the language of the bill. It specifically says they would not be entitled to another loan, so we've already taken care of that problem. 
   As it relates to the State itself being in default, the State is independent of a State risk catastrophe fund. So the fact that the State of Illinois doesn't repay something to the Federal Government doesn't necessarily or should not necessarily put a burden on an independent organization that has a State risk catastrophe fund that does not operate under the full faith and credit of the State of Illinois. 
   So, again, I support the notion that a deadbeat should not receive more. But, again, we are dealing with States and organizations where we've already taken care of the problem or that we are looking to solve a problem that really isn't there. 
   So I would suggest that this amendment should be opposed. It's unnecessary and duplicative, and I think we've already addressed the problem very clearly in the legislation.

And the point I was trying to make, which I think is pretty clear here, is that it says ``under any loan previously made under this Act or any loan provided by any agency or establishment of the Federal Government to the program,'' that's the risk catastrophe fund, ``or the State for assistance in connection with a natural or other major disaster.'' 
   First of all, a question for you is the money that goes to a State, are you talking about FEMA money?

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. The way this is designed is that the loans are structured between the risk catastrophe fund and the Treasury under terms and conditions that are acceptable to the  Treasury. Now, if there is a default under those terms and conditions, it's already clear in our bill that the Treasury will not lend under any future natural disaster, if that's what you are concerned about, and I think it says here. It's already part of the bill, and I think that answers the question.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. The good news is that we are in agreement that we certainly want to make sure this is fiscally sound and responsible. I think we all agree on that. 
   The only thing I'm suggesting, as we pull up this language, is that it's already in the bill. The intention is that the Treasury have this authority. If it isn't clear, we would be glad to fix it. But I think it is crystal clear and we'll just pull it up.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I want to thank the gentleman from Utah for an excellent amendment which really adds some good value to the bill. And basically what it does is it creates a metric by which States can determine whether joining the consortium in the future would provide a benefit. It's information. The more information the States have, the better, the more consumers will benefit. I think that's the kind of ongoing accountability, both to the taxpayers and to the States themselves, in terms of whether this is something that a particular State should join. 
   So I appreciate the suggestion. We didn't think of it. It's another good example of us all coming together and trying to put something together that makes some sense. So I would like to support the amendment, and I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by  the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to thank the gentlelady from Florida on this work on price-gouging. She and I served in the legislature in Florida and worked together with many others on price-gouging legislation. I don't think anybody can condone any kind of price-gouging in a natural disaster or at any other time, but certainly in a time of a natural disaster. 
   What the amendment to the amendment does is it provides some flexible language in the implementation of this. It certainly is something that we want to encourage States to move forward on as part of their eligibility, but recognizing we also want to make sure we're not creating impediments in terms of many States getting involved in the natural disaster consortium as quickly as possible. 
   So I am in full support of this flexibility language, and that's exactly what the amendment does.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, what has just been expressed by our colleagues from around the country is that this is a time for action on an issue that is well overdue. There have been many parts of the country that have been hit by this insurance problem for a long time. But I can tell you that whether you are in the State legislature, like I was in the past, or in the Congress, or in any local government, or even a lot of businesses, a lot of times when you want to study something and you want to put it on the shelf and collect dust, it is not going anywhere. This particular provision, this particular idea sounds nice. It says, oh, we are going to study this and we're going to study that and have qualified people come together. Well, do you know something? That is what we have been doing. We have been bringing together qualified people. 
   We have spent a lot of time, bipartisan, a lot of experts in the field, consumer groups and experts on Wall Street and people in the industry to really figure out what is the right way to do this. Is this perfect? I don't know. But we have certainly tried to do what we think is common sense and we are moving in the right direction. 
   The notion of studying it and coming back, and this particular provision says coming back on June 1 of 2008 with a report which will then be presented to the Financial Services Committee, which will then hold hearings and more hearings and more hearings, and then it will end up in the Senate, we are talking about 2015 before they even bring a bill up. 
   Well, we have something here today that is a bill. It is an idea, a set of ideas that have been developed, and we are ready to move on it. And the people back home are ready for us to move it. They want action. They want relief from their insurance bills. They want to know as taxpayers there is a better way of doing this than the Federal Government writing a check every time. That is what this bill does. 
   So with all due respect to those folks who say, let's study it more, it hasn't been studied enough, yes, it has. It has been studied enough. And we will continue to study it when it goes over to the Senate. But we are looking to make a bill, finalize a bill here in the House today. Let the Senate take it up over the next couple of months and let's get some relief to the homeowners of the United States when it comes to their homeowners insurance. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the gentleman from California. Although we are from different parts of the country and sort of the extreme points of the country, we share, along with many people in other quarters of the country, the same problem; and it is a problem with dealing with these large-scale natural disasters which are difficult to predict and, at the higher end, difficult to insure. Whether it is mud slides or wildfires or earthquakes or tornadoes or major floods or hurricanes or blizzards or any number of other things which cause very large-scale damage, we need to find a way to come together and resolve this, which is what, of course, this plan is trying to do. 
   What the gentleman has proposed, and is something I think we should all recognize, is the fact that earthquakes don't distinguish between a house and an office building, or a house and an apartment building, or any other number of commercial or private structures. I think the notion here of trying to, again, pool interests is something that deserves a lot of attention. 
   I would like to pose a notion to the gentleman. I know the Chair of Financial Services has mentioned that he would like to hold a hearing, because as we developed this, we were pretty close to certain this would work with the residential property community, and even put something in the bill at the gentleman's request about the multi-family properties as well, because I think that is a big issue. 
   As it relates to the broader issue, I think we want to continue to investigate this, to understand from the Congressional Budget Office's point of view, making sure that, as this does meet PAYGO, we want to make sure this continues to meet PAYGO; and I think if we were to adopt this amendment, I think there would be some question about that. 
   If the gentleman would respond as to whether he would withdraw the amendment now, with the commitment, I think from chairman of the Financial Services Committee, to, number one, hold a hearing and bring all the necessary information together and continue to work on this, whether it is in this piece of legislation as it moves to the Senate, or we all work together on another piece of legislation to deal with the same issue.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, good evening. It is a pleasure to be here tonight on behalf of the freshman class. It certainly has been an honor to serve here this last year, and to be joined by Mr. Hall of New York, and a number of other Members who are going to join us tonight. 
   What we are going to talk about tonight is something that I think is weighing very heavily on the minds of Americans right now, and that is the economy. We understand because the United States is the most resilient, optimistic, innovative country in the world, that we will persevere and we will work out the issues that have caused some of the problems in our economy right now. 
   But that being said, as we speak today, there are people all over the United States who are hurting. They are hurting because their jobs may be threatened or they have lost their jobs or lost confidence that their job may be here in the next weeks and months. They are hurting because their home may be threatened from foreclosure or difficult terms. They may be hurting because gas prices have shot up. If we think about what the cost of oil was not that long ago, literally back in 2002, it was $28 per barrel. And we know as of today, it hit $114 per barrel. Shame on all of us for allowing that to be the case today and for having this dependence on oil. We have leadership in this House that is working on that. 
   Americans may be hurting because their health care is a threat, preexisting conditions, things that are not covered by their policies, and the cost of insurance is just beyond their means. 
   There are a lot of things that people are thinking about that are weighing them down. At the same time, we have a war in Iraq and in Afghanistan. And a fight that we, as Americans, obviously understand that when America is challenged, we will fight back. But I think there is also a broad recognition that the war we are in, at least in Iraq right now, we may have gotten into for some of the wrong reasons, and without justification. 
   With that being said, I want to thank the men and women who serve this country and put their lives on the line every single day in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world. And their families that are back home, persevering and doing the necessary things to carry on while their loved ones are gone. I know this Congress has taken upon itself to be certain and put all of the dollars on the table that have been promised in the past but not delivered, to make sure that every man and woman when they come home from service in the armed services, that they are given all the medical services, mental health services, physical health services, and a lifetime of care if necessary. We are committed to doing that as Congress. 
   But the question today is what should we be doing about Iraq, and how does this interplay with the economy. That is the subject of what we are going to talk about tonight. Are there things that we should be doing to help us as Americans, help us in our daily lives in the United States, help us make sure that we have the future, a better future, as our parents wished for us, that my children who are in college right now, that they will have a better opportunity than I did. That is something that is the American dream, and it has been around for generations. And yet people today are questioning if that is where we are going. 
   We have to say what do we have to do to make sure that Americans come first and also protect our national security and evaluate this foreign policy, this fight in Iraq and other places, yes, is it in fact making us safer at home and on our streets. Or is it a disastrous situation that has cost us $600 billion up to this point, over 4,000 lives of our brave men and women, and 30,000 to 40,000 brave men and women who have come back with severe injuries and will require lifetime care. 
   We are going to talk about those issues, engage each other on the floor, and we are going to continue to invite the American people to work with us and come up with some good solutions. 
   I am joined by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hall) who has been a strong leader and very focused on the fact that our security is important, but our economy is equally important, and I turn the floor over to Mr. Hall.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Hall. And again, exceptionally well-stated. I think we all understand the costs of war. I think we all understand, as Americans, there are going to be times, historically, when we have to be prepared to fight and to make the necessary commitments. 
   There are also times when we recognize that, you know, we have to look and say, is this the right thing? Is it really achieving our national security interests? 
   I think we've heard over and over again, and I'm on the Foreign Affairs Committee. I know many of you are on the Armed Services Committee, we've heard about the fact that we have, the real problem, the terrorist threat is in Afghanistan or Pakistan or Iran. And unfortunately, the strategy that continues in Iraq is one that puts all of our resources and assets and our men and women in one location where al Qaeda was not a problem initially. There may be some al Qaeda there, but we don't have to deal with them necessarily with a 160,000 troop contingent. 
   I'd like to now just bring into our conversation another esteemed member of our freshman class, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley).

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman from Iowa for explaining, not only the aggregate cost, but certainly what's happening in Iowa. I know one of our colleagues in our freshman class, Mr. Space from Ohio, he has explained to us the impact in his district in rural parts of Ohio and how important it is for him to help the local people get beyond this. 
   I'm going to explain it a slightly different way, because, again, I think it's the tangible side of this thing that people need to understand. The cost per day that we are currently spending, and this is independent information; there's no question that this is accurate. It comes from the Library of Congress Research Service. 
   The cost per day that the war is costing us, if you will, $339 million per day. That is a staggering amount of money. 
   Now, again, I'm not here to say that we don't have to fight wars, or don't have to do the necessary things to protect Americans. But when we come to the conclusion, as most Americans have, that the strategy of keeping the men and women in place the way they are is not advancing our national security, we should question whether that money is being well-spent. 
   But I've introduced something today in the House, which I'm going to begin to talk about more actively, and I'm sure the gentlemen here tonight will chime in on this as well, and that is, whether people support the war or not, and I know there's differences of opinion on this, I think every American understands that at $339 million per day, it's about time that the Iraqi government step up and pay its fair share. 
   And whether we're talking about the cost of fuel for our operations over there, whether we're talking about the cost of rebuilding, whether we're talking about the training of their military, after five full years and $600 billion, now coming out to $339 million more every single day, for all the reasons that Mr. Braley has already mentioned about the savings and what could be applied in the United States, or maybe dealing with reducing the deficit or dealing with taxes, any number of different strategies to make life better for Americans, it's about time the Iraqi people step up, and if they want us there, the government, pay their fair share. 
   And I'll just throw out a few facts as to why I believe this is so important. First of all, our President, Mr. Rumsfeld and others, when the war was presented to us in the first place, they told us that this was a war and a rebuilding effort that was going to be paid for by Iraqi oil money. 
   Iraq sits on the second largest quantity, second largest quantity of oil reserves in the world. They've got tens of billions of dollars in bank accounts, as we speak, that are not being applied toward the rebuilding effort. That is unacceptable. 
   As an American, as a taxpayer, I hope every American understands this and joins us. This is not a Democrat issue. This is not a Republican issue. This is an American taxpayer issue that we need to all band together and say, you know, whether or not you're for the war or not, absolutely, every American should say, enough is enough. We've paid our fair share. We've put our men and women on the line, and it's time for the Iraqis to pay for the cost of this continuing effort to the extent it continues into the future. 
   So I've offered House Resolution 1111, which was filed today, and I'm looking forward to discussing this with many of the Members. I've already spoken to a number of Members, and they're very interested. It's being offered in a bipartisan way in the Senate, and I think this has the opportunity of finding some common ground in changing the dynamics of who's paying for this, the American people or the Iraqi government, who wants us, for whatever reason, to continue this effort in this way. 
   And I would suggest to you, and rightfully so, that 1 day of the war could provide for 48,000 homeless vets to have a roof over their head, men and women who served in Vietnam and other wars. 
   2,000 new Border Patrol guards. And Mr. Hall just told us, and Mr. Braley, about how they were down on the border and saw what's going on. We have border patrol needs. And just again, just 1 day, 2000 more Border Patrol guards for a year. 
   We talked about health care. We can go on and on and on. But the bottom line is, it's time for a change. It's time for a change with the policy, it's time to re-look at this whole effort. But certainly, at a minimum, it's time for the Iraqi government to pay for the cost of this operation. 
   Mr. Hall, I know that you've got some thoughts on this as well, so please join us in this conversation.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. And these are certainly the questions that our country is wrestling with right now, and as I turn it back over to Mr. Braley, I will just mention again that on the economy side of this thing, and I think about the people back home and what they're thinking about as they're looking towards the next election and just thinking about the next week's expenses. And one statistic jumped out at me when I was hearing about gas prices. Gas prices in the United States are about $3.39 per gallon, extraordinary, at a time when the oil companies are still going to be making historic profits. 
   The United States military is paying $3.23 a gallon in Iraq. That's $153 million per month. At the same time, Iraqis, when they can get gas, are paying $1.30 per gallon of gas. What is wrong with this picture? Our military is paying $3.23 to buy gas in Iraq on our dime, and Iraqis are getting it at $1.30. 
   So again, it's this question of as Americans, and being the great people that we are and trying to do what we can to help here and there, what can we do differently to help protect Americans deal with their daily lives and, at the same time, protect our country?

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman, and being from Iowa, and obviously one of our farm States, you have a direct understanding of what the cost of food production is and for farmers, the cost of fuel and the cost that is just driving the inflation numbers in the United States. And most Americans aren't even aware of the fact that when you hear this inflation discussion that energy prices, that's gas prices at the pump, and food prices, are not even part of that discussion. That's not factored into these inflation numbers. It's everything else. 
   And the story we're given is, well, those fluctuate too much. That's not a reliable factor. Well, you know something? That's the bottom line. When people go to the grocery store every week, I know back in my town, and they see a dozen eggs cost this and all of a sudden they're up 80 cents for a dozen eggs or a gallon of milk or bread or vegetables, no matter what it is,  there is a huge inflationary factor tied into the cost of food at a time when wages are not keeping up. So people are feeling stretched and pushed and stressed. 
   So it is important for us to focus on this, and again, I appreciate the gentleman's comments on our House resolution because I think it is going to be something that all of us, and everybody has been talking about this; this is certainly not my idea. I think we can all work together in changing the direction of how this is going to play out. 
   And yes, it will probably be a new President before there may be some major changes in the military strategy, and I would hope and I know I have heard a lot of good generals talk about some of the different ideas that they have on changing that. But at a minimum, I think most Americans would say that wow, I thought they were already paying for it, and if they're not, they should be. And that's something that I hope that we can find common ground. That's what Americans elected us for, not to be Democrats or Republicans, but to come together as Americans and say how do we solve this problem, just like we started the discussion tonight. 
   Mr. Hall maybe can share with us some of the economy and the economic issues that you're hearing from your neighbors and friends and how we can try to address some of these.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, I would certainly pick up on that because one of the first things that this Congress did, with our freshman class encouraging the way, was to say that we were going to change the way Congress paid for and spent the American taxpayers' money, and we adopted something called ``PAYGO,'' pay-as-you-go budgeting. In other words, we can't pass a bill without it having been paid for in the budget. You've got to find the money somewhere in the budget; you can't say, well, maybe we'll have more money next year. That's just the way everybody runs their business back home, that's just the way everybody runs their personal checkbook. I know that my wife and I operate that way, and I'm sure everybody else on the floor here does the same thing. You just can't keep spending without having the money to pay it back. 
   And the reality is that, if you think about that, if you think about that responsible budgeting and the fact that we're spending--the number I keep throwing out--$339 million per day, think about the opportunity of investing in new energy alternatives. And you hear, well, maybe with some of the types of energy alternatives, the renewable energies, they're not ready for prime time yet; there are pollution problems with this type or some type of hazard. I'm from Florida; we should be leading the world in solar power, but there is a battery storage capacity issue. Is there an answer? You bet there's an answer. It requires our scientists, our business entrepreneurs to sit down and figure it out. And with the kind of money that would be available to challenge our scientists, our business entrepreneurs to develop solar, wind, wave, any number of various alternatives, to make us energy independent and then get rid of this oil import of 60 percent of our oil from the Middle East and Venezuela every day, which I think every American understands is a national security problem and all the other things that go along with that, we would be in great shape. 
   And that is what we, as Americans, are all about. We think forward, we're visionary, and we need to recognize that these opportunities that are being presented to us on becoming energy independent over the next number of years, as many of us refer to it, the Apollo Project--Mr. Hall is a leader in our class on these issues--that this is where we need to be moving forward for our future on national security, for our jobs, and opportunities that will help us engage in a stronger future economy, and for an environment. It all ties together very nicely. 
   Mr. Hall, I know you are very interested in this as well, so please join us.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, as we begin to wind down, we started this discussion about the impact of Iraq and the economy, and the economy and Iraq. And I think we started it from the beginning saying this country, we Americans have spent $600 billion on this effort in Iraq. And at a minimum, as we've discussed tonight, what could we do, certainly in the future, in terms of Iraq, from the right standpoint, taking responsibility and making it stand up and step up for itself and paying for its reconstruction, its fuel needs that Americans are having to pay for right now, and the training of its military. 
   And those resources, those American dollars can certainly be applied in a way to make us safer in dealing with, as you express, national security interests by taking us away from the addiction to oil and coming up with wonderful new renewable energy sources. The technology is there, it's being developed, it's being refined. We can take the question of the jobs and our economy right now, and of course the environment. 
   And so, as we begin to wrap up, if you can give some final thoughts as to how the Iraq and the economy are tied together and how we can get beyond this point and do good things for this country.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today, the House of Representatives will vote on a war spending bill that does not call for accountability. Unlike the previous Iraq supplemental, the bill we are voting on today does not provide the American people with a path to end this war. For me, the issue of accountability is imperative. Without a real accountability plan in Iraq, there is no telling how long this war will continue. 
   We were elected to bring a new direction in Iraq, and I will continue that fight, along with many of my colleagues. As I have made clear time and time again with my votes, I fully support our troops and their families. But I also believe that it is Congress' duty to support a change in the Iraq policy that will meet our national security objectives. 
   When the people of South Florida chose me to be their voice in Congress, they put their trust and faith in me to represent their values and priorities. Along with the people of South Florida, I will continue to stand up and work toward a new policy in Iraq. 
   For these reasons, I will vote against the Iraq supplemental bill today.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6331, the ``Medicare Improvements and Patients and Providers Act of 2008,'' and thank Chairmen Rangel and Dingell for their leadership in bringing it to the House floor today. This legislation, among other things, will block a devastating 10.6 percent cut in reimbursement fees for physicians who accept Medicare patients. 
   Mr. Speaker, Medicare used to be known as the ``Gold Standard'' for physicians because it provided them with fair and sustainable reimbursement rates, but not anymore. As a result of the President trying to balance the budget on the backs of doctors, physicians all across the country are facing severe cuts in their Medicare reimbursements on July 1. 
   In south Florida, we're currently facing a severe shortage of qualified physicians in part because of the way physicians are paid under Medicare, and the pending cut could hasten this exodus, potentially leaving many elderly and other vulnerable populations without doctors to treat them. 
   This is an unacceptable situation for south Florida or for any region of this country. Eliminating the cuts and providing physicians with a 1.1 percent increase in 2009 is simply the right thing to do. 
   But we cannot be satisfied with short-term patches to this systemic problem. During the next 18 months, let us once and for all end all talk of patches or fixes, and come together in a bipartisan way to find a permanent solution to the way we pay our doctors. 
   We owe it to our seniors, to the men and women who helped to make this country the greatest in the world, to ensure that when they are sick, a doctor will be there to see them. It's a fair deal, and one we must not turn our backs on.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the gentleman. It is good to be here as part of our freshman class, the Majority Makers. It is an honor and privilege, as it always is, to be here in Congress and to talk about some of the things that we have been doing, Madam Speaker, over the last number of weeks that hopefully will really impact people's lives. 
   The thing I think that to me is so important about the minimum wage discussion was the fact that it was a discussion that not only dealt with the average family, the people putting food on the table, but also dealt with the small businesses, because there was concern by some people that our small businesses might be impacted, and there is only so much that a small business can absorb when compared to other businesses, because the bigger businesses probably pay more than minimum wage, but sometimes small businesses pay the minimum wage. 
   The great thing about this package is that it not only provided that increase, and two more increases to follow, which will amount to $4,400 a year when this is fully implemented additional compensation to people. Think about what you can do with $4,400 a year for a person who is earning minimum wage right now. We know that the problem all along has been minimum wage does not put food on the table and a roof over the house or the place that you live. So we are contributing to that. 
   But also, on the small business side there are some tax breaks that went along with it to help the small businesses absorb this, some tax breaks to help small businesses thrive. We are a small-business country by and large. I am from Florida. Most of our businesses are small business. Some are of the definition small businesses being 200 employees or less, but most small businesses are 5 people, 10 people. It really is that corner store that really makes the difference. 
   So we want those small businesses to thrive because they do create jobs. At the same time, we want the people that work in those jobs to be able to care for their families, to be able to put their kids through school, maybe to go to college if that is what they choose; certainly we live in a world economy where we want kids to go to college; pay for health care expenses, and at least move in the right direction. 
   So I am pretty excited that the minimum wage increase has finally been implemented, 10 years of this country lagging behind, and at the same time we are helping our small businesses compete and be successful. 
   I will just turn over to Mr. Hodes to give his thoughts on how this affects people in New Hampshire.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Absolutely. And I'm glad you pointed it out because I know that you personally took a lead on a number of the educational issues. I think all of us as Americans understand the importance of education and so many of the achievement issues that have been brought up in our individual States at the Federal level, there's concern. There's concern that America's not keeping up. We're not achieving. We're not where we need to be and we see some of the other countries of the world, whether it's China or some of the Far East countries that really are moving ahead with their economies, with their job creation. It's not just call centers in Bangalor. It's high tech jobs. And I think there's a big commitment by this Congress this year with Democratic leadership, and I'm glad to see Republicans joining us because this is not a partisan issue. This is the right thing to do. 
   There was a big commitment to invest in children, and it was everything from investing in schools to investing in college scholarships, Pell Grants. For those of you who don't know what Pell Grants are, those are the scholarships that help students go through college and provide access to college. We've worked on the interest rate, reducing the interest rate so that more kids can, again, go to school. 
   There are lots of kids in our country that have disabilities and we have invested in education for children with disabilities. As a matter of fact, we put $509 million additional dollars in. 
   And the last thing I'll mention, because this is something that I know that both my colleagues, Mr. Hodes and Mr. Ellison are very involved in their local communities and that's expanding medical research. This is such an important issue. And whether you believe in stem cell, which I firmly do, or any other type of medical research, we have millions of people in our country, not just seniors, but families with children and adults that have serious medical disease issues. And unfortunately, the last number of years, Federal grants for research have been declining. It's called the NIH, National Institute of Health grants. And they've been declining. Unfortunately, the recommendations from the President have been less and less, and Congress has put less and less in. 
   Yet, there's been a demand for the public to say help us, help us find cures. And I'm so proud about the fact that there's going to be well over a billion dollars of additional research over and above what the President even asked for. And this will allow for an additional 545 competing medical research programs to go forward. And I don't even have to mention the names of the diseases because Americans understand what's going on here. It's not just Alzheimer's; it's so many other things. 
   So, Mr. Ellison, thank you for mentioning that because one of the things that I came to Congress for was to work on education, making sure our children can compete and our adults can compete, and medical research. And I think that this bill, in particular, has so much in it and it's so exciting. I'm looking forward to seeing the President hopefully sign this bill as soon as possible.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. If I can just throw something in, Mr. Ellison. One of the things that Mr. Hodes is pointing out is that the people that we're talking about are working families. We're not talking about necessarily people that aren't working. We're not only talking about what people in this country may think of as destitute people, poor. There are a lot of those people also that we're trying to, as Americans, give a helping hand which we're always, of course every one of us is committed to doing. 
   But we're talking about a lot of middle-class people. And there's so many issues out there today. And if I can ask you a few questions. If you can elaborate for us some of the things we've been working on housing and some of the foreclosure issues, you know, transportation. These are things that this Congress has been working in this last week on putting together a bill for the first time in about a decade to really take a look at what's happening to working families and what we can do to give them a hand up, not a hand out, but a hand up, and empower them. So if you can just elaborate on some of those, Mr. Ellison.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, it's been a full day for us. I know I'm going to get a good night's sleep tonight. But what I think we should all be proud of as Americans is the fact that we're moving forward. And there are some very positive things that are happening. Obviously, at home people are very concerned about their livelihood, putting up a roof over their head, being able to afford health care, putting their kids into college and pursuing the American Dream. And I think a lot of things that we have discussed in this brief time tonight about improving education and really putting some  muscle behind it, not just throwing money at it but changing the policies to make sure that we give teachers the tools and the kids the incentives to be successful, the minimum wage, just giving people a working wage so they can go forward and do well and giving the tax benefits to the businesses that create the jobs. It's a great combination on both sides. 
   You know, the research which I know all of us feel so strongly about and finding the cures, these are things that Americans think about every day when they get up and go to work and think about their parents, their grandparents, their kids. It's about the future of our families and our country. So I'm very excited and I know I'm going to sleep well tonight knowing we got good work done today. And we are going to continue working on this over the next number of weeks and months as we continue to move America forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you very much, Congressman Ellison. 
   It is a pleasure to be here once again with my freshman colleagues as we try to do this every Thursday evening and get together and speak about what's going on in the last couple of weeks and tell the American people and share with them some of the good things that we've been working on. 
   We ran in elections this past November. And coming into the freshman class, we heard loud and clear from the American public that it was very, very important that we get this budget under control. One of the first things that we did, and I am very proud of it and Republicans joined with us on this so it was a bipartisan effort, is we passed the PAYGO principle. PAYGO is about as simple as you can imagine; it's pay-as-you-go. It's no different than the way I run my personal family budget with my kids and my wife; it's no different than most people run their small businesses or large businesses. It is the simple point of money comes in, and you can't spend more than is coming in. It is expenses versus revenues, or cash flow. 
   I was very proud of that moment as one of the very first things that we did was to pass the PAYGO principle, and that was something that was, in the past, the Congress always followed that principle, but most recently, in the last number of years, it was thrown out. As a result of that, tax cuts, higher spending, and tax cuts are wonderful, we all want less taxes as long as there are corresponding spending cuts. Everything has to balance. I just want to reference that because to me that was a great start. 
   I am very proud of the fact that everything we have passed since then, every bill that we have taken up has a component in it which says we cannot add new expenses, we cannot build more programs unless the money is in the budget. I think that is a principle that needs to be there forever, for that matter; and I think that is the first step in beginning this process of getting our fiscal house in order. 
   So I am just going to highlight that for a minute and turn it back over to Congressman Ellison.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Sure. I listened to Congressman Murphy, and I listened to veterans in my home district of Broward and Palm Beach Counties, and whether it was World War II, the Korean War or the most recent conflicts we are involved in, these are brave men and women that put their lives on the line, and they deserve to be supported, both on the ground and when they come home. 
   I thank you for your service, and I certainly thank your colleagues over in Iraq and the men and women that are fighting and protecting our freedoms all over the world.     
   You know, when I think about September 11, which was a dark day for our country, and what happened in our country with the failures that allowed these terrorists to attack us, and the deaths, the needless deaths that occurred in our major cities, it was an awakening for this country. But it was also a time when we had an opportunity to really take stock of where our shortcomings were. Where were the intelligence failures? Where were the communication failures? Where were the vulnerabilities in our airports and our seaports and all these other places where people came in from other countries to harm us and kill our people in this country? 
   And there was a man named Osama bin Laden who is still out there. Hard to believe today. When you think about what our number one strategy should have been was to find the perpetrator and the perpetrators of this terrible, terrible tragedy, and he is still out there today. That needs to be rectified. 
   But beyond that, I think we all recognize things that came together after that; and there was this 9/11 Commission report, which was probably one of the most prestigious, important, qualified incredible groups that came together, Democrats, Republicans, professionals which said, let's figure this out. This isn't a Democrat/Republican issue; it is an American issue, and protecting our territory, our homes, our streets. And they came up with this 9/11 report. Which, if you haven't had a chance to take a look at it, it is not just reading you read before you go to bed and it will put you to sleep. This is gripping. This is really a very thorough analysis of what we need to do. 
   Unfortunately, it was a number of years that passed. Some things were adopted from that plan, but many were not. And I don't think it was anybody questioning the fact that this was a priority, but it wasn't passed. Many of the items weren't passed. 
   So one of the things that we said in our campaigns and we took up right away, and we are still obviously waiting for the process in Washington to be finished, but the House quickly took up the rest of the 9/11 Commission report and passed it. And I just want to highlight a few key elements. 
   We know that there were problems with aviation security. Those elements, those recommendations have been adopted. We know that there were port problems and port security issues. Most containers that come in, substantially most of the containers that come into our ports are not inspected. I come from southeast Florida. We have Port of Palm Beach and Port Everglades. Port Everglades is a main oil terminal among cargo and container in great bulk. Tremendous risk if you happen to be anywhere near those areas and something, God forbid, comes in in the form of nuclear materials or biohazardous materials or anything else that comes into those ports. And this is all over the United States. Ownership of the ports. We all know about the Dubai Port issue. That has been straightened out through our legislation. 
   Certainly the idea of preventing terrorists from even getting into this country, visa changes, rules changes, all these things are so important. And not to mention the people that are on the ground fighting for us every day, our firefighters, our emergency responders, our police officers. Every one of us feels very strongly about them. And as we grew up and you wanted to be a fireman or you wanted to be a policeman, not everybody chose that profession, but, boy, on September 11 did we as Americans have a newfound respect for what they did for us. 
   But what we needed to do that wasn't done was to give them the tools, the communications tools like they needed in New York and other places so they can make sure that they can communicate with each other, and that local and State and National Federal intelligence agencies can properly share that information. These things have now been passed by the House of Representatives, and it was one of the first things we did. And that is the right thing to do. And whatever it costs, that should be at the top of our budget. People say, well, it is expensive. You know something? You prioritize. You say, what is first? Homeland security, protecting our troops, making sure they are properly funded. And I know that Congressman Yarmuth is going to talk about the incredible great work we have done for our veterans. 
   These are the things that are our Nation's priorities. These are American  values and America's priorities. And I am very proud that we as the freshman class participated with the rest of the Congress, and mostly Democrats, and Republicans, came together that said, yes, we are going to take care of the American people first. So I just wanted to share those elements with you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Well, that is an interesting question, and I think we should look back the last few years. 
   The President in his State of the Union address about a year ago correctly said we are addicted to oil. I think everybody understood what he meant by that, and yet Congress, a number of months later, passed an energy bill which gave billions of dollars to energy companies and subsidized more oil drilling. 
   Now, oil will always be a part of the energy policy of the United States, but this notion that oil is our way out, to me, is just ridiculous. This is interesting because when I have been speaking at schools back home, and I am sure you have been doing the same thing, and I want to talk to our young population, our students, as well as our adults. 
   The calling of this generation is to move toward making this country energy independent. It goes right directly to what Representative Hodes was talking about, defend our country. The number one thing that we should do to ensure that we are defending our country is making sure that we are not continually dependent on importing oil from countries that are not reliable partners, and whether that is Middle East countries or Venezuela or any other country if you have been following around the world where we are daily bringing in 60 percent of our oil in the form of imports, that is a dangerous prospect and a dangerous policy. 
   So what we can do about it? We can focus, just like in the past, the attention of the American people, our scientists, our public sector, our private entrepreneurs, our people that have great vision and say, what can we do to make ourselves energy independent? Is it solar, is it wind, is it wave, is it thermal, is it any combination of science that can go along with this? 
   We put a man on the moon when said John F. Kennedy said, we are going to fight against the Sputnik, that little can that went up into space. We created the Manhattan project, that we knew it was a matter of our national security to make sure that we developed a nuclear weapon, it was an atomic weapon at that time, to make sure that we would end World War II successfully. That was a commitment that Americans, with our ingenuity and our science, put that all together. 
   Well, I do not think there is anybody who is listening tonight does not believe that Americans, if they put their nose to the grindstone and we make our commitments as consumers, as scientists, as public and private people, that we cannot accomplish that same goal. It is a matter of national security. It is a matter of our environment. You already mentioned this, global warming, and the science, the carbon dioxide and all those things, and it is also a matter of a new economy. 
   We think about jobs for the next generation, the science, that we can lead the world and export our technology and be successful. 
   A new energy policy is the calling of our generation, and I hope and I believe, based on the freshman class, by the way, the freshman class of Democrats and Republicans coming in and listening very closely to the public, I think there is a great opportunity for us to all work together and change it from just an energy policy that is dependent on oil to one that will really improve our environment, create new jobs and really protect us in this next century.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act. 
   This legislation represents the best in bipartisan compromise, and it demonstrates that, despite what divides us from time to time as Republicans and Democrats, we can and do come together to tackle issues that matter most. And the global HIV/AIDS crisis matters deeply to all of us. Some 40 million people around the world are living with this disease. We have a moral imperative to act and to act decisively. 
   Just 5 years ago, an HIV diagnosis for a poor villager in Africa was a death sentence. Thanks to lifesaving drugs provided by the American people, this is no longer the case. The global AIDS program works, and it works because it is an initiative not of one political party or another. It is truly a compassionate statement by the American people, and I am very proud to support its reauthorization and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you very much, Mr. Hodes, the distinguished gentleman from New Hampshire, who really has been a great leader in our class. He was the first president of our class this year. And I am also joined by John Yarmuth from Kentucky, who is our current class President. That's an honor that's bestowed, elected by the members of our freshman class on both of you. So I'm glad to be here with both of you tonight. We are going to be joined by a few other people. 
   Yes, I do come from the Sunshine State, and the sun does come out every day, and it's a wonderful place to live. My wife and I have lived there for many years, and a lot of people in your districts come down and eventually retire there. Maybe you will be part of my constituency some day. Although the sunshine is out and it is warm there and beautiful, we have also had our trials and tribulations as of late with the economy. 
   We in Florida have actually been blessed for a number of years, 15 years straight, until just recently with growth and appreciation of home values, expanding businesses, a lot of international trade and agriculture production and things like that. Yet, we now are facing the same problems that most other States in the United States are, and that is our real estate industry has just stopped. People are having a great deal of difficulty selling their homes. If they're trying to downsize, they're retired and want to move to something smaller, or if they're a family growing and want to get into something a little bigger. There is nothing that is selling right now. Despite the great efforts of our realtors and people who are in the development business, they're having a difficult time. 
   And as a result of the real estate industry, which is a big part of Florida's economy, as a result of that having stopped, retail, and all of the service businesses and all of the businesses that relate to an economy which is growing and people are moving, coming and going, they have also stopped. 
   So we are now facing a very, very difficult time in Florida, and our Florida legislature is meeting, as we speak, and deciding how they're going to take $3 billion-plus out of a State budget that funds education, health care, and all of the other things that our States do. 
   So we obviously understand that up here in Washington because all of us live at home. We live in our districts. We go to church and synagogue with people and go to our local supermarkets, and neighbors and friends are telling us what they're dealing with right now. And what they're dealing with is what people all over the United States are dealing with. 
   In Florida right now, gas prices are averaging about $3.40 a gallon despite the fact that we live very close to a port. As a matter of fact, I have Port Everglades right in my district. That's a fuel farm where large tankers come in, bring the fuel right there, and it's $3.40 on average per gallon of gas. 
   Food prices. Anybody who has been in the supermarket lately, and I know all of us have and our families have and people on the floor here have all been to the supermarket, a dozen eggs is $3.50. A dozen eggs. Milk prices. And it goes on and on and on. Things that are manufactured in your States, the cost  of transporting things, the oil prices. These things add to the cost of living in all of our communities and I know in Florida. 
   I find it very interesting, and Mr. Hodes and I serve on the Financial Services Committee, which is a committee that deals with the economy, that deals with the Federal Reserve. It deals with banks and credit and insurance and housing. All of these things are part of this committee. 
   So we have been hearing from Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson, the Treasury Secretary and others. It's very interesting. When the information is presented to us and you hear this debate, is there a recession or is there not a recession; people back in my district are saying, What are you talking about? Who cares if there's a defined recession or not? We know what's going on. My job is not as secure as it was a year ago. I know what my food prices are, my energy costs, my insurance costs, my taxes. All of these things are weighing very heavily on me, and things are not good. 
   People have lost that confidence, that swagger that Americans have. And, of course, we know we can get it back, but it is a question of what we can do about it.     
   Well, in the discussion with Financial Services, when they present the inflationary numbers to us and say, well, inflation is in check, that maybe it's moving a little and we have to watch it but it's in check, guess what the inflationary factors do not consider: energy and food prices. And they say that the reason they're not considered is because they fluctuate wildly and they are really not a determining factor of whether there's an inflation. Well, you know something? They certainly are a big factor on my budget and my neighbor's budget and my parents' budget and everyone else who lives in the United States because those two factors are things that affect us. Every time you go to the gas station and you spend $50, $60, $70 for a tank of gas, that's a lot of money. And whether you can afford it or not, you feel like something's wrong here. We're sending money overseas to countries that are not our friends and are supporting our enemies or these oil companies are creating the largest profit in American company history. And nobody's out there criticizing the entrepreneurial system, but let's have a little fairness here, a little investing in renewable energy, which is what this Democratic Congress has been focusing on, which is a good thing. And food prices, our farmers and people who produce, this is a big factor to American families when they go to the supermarket. When all of a sudden it costs $175 for your weekly bill instead of $130, that adds up. People that are on fixed incomes, we have a lot of seniors that have retired to my community that are on fixed incomes. These are real issues that I think we are concerned about. 
   And the good news is there are some things coming out of this Congress that are going to begin to help deal with everything from energy prices, both short and long term; food prices, of course. And nobody's looking to control the economy, but we are saying we need to work together to help reduce the costs of the materials that make up these products. And, of course, the mortgage crisis and the credit crisis, and I know we're going to talk about that as we get into our discussion tonight. Fortunately, we have some great people. Congressman Barney Frank, chairman of Financial Services, probably one of the smartest people, he's working every day with Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson to try to find things that we can do to help people stay in their homes. We're not talking about land speculators. We're not talking about people who have five homes. We are talking about the families that got in a little bit over their heads here, and they need some help and those communities need some help so you don't have this cascading of foreclosures in any one area. 
   So I'm looking forward to being with our colleagues here tonight to talk about some of these things. And with that if I can yield to the gentleman from Kentucky, I will do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Thank you for laying out as you did. It's very easy to understand the way you just explain it. I will just mention another item that we did pass last year as we saw this coming on. The question is what is Congress doing. What are we doing to help our neighbors and friends. This is a community issue. Sure, it's a national issue. But it boils down to what is happening in my community in Delray Beach and Boynton Beach and Lauderdale by the Sea and places that are close-knit communities and close-knit families that have lived together for a long time and they are seeing house after house after house with a sign that says Foreclosure, that notice on the door. It's not very troubling. It's not just that homeowner him or herself, it's the community that gets affected. It has a downward pressure on home values, which is what we want to avoid. 
   Another thing that is very important that this Congress, the two gentlemen here and others supported, and we are all very proud to do this, it was a bill called the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. It did something which is very important. It prevents homeowners from facing a tax bill at the same time they are losing their homes. Here's how it works. This is a problem with the current Internal Revenue Code. Basically, it says if you have a debt, a mortgage, and somebody releases you from that debt, they cancel the debt, or they reduce the amount, that is considered income to you. You actually have to pay tax on that, which is pretty ridiculous. But that is the way the current tax law is set up. It's not just for homes, it's for other things as well. It's called ``phantom income.'' It's the worst kind of income you can have because there is no cash in your pocket to pay for it. 
   So this Congress under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and others, in a bipartisan way, it was the right thing to do, we passed a law that said no, that is not going to be the case. If you're foreclosed on or there is a problem and there is a release of this debt, that is not going to be income to you, and you don't have to pay tax on it. It's bad enough your losing your home, but you certainly shouldn't have to add insult to injury by paying income on that as well. 
   We also passed a bill which expanded financial counseling for families in danger of losing their homes. A lot of it is information. If you're getting this notice and you can't afford that mortgage payment, what can you do? As Mr. Hodes correctly said, this isn't the old days when you went to your local banker, in many cases, and it was a man or woman you knew, it was someone in the community, and they took down your application, they knew where you worked and what your income was and everything else, and that bank was going to hold that mortgage. 
   Today, that is not the way it works. Many banks, not all banks, but many banks, they take that mortgage and it's sold within 30 days in the package that Mr. Hodes mentioned. Packaged and sold again and again, and most people don't even know who's holding their paper. They send a mortgage payment to some P.O. box somewhere. They won't even know who to call if they were late on their payments. 
   One of the things this Congress said is let's help people, get them information, and this counseling process is one which you bring people together and say listen, maybe I can't afford this, but I can afford this. It's not in the bank's best interest to foreclose on a piece of property. They lose all the way around. It's certainly not in the best interest of the homeowner. So we are very proud that that was the right thing to do. But there's so much more to do. 
   This past week, the Treasury Secretary, Mr. Paulson, released a series of proposals. He called them short, intermediate, and long-term views on the financial markets. Unfortunately, the short-term really wasn't much of anything. The way I read it, it was sort of we are going to reinstate this commission, put some new people on it, and study it. 
   Well, time for study is over. People are in real need right now. We are not into bailouts. We are not into bailouts of banks or investment groups that made bad investments, and we are not into bailouts of land speculators. But there is a narrow group of people that are homeowners, family owners. It's their primary home, their only home. It's where they live. They are raising their kids, or they are senior citizens. This is the group of people that may have got caught short. This is the group of people that I think there are some strategies being discussed right now in Congress just to give them some relief to encourage the lenders to work with them and create some ways that the financing can be stabilized. 
   So I think that is a very good thing. But, again, it's not in the President's proposal. I am not saying that he is not prepared to work with us, but I think the ideas are going to come out of this Congress. 
   The second thing I will mention quickly and turn it over to my colleague from Kentucky is the notion that these organizations at the Federal level, SEC, Securities Exchange Commission; CFTC, another group that regulates commodities, and the groups go on and on in evaluating and regulating banks. They call it the alphabet soup of regulators. 
   It's pretty clear that these organizations have failed or not had the legal authority to do what they need to do. I think what this means to all of us, and the President and through the Treasury Secretary has said let's merge some of these together. That may be a good idea for efficiency purposes and it may be a good idea in term of creating a better form of regulation. But it's like reorganizing the chairs on the Titanic, or even creating the Department of Homeland Security by putting Immigration and FEMA in there. It isn't always necessarily a better idea to just merge everything together. 
   I am all for efficiency, I am all for saving money, I am all for the better regulatory side without, as Mr. Hodes, said over regulating. But I think there has to be a mission clarification here to understand that a whole lot of things that were being sold on Wall Street are not understandable, not only to the average investor, like any American that buys stocks or investment vehicles, but even to the most sophisticated people. 
   There are a lot of things being traded that nobody real understood what they were trading, and the result of that is no transparency and a whole lot of businesses and a lot of people have lost a lot of money. Again, I think I am mostly concerned about the average investor and our markets being creative and innovative. That is all a good thing. But at the same time, we want to make sure that there's a regulatory scheme that doesn't stifle innovation, but it's that side of capitalism, that capitalism unregulated results in the Depression, as we had in 1929, and certainly there have been pitfalls along the way. This is obviously a pitfall, and we need to fix it and learn from the mistakes of what got us here in the first place. 
   So I am hopeful that this Congress in a bipartisan way with the leadership of Chairman Barney Frank will be able to come up with some good ideas, work with Federal Reserve Chair, work with the Treasury Secretary, work with the Bush administration. America is depending on us. Our families are depending on us, our neighbors are depending on us. We are all optimists. That is why we are here. As Americans, we are optimists. Let's not repeat these mistakes again. 
   With that, Mr. Hodes, if it's okay, I will turn it back to you.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3021, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public Schools Facilities Act. 
   I was proud to work with the chairman and Mr. Blumenauer to authorize the use of funds to improve building infrastructure to facilitate bike and pedestrian access. This could include bike storage facilities, safety lighting, lockers, safe travel routes on school grounds for bicyclists and pedestrians, and more. 
   Alternative modes of transportation and storage facilities for bicycles are recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council as criteria for obtaining certification as a green school and are critical to reducing emissions and the carbon footprint of our Nation's schools. 
   With skyrocketing gas prices, American families are feeling the pain at the pump. It's my hope that this amendment will help ease that burden by encouraging students, just as we did, to walk and bike to school rather than catch a ride with their parents or drive themselves. I would like to thank my friend Representative Blumenauer for working with me on this important provision and commend him for his tireless work on this issue. 
   Additionally, I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, along with his staff, for their work to bring this legislation to the floor today.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (CHIP PROGRAM IS COST EFFECTIVE -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, President Bush rejected the wishes of the American people, 68 Senators, 43 Governors, and 265 Members of this body when he vetoed the children's health bill. 
   The reason that so many Democrats and Republicans support the CHIP Reauthorization Act is that it is consensus legislation that was crafted in a bipartisan fashion. 
   Over the last 10 years, the children's health program has proven to be a popular and successful program, with 6 million children currently receiving quality private health care. It costs less than $3.50 per day to cover a child through the CHIP program. Insuring kids is also cost effective for taxpayers who end up picking up the tab for indigent care in emergency rooms, the most expensive way to care for a child's health. A child is also more likely to succeed in education and life if they have access to health care at an early age, and it certainly benefits our Nation in the long run. 
   Madam Speaker, I would hope more of my Republican colleagues would work together to recognize the success story of CHIP, and would join us today in overriding the President's veto. We need to ensure that more children have access to quality health care.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, when the American people entrusted this House to a new Democratic majority, they wanted Congress to deliver tangible results. We are living up to that promise. In the first 100 hours, we passed rules to clean up the way that Congress operates. We implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We raised the minimum wage to expand economic prosperity to millions who have been left behind for too long, and we cut interest rates in half so college is more affordable to middle-class families in our country. 
   We also repealed billions of dollars in tax breaks to big oil companies and instead are investing that in alternative fuels and energy-efficient technology. We hope this legislation will begin to wean our Nation off foreign oil because today customers are once again paying record prices at the pump, and that is simply wrong. This legislation is a first step in changing our Nation's energy policy. 
   We also passed a budget that is actually balanced within the next 5 years, and we did it without raising taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are living up to our promise to move our Nation in a new and better direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, our economy is in trouble, and millions of hardworking American families are feeling the impact as we speak. Since 2001, the real income of a typical working family has fallen by $2,500, and workers' wages have failed to keep up with the inflation for the fourth time in the past 5 years. 
   In December, the unemployment rate shot up to a 2-year high of 5 percent with over 900,000 more Americans looking for work over the same period last year. Stagnant wages are not only forcing families to squeeze more out of every dollar, but are also taking a toll on our overall economy. Retailers suffered their worst December shopping season in 5 years, and consumer confidence fell this month to its lowest point on record. 
   Last week, the House approved a bipartisan economic package that will provide urgent relief to 117 million Americans. This is a fair economic package that gets money to the workers, the people who need it the most; and they are most likely to spend it on necessities like groceries and gas. 
   Economists estimate that each dollar of the rebate will lead to $1.26 in economic growth. Mr. Speaker, economists also say we have to act fast. That's exactly what this House did, and I hope the Senate joins us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great solemnity to mark the 1-year anniversary of the killing of three Israeli soldiers and the kidnapping of two others, Eldad Regev and Udi Goldwasser. On July 12, 2006, Hezbollah terrorists crossed into Israel and attacked two IDF armored jeeps as they were patrolling Israel's northern border. 
   Eldad is 26, born in Kiryat Motzkin. I met Eldad's brother, Benny, in Israel last summer, just weeks after his brother's kidnapping. He begged us to spread the message back to the United States that we must do everything possible to bring the missing soldiers home. Eldad's family and friends pray every day for Eldad's safety and his swift return. They wrote of him: 
   ``One of the qualities that makes Eldad so special is the kindness of his heart, never hesitating to donate and offer aid to anyone in need. He always likes to stay informed and is constantly involved in everything that is happening around him.'' 
   Udi is 31 from Nahariya. I met Udi's mother just a few months ago when she visited Members of Congress on Capitol Hill. She came to raise awareness about the plight of her son and others who were kidnapped. Udi had just married Karnit when he was captured, and his wife had to spend their 1-year anniversary alone, wondering where her husband was and what condition he was in. His family and friends wrote: 
   ``He's a loving, caring person, always ready to offer a helping hand in any situation. He is a man of principles and values, knowledgeable in many varied subjects.'' 
   Unfortunately, Eldad and Udi are not alone among Israel's missing soldiers. Three weeks before their capture, Hamas kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. The Shalit family has also met with many communities across the United States, urging people to remember their son and speak out on his behalf. 
   I rise tonight to make sure that the plight of these soldiers is not forgotten. I rise to honor the sacrifices of these soldiers and their families who wait every day for news of their circumstances. 
   Here in my hand I have a copy of their dogtags. The United Jewish Communities around the country delivered a copy of the dogtags to every Member of Congress to help raise awareness that it has been 1 year since the families have heard from their loved ones. It has been 1 whole year since they have seen their husband, son, and brother. These families have heard not one word from the captors about whether they are alive or okay. 
   I join the families of these soldiers and all freedom-loving Americans in calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Eldad, Udi, and Gilad. America stands with Israel in its refusal to let these soldiers be forgotten. Let their dogtags on the floor of the United States House of Representatives serve as a symbol of unwavering vigilance and support. American families and Israeli families are united in the hope that these families should suffer no longer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, otherwise known as the GIVE Act. This legislation speaks to what makes our country great, Americans volunteering to give back to their communities. Volunteerism is so important to helping the less fortunate, working to better one's community, and instilling a sense of patriotism and love for one's country. 
   Volunteers are critical to pulling our country through hard times. Following the hurricanes that plagued my home State of Florida, I witnessed firsthand the overwhelming response from volunteers who came out to respond to the needs of hurricane victims. Volunteers came together to provide these victims with clothing, food, shelter, and other items that displaced residents and families needed to get their lives back on track. 
   The GIVE Act will continue this strong tradition of volunteerism in America by increasing community service opportunities and providing new incentives for volunteering.     
   Furthermore, I am proud to support legislation that puts a premium on disaster preparedness and emergency response. 
   I would like to commend Representative McCarthy for her work on this bill and urge my colleagues to support this bill for the betterment of all our communities and our country as a whole.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay respect and honor to Private First Class Daniel Agami from Parkland, Florida, who lost his life this past June while serving in Iraq. 
   Private Agami was patrolling in a Humvee with four other soldiers when their vehicle was hit by an IED, an improvised explosive device. Unfortunately, all five of these brave troops were killed. 
   Private Agami was a man of great character, known for his devotion to faith and his country. His presence was so strong and his personality so outgoing that the Army planned to feature Private Agami in an upcoming advertising campaign. 
   Like me, Private Agami was born in Ohio but later moved to Florida. His parents were surprised by his decision to join the military 2 years ago, but noted that he felt a responsibility to his country, and in the words of his mother, Beth Agami, he ``was totally patriotic.'' 
   I, unfortunately, never had the opportunity to meet Private Agami, but after hearing about the way he approached life and his devotion to our country, I feel like I know him. He is a role model to me and to all citizens. 
   To the family of Private Agami, your beloved son made the ultimate sacrifice to serve our country, and those of us in Florida and the Nation are eternally grateful and will never forget his unfathomable service to our country.

   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the economic challenges that are affecting America are having a real impact on my constituents in South Florida. The Associated Press recently reported that Fort Lauderdale has among the highest foreclosure rates in the country. Market stability is of the utmost importance in returning Florida's economy to a position of strength and restoring consumer confidence. 
   The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act provides mortgage refinancing assistance to keep families from losing their homes, protect neighboring home values, and help stabilize the housing market. It also helps borrowers avoid foreclosure, while minimizing taxpayer exposure and, at the same time, requires lenders and home owners to take responsibility. It also provides a $7,500 tax credit to first time home buyers to jump start the residential real estate market. 
   This is an excellent, well-thought-out response to the housing market crisis that we are dealing with. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters and the minority members who worked on this commonsense economic compromise legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. KLEIN of Florida. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the Water Resources Subcommittee for yielding to me, and for her great work on the legislation, as well as the bill's sponsor, Mr. Pallone. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today to enthusiastically support the Beach Protection Act of 2007. With over 75 miles of shoreline along Florida's well-renowned Gold Coast on the Atlantic Ocean, my congressional district relies heavily on its beaches to support both our economy and our unparalleled quality of life. 
   But keeping our beaches open and thriving requires us to vigilantly fight pollution in our waters. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, almost 2,700 beach advisory or closure dates were issued due to pollution for the State of Florida in 2006. Although the number was down from the previous 2 years, 2006 represents a record high for closing or posted warnings with over 25,000 such notices across our country. 
   Madam Chairman, the causes for beach pollution are well known. It often originates from contaminated storm water or inadequately treated sewage, and the effects can be wide ranging and devastating, ranging from ear infections and respiratory ailments, to hepatitis and dysentery. For senior citizens, small children and people with weak immune systems, the results can even be deadly. 
   That is why this act, the Beach Protection Act, is important. The legislation will reauthorize the BEACH Act of 2000 and increase annual funding from $30 million to $40 million, enabling more beaches to receive Federal grants to support State-monitoring efforts.     
   It will also allow States to use the funds to track and clean up the sources of beach water pollution so that we can prevent future closings and advisories from happening. 
   H.R. 2537 will also speed up notifications of water quality. The unfortunate truth is that many beach managers are using outdated testing methods that are incapable of providing immediate, same-day results of water quality. This means that beachgoers sometimes don't even find out until a day or two after they return from the beach that the water they were swimming in was hazardous. 
   This delay must stop. Our constituents have a right to know right away if the water is unsafe. And now that we have rapid test methods that can provide results in as little as 2 hours, the EPA must approve them and States must implement them, and this bill will require them to do that. 
   The Beach Protection Act is critically important for our coastal communities and the millions of Americans who enjoy and visit them each year. 
   I thank the chairwoman again for her work on it, and look forward to the passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for the presentation and the support of the resolution, House Resolution 583. I would also like to thank Chairman Lantos, who has a deep and abiding understanding of the circumstances leading up to and what occurred during the Holocaust, and of course Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and my cosponsor, Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart from Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true hero, Mr. Nicholas Winton, who saved more than 600 children from their death during the Holocaust. Nine months before the outbreak of World War II, Nicholas Winton, then only 29 years old, a young man, used his business and personal connections, urgently working from the dining room of a hotel room, and found safety for these hundreds of children. 
   Nicholas Winton took the lead in raising the necessary funds to assure transportation for these children. As was said already, he found foster homes and arranged for the necessary permits and documents. But let's understand this is not just an administrative function that we would think of today to place children. This was under threat of death of himself, his family and anybody who assisted. He saved these children's lives, since most of their families and contemporaries remained in Czechoslovakia, and they soon perished. 
   These children grew up to be doctors, nurses, teachers, musicians, artists, writers, pilots, ministers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and even a member of the British Parliament. Today they and their children and grandchildren and great grandchildren number over 5,000 human beings, living in the United States, Canada, Australia, the Czech Republic, Britain, Germany and elsewhere. 
   Nicholas Winton, as was already indicated, was given a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for his services to humanity. Sir Nicholas never sought credit for saving the lives of these children. In fact, his achievement went unrecognized for more than half a century, and until 1988 his family never knew about it. 
   For 50 years they were called ``Winton's children,'' as the survivors called themselves, and did not know who to even thank or to whom they owed their lives. The story only emerged when his wife came across a satchel in the attic and found lists of children and letters from their parents. 
   In 1939, as he scrambled to save hundreds of lives, Nicholas Winton wrote in a letter: ``There is a difference between passive goodness and active goodness, which is, in my opinion, the giving of one's time and energy in the alleviation of pain and suffering. It entails going out, finding and helping those in suffering and danger and not merely in leading an exemplary life in a purely passive way of doing no wrong.'' 
   The life of Sir Nicholas is certainly an example of active goodness. Just as we will never forget the horrors and deaths of the Holocaust, we must also never forget the examples of bravery and heroism that still serve as our role models today. 
   On a personal note, as with many people in this country, much of my grandparents' family was killed in the Holocaust. I think many of us in this country understand and recognize the importance of a man who stood up as bravely as he did, and there were many others who did the same and risked their lives in doing this. 
   I thank the members of Congress today. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor the life and accomplishments of Sir Nicholas Winton, a hero to many and a model for all.
