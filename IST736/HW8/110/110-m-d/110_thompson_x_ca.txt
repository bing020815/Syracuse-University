<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule. The trigger is an arbitrary way to try and reform Medicare. Moreover, no hearings were ever held to determine whether the trigger was set at the right level of general revenues. The trigger was literally added in the back room during conference on the Medicare Modernization Act. It wasn't in the House bill. It wasn't in the Senate bill. 
   The chief actuary from the nonpartisan Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services testified before our committee that the trigger is judgmental, not scientific. He said there is no analytical rationalization for setting the trigger level funding at 45 percent. This trigger is politically, not policy, based. 
   We need to focus on system-wide issues to address costs in both private insurance and Medicare. The trigger is no substitute for real reform. We have taken important steps in this Congress to assure Medicare solvency. The CHAMP Act, which was passed last year by the House, included significant Medicare cost savings and extended the solvency of the hospital trust fund. 
   The bipartisan Medicare bill, the bill that became law after we overrode the President's veto, extended that solvency of Medicare and pushed back the date the trigger is pulled, while providing $18 billion in beneficiary improvements for seniors.  
   I urge everyone to support this rule change so we can continue to work towards real reform in the next Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, PAYGO is a budget enforcement tool that has both a history of success and a history of bipartisan support. In its original form, PAYGO was part of an agreement between the first President Bush and a Democratic Congress. A Democratic President and Congress extended it in 1993, and a Democratic President and Republican Congress extended it in 1997. Unfortunately, it was allowed to expire in 2002 and the results have been a disaster. Deficits and debt have reached historic levels and the debt limit has been raised four times. 
   This rule takes the first step toward restoring fiscal responsibility in the Federal Government by requiring the House of Representatives to pay for the bills that we pass. 
   I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the passage of this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   I rise in opposition to this and any amendment that proposes to lift the moratorium on oil and gas leasing off our coast. 
   The moratorium has been a bipartisan, multi-State, bicoastal agreement for over 25 years, and as mentioned has been renewed annually since the 1980s. 
   The north coast of California along my district, and I want to point out that my district has the longest run of coastline, the most miles of coastline of any district in the lower 48 States, I want you to know that people don't want this moratorium lifted. And the businesses that operate up there can't afford to have this moratorium lifted. An oil or a gas spill off my district's coast could devastate one of the most unique marine ecosystems in the world, as well as the economy that depends upon it. 
   My north coast district is part of an upwelling zone found along the west coast. It's one of only four of these upwelling zones in the entire world. These upwelling zones bring nutrient-rich water to the surface, and they support an incredibly abundant and productive marine life, including fish. The ecosystem also supports some of the largest and the most economic fishing industries in the world. A spill in this area would be absolutely devastating. 
   The north coast of California also supports a large tourism industry, and that industry is vital to our local economy, our State economy, and it contributes mightily to our national economy. It's dependent upon pristine coves, pristine beaches and spectacular views, all of which would be threatened if this moratorium were to be lifted. 
   In addition, given the rural and rugged nature of my congressional district, an oil or a gas spill would be disastrous to an even greater extent because of the limited accessibility to get in and clean that up, as well as the limited resources that would be readily available for cleaning up a disaster of this magnitude. 
   Mr. Chairman, the north coast waters provide economic and biological benefits to our entire country, and they must be protected. Lifting this moratorium, as pointed out by previous speakers, does nothing to lessen our dependency on oil and gas. And more important, it does nothing to increase the research and use of alternative energy sources.     
   This amendment, and all of the other amendments that are proposing to lift this moratorium, need to be rejected.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for recognizing me for time. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, as a combat veteran, from the bottom of my heart, I say thank you to the brave men and women who have served in Iraq, each with great distinction. 
   Our troops have done an outstanding job. They have done all that has been asked of them and more. They have performed with the utmost professionalism, making all of us very proud. 
   Now, I believe it is past time that we start bringing these brave men and  women home. They should be home with their families, not in the middle of Iraq's civil war. Moreover, we shouldn't be sending more troops into Iraq's civil war. Some of our servicemembers have been on two, three, and even four tours of duty in Iraq already. 
   This escalation would put too much strain on our military and not just our troops. Much of our military's equipment is damaged. It will take years and billions of dollars to repair it and replace it. Nearly every Reserve and National Guard member has been mobilized. The escalation is in no one's best interest. 
   Two weeks ago I joined with my colleague PATRICK MURPHY from Pennsylvania, a decorated Army captain who served in Iraq, to introduce binding legislation to begin a phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. Our bill, which has already attracted 20 co-authors from both sides of the aisle and has a companion bill in the Senate, provides a practical and comprehensive strategy for ending our military involvement in Iraq. It sets a firm deadline for phased redeployment of our troops beginning May 1 with all combat brigades out by March 31 of 2008. It provides a concrete plan for shifting security responsibilities to where they belong: with the Iraqis. 
   I have visited with our troops in Iraq, and I have talked to those who have been training the Iraqi security forces. They have told me that the U.S. troops have finished their job and that Iraq needs to step up and start securing their country. Americans cannot continue to do it for them. 
   Our bill recognizes that the President's escalation plan is a continuation of his failed ``stay the course'' slogan and it would not allow the increase of troop levels without congressional approval. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States cannot win the peace in Iraq. The Iraqis must be the ones to do that. Our bill recognizes this reality and creates a surge in diplomacy, not troops, by creating a special U.S. envoy that will help build relationships between Iraq and their neighbors. Our bill is a strategy for success in Iraq and is the best way to bring our brave men and women home as quickly and safely as possible. 
   While I strongly believe that today we should be debating and passing our binding solution, H.R. 787, I know that this week's debate is the first real debate we have had on Iraq in more than 4 years. In this week alone, we will more than quadruple the amount of time given to debate this war since it began. 
   Thank you, Speaker Pelosi, for bringing this important matter to the floor. This resolution is a critical step in getting our men and women out of this ugly mess, a full blown civil war in Iraq. I support today's resolution, which joins with the American people in sending the President a loud and clear message that escalation is not the answer. We need to focus on getting our troops out of Iraq as safely and quickly as possible and making sure that the Iraqis step up and assume the security responsibilities for their country. 
   I also rise to tell those who have served, those who are serving in Iraq today, and their proud families thank you. Your Nation thanks you for your great service to our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (PROVIDING EXCEPTION TO LIMIT ON MEDICARE RECIPROCAL BILLING ARRANGEMENTS -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, this is a very important bill. There are almost 3,000 physicians that are serving our country in the Reserves and the National Guard. And, as has been pointed out, when these folks are deployed and they leave, just like every other person in the Guard and Reserves that is deployed, they leave their families, they leave their businesses at home, and they go over and they serve their country. But there is just one thing different with these doctors; when they are deployed, they also leave behind their patients. And these are patients who depend upon the medical care they get from that great American who is now serving his or her country, and these patients can't go without a doctor. 
   The way the rules are now, the physician has to line up someone to take their patients in their absence, and they can only do this for 60 days. This doesn't work. It is bad for the doctors and it is bad for the patients. What we are trying to do is to waive that 60-day requirement so the physicians can line up one doctor to take their Medicare patients while they are serving our country in Afghanistan or in Iraq.     
   And it's a temporary measure. It's only good through this year. So we can, in fact, establish a permanent fix. And this bill has been vetted all through the different committees, and the Ways and Means Committee, both the chairman and the ranking member are very aware of this bill. And my good friend and committee colleague and war hero Sam Johnson has signed up on this as a coauthor, recognizing the plight of both the physicians who are serving, and their patients and their practices at home. And it's important that we fix this now and then continue to work on the permanent fix so we can make sure that no doctors and no patients who are caught in this vise go without medical care, or doctors, while serving their country, lose their practices. 
   And I just want to say a special thank you to Dr. Bradley Clair of Lakeport, California, my constituent, who brought this to my attention. And  he's ready to be deployed on his third tour. He'll be going to Iraq. So we need to fix it for him, for the other doctors, and patients who are exposed because of this problem. We need to fix it permanently. And this is the first step in doing so. 
   Sam, thank you for your help and your friendship on this and other important issues.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (BLUE DOG COALITION DEFICITS AND DEBT BACKGROUND -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Arkansas, and I thank the gentleman from Arkansas and I appreciate your leadership on this issue. 
   I don't come to the floor often on Special Orders, but I think today this issue is so critically important not  only for the American taxpayers but for the men and women who are serving so bravely in Iraq, and this is such a long overdue issue, as the gentleman mentioned, I helped write this bill but this came about after two Congresses of my own bill, the Iraq War Funding Accountability Act, that in the last Congress, as you know, was a Blue Dog-endorsed measure. That was an attempt to bring about accountability in Iraq in regard to the moneys that are spent by contractors in the reconstruction areas taking place in Iraq. 
   Unfortunately, we were not allowed under the last Congress or the last majority to bring this measure forward so we could debate it, so we could discuss it, so we could vote on it. But fortunately, with the new leadership in Congress, this has become an issue that has not only been discussed and debated but an issue that is going to be included in the bill that we have before us this week. And it's just so long overdue on the part of the American taxpayers and the men and women who are serving who, because this money is misspent, misdirected, sometimes lost, are going without the equipment that they need. 
   Every Member in this House has heard from family members and friends about their loved ones serving in Iraq who require supplies purchased by family members and friends and sent to them, everything from boots to protective gear, to the proper sunglasses, to supplies. It's absolutely inappropriate, and as long as we continue to misappropriate money and allow this to fall into the area of waste, fraud and abuse, and in sometimes criminal neglect or criminal negligence, this issue is only going to be exacerbated and the stories are just far too numerous. 
   We've heard the little stories that, in fact, some of these contractors are selling soda pop at $45 a case to the men and women who are serving in Iraq to the same contractors who are charging $100 to do a 15-pound bag of laundry, to the bigger issue, such as trucks, trucks that are burned in place because there's minor repair problems needed, to even bigger issues such as pallets of money, I think it was $12 billion that just disappeared in Iraq. And we have been trying to get a handle on this for a long time, and every effort that we have made has been short-stopped in this Congress, and finally, we are going to be able to get it out. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have here a Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction Report. This is a report that's issued quarterly to Congress.     
   It tells us very, very little about what's happening. It will tell us by contractor name how much we are obligated to them. It will tell us by contractor name how much they have expended. It will tell us by contractor name the percentage of increase in these expenditures, but it doesn't tell us how the contract was let, why the contract was necessary, and, if, in fact, the work being done was, in fact, completed. 
   This report represents a snapshot from 30,000 feet, no attempt at all to drill down and find the answers that the taxpayers and the servicemembers deserve. I have another report here about the construction by a contractor of the Baghdad police academy, obviously built in Baghdad. These pictures are worth 1,000 words. They show the fact that the work was done, shoddy workmanship. They show, in fact, that the supplies that were used by these contractors were inappropriate supplies, faulty, substandard supplies. This isn't pointed out in the quarterly report. 
   These are the things that we need to know, and I am just proud to be a member of the Blue Dogs who exist for one reason and one reason only, the one common thread that runs through the entire Blue Dog organization, and that's fiscal responsibility. It's fiscally irresponsible to continue to ignore these very real problems. It's fiscally improper to adopt this measure, to insist on accountability by those who are being paid just gross sums of money to do, in some instances, inappropriate, ineffective, substandard work. 
   I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for yielding, and I appreciate your leadership in helping get this measure signed into law and bringing accountability to these outrageous incidents that are taking place in Iraq today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Speaker, in my district, over 30 wineries and countless homes and businesses have already gone solar, and more are looking to do the same every day. We need to build on this momentum by extending the solar investment tax credit. 
   Solar business owners in my district are feeling the effects of not having this extension. Commercial and large residential sales of solar technology have ground to a halt because of the uncertainty over the solar investment tax credit extension. One local business owner told me that several wineries and small businesses have stopped plans to install solar technology because of this delay. Expanding solar is, first and foremost, about promoting renewable energy and fighting global climate change. 
   But this bill has a critical economic impact as well. 110,000 green jobs, new green jobs, will be created in the solar industry with this bill. The multiplier effect of economic growth by this bill will create an additional 330,000 jobs throughout our country in sectors outside of the solar industry. California alone will get over 200 of those jobs. 
   In these troubled economic times, we need to do all that we can to add jobs and move towards energy independence. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this vital bill which will move us one step closer to a strong, green economy. And don't forget it's paid for as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, I rise in strong support of the bill that is before us today. First and foremost, I want to point out that every Member on this floor, every Member knows that the brave men and women of our military have done a fantastic job, and every Member on this floor supports the brave men and women serving our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, too many of those brave men and women have been doing a fantastic job for way too many tours. Multiple tours. The last time I was in Iraq, I had lunch with a group of soldiers from California, one of whom was a firefighter from the North Bay in California, and he said, I used to have a house in your district, but I don't anymore. My ex-wife has it now. I said, I am sorry to hear that. He said, well, this is my fourth tour. I couldn't expect much else. 
   Our men and women have been put under a tremendous strain for far too long. Our military equipment has been depleted. Over $100 billion is needed to bring our military equipment up to standard. Our combat readiness has been depleted. This bill, this bill is about refocusing our area; to transition, transition our effort into force protection, diplomatic protection, counterterrorism, refocus our effort looking into the future for future problems that we may have. It's long past time to refocus our efforts; it's long past time to transition. 
   This bill does represent a change. We heard from the previous speaker that there wasn't much change. Mr. Speaker and Members, if there wasn't any change in this bill, we wouldn't be facing the opposition from the other side that we are facing tonight. This bill represents major change. 
   This bill represents a policy change that the American people are demanding. They demanded it in the November election; they demand it today. It's long past time for this transition to take place. This war can't go on forever. We know that on this side of the aisle and we know it on the other side of the aisle. 
   A lot of comparisons have been made tonight with Vietnam. I want to make just one. I served in Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. I didn't do anything exceptional. I showed up; I did my job. But there came a time in past Congresses that it was known that we were going to leave Vietnam, and from the time that we knew that our colleagues, our past colleagues knew that we were going to leave Vietnam, until we actually left Vietnam, 21,000 Americans died. 
   They knew, our colleagues in past Congresses knew that we couldn't sustain that. We weren't going to be in Vietnam forever. They knew we had to leave. From the time they absolutely knew it on this floor until we left, 21,000 brave American men died in Vietnam. I was one of the lucky ones. I was only wounded. I lost a lot of friends. We lost a lot of fellow Americans. 
   We cannot make that same mistake. We know that the Iraq war cannot go on forever. We know that on both sides of the aisle. It's time for a major policy change. This bill represents that major policy change. I urge everyone to vote ``aye'' for the underlying bill.

   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, my district--California's First Congressional District--provides ample evidence of the importance of renewable energy. My district is home to The Geysers, the largest complex of geothermal power plants in the world--which can generate enough energy to run over 750,000 homes. My district is also home to California's best wine country and wineries that use solar systems to generate all of their electricity. 
   This legislation extends and improves Federal incentives for renewable energy production so that States across America can follow California's lead. 
   We extend the tax credit for the production of biomass, geothermal, wind, and many other types of renewable energy. We extend the solar investment tax credit for 8 years providing long-term stability to that industry. We expand existing and create new incentives for taxpayers to make their homes and their businesses more energy efficient. And we make an investment in technology known as ``smart meters''--tools that will allow consumers to better manage their electricity usage during peak hours. 
   I have some concerns with the language in this section that refers to net metering, but I am confident that we can use the conference process to clarify these specific provisions. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes a critical investment renewable energy, and it does so without increasing the Federal deficit by a dime. 
   The new Democratic Leadership has made a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility and this legislation meets the rigorous Pay-As-You-Go requirements of the 110th Congress. 
   I am proud of this investment in alternative energy and I urge an aye vote on this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3, legislation to expand Federal research on devastating diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, and various cancers. 
   When President Bush announced in 2001 that Federal funds would be available for research performed using currently existing embryonic stem cell lines, I truly believed we had begun to open the door for life-saving research. Unfortunately for all Americans, less than a quarter of those lines proved suitable for research. As a result, research conducted in the United States has slowed considerably. 
   Federal restrictions on new lines have dashed the hopes of millions of Americans who are impacted by life-threatening illnesses stem cell research may cure. In addition, America is losing top medical researchers and scientists to other nations without such restrictions. 
   A handful of States have stepped in where the Federal Government has failed. My home state of California was the first to act, passing a ballot initiative in 2005 that authorized $3 billion in funding for embryonic stem cell research. I strongly supported that ballot initiative, and I would like to acknowledge the other States that have stepped up to the plate in a similar fashion. 
   Last year, I voted with 237 of my colleagues in the House and 63 Senators to pass Federal legislation to fund stem cell research. Tragically, the President ignored the will of the Congress and the American people by casting the only veto of his administration against this bill. 
   I am very proud that the Democratic majority has made facilitating this life-saving research a cornerstone of our agenda. Today's  vote signifies a Federal commitment to exploring every possible option available for curing these terrible illnesses. 
   Today, we cast a vote for hope. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.

   It was very difficult to watch the former majority allow the national debt to grow to record heights. Today, I am proud that the new Democratic leadership has said no to deficit spending. 
   The CHAMP Act is emblematic of that shift. It is completely paid for. The CHAMP Act guarantees that both eligible children and Medicare seniors can access qualify health care. 
   Make no mistake. Without this legislation, 5 million new kids won't be able to get health care, and millions more already in the program will see their benefits cut. 
   Without this legislation, physicians will take the biggest rate cut in the history of the Medicare program. 
   Without this legislation, Medicare benefits that are critical to rural communities will expire. 
   Today, with the passage of the CHAMP Act, Congress has taken an historic step. So be a champion for kids, be a champion for seniors and be a champion for common sense.

And when delayed on the tarmac, it will ensure that these folks have clean and safe water, proper air circulation, and clean and working restrooms. 
   This is a great success for the flying public, and I want to thank everyone for making this happen. But I want to remind everyone that our job is not done. We are going to have to continue to provide the oversight to ensure that the airlines and Department of Transportation do their jobs and that these provisions do, in fact, provide the protections that these people flying deserve.

   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for all your work on this bill and all that you have done over the years for both veterans and those currently serving in the military. I value greatly all the work that you have done. But as Mr. Rehberg said, 45 years ago, the Department of Defense began more than 50 chemical and biological weapons tests on U.S. servicemen without their knowledge. The government called these top secret tests Project SHAD. For the next 40 years, the Department of Defense denied Project SHAD even took place. 
   Ten years ago, I was able to prove that in fact they did take place, and the DOD said they only used simulants and at no time were these veterans exposed to anything harmful. Finally, after 3 more years of work, the DOD admitted they used live and extremely dangerous agents, such as Vx nerve gas and sarin. 
   More alarming than the lies and the coverup, we are not giving these veterans the care they need and deserve today. A recent Associated Press article revealed that only 6 percent of claims made by Project SHAD veterans and other veterans involved in these secret government tests have been accepted by the VA. That is only 39 out of 641 claims. These brave men served our country and they served it with distinction, and in return they were unknowingly used as human guinea pigs by their own government. Now they are denied care. 
   The extension of treatment authority would go a long way towards increasing the VA's dismal record in helping our veterans exposed to these harmful agents, a record that the veterans service associations in this country have called shocking, disgraceful and disappointing. 
   I hope that the chairman can assure me that he will work together with us to find the appropriate vehicle to extend this important provision.

   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, today we're debating legislation that will provide middle-class families with tax relief from the AMT tax, 23 million taxpayers. We'll pass this legislation, offering AMT relief to middle-class families without increasing the Federal deficit. 
   My good friend from Wisconsin said earlier that this sets a new precedent. Yes, it does. We're going to be paying for this tax relief. That is precedent setting. To do otherwise would be an abdication of our responsibilities, both as legislators, and as stewards of our Nation's finances. 
   This administration has presided over 7 years of fiscal mismanagement. Spending has skyrocketed. Entitlements have expanded. Taxes have been cut without any regard to the bottom line.     
   As a result, our budgets haven't balanced, our surpluses turned into deficits, our national debt exploded, and our borrowing from other countries more than doubled. 
   If there was ever a time when fiscal discipline was necessary, it's today. 
   From day one, this Democratic majority has pledged our commitment to budget enforcement. One of our first acts as a new majority was to implement PAYGO rules. The position of this House and this majority has not changed. Congress must pay as we go, and we pay for this tax relief today by closing loopholes which allows tax avoidance for wealthy folks who move their money offshore, and we take what we gain from closing that loophole and in turn we pay for middle-class tax relief. Twenty-three million people will be hit with a tax increase if we don't pass this. 
   This legislation provides responsible tax relief. It does not increase the deficit and it deserves our vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Speaker, this is about health care for kids. It's an important and humane bill that's illustrative of who we are as Americans. It's paid for, and moreover, it saves us money. It saves us money by keeping kids out of the emergency room, and anytime that you can prevent or cure an illness before it becomes acute, that saves us money as well. 
   It's bipartisan, not only in the House and the Senate, but 43 Governors have endorsed this measure. Over 80 percent of the American people support the SCHIP program.  
   We should not let the President deny health care to 10 million kids of working moms and dads. We're better than that. We need to override this veto.

   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding and both him and the ranking member from California for accepting this amendment. 
   This is an important amendment that is a first step in solving a very serious problem on our military bases both here in the States and abroad; and it is a problem that, unfortunately, spills over into our communities. And this is the issue of members of criminal street gangs joining the military and getting the training that they get in the military and now, unfortunately,  on the battlefield, and then bringing that back into the community and deploying those tactics on the streets in our neighborhoods. 
   This is a serious problem. It is documented. The FBI has a report. This is a problem that we need to get ahead of and stop before we have more serious problems than we do already. 
   I thank the chairman and ranking member for accepting this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (THE SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SELF-DETERMINATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank all of you who have taken time to come to the floor tonight to talk about this very, very important issue, an issue that impacts all of our districts, and most important the people that live within our districts. 
   Mr. Speaker, and Members of this House, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act was created to provide critical education and transportation funding for all of the counties that do not receive property tax from lands managed by the National Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. 
   This program was enacted by this Congress to compensate local governments for the tax exempt status of these public lands. The law authorizing these payments, as you have heard tonight, expired at the end of fiscal year 2006. 
   And all of the counties that are touched by this issue received their last payment on December 2 of 2006. If we do not reauthorize this funding by the 15th of March, county school districts will have to fire teachers, and reduce critical education programs. 
   Counties will be forced to slash their transportation budgets. My Congressional district is heavily impacted by this issue, because of over 1.2 million acres that are managed by the National Forest Service. 
   The National Forest Service acreage in my district is twice the size of the State of Rhode Island, and every single acre is exempt from property tax. No county in my district will be hurt more than Del Norte County. I have a map of Del Norte County, not wanting to be outdone by my friends with their visuals, but no county will be hurt more in my district than Del Norte County, where nearly 80 percent of the county, 80 percent of all of the land within the county is owned by our Federal Government. 
   Jan Moorehouse, the Superintendent of the school district up in Del Norte, and she was I think very, very succinct in pointing out the problem. I will just tell you what she said. I cannot say it any better. 
   She said, the loss of funding is heart wrenching and carries an enormous impact on our ability to fund critical education programs for our youth. This is our future leaders. These are the people that will serve in Congress, serve in the State legislature, run the businesses, be on the city council, the people that will make the money to generate the greatness that our country is known for.     
   And we are taking money right out of their education, the things that will benefit them the most. Without this funding, the school district will have to increase their class size and lay off as many as 25 teachers. And that may not seem a lot to big city school districts, but up here it is nearly 10 percent of the entire teaching faculty. With more students and less teachers, this will dramatically reduce the student to teacher ratio and shortchange our kids.  
   In addition to the loss of faculty, Del Norte County School District will have to close their art and music programs, and some of the smaller schools in our county will have to close completely because they won't have the money to keep the doors open. Now, this is going to require that the school district bus students who live far from town travel over an hour each way to school on seasonably treacherous rural mountain roads. 
   Other county school districts in my district will also be hit hard and will have to eliminate teachers and staff for early literacy programs, special education and arts education. The Klamath-Trinity School District on the Hoopa Indian Reservation will have to lay off eight teachers, nearly 15 percent of their entire faculty. 
   And as I mentioned earlier, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act also provides critical funding for county transportation needs. Again, this is because the counties do not receive property tax from land managed by the National Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Humboldt County in my district has over 1,200 miles of county roads. The funding this program provides represents a large portion of that county's road maintenance budgets. Humboldt County has a maintenance backlog of over $150 million. Many other rural counties have similar backlogs, and the loss of this funding is going to be devastating. 
   Back in Del Norte County, the transportation money from this program represents 20 percent of the county road budget. And to add insult to injury, 40 percent of the county roads in Del Norte County are within the national forest. So the county is responsible for maintaining the roads in the very areas that are exempt from property taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, I urge this Congress to reauthorize and to fund this very important program as soon as possible. It is unconscionable for the Federal Government to walk away from our obligation to help these rural counties. Rural counties depend on these funds. They have no other option. We made a commitment, and it is up to us to follow through on that commitment. 
   Again, I thank you for taking the time to put this Special Order together and help us convince all of our colleagues how necessary and how important this program is and how critically important these funds are to a large area within our great country.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH INTO HYDROCEPHALUS -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am here today to ask all of my colleagues to support this resolution. Hydrocephalus is an abnormal buildup of fluid in the brain, and it affects nearly 1 million Americans. Without treatment, hydrocephalus is fatal, but when treated, most people with this condition can lead full and productive lives. 
   I became aware of this condition through a constituent and a friend of mine, Cynthia Solomon, who has a family member who suffers from this condition. Cynthia struggled to find information about hydrocephalus and wanted to connect with other affected families. So she cofounded the first patient advocacy organization for this condition, the Hydrocephalus Association. 
   As anyone who has been affected by this condition can tell you, the symptoms are many and they vary from person to person. Excess fluid in the brain can cause head enlargement, blurred vision, seizures, learning disabilities and impaired physical development. In older adults, symptoms can mimic dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, often leading to a misdiagnosis and a delay in receiving critical and proper treatment. 
   Doctors do not yet understand the specific causes of hydrocephalus. However, the current treatment was developed back in 1952 and involves surgically inserting a shunt into the brain. This carries serious risk of shunt failure, infection and obstructions. Overdrainage is also a threat. This can trigger a vertical collapse, causing blood vessels to tear and possibly resulting in a subdural hematoma. 
   Improvement in this treatment is long overdue, and with additional research, we can make it happen. 
   The National Institutes of Health recognizes this need and recently organized their first ever conference on hydrocephalus. This has resulted in efforts to initiate new collaborative research projects and an expansion of their focus on the development of new treatments. 
   This resolution commends the NIH for their action and encourages them to continue their collaborative efforts. It also calls for additional research into this serious condition. 
   However, we cannot depend solely on Federal efforts to expand awareness about hydrocephalus. I commend the Hydrocephalus Association and other groups for their commitment to patient advocacy and public education. Partnerships between these groups, health care providers and the government will bring us closer to our common goal: improved treatment of this condition. 
   I would like to say a special thanks to Dory Kranz, who is the current director of the Hydrocephalus Association, for her help in putting this resolution together and her ongoing work in this regard. 
   I ask my colleagues for their support of this resolution so we can further research into this very serious and important condition and we can bring about improved treatment to those individuals who are affected by this very, very serious and debilitating condition.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (CHARITY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ramstad for their work on this very important bill, a bill that I am proud to be the coauthor of, and I rise today in strong support of this bill. 
   The provisions of this bill will play a vital role in allowing charitable organizations to better serve our communities. In fact, the two largest organizations representing charities, Independent Sector and the Council on Foundations, have both endorsed this critical legislation because it allows charities to better fulfill their valuable mission. 
   To help explain the practical impact of this bill, I would like to share the story of the Doyle Trust which benefits thousands of hardworking families. 
   Doyle Trust was founded 59 years ago to serve the students of Santa Rosa Junior College in Sonoma County, California. On Frank Doyle's death, he established the Doyle Trust which he funded with his 51 percent share in the Exchange Bank. Doyle created his trust so that dividends for his bank stock would go to a scholarship fund to help students attending this junior college. 
   Last year alone, more than $5 million in scholarships for 5,500 Santa Rosa Junior College students was donated by the Doyle Trust. It is not unusual to find three generations of the same family who have benefited from the Doyle Trust scholarships. The Doyle Trust is an institution in Sonoma County, and its contribution to the community makes a real difference in the lives of working families. 
   Without this legislation, the mission of the Doyle Trust may be undermined because provisions of the Pension Protection Act could force the trust to sell its assets.     
   The unintended consequence of the Pension Protection Act would be to end Doyle Trust's ability to continue providing scholarships to thousands of students at Santa Rosa Junior College. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help us pass this bill to ensure that future generations of Sonoma County families can benefit from the generosity of the Doyle Trust.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT MONDAVI -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of the late Robert Mondavi, a founding father of the American wine industry. 
   Mr. Mondavi was born to Italian immigrants in June 1913. He graduated from Stanford University and joined his family in running Charles Krug Winery in my hometown of St. Helena. 
   Nearly three decades later, he founded the Robert Mondavi Winery to make his dream of creating world-class California wines a reality. Only a few years later, he released a Cabernet Sauvignon that opened the eyes of the world to the potential of the Napa Valley region. 
   He went on to create the first French-American wine venture, the first of many international partnerships. 
   His work made him known throughout the world as a premier winemaker and businessman. His pursuit of excellence and passion for winemaking could be found in every sip of a Robert Mondavi vintage. 
   Through innovation and determination, he redefined American wines and helped propel the birth of one of our Nation's fastest growing industries. Robert Mondavi's leadership is irreplaceable. 
   But to me and many others, he was best known--and loved--as a dear friend, a pillar of the community, and a much-admired philanthropist. 
   I was fortunate to know Mr. Mondavi my whole life. I grew up with his children and I later worked with him on issues important to the wine community. Of all his accomplishments, it was his commitment to our community that I found most awe inspiring. 
   A lifelong student himself, Bob established the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science at the University of California at Davis so that future generations could continue improving his craft. 
   He also established the Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for Performing Arts at UC Davis. He was a leading force in the creation of Copia: The American Institute for Food, Wine, and the Arts in downtown Napa. He helped found the Napa Valley Wine Auction, which raises millions of dollars to help many of our local charities. He was also a strong and steady voice for the conservation of our farmlands. 
   Mr. Mondavi's legacy, can be found throughout the world. But it is most treasured at home. My district would not be what it is today without him. 
   I will miss him greatly. My thoughts and prayers are with Margrit, sons Tim and Michael, daughter Marcia and his entire family. 
    Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that this resolution serves as a tribute to the unparalleled life of Robert Mondavi.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and also for his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's vote is about maintaining access to health care for seniors and people with disabilities. Although this bill stops cuts to physician payments, it is not about how much we pay doctors. This bill is about access to health care for patients, people that need medical attention. 
   The data are convincing. Over 60 percent of California physicians would leave Medicare or stop taking new Medicare patients if these cuts are implemented. In rural California, like  rural America, we are already facing a physician shortage crisis. The impact on seniors would be devastating if Medicare beneficiaries lose access to thousands of physicians in California because of this cut. 
   Fortunately, we can prevent those cuts and further strengthen Medicare through expanded preventive health services, enhanced low income protections and other improvements to help people in need of care by passing H.R. 6331. 
   There may not be bipartisan support in this House for this bill, but there is bipartisan support across the country for this bill. I urge everyone to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. I want to thank both Chairman Reyes and Ranking Member Hoekstra for their leadership and making sure we had a good bipartisan bill that benefits the people of this great country, the staff that worked so hard to make this happen on both sides of the aisle, and, in particular, the ranking member of my subcommittee, Mr. Rogers, for working together to make this a good bill. 
   Human intelligence, or HUMINT, is one of the most difficult but effective means of understanding our adversaries' plans and intentions. This bill adds funds improve HUMINT collection on counterterrorism and other critical national security challenges. It also adds HUMINT resources for global challenges, such as the political and humanitarian crisis in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The events unfolding in those regions demonstrate that we must always have the resources to understand these threats. 
   The information we collect, however, is only useful if analysts translate it into actionable intelligence for policymakers and law enforcement. For that reason, this bill provides resources to improve intelligence analysis across the entire intelligence community. It also authorizes additional personnel to support State and local law enforcement so they can better address the challenges of border security, counterterrorism and infrastructure protection. 
   And the bill also calls for fiscal restraint. As Mr. Rogers mentioned, since its creation in 2004, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has grown into a bloated bureaucracy that hinders, rather than facilitates, intelligence complexes and analysis. This bill adds an amendment that Mr. Rogers and I introduced in committee that prevents further growth in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, this legislation provides critical intelligence resources for our troops and strengthens oversight of intelligence support to the military. Many of us have visited our troops in Iraq, and we have seen firsthand that good intelligence saves American lives on the battlefield. 
   This bill will greatly improve our intelligence capabilities and enhance our national security. I urge all my colleagues to support it. 
   In closing, I too want to add my name to those who are very appreciative and thankful for our friends, Mr. Everett and Mr. Cramer, who did a great job on the committee. They were a pleasure to work for, they are fine Americans, and we are going to miss them.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE AND WESTERN STATES EMERGENCY UNFINISHED BUSINESS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, this bill contains emergency disaster funding that is needed because of a commercial fishing disaster that happened last year and was not dealt with last year. It has devastated fishing families and related businesses up and down the California and the Oregon coast. Moreover, this disaster was the result of this administration's failed and illegal water policy. This water policy caused a virtual shutdown of the entire commercial fishing, salmon fishing season last year. And their water policy has been unanimously ruled arbitrary and capricious and a violation of the Endangered Species Act by not one, not two, but three different courts. 
   Sadly, fishing families throughout my district and other parts of the coast have lost their boats. They have lost their homes. And they can't wait, as the ranking member suggested, for the 2008 funding cycle. The ones who still have their boats can't afford to buy fuel to go fishing if they do get a fishing season this year. 
   Marinas throughout my district have gone out of business. The few that are left open have had to lay off up to 80 percent of their employees. Fishing lodges throughout the coastal area are near bankruptcy. And all of this because of a failed water policy and the previous majority's failure to deal with this disaster declaration last year, a disaster declaration that was made by the Secretary of Commerce. These folks can't wait. 
   Also, as previously mentioned, this important bill contains rural school funding that is critical to school districts throughout rural America. And they are entitled to this funding because the Federal Government owns the property that would otherwise generate taxes that would fund these schools. This funding goes for schools and for the road maintenance in these areas. 
   I have one county that has 80 percent federally owned property. And to talk about rubbing salt on a wound, not only do they get their school funding and their road maintenance funding taken away, but they are still required to maintain the roads throughout this federally owned property. This is an incredibly important bill that needs to be passed and should not be vetoed by this administration. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I am pleased to stand in strong support of this authorization bill tonight. I believe that this bill strengthens our capabilities to recognize and counter threats to the United States, both terrorist threats from groups like al Qaeda and the strategic challenges present in regions all over the world, including the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. This bill ensures that U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will continue to receive the intelligence support they need to conduct their missions. 
   The bill authorizes the largest intelligence budget ever. It also provides full funding for the intelligence programs related to Afghanistan and for U.S. efforts to counter terrorist threats. 
   Madam Chairman, terrorism and the war in Iraq are critical issues, and they have required intelligence agencies to divert resources away from other strategic challenges. This bill funds initiatives to collect better intelligence on those that pose threats to our country. It also adds funds to enhance coverage of other challenges, such as emerging threats in Africa and Latin America, and to ensure that America is not caught by surprise in the future. 
   The bill makes significant investments to improve the quality of intelligence analysts. It provides resources to send more analysts overseas so they can gain the real world experiences in the countries that they study. It provides funds for expanded foreign language training that we all agree is needed, and the development of advanced technical tools so both analysts and collectors can better do their jobs. 
   The bill makes us safer by adding resources for counterintelligence investigations, and these provisions will help mitigate efforts by our adversaries to steal classified information and advanced technologies, keeping the U.S. policy options open and preserving our military edge. 
   Despite these additions, the bill promotes efficiency and accountability by cutting programs that lack clear objectives and measurable results. It also requires the CIA Inspector General to audit covert action programs, ensuring regular oversight. 
   Madam Chair, this legislation helps us fight terrorists; it supports our troops; and it enhances U.S. intelligence capabilities throughout the world. 
   I support this bill, and I strongly recommend that our colleagues do as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of California. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   This Congress created the Director of National Intelligence so he and a core staff could manage the activities of the different intelligence agencies. Congress did not intend to create a new bureaucracy. 
   Nevertheless, the office has expanded in size. Many members of the Intelligence Committee, myself included, as well as other colleagues in the House, are concerned that this growth will complicate, rather than streamline, the activities of the intelligence communities. Some Members have proposed limiting the number of people who can work for the DNI in order to stem this growth. 
   But I believe that such a measure, while satisfying on the surface, would have harmful consequences. It would eliminate a large number of analysts and planners, the experts who actually perform the core intelligence functions, not middle managers and bureaucrats. 
   The harshest impact would fall on DNI elements like the National Counterterrorism Center, which analyzes terrorism information and plans counterterrorism operations. This would happen because there are plans in play to shift personnel to this specific task. If this other amendment were to pass, it would truncate these very important efforts. These are the people who play critical roles in our efforts to combat terrorism, and our operators around the world cannot do their jobs without this critical backstopping. Preventing the DNI from adding staff to these missions would gut key counterterrorism capabilities. 
   The real issue, though, is not simply the number of people who appear on the DNI's balance sheet, the challenge is to have fewer people sitting behind desks in Washington and to place more intelligence officers in the field. This is a goal that I think we all share, even those with a competing amendment. They need to be in the field where they can collect needed intelligence and where they can catch terrorists. 
   The Intelligence Authorization Act will fund increases in the number of intelligence collectors at many agencies, but there is still not enough. To push the Intelligence Committee to get its staff out of the office and into the field, the amendment that I am offering would freeze the number of people working for the DNI at the level specified in the fiscal year 2007 Intelligence Authorization Act that was passed by this House. 
   The freeze wouldn't be lifted until the Director of National Intelligence provides the committee, the Intelligence Committees, one, a report on the number of analysts and collectors in each element of the Intelligence Community, and two, a plan to maximize the number of collectors across the community. This plan must be provided within 120 days of enactment. 
   With this information, the Intelligence Committee will be able to work with the DNI to ensure that he has the right mix of collectors, analysts, technical experts and other staff, and we will be able to press the DNI and the individual intelligence agencies to accelerate the recruitment, the training and the deployment of core collectors. 
   This amendment will enhance congressional oversight of intelligence activities and result in improvements to the Intelligence Community's ability to collect critical intelligence. 
   I am willing to work with, and we have worked with my colleague and friend from the committee on this issue. I believe that this amendment is the one that will allow us to best collect the information so we can, in fact, put together the best policy for America.  
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   As he and my other good friend and colleague, Mr. Hastings, has said, we all have the same goal, it's just, how do we get there? 
   We believe that by putting this freeze in place, requiring this information be provided to the committee, will allow us to best analyze this, know where these folks are and force the DNI to put them in the right spots. 
   The only other thing I would like to add is that it's important to note that the majority of this growth consists of transferring personnel who already work or should work for the DNI on to their books for better management and oversight. 
   I ask for your support of this amendment.

   Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding and also thank you for your great work on this bill, Mr. DeFazio, and thank you especially for paying for the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, county governments don't receive property tax for lands owned and controlled by the Federal Government. However, they are obligated to provide services in those areas. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act was created to compensate local governments for the tax exempt status of the public lands within their county. If we fail to reauthorize this important program, teachers will be laid off, kids will be short-changed on their education, and county roads will go unmaintained. 
   In my district, over 1.2 million acres are controlled by the Federal Government. The National Forest Service  land in my district is twice the size of the State of Rhode Island, and every acre, every acre is exempt from property tax. In one of my counties, 40 percent of the roads are within the National Forest. So that county is responsible for maintaining the roads that run through the very property that is exempt from the taxes that pay for our roads. 
   It's unconscionable for the Federal Government to walk away from this obligation to rural local governments. Rural counties have no other options. We have made a commitment on this issue. Now let's live up to our word.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4, and I am not here to claim that it will instantly bring seniors huge discounts on their drugs, but this legislation is an important first step, because it gives the Secretary one more tool to maximize savings for seniors and value for taxpayers. 
   It is important for another reason, lowering drug prices means that it will take seniors longer to hit the coverage gap, the donut hole, the period during which time they have to pay 100 percent of their drug costs. 
   Less than 25 percent of the drug plans in my district offer any sort of coverage during this donut hole period, and most of them have premiums of upwards of $100 a month. A lot of northern California seniors can't afford that. When they hit the coverage gap, they foot the entire bill, or they go without their medicine. 
   Allowing the Secretary to negotiate prices will complement, not replace, the negotiations being conducted by the private plans. It is one more tool that can be used to lower costs and prolong the amount of time it takes before seniors hit their donut hole. 
   This legislation does not create price controls, which I oppose, and it explicitly prevents the Secretary from setting a national formulary. Our Medicare program offers seniors choice and allows seniors access to the medicines that they need. This legislation will maintain that choice and access, and it is a good first step to bring about lower prices. 
   I support H.R. 4, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.
