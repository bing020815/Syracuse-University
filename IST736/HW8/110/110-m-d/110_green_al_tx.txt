<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (WE MUST MAKE THE MINIMUM WAGE A LIVING WAGE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, today the minimum wage will increase to $6.55 an hour. This is laudable. However, Madam Speaker, if the truth be told, the increase will be consumed because of inflation, higher gas prices, and higher food prices. 
   Madam Speaker, we must make the minimum wage a living wage. This is why I have introduced the Living American Wage Act, the LAW Act, such that we can have people who work full time always live above the poverty line.  
   We have people in the richest country in the world, a country where 1 out of every 33 persons is a millionaire, we have people living in poverty and working full time. No one should work full time and live below the poverty line. 
   We need to pass the Living American Wage Act, the LAW Act. The living wage should be the law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we take the final steps in the legislative process to accord the Honorable Dr. Michael E. DeBakey a Congressional Gold Medal. 
   While I am proud to be here at the revelation of this process while we are now revealing all that has taken place and all that has happened for us to have this great opportunity, I must confess that I was not there at the genesis of the process. But, Mr. Speaker, there is one person who has been a constant throughout the entirety of this process, and that one person, Mr. Speaker, is the Honorable Kay Bailey Hutchison, Senator from the great State of Texas. She has been consistent in that she has annually filed this bill to get it to this point, and she has been persistent in that she has insisted that we work together so as to cause the Honorable Dr. Michael E. DeBakey to have this opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I am the original sponsor of the House bill, H.R. 1154, to accord this Congressional Gold Medal, there are many other persons who must be thanked. I want to thank my chairman of the Financial Services Committee, the Honorable Barney  Frank, for the outstanding job that he has done to help get this piece of legislation, the bill that has already passed, out of the committee and to the floor. But he has also done an outstanding job in helping us to get the Senate bill to the floor, and for this we thank him. 
   I also would like to thank my colleagues Congressman Michael Burgess and Congressman John Culberson for the outstanding job that the two of them jointly performed in getting the necessary signatures to get this bill to the floor.     
   That would be the bill in the House, not the Senate bill. But I want to thank them for what they did because it took getting the House bill through to get us to the point where we can now get the Senate bill passed, such that we can accord the Gold Medal. 
   I would like to thank the entire Texas delegation. They have all thought highly of Dr. DeBakey, and they have worked with us to make sure that we were in a position to get this done. 
   We want to thank the 313 cosponsors of this legislation. Literally, we have gone to the floor of the House and we have talked to persons who agreed that the Honorable Dr. Michael E. DeBakey should be accorded this preeminent privilege and this great honor. 
   I want to thank the House leadership because the leadership made it possible for the fellowship to be in this position today. And again, we thank Senator Hutchison and all of the Members of the Senate who have helped us with this process. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Gold Medal has 535 judges, 100 in the Senate, 435 in the House, because each Member of the House and each Member of the Senate has a vote on the Congressional Gold Medal. And I am honored to say that, while we must receive 290 votes in the House and 67 votes in the Senate, we have exceeded the required numbers in both the House and the Senate. People were excited about the opportunity to accord the Honorable Dr. Michael E. DeBakey a Congressional Gold Medal. 
   What is a Congressional Gold Medal? It is the Nation's highest and most distinguished civilian award. It was originally awarded to military leaders for their service and later became a civilian medal. It is the congressional equivalent of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Each medal is unique. It is designed by the U.S. Mint and is duplicated in bronze for sale. 
   The Congressional Gold Medal has been awarded approximately 134 times to approximately 300 individuals. Some notable recipients include our first President, George Washington; General Andrew Jackson; the Wright brothers; Thomas Edison; Sam Rayburn, former Speaker of this august body; Sir Winston Churchill; Robert Kennedy; Lady Bird Johnson; Mother Teresa of India; Nelson Mandela; Rosa Parks; Pope John Paul, II; the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King; and the last recipients were the Tuskegee Airmen. I was honored to be present in the rotunda when they received their Congressional Gold Medal in April of 2006. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the oldest of five children, born of parents of Lebanese descent, has truly been an outstanding American. He was born in Louisiana in Lake Charles, performed his residency at Charity Hospital. Mr. Speaker, I am from Louisiana. I was born in New Orleans. I was born in Charity Hospital. And while it may be a bit of wishful thinking, there may be the possibility, or the possibility may exist, that I am a DeBakey baby and that he was performing his residency at Charity Hospital at the time that I was born. 
   Mr. Speaker, he was on the faculty of the Baylor College of Medicine from 1948 to 1993, where he chaired the Department of Surgery. He served as President and Chancellor of the Baylor College of Medicine. 
   And Mr. Speaker, I say from the bottom of my heart that I thank God for the Honorable Dr. Michael E. DeBakey. He has earned the right to receive a Congressional Gold Medal. He served his country in World War II, and he volunteered to perform this service. He helped to develop, while in the military, the mobile army surgical hospital, we know it as the ``MASH'' units. And Mr. Speaker, there is a TV program and a movie that was made popular because of the MASH units that were developed because of the Honorable Michael E. DeBakey. In fact, it may be said that, but for the Honorable Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, there might not be a MASH television series. 
   He helped to establish the VA Hospitals. He helped to establish the current Veterans Affairs medical system. He was one of the first to successfully perform a coronary bypass. He established the field of surgery for strokes. He led the movement to establish the National Library of Medicine. He performed the historic transplantation procedure, with a team of surgeons of course. He was the first person to successfully use a partial artificial heart to help patients who could not be weaned from the heart-lung machine following heart surgery. 
   He pioneered the field of telemedicine, with the first demonstration of open heart surgery transmitted overseas via satellite. He invented the Dacron tube, using his wife's sewing machine and fabric he purchased from a store in Houston, Texas. This, Mr. Speaker, was the first artificial artery. 
   He was a leader in the development of the artificial heart. He operated on more than 60,000 patients in Houston. He has published over 1,600 articles. He helped to establish health care systems around the world in Jordan, Morocco, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, to name a few countries. 
   He became one of the persons to work at the Baylor School of Medicine, to the extent that Baylor has recognized his unprecedented achievements by naming the DeBakey Heart Center in his honor. And also, the Baylor College of Medicine has named the Michael E. DeBakey Department of Surgery in his honor. 
   Dr. DeBakey is a great citizen, Mr. Speaker, not only of the United States but also of the world. He is a great humanitarian; he has helped rich and poor alike. If we did not have the Congressional Gold Medal, Mr. Speaker, we would have to create one for the Honorable Dr. Michael E. DeBakey. 
   On his 99th birthday, we called him to let him know that we had completed the process in the House in terms of passing the House bill so that we can move forward to this bill, and his comment was, ``I am so grateful that I am a citizen of the United States.'' Mr. Speaker, I believe that his life stands for the proposition that one person can not only impact the world, but can change the world for the good of all. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Burgess, for it was he who called this piece of legislation to my attention. And he has been steadfastly with me throughout the process, and I am honored to have worked on this piece of legislation with him and Congressman Culberson. 
   I also think that we would be remiss, Mr. Speaker, if we did not mention Mrs. DeBakey and the persons who are caring for him currently. We have had conversations with the persons caring for him. They have indicated that, of course, he was doing well when last we spoke to them, and they do an outstanding job of caring for Dr. DeBakey. 
   Earlier, I mentioned that he has had the Methodist Hospital DeBakey Heart Center named in his honor, and I may have misspoken and said Baylor, but it is Methodist. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this piece of legislation has received bipartisan as well as bicameral support. I had the honor of meeting with Senator Hutchison, and we talked about continuing the effort together to move this piece of legislation as quickly as possible through the process so that the President can sign it and get the actual award ceremony to take place. The President will now have 10 days to sign this bill. History will show us that at no time has a President refused to sign a Congressional Gold Medal. So my suspicion is that this President, who is from the State of Texas, will move expeditiously to sign the bill. After the bill has been signed, the U.S. Mint will meet with the sponsors and with interested parties, which may include family members, to discuss possible designs for the medal. 
   The Mint engravers will then prepare a series of sketches and possible designs for consideration. These designs will be commented on by the Commission of Fine Arts, and subsequently the Secretary of the Treasury will make the final decision as to the medal's design. The medal is created by the Philadelphia Mint. The medal will be in bronze. The gold medal, of course, will be the one presented to Dr. DeBakey, but there will be replicas in bronze to offset the cost of the medal, and arrangements will be made for the presentation of the gold medal, a ceremony to honor the Honorable Michael E. DeBakey. 
   Mr. Speaker, this has been one of the great pleasures of my life in terms of being in Congress, in fact, one of the great pleasures of my life period. But this is a high point in my congressional career. I am so honored that my friends have worked with me on this process and that Senator Hutchison has been there throughout the entirety of the process. We are committed to making this happen as expeditiously as possible. If Dr. DeBakey were here today, I am confident that he would continue to talk about how great it is to be a part of this great country that we know as the United States of America. 
   So I close by saying, God bless you, Dr. DeBakey, and thank you for what you have done to make life better for all of us, and God bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 
   I have to say this. I have to apologize to the gentleman, too, because for a moment, I thought I heard a disjointed syllogism because I couldn't make that connection. 
   This bill is needed by this country. This bill is going to help neighborhoods maintain their integrity. 
   And I have to ask one question: Where was the moral hazards argument when Penn Central got $7 billion? When Lockheed Martin was bailed out? When Franklin National Bank was bailed out? When Chrysler was bailed out? Continental Illinois? When Bear Stearns received its $29 billion plus a $13 billion loan? Where was the moral hazards argument?  
   It seems that this argument surfaces whenever poor people or whenever people who are living in the streets of life, whenever people who have not found their way into the well-off, the well-heeled, and the well-to-do, it seems that it tends to surface. I think that it's time for us to do for others what we can do for these major corporations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. I'd like to thank the chairman, BARNEY FRANK, for this outstanding piece of legislation. 
   Let me quickly say that Hope Now is good, which is what my friend referenced. Hope Now is good. However, help now is better. 
   We didn't give Penn Central hope now. We gave Penn Central a $7 billion bailout. Lockheed Martin got a $250 million bailout. Franklin National Bank, $1.7 billion bailout. Chrysler, $1.5 billion bailout. Continental Illinois, $4.5 billion bailout. Farm Credit System, $4 billion bailout. First Republic, $1 billion bailout. Major airlines, $5 billion bailout. Steel companies, $7 billion bailout. And Bear Stearns, if we talk about the bare facts, $29 billion, plus a $13 billion loan through J.P. Morgan, which makes a total of $42 billion, if we talk about the bare facts. 
   This is a good piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker. This piece of legislation is voluntary, as has been indicated. But more importantly, it is a guarantee, not a loan. It does allow FHA to guarantee loans, about $300 billion, and that's going to help a lot of families to stay in homes. But it will also help this economy. 
   This economy is right now in a credit crisis. And in this credit crisis we've got to realize that there is interconnectivity. There's an interconnectedness, that we are living in a world wherein we are related to each another in a certain way. In this crisis, Mr. Speaker, when one home in a community has a for sale sign up, it impacts other homes in the community. It impacts the tax base of the community. It impacts the lives of children who are going to school in the community. So this piece of legislation will help us to keep people in their homes, but it will help to maintain the community. We sleep in houses and live in neighborhoods. This legislation helps neighborhoods. 
   I would also add that flippers don't benefit because you have to be a resident of the property. The government maintains a lien on the property. And there's an amendment in this bill, the Watt-Vel&#225;zquez-Green amendment, which will help those persons who are being evicted, who happen to be tenants. Many persons who have their rent paid, their rent is paid, but they're being evicted because the owner of the property was foreclosed on. This amendment will help them to stay in their homes. 
   I ask that my colleagues please support this amendment, and please remember that we bailed out a lot of companies in this country. This is a hand up for a lot of people who are suffering and who may lose their homes, others who have their rent paid but who are about to be evicted.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, let's not forget that it was with the help of organized, unionized workers that we acquired the 40-hour work week, that we instilled child labor laws, that we have paid leave, that we have pensions, and that we have health care. 
   Madam Speaker, in a world where loyalty to workers is becoming an endangered species, the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act helps to level the playing field between industry and workers, and it will give workers a fair chance to organize and fight invidious outsourcing. Our jobs are being taken overseas. We need to have workers on the ground in a position to fight this. It will give workers an opportunity to preserve health benefits and an opportunity to protect pensions. 
   Workers are the first line of defense when it comes to protecting the standard of living that we have in this country. We must level the playing field and pass the Employee Free Choice Act. I encourage all of my colleagues to do so.  
   Madam Speaker, I stand here today in support of giving our working men and women a fair chance and a free choice to form a union. As one of 234 cosponsors of this legislation I can confidently tell the men and women who literally make this country run that you are not alone in your fight for higher wages, improved benefits, and better working conditions. I can confidently tell you that we understand that the right to unionize is the right to pursue the American dream. 
   It is as a result of unions that we can enjoy weekends with our families. It is as a result of unions that we can benefit from basic health and safety protections. It is as a result of unions that we can take advantage of family and medical leave. 
   Unfortunately, under the current labor law system, employers often use a combination of legal and illegal methods to silence employees who try to form unions. The law says that employers cannot intimidate, coerce, or fire employees for attempting to exercise their democratic rights. 
   Yet, in reality: Every 23 minutes a worker is illegally fired or discriminated against for their support of a union. 34 percent of employers coerce workers into opposing unions with bribes or special favors. 51 percent of employers illegally threaten to close down worksites if employees vote for union representation. 75 percent of employers hire anti-union consultants to help kill union organizing drives. 91 percent of employers force workers to attend intimidating one-on-one anti-union meetings with their supervisors. 
   Madam Speaker, some people say that liars figure and figures lie, but I want the American people to hear these figures and decide for themselves whether they believe that American workers should have the right to unionize: 
   Workers who belong to unions earn 30 percent more than non-union workers. Workers who belong to unions are 63 percent more likely to have employer-provided health care than non-union workers. Workers who belong to unions are 77 percent more likely to have jobs that provide short-term disability benefits than non-union workers. Workers who belong to unions are nearly 400 percent more likely to have guaranteed pensions than non-union workers. 
   This discrepancy is even more pronounced among women, African Americans, and Latinos: 
   Women in unions earn $9,300 more a year (31%) than their non-union counterparts. African Americans in unions earn $9,700 more a year (36%) than their non-union counterparts. Latinos in unions earn $11,300 more a year (46%) than their non-union counterparts. 
   It is astonishing that some would try to prevent some of the hardest working Americans the right to organize at a time when: 
   The average CEO in the United States makes more than 260 times the pay of the average worker. A CEO earns more in one day than an average worker earns in one year. 
   We have seen an increase in: 
   The number of people who are classified as poor (from 32 million in 2000 to 37 million in 2004). The number of low-income households paying more than half their income on housing (from 9.4 million to 11.6 million). The number of Americans who lack health insurance (from 40 million in 2000 to 46 million).  
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to hear the voices of our 60 million working brothers and sisters: Who say they want a voice at their workplace, Who say they want a choice at their workplace, Who say they want unions. 
   I urge my colleagues to join the distinguished Chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, GEORGE MILLER, and vote ``yes'' on the Employee Free Choice Act.   
   Employee Free Choice Act 
   SUMMARY 
   1. Certification on the Basis of Majority Sign-Up. Provides for certification of a union as the bargaining representative if the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) finds that a majority of employees in an appropriate unit has signed authorizations designating the union as its bargaining representative. Requires the board to develop model authorization language and procedures for establishing the validity of signed authorizations. 
   2. First-Contract Mediation and Arbitration. Provides that if an employer and a union are engaged in bargaining for their first contract and are unable to reach agreement within 90 days, either party may refer the dispute to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) for mediation. If the FMCS is unable to bring the parties to agreement after 30 days of mediation, the dispute will be referred to arbitration, and the results of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties for two years. Time limits may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. 
   3. Stronger Penalties for Violations While Employees Are Attempting to Form a Union or Attain a First Contract. Makes the following new provisions applicable to violations of the National Labor Relations Act committed by employers against employees during any period while employees are attempting to form a union or negotiate a first contract with the employer:

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, democrats in Congress have pushed to extend unemployment benefits since the beginning of the year, as the economy weakened, but have faced continued resistance from the Bush Administration. Nobody can argue that our economy is struggling. For five consecutive months, the U.S. economy has lost jobs, totaling 324,000. Over the last year, the number of unemployed workers has grown by 1.6 million. The number of people looking for work climbed to 8.5 million in May. Nearly 1 in 5 jobless workers (1.6 million) is long-term unemployed (jobless for more than 26 weeks). There are 200,000 more long-term jobless Americans now than when President Bush signed the last extension of unemployment benefits into law in 2002. 
   The airline industry has eliminated 22,000 jobs so far this year, more than in all of 2007, most recently at Continental (3,000 jobs) and United (up to 1,600 jobs), and the automobile industry continues to face job cuts, leading industries with announced layoffs in May with over 30,000. 
   In May, we had the biggest one-month jump in the unemployment rate in two decades. The unemployment rate surged to 5.5 percent from 5.0 percent--the biggest one-month jump in more than two decades (since February 1986) and climbing to the highest level in nearly four years (October 2004). The unemployment rate is now a full percentage point higher than a year ago. Families can wait no longer, and neither will this Congress. 
   Today, the House will take up H.R. 5749, the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act: 
   To immediately provide up to 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits in every state to workers exhausting the 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits. 
   In states with higher levels of unemployment (six percent or higher), an additional 13 weeks would be available, for a total of 26 weeks of extended benefits. 
   Relief would run through March 2009. 
   The bill would provide much-needed relief to 3.8 million unemployed workers to assist them with rapidly rising gas and food costs, while they continue to struggle to find work in the slowing economy. 
   Federal unemployment trust funds, which have more than enough reserves to cover the cost, will finance these benefits.  
   In Texas, this bill would help 160,239 unemployed workers. Extending these benefits is one of the most cost-effective and fast-acting ways to stimulate the economy because the money is spent quickly. According to the Congressional Budget Office, every $1 spent on unemployment benefits generates $1.64 in new economic demand. This bill costs $11 billion over 10 years, or 1.1 billion per year. That is approximately 3 days in Iraq. 
   I commend my colleagues, Congressman MCDERMOTT and Congressman ENGLISH for introducing this bill and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

   Mr. Speaker, this is a serious problem. I beseech, I urge, I implore, I beg that my colleagues would support this legislation, H.R. 365. 
   365 is an appropriate number for this legislation, because this is a 365/24/7 problem. And this problem must be dealt with. This is a dangerous drug to produce. It is toxic. It is poisonous. It is deadly. It can explode. Twenty percent of all labs are discovered because of fire or explosion. 
   And as bad as this is, there is a sinister side to this drug. Innocent people are being harmed by virtue of this drug being in residential property that landlords are not aware of. And when these innocent persons move in with their children, the residue from this product is causing damage to the liver, damage to the lungs, may cause cancer, and it creates problems in the neurological system. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must act now. These labs are in all 50 States. No State is beyond the scope of this problem. Two-thirds of the residential settings are victimized with these labs. Between 2003 and 2005, the DEA pointed out that 47,000 lab incidents occurred. We must act now if the innocent are to be protected from this deadly assassin. I beg that we all support this important piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today we passed H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, in so doing, we will do at least three things: We will help our troops and support those troops who are in the field; we will provide assistance and care for our veterans who are at home; and we will also provide some assistance for the friends, the family, and the people who are in this country at the same time we are helping our troops. 
   I do want to remind people that the troops are there risking their lives so we can have a better life here.     
   In so doing we want to make sure that we take care of them, but we should also be mindful that their families and their friends back home have needs as well. This bill addresses troops in the field and family and friends who are left behind. 
   Let us just talk for a moment, if we may, about what happened today. We had a bipartisan bill to pass the House. Democrats and Republicans supported this effort. Members of Congress voted their consciences, and I do not begrudge any Member for any vote that a Member took. I do want to talk for a  moment about what this bill will mean to the American people and especially to our soldiers who are in the field. 
   This bill provides $1.2 billion approximately for Afghanistan. It provides $2.8 billion for defense health; for veterans health, $1.7 billion; for readiness, military readiness which is important, we want our men and women, our soldiers, to be prepared, $2.5 billion. 
   But at home, we have some needs as well, and this bill addresses many of our needs at home. Aviation security is important to us, $1.25 billion. Port, transit and border security is important to us, $1.25 billion. Disaster relief is important to people who were left behind, $910 million. 
   There are those who have made comments about agriculture and the assistance that we are providing. Many of those persons who are in the field, who are in harm's way, came from the farm lands of America, and they have relatives who are still in need here. We must support the troops, but we can also do it and support the friends, relatives and family members that they left behind. So, yes, for agriculture disaster we have $140 million. 
   We also have many children in this country who are not getting the proper health care, many children without health care in the richest country in the world. If we truly want to leave no child behind, we have to do more than fund schools. If we want to leave no child behind, we have got to make sure every child that goes to school is healthy, that every child is mentally ready to embrace the learning process. We have $750 million for the CHIP program. This will help children have good health care. 
   There are wildfires in this country. Many family members and friends of our troops may have to suffer from an incident that could be prevented. So we do have wildfire suppression, $500 million. 
   But there are people who may not be related to the troops, who may not be a friend of a member of our armed services in harm's way, and they, too, deserve some assistance, $400 million for the energy assistance program. 
   I will close with this, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you for the time. We must protect and defend our country and we have to protect our military in harm's way and the people who are left behind.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the Members who have spoken before me, and I am greatly concerned about the amendment. I am concerned because I, too, understand what happened with 9/11. It was one of the great disasters of our time, and yet I know of no amendments comparable to this one. 
   My friend from Texas and I in committee engaged in somewhat of a Q and A, so I believe it appropriate and fair that he and I do a similar thing at this time. So to my friend from Texas I ask, what amendment would you have imposed on the more than $15 billion that the families received after 9/11? Which, by the way, I think was appropriate. 
   I ask my friend to respond, and I yield him such time as he may need within my 2 minutes to do so.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, please permit me to take just a moment to thank the chairperson of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank. I am so honored to have the opportunity to serve under his leadership. There are many persons who are great managers. Great managers are concerned about doing things right, but I want you to know that our leader is concerned about doing the right thing, and I am honored that he is the chairperson of our committee. 
   I also want to thank the subcommittee chairperson Chairwoman Waters. She has gone to Louisiana on many occasions, and Mississippi. She has held one hearing there where she was Chair, and she attended another hearing wherein she was a ranking member. And in attending these hearings, she did more than sit in a physical location and listen to people talk. She actually went to the housing complexes. She actually talked to persons who were living in the apartments, the units, and in so doing, she gained a greater understanding of what is actually taking place in the lives of the people who have been displaced. So I thank her for all that she has done. 
   I also thank the Members of the minority who attended. I am greatly appreciative that they were there and showed great interest in what was happening to the people from Louisiana who have moved to other locations as well as those who are trying to move back. 
   And finally I thank the staff. The staff has done an outstanding job in helping us to put this legislation together. They are to be commended. We do a lot of things, but we do most of them because we have good staff, and I thank them. 
   Mr. Chairman, Hurricane Katrina, one of the greatest natural disasters of our time, has caused us to confront one of the greatest domestic issues of our time. And the question that we have to confront is how does the richest country in the world treat the poorest victims of one of the world's greatest disasters? 
   The richest country in the world, the country where 1 out of every 110 persons is a millionaire, how does it treat persons who are among the least, the last, and the lost who have suffered as a result of a natural disaster? With all due respect given to my chairman, I don't want to get into the war, but a country wherein $177 million is being spent not per year, not per month, not per week, but per day on the war, how does this country, the richest in the world, treat the least, the last, and the lost when they have suffered a natural disaster? 
   I am proud to say that our response to Hurricane Katrina has taught me that in times of disaster, Americans of goodwill want to see that no American, to borrow a cliche, is left behind. Communities across the length and breadth of this country opened their arms, their homes, their hearts to the Katrina survivors. From financial services institutions to nonprofits, from apartment owners to homeowners, we answered the clarion call for help, understanding in a sacred sense that but for the grace of God there go I. 
   However, I also understand and I have learned in a secular sense that HUD, not FEMA, is best suited to meet the mid- to long-term needs of disaster victims. In fact, a White House report from February of 2006, styled ``Lessons Learned'' indicates that HUD was mistakenly not engaged in the housing response until late in the effort. It also indicates that HUD has expertise in providing the long-term housing needs that these victims so desperately need. It further indicates and recommends that HUD be designated the lead Federal agency for providing temporary housing. 
   FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, by definition should not, should not manage long-term housing needs. Today, more than 18 months after Katrina, more than 120,000 households are still receiving FEMA assistance. More than 37,000 households are still receiving FEMA rental assistance. It is past time, Mr. Chairman, to get the Federal Emergency Management Agency out of the Katrina long-term housing crisis, and it is time that we put the Housing and Urban Development program in charge. 
   Why is there a long-term Katrina housing crisis? Because the vast majority of all families receiving FEMA rental assistance have extremely low incomes and are disabled and/or elderly. 
   Why is there a long-term Katrina rental housing crisis? Because of the Katrina survivors receiving rental assistance, 7 in 10 households have annual incomes below $15,000 per year, because more than half of the monthly incomes are $750 or less, because more than 44 percent have health care problems that will impact their abilities to work. 
   How has FEMA responded to this housing crisis? By moving real people with real problems from one deadline to another deadline. The section 403 rental program alone speaks volumes. The deadline for section 403 moved from March 1, 2006, to March 30, 2006, to May 31, 2006, to June 30, 2006, to July 31, 2006, to August 30, 2006. 
   It is time to end the deadlines and extend a lifeline to only those who are eligible for HUD assistance. 
   This amendment, I believe my friends on the other side should really love this amendment because it provides assistance to the people that don't have a place to return home to, and I think that is what my friends are indicating we should do. This amendment extends section 408 rental housing assistance until the end of this year. Further, it would help the families who are eligible for section 8 rental vouchers to get section 8 rental vouchers. And as soon as a family becomes ineligible for section 8 rental vouchers, then the family would cease to get the vouchers, and the vouchers would cease to exist. 
   This amendment also allows persons living in FEMA trailers who are eligible to receive section 8 vouchers to receive section 8 rental vouchers. Again, they must be eligible to receive the vouchers to, in fact, acquire the section 8 vouchers. 
   This amendment is supported by over 50 not-for-profits and other agencies. It has a zero direct impact on spending. It has a budget score of zero. And I think it is time for us to end the deadline, extend the timeline, and extend long-term rental assistance only to those persons who are eligible to receive it 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   Mr. Chairman, apparently it is understood, I suppose, that moving is not a pleasant thing, and in contemplation of moving, many persons become distraught. I personally don't like moving, and I suspect that many of my friends on the other side do not. 
   My point is it creates a lot of stress in the lives of people to move from deadline to deadline. This amendment extends a lifeline and gives them the time to adjust their lives.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   My response is that this is only for persons who are eligible to receive the relief. This means that persons must be eligible for the section 8 vouchers to receive the vouchers. This is not for people who just happen to be in need of someplace to stay and may be making $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 to $60,000 a year. They must qualify. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the honorable gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt), the former Chair of the CBC.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of the time. 
   Mr. Chairman, many of the persons who will receive these vouchers are persons who will be working full time and living below the poverty line, persons who are what we call extremely low-income persons, making around $12,000 per year. Does someone argue that a person making $12,000 per year should not receive some assistance for housing? That is what we are talking about, persons working below the poverty line full time, family of two. You are making about $13,000 if you are going to reach poverty line, and these vouchers go away. They are not vouchers that are permanent. They are only there to help as needed, and once the need ceases to exist, the vouchers will cease to exist. 
   People are suffering. Moving from one deadline to another deadline causes a lot of stress in the lives of the persons who have these vouchers or who have these temporary living conditions, and their children are suffering. The children are in schools. At some point people want to know that they have stability, that their children can attend the same school all year long, that at Christmastime there is no threat that they will have to move from one place to another. At some point we have to give them the stability that they deserve. 
   Finally, people still cry. They have tears to well in their eyes when they talk about what happened to them. Why would we continue to compound what is already a distressful situation by adding additional stress to their lives by threatening them with eviction? 
   In closing, I mention only that we have the ability to do the right thing, or we can try to do something right. We can try to put a process in place. I say it is time for us to do the right thing, and in the process, I think we will be doing something the right way as well. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is the very last day of the  month of February, which is Black History Month, and today I rise to thank the many Members who have supported H. Res. 198, which recognizes the significance of Black History Month. 
   This piece of legislation is supported by conservatives, moderates and liberals. It is a piece of legislation that I received not one negative comment on. Every person that we requested agreed to support the legislation. So I thank those who supported it. 
   But I also, Mr. Speaker, want to apologize to the many that I did not approach and ask for support because my belief is that this kind of legislation will receive the support of all persons of goodwill. African Americans in the diaspora in America merit this kind of support. The Members of this House have given it to African Americans and to persons of goodwill, and I thank them all.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3329, the Homes for Heroes Act, and at this time I would like to thank the House leadership for allowing this legislation to come before the House expeditiously. I also thank Chairman Frank, the chairperson of the Financial Services Committee, for his outstanding service in helping us with this piece of legislation. Congresswoman Waters, who chairs the Subcommittee on Housing, is to be given a debt of gratitude as well, because without her help we could not have brought the bill to fruition. The staff has been outstanding. Ranking Member Capito on the Housing Subcommittee has been of great benefit to us, as well as Congressman Bachus, who is the ranking member on the full committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, of the many supporting organizations, I would like to especially thank the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans. They have been with us and they have assisted us through the process. The cosponsor and co-lead, Congressman Michael Michaud, deserves a special expression of appreciation. He is the Chair of the Veterans Affairs Health Subcommittee. Finally, we thank the 53 cosponsors, and we appreciate greatly the bipartisan support that this legislation enjoys. 
   Mr. Speaker, we live in the greatest and richest country in the world. We literally have housing for our astronauts, who are in space. We have housing for our farm animals, called barns. We have housing for our cars, called garages. One of every 110 persons is a millionaire. However, I am sorry to report, Mr. Speaker, that as many are sleeping in the suites of life, too many are sleeping on the streets of life. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have 800,000 homeless people in our country. One-fourth, or 200,000 of them, are veterans. Approximately 16,000 veterans are homeless in the State of Texas, 2,400 in my  City of Houston. Veterans make up 11 percent of the population, yet are 25 percent of the homeless. 1.5 million veterans have incomes below poverty, and that would be $10,787 per year for a single person who happens to be a veteran. 643,000 veterans have incomes below 50 percent of poverty. That would be $5,394 per year for a single veteran. Of the homeless veterans, nearly one-half are Vietnam vets. One-half have mental illnesses. Two-thirds suffer from alcohol or substance abuse. Fifty-six percent are African American or Latino. 
   The passage of this legislation will help to end homelessness among our veterans. More specifically, this legislation would establish the position of Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs within HUD. This special assistant within HUD would coordinate the services of homeless veterans, serve as a liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs, to the States and to local officials, as well as nonprofit organizations. 
   This bill would establish a $200 million assistance program for permanent supportive housing and services to low income veterans. Low income veterans are those who are at 50 percent of the area median income. This bill would expand the highly successful HUD Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program known as the HUD-VASH program. This bill authorizes 20,000 such vouchers on an annual basis. 
   The bill authorizes $1 million in HUD grants to assist housing and service providers with the execution of their projects. This bill would require HUD to submit a comprehensive report annually on the needs of veterans who are homeless and give an indication as to what steps are being taken under this program to eliminate homelessness among our veteran population. 
   Mr. Speaker, some may say that this is too little. Others may say that it is too much. It is our position that we do this before it is too late for many of our veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I will reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Obey, Subcommittee Chairman Olver, and Ranking Members Lewis and Knollenberg. I also would like to thank them especially for their leadership. 
   Mr. Chairman, we understand that budgetary constraints are necessary and that budget challenges are a reality, just as invidious discrimination in housing is a reality. This is why Congress passed the Fair Housing Act of 1968.  
   The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination not just on race, color and national origin, but also on religious, sexual status, disability and familial status. However, nearly 40 years after the passage of this act, 4 million fair housing violations occur annually, tens of thousands of complaints are filed, and most violations aren't investigated. 
   Violations occur in the rental market when qualified renters are denied housing based upon invidious discrimination. Violations occur in the purchase market when qualified buyers are denied loans, pay more for loans, or are steered to the subprime market when they qualify for prime loans. 
   This is why we need to fund the Fair Housing Initiative Program to the level authorized of $26 million. The Fair Housing Initiative Program allows for testing. This will allow us to have persons who are equally qualified, perhaps one is disabled and one is not, to go out and seek a loan or a rental property. If the disabled person is denied, and the person that follows who is not disabled receives the loan or the property, then we are gathering the empirical data necessary to show that the discrimination exists. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment would add $5.82 million to the bill to bring it to the $26 million authorized level. 
   Mr. Chairman, the need is there, the authorization exists, and the time to act is here. Let us keep the American dream alive for all persons who are qualified. Let's do our part on our watch to prevent invidious discrimination in housing. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment because it is a good amendment, and HUD's language is bad language. 
   Mr. Chairman, since 1997, this program has assisted literally nearly 1 million families with down payment assistance. In my district alone, it has helped more than 600 families. This program is a privately funded down payment assistance program. I think that is important for us to highlight, a privately funded down payment assistance program. 
   Yes, there is some concern with reference to the appraisals, but that can be amended and fixed by way of a program similar to what the VA has. The VA has a blind pool appraisal process. With a blind pool appraisal process, you can get the appraisals that are fair market value, and you will save the program that has helped so many families. 
   This program is viable. It helps community development. It is meaningful. It helps needy buyers. It is workable. It can work through HUD, and it is achievable without this language. I suggest that my colleagues vote for it. Let's save this program. Let's vote for this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (INTERNATIONAL FOOD CRISIS AND HAITI -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Let me start by saying that the constituents that you have, Congresswoman Clarke, can be exceedingly proud of you because you've been here a short time, but you've made a very significant difference. And I trust that they will understand the totality of the impact that you're making on the lives of people in this country, people who need help. 
   I was honored to go to Haiti with you and with my colleagues, and I will tell you that I was thunderstruck by what I saw. Probably the thing that stands out most in my mind is the notion that in the United States we have four seasons. In Haiti, there are five. There is a hunger season in Haiti, a time when it is prognosticated, it is predicted that people will go hungry, and they will need help that they probably will not receive. 
   Haiti is a country in crisis and needs help immediately, if not sooner. Haiti has an unemployment rate of 70 percent. Eighty percent of the people live in poverty. Seventy-six percent of the people live off of $2 per day; 55 percent off of $1 per day. The highest HIV/AIDS rate in the western hemisphere; infant mortality rate 10 times higher than that of the United States of America: Haiti is a country in crisis. When you go there and you see the density of population, people living in structures that in this country we would not house our animals in. Haiti needs help. 
   I'm not sure what the ultimate solution is, but I do know that if we do not act immediately, there will be a crisis right off of the coast of Florida comparable to what we have in Darfur. 
   And we talk consistently and continually about the things that are happening in Africa, and there are things there that necessitate our attention. We must do more to help in Darfur. But we have, right off the coast of Florida, some few hundred miles, a country that can benefit from much of what we have to offer. 
   It has been said that if you have the ability to do something and you cannot do enough, you have a duty to do all that you can do. The United States of America has a duty to do more in Haiti. I know that we have needs in this country, and we have to meet our needs. But we are the richest country in the world. And Haiti is a country that is our neighbor. It is an island. And people are trapped, they cannot leave. If they do leave and try to come here, we will return them. 
   There must be a way for us to have an infusion of capital, an infusion of help such that the people who are trapped on this island can extricate themselves from this most saddening circumstance. 
   There will be some who will say they should pull themselves up by their boot straps. They don't have any. There will be some who will say rising tides will lift all boats, and if we can find a way to do better here, they will do better there. This is not true. They don't have any boats to be a part of the rising tide. TPS is a part of the solution because if we allow those who are here to stay and to prosper, they will send money back to their relatives at home. 
   We have not been able to pass TPS. I would invite any Member of the House to go to Haiti and come back and say you won't vote for TPS. I challenge any Member of the House to go there. I don't believe you will come back and say you won't vote for TPS. 
   So probably one of the great things that any of us can do, if we want to adjust our hearts and become a part of the solution, is just go to Haiti and see the circumstances under which human beings are not living, but existing. It is an existence that we can change. 
   So I challenge my colleagues and I beg my colleagues to please, if you can, go to Haiti and see for yourself. It will tug at your heart, it will cause you to understand that we have an obligation to our fellow human beings to help them out of this circumstance. That is my appeal. 
   I thank you for the time. And I thank Congresswoman Lee for all that she has done through the years on this question of Haiti. This is not something new to her. For me, it is new in that this was my first visit, I'm a neophyte. But she has been doing this year in and year out and she knows of what we speak and she understands the challenges that are before us. 
   So I thank you, Congresswoman Clarke, for the time. I thank you, Madam Speaker. And I beg that my colleagues will see for themselves the human crisis that exists right off the coast of Florida.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H. Res. 198, a resolution I authored recognizing the significance of Black History Month. This piece of legislation is supported by conservatives, moderates and liberals. It is a piece of legislation that I received not one negative comment on. Every person that I requested agreed to support the legislation. So I thank those who supported it. 
   I am delighted that 80 Members of Congress joined me in cosponsoring this bipartisan resolution which serves as a testament to our united desire to inform all Americans about the contributions made by persons of diverse backgrounds to the development of our great country. 
   Black History Month is a time of the year when all Americans of every race and ethnicity are given the opportunity to study the untold history of African-Americans and their contributions to American and world civilization. Additionally, Black history is American history and it is essential that we recognize the great contributions of all Americans by commemorating this month long celebration. 
   My resolution: 
   Recognizes the significance of Black History Month as an important time to recognize the contributions of Black Americans in the nation's history; 
   Encourages the continued celebration of this month to provide an opportunity for all people of the United States to learn more about the past and to better understand the experiences that have shaped the nation;  
   Affirms that the contributions of Black Americans are a significant part of the history, progress, and heritage of the United States; and the ethnic and racial diversity of the United States enriches and strengthens the nation. 
   Black History Month is also a special time to honor pioneers such as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, Malcolm X, W.E.B. DuBois, and many others who fought for the complete freedom and full emancipation of African-Americans. That is why we use Black History Month and every month to honor their wonderful contributions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues support H. Res. 198, a resolution recognizing the significance of Black History Month. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to show my support for the principles of Black History Month. I was privileged to be a part of the recent Congressional trip to Selma, Alabama. While in that historic city, we joined together and walked in the footsteps of the brave individuals who fought to ensure that the rights and opportunities of our Nation would be available to all of its people. 
   The Civil Rights Movement was not the first call for freedom and equality in our Nation's history, and it will not be the last. But its success provided a blueprint for future generations to follow, an example of hope to all those who seek to secure the basic freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution. 
   The history of African Americans extends far beyond the Civil Rights Movement. The works of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks and Thurgood Marshall will resonate in American society for generations to come. There are so many African Americans who have made notable contributions to our Nation. For example, Benjamin Banneker blazed new trails in astronomy, accurately predicting solar and lunar eclipses and Dr. Charles Richard Drew developed techniques in blood storage and helped to develop the blood banks which have saved countless military and civilian lives over the years. And there are many others, in fields too numerous to name. What is important is that we take time to honor, to remember, and to revere all of these individuals. 
   Black History month gives all Americans an opportunity to recognize and continue to learn about African-American history, which is the history of our Nation. I am proud to do my part to help promote the contributions that African Americans have made to our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Conyers for being there and making this resolution possible and bringing it to the floor. I also would like to remember Mr. Sensenbrenner, who at the time we first introduced this piece of legislation was the chairperson of the Judiciary Committee. And I recall how he made a great effort to get this legislation to the floor and to get it passed. I am grateful to the Honorable Steve Cohen who is our floor leader today, a lawyer par excellence who does an outstanding job on the Judiciary Committee. Thank you so much. I am grateful to Mr. Steve Chabot. Thank you for your very kind words. What you said about the NAACP is entirely correct, but it is also something that means a lot to a lot of people. And I think the people across the length and breadth of this country appreciate what you have said and how you have made it clear that the NAACP is important to us in the United States Congress. 
   I also want to thank the many persons, about 45 of whom signed on to this piece of legislation so that we could bring it to the floor this year. This is the 99th anniversary of the NAACP, having been founded February 12, 1909. The NAACP has always been an integrated organization. It has fought for integration. But it has from its genesis been an organization that has been integrated. And while we remember many of the names of the great NAACPers, James Weldon Johnson, of course, who was one of the great executive secretaries of the organization, we will remember always the name Roy Wilkins, who was a labor leader and executive secretary of the NAACP, W.E.B. DuBois, who was one of the great intellectuals of his time and of all time. We remember Julian Bond who today is the chairperson of the organization, and Dr. Benjamin Hooks who was an FCC board member but also a lawyer and executive director of the NAACP. 
   But some of the names we don't always remember are names of persons who are not African Americans who were there at the genesis of this organization. Mary White Ovington, this lady held one of the very first organizational meetings of the NAACP in her living room at a time when it was not popular to host a meeting for an organization like the NAACP. I also would remember, if we would, William English Walling and Oswald Garrison Villiard. These persons were not African Americans, but they literally put their lives on the line so that African Americans could have the types of rights and privileges that we enjoy today. 
   The NAACP, the Nation's oldest civil rights organization, has been there at times of need when it came to issues like the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960 and 1964. It was there for us when we were lobbying for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Brown v. Board of Education is always mentioned when we think of the NAACP, for it was Thurgood Marshall who took this case to the Supreme Court and won it, integrating the schools across this country. 
   But the NAACP was also there in the case of Shelley v. Kramer, and the case of Borrows v. Jackson. These cases outlawed restrictive covenants, racially restrictive covenants that barred African Americans from living in certain communities. The NAACP took these cases to the Supreme Court and won them as well. 
   If the truth be told, we live where we live, we sleep where we sleep and we eat where we eat because of the NAACP. It has made a difference in the lives of all Americans. And I am so grateful that this Congress has seen fit to honor it today for its 99 years of service. 
   As of late, the NAACP was a party to the legislation that we put before Congress to deal with noose intimidation. Noose intimidation, one of the latest means by which persons are having civil rights violated, and the NAACP was there to help us push this legislation through Congress, so as to make it very clear, transpicuously so, that this country will not tolerate noose intimidation. In fact, the President of the United States, as late as yesterday, made it clear that noose intimidation is unacceptable in this country. 
   The NAACP has been a part of the fiber and fabric of the human rights, civil rights movement in this country. If we did not have the NAACP, we would have to create the NAACP. It has been there for us. Today we are there for the NAACP.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NEEDED TO RECOVER FROM HURRICANE IKE -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Ike came through Texas, landed near Houston. Much of the area in my State, especially in the Houston-Galveston area along the gulf coast, has been decimated. It will take billions of dollars for us to recover. 
   We are asking that this House understands the needs of the people of Texas and the areas that have been devastated. We will have to lend some assistance to the areas that need our help at a most important time. 
   For fear that someone may not understand, we are truly all in this together. Dr. King reminded us that life is an inescapable network of mutuality tied to a single garment of destiny. Whatever impacts one directly, impacts all indirectly. 
   Though you may live in some far corner of the United States of America, there are earthquakes, there are fires, there are storms that will come into your life. We are all going to need some help at some point. 
   So I am begging those of you who can, please understand that we have got to help Texans and Americans through this.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I want to thank you and the chairman of the full committee for this brilliant and well thought-out legislation. I absolutely support it. I am convinced that this bill, had it been in place, would have helped many borrowers to avoid the subprime market and many of those who also went into the predatory lending areas, because it would provide reasonable rates without prepayment penalties. 
   But this bill also has the Affordable Housing Fund, and I support it wholeheartedly. There is no question that there is a need to build, preserve, and renovate, rehabilitate affordable housing in this country. This bill gives us the means by which it can be done. 
   I also would like to point out that the bill has an amendment that we introduced to deal with the mortgage brokers.     
   This bill requires mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders to safeguard and account for a borrower's money. It is actually codified into law. It would require them to follow reasonable and lawful instructions of the borrower and to act with reasonable skill, care, and diligence in handling the money of borrowers and the business of borrowers. It allows the Secretary of HUD to deny a violator the privilege of originating loans. It's a good amendment. I beg that my colleagues would support it. 
   Finally, I want to talk about the alternative credit amendment that was added that we introduced, which is a pilot program to establish an automated process using alternative credit such as rent, utilities, phone bills. 
   Many persons are credit worthy, but they don't have the traditional credit necessary to purchase a home. This bill will establish an alternative system so that they too may enter the marketplace and purchase a home. 
   After 4 years, the GAO is to give Congress a report on the bill. I support all of what is in this bill, and I beg that my colleagues do so as well. 
   Again, I commend the Chair and the ranking members for what they have done as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the road to a better society is paved with better education. H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, is the single largest investment in higher education since the GI bill and highlights the commitment of this Congress to making college more affordable. By making this investment in our students, we are investing in the future of our country. 
   This landmark legislation will provide vital assistance to low- and middle-income students by increasing the Pell Grant Scholarship by $500 over the next 5 years. In the State of Texas alone, over 470,000 could benefit from this increase. 
   H.R. 2669 will also encourage philanthropic participation in college financing through matching grants aimed at increasing the number of first generation and low-income college students. 
   By passing this bill we will be making great strides on behalf of minority students. The College Cost Reduction Act invests $500 million in minority serving institutions and creates two new designations--Predominately Black Institutions and Institutions Serving Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. By recognizing these institutions, we recognize their commitment and dedication to serving our minority students. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe in an America where every child should grow up knowing that if they study and work hard, that they will have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. 
   I believe in an America where the circumstances into which you are born do not determine whether you will one day stand in front of family and friends as you receive a college diploma. 
   I commend Chairman Miller and our Democratic Leadership for their continued commitment to ensuring that a college education is not out of reach for low- and middle-income Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it has been said, but it bears repeating, that a person working full time, full time at $5.15 an hour, will make $10,700 per year. If that person happens to have a child, that person is living below the poverty line of $13,461. 
   No one in this, the richest country in the world, should work full time and live below the poverty line. In this country, we want people to work their way out of poverty. What better way to have them do this than have a minimum wage that gives people a job and money that takes them above the poverty line.     
   Mr. Speaker, it is sinful for us to continue this debate without adding that in this country one out of every 110 persons is a millionaire. People don't want welfare. People want self-care. We want to give people the means by which they can say farewell to welfare. Raising the minimum wage will do this.

Justice not just for those who make more in a day than a minimum wage worker makes in a year, not just for those who are in, those who are in charge, in control, included, but justice also for those who are out, who are left out of the economic recovery, who are without health insurance, who are locked out of an apartment because they cannot afford to pay rent. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the final analysis, the justness of America will not be determined by how we treat millionaires in the suites of life but, rather, how we treat minimum wage workers in the streets of life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the Conference Report on H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007. This bipartisan legislation takes significant steps to strengthen the Head Start program so that children will be better prepared and ready to succeed when they begin kindergarten. H.R. 1429 increases funds targeted at improving teacher quality and provides additional support for the program's extensive monitoring process and the comprehensive services offered to the students' families. In addition, it expands access to Head Start for more children, increases coordination efforts with State and local programs, and eliminates any further development of the controversial and ineffective National Reporting System. 
   For over 40 years, the Head Start program has worked to break the cycle of poverty by providing access to early childhood education for low-income children and families. In the House budget for FY 2008, the State of Texas is estimated to receive approximately $490 million in Head Start funding which will go towards providing services for over 68,000 students. Since it first began in 1965, the program has served more than 20 million children, and it continues to play a major role in our Nation's efforts to close the achievement gap, reduce poverty, and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed. 
   Studies have shown that students with a high quality pre-Kindergarten education enjoy greater success in academics as well as their overall lives. The Head Start program goes a long way in addressing educational inequity by aiding low income children in their social and cognitive development. I am a firm supporter of this program and the lifelong benefits it provides. It is only by addressing this critical need that we will be able to ensure a better future for all our Nation's children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very kind words and compliment him on the outstanding job that he is doing in the United States Congress, and I'm always honored to have the opportunity to serve and work with the gentleman. 
   I also thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle who has graciously helped us with this resolution and helped us bring it to the floor. 
   This resolution has received bipartisan support. I can say with a great degree of sincerity that not one Member that I approached about signing on to this resolution had any reservation, hesitation, or consternation. Every Member saw this as a worthwhile resolution, and I want to thank all of the Members who are now supporting it and who will vote for it. 
   I also am honored to make this expression of appreciation on behalf of the millions of Africans who are in America and who are known as African Americans. They cherish this day. This day means something to persons in the African American community. So they, too, would express appreciation, and I do so as one of their representatives in the United States Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution gives us an opportunity to tell a portion of the greatest story never told. One of the great stories in world history is the story of Africans in the Americas and, more specifically, Africans in America today. This month allows us, and through this resolution we are allowed, to talk about some of the great accomplishments of African Americans, and Mr. Feeney has been so generous with his compliments and the persons that he has named. My colleague has been very generous with his compliments as well.     
   But I want to name just a few more, because at a time like this, on occasions like this, we want to make sure that we say as much as we can, understanding that we cannot say enough. 
   So on occasions such as this, we'd like to at least mention the prolific poetry of Phyllis Wheatley. We want to say that there was the scientific genius of Benjamin Banneker, who, by the way, was self-educated, a self-educated scientist, astronomer and inventor. We'd like to mention the legal brilliance of Macon B. Allen, who became the first African American admitted to the bar in the United States in 1845. 
   We should mention the colossal courage of Harriet Tubman, who, with her Underground Railroad, took persons from slavery to freedom. And we have to mention that she didn't do it alone. African Americans are not free because they were able to extricate themselves from slavery; they are free because they had help along the way from persons of good will of all ethnicities and races, all genders. People of good will have been of service in this fight for freedom for African Americans, and we should never have this kind of celebration and not mention the fact that we are here because there were many others who made it possible for us to have the opportunities we have. Many lived and died, and they were not all African Americans. 
   On occasions such as this, we mention the political prowess of P.B.S. Pinchback, who was the first African American elected Governor to become Governor of a State; he became Governor of the State of Louisiana in 1872. 
   These are some of the notables that we mention. But we should also mention that African Americans answered the clarion call to serve the Nation in times of war. They were there at the Boston Massacre. You will recall that Crispus Attucks was the first person killed, an African American. They were there at the Revolutionary War. Five thousand slaves and freedmen fought in the Revolutionary War, with the Continental Army, with the Navy, and with the militia in the Revolutionary War. 
   They were there in World War I; 350,000 African Americans were there in World War I to serve our country. In World War II, 2.5 million registered, and approximately 1 million served. And, of course, we can never forget the Tuskegee Airmen. They were not only there but they were so outstanding that the President of the United States came to these Halls and presented them a Congressional Gold Medal.  
   America is not a perfect Nation, but it does provide the means by which we can strive for perfection. And I am so honored that by passing this resolution, we continue to reach for the ultimate perfection in the United States of America.

We want them to know that they are not alone in this moment of tragedy.

This will help the children in the State of Texas, where I happen to represent the Ninth Congressional District, and we have the largest portion of uninsured children in the entire Nation. 
   This is the safety net that children need. Children don't decide where they're born and to what families they come. Children need health care. This will help Texas to do what it should have done when it lost $830 million to  other States because it didn't spend CHIP funds. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm grateful to the Members who voted to help children, 11 million in this country who are uninsured. I thank each of you. And our sympathies are with the people of Minnesota.

   I question it because I have to ask myself, where was the moral hazard  when we bailed out Penn Central? Penn Central got more than laissez faire. Penn Central got more than market forces. Penn Central got $7 billion in a bailout. 
   Where was the moral hazard when we bailed out Lockheed Martin, $250 million? Franklin National Bank, $1.7 billion bailout. For the good of the country, we bailed out Chrysler at the tune of $1.5 billion; Continental Illinois, $4.5 billion; Farm Credit System, $4.5 billion; First Republic Bank, $1 billion. Major airlines got $5 billion, the steel companies got $7 billion. 
   Where was the argument about Bear Stearns that was never brought to the floor? I have heard about a letter that has been circulated. Why didn't you bring the argument to the floor? Let's talk about the Bear facts, the Bear Stearns facts. Bear Stearns got $29 billion in a bailout and a $13 billion loan. 
   So if you really talk about the Bear facts, the Bear Stearns facts, you are talking about $42 billion. We live in a world where it is not enough for things to be right, they must look right. 
   It doesn't look right for this country to continually bail out major corporations. When the American people, little people as we sometimes call them here--they are big in my heart--but the little person needs some help, we don't find it within our hearts and our power to help them. 
   We have the ability to make a difference in the lives of people today. This is why I am encouraging my colleagues to vote for this bill.

Why, because I believe at some point on the infinite continuum that we know as time, I will have to account for my time. And at that point when I have to explain what I did for the least, the last, and the lost, I will be able to say I supported clothing the naked, I supported feeding the hungry, and I supported shelter for the homeless. 
   At a time when we are spending $353 million a day on the war, what did you do, Al? I stood before the House and I requested that we support an affordable housing trust fund. 
   In a country where every day we have millionaires, in fact one of every 110 persons in this country is a millionaire. The question becomes what did you do when you had a chance to help the least, the last and the lost. 
   So today, I stand here to say I will try to help the least in Alabama. In Alabama, where we need an additional $146 million to $164 million to help Alabama recover from Katrina and Rita. In Texas, where we need an additional $1.5 billion, I support an affordable housing trust fund to get the job done. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a simple one. My amendment would not only recognize that Louisiana and Mississippi have been harmed. My amendment also recognizes that Katrina and Rita have done damage in Texas and Alabama. And my amendment would also allow funds to go to these two States as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand in the well of the House tonight and address conditions at Walter Reed Medical Center, as well as other military medical hospitals, and I would also like to, in doing this, talk about why our soldiers and our veterans are so important to us. 
   I want to start by saying if we are truly concerned, if we are truly concerned about national security, then we have to be concerned about those who secure national security. We have got to be concerned about our soldiers. We have to be concerned about our veterans. Because, in fact, they make it possible for us to have these liberties that we have come to know and to love. 
   Tonight, as I start this explanation, I would like to first use the words of another, Major General John H. Bailey II, and I want to bring his words to our attention, because he has written an ode that really explains why the American soldier, the American veteran, is so important to this Nation and to the well-being of this country. His ode is styled from Boston to Baghdad, and his words capture the essence, the spirit of what the American soldier is all about, what the American soldier has done for this great country. 
   His words are: 
   I am the American veteran. I was born in battle on April 19, 1775. I am the total sum of my country's ethnic and cultural diversity. I am loyal, dependable and patriotic. My motto is, ``Duty, Honor and Country,'' and my battle cry is, ``Don't Tread on Me.'' The tracks of my tears and the stains of my blood can be traced from Boston to Baghdad. 
   I was there at Lexington when the shot heard around the world was fired, saw the whites of their eyes, was battle-tested at Bunker Hill, Valley Forge and Yorktown, and won my country's independence.     
   I earned worldwide respect during the Spanish-American War while helping our friends in Cuba gain their independence. Names like Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders and the 9th and 10th Cavalry became household words. I saw action at San Juan Hill, Guantanamo Bay, and the Philippines. A young Lieutenant John Pershing was heard to have seen ``white and black regiment fighters shoulder to shoulder unmindful of color in combat.'' 
   I was there at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, in the year of our Lord 1918. I was crowned in glory at the conclusion of World War II, the war to end all wars and the birth of Veterans' Day. 
   During World War II, in response to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the pearl of the Pacific, I rallied a nation, shouldered the weight of the world, defeating the Axis powers, preserving democracy around the world and preventing the annihilation of a race of people who called Germany home. In this country, we call these exceptional citizens Jewish people, and we know them as the Jewish community. 
   No words can better describe the effects of our entry into World War II than those of Admiral Hirohito when told by an aide, ``Sir, we have scored a great victory,'' and he replied, ``I'm afraid we have awakened a sleeping giant.'' 
   Thank you, World War II veterans. You are the greatest generation. Never before have so few given so much for so many. 
   In support of our friends in South Korea, I saw action at Bloody Ridge, Pork Chop Hill and Heartbreak Ridge, while introducing the helicopter and jet aircraft as battlefield tactics, actions which changed the course of military history. 
   I went to Vietnam to help the people of South Vietnam maintain the right to choose their own destiny. There I fought at Hue Dong Hai and Hamburger Hill. I refused to fall at the hands of a well-equipped and determined enemy during the 1968 Tet Offensive. 
   During Desert Storm, I engaged Saddam Hussein in his mother of all battles. I destroyed his will to resist. 
   And then there was 9/11, a day which must never be forgotten, a day which must never be repeated. It tested the soul of our Nation in a way not witnessed since December 7, 1941. And due to the atmosphere it created, I was again sent to Iraq as a part of the global war on terror. I am still there today  participating in peacekeeping and nation building. My rewards are found in the eyes of children and old people who now have hope. 
   I am the American veteran. I am from New York City, the countryside of Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. I've come from sea to shining sea. As a participating citizen, I shall continue to fulfill my forefathers' dreams of a more perfect union and open my arms and say to the world, send me your tired, your huddled masses, because I know it is that diversity that makes us who we are. 
   In closing, he adds, I leave you with the words of a young John F. Kennedy in his inaugural address, who said, ``We will bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.'' This pretty much describes the spirit of the American soldier and the American veteran. 
   Mr. Speaker, I share these words because it is important for us to understand the sacrifices not only made by this generation of veterans but the sacrifices made by veterans since the country was founded, since the genesis of this country, if you will. And because our veterans have been so important to us, because they have been there for us, we must be there for them. 
   I regret to say, Mr. Speaker, that we have not been there for them when it comes to military hospitals and facilities and the delivery of health care through the military facilities. We have not been there because recent events have shown us, in transpicuously clear, empirical data, that hospitals are substandard, that some of the treatment received has not been delivered in the kind of fashion and manner that we would have those persons who have given us liberty and justice for all, those persons who have made real the ideals in the Constitution of the people, by the people, for the people, those persons who have given us this opportunity to stand here tonight, we have not made the delivery of health care services as effective and efficient as they should be. 
   So I am here tonight with a colleague, and we are going to talk about not only the problems at Walter Reed but the problems in health care delivery in military facilities, generally speaking; and we are going to also continue to be grateful for the service that our American veterans have rendered to make this country the great country that it is. 
   At this time, I will yield such time as she may consume to the honorable lady from the District of Columbia, a student of jurisprudence par excellence, I might add, one who is a part of the conscience of the Congress and certainly the conscience of Washington, D.C., who has fought for statehood and continues to fight for the American veteran. She speaks, and when she speaks, others listen. I am honored to share time with the honorable ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON.

   You have mentioned Walter Reed several times and conditions at other facilities as well. I have information from the Washington Post that I would like to share to substantiate much of what you have just said, and I think that it bears reading because I want to make sure that I quote the Washington Post accurately. This is from February 18, 2007: 
   ``Behind the door of Army Specialist Jeremy Duncan's room, part of the wall is torn and hangs in the air, weighted down by''--what the gentlelady called to our attention just a moment ago--``black mold.'' Black mold weighing the door down to the extent that it is being pulled apart from the wall. 
   ``When the wounded combat engineer,'' it goes on to read, ``stands in his shower and looks up, he can see the bathtub on the floor above through a rotted hole.'' 
   Now, this is hardly what we would expect to find in a hospital.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. The point is that, on the facility that Walter Reed claims as a part of it, building 18, the infamous building 18, we have these substandard conditions. These conditions are conditions that we would hardly expect to find at a facility that is treating wounded persons, patients, persons who, quite frankly, can become ill because of the conditions that they have to exist in while they are recuperating from their war injuries. These are the kinds of conditions I think the Washington Post, and I thank the Washington Post for doing this, but I think that the Washington Post has done our country a great service by calling them to our attention. 
   I would also mention this, if I may, before I yield back. My heart was really torn when I saw persons giving their testimony at the various hearings that took place. I was very much hurt and had tears literally well in my eyes when I saw one of the family members testifying about how a relative was treated. And then to hear soldiers talk about what they had to go through, the enormous amount of red tape, before they could be served. 
   These kinds of conditions in the hospital as well as the conditions that are a prelude to entry into the hospital make it very difficult for our soldiers to appreciate the promise that we made to them, the promise to provide for them if they provided for us. If they made it possible for us to be secure, we made a promise to them to provide for them. It was very heart-wrenching to see the kinds of conditions, to hear the kinds of conditions, if you will, talked about with reference to our soldiers. 
   I am hopeful that these conditions will change. They have got to change. And they have got to change right away. I know that the gentlelady has other conditions that she would like to talk about, and I have other charts that I will be sharing as well. 
   I will yield to the gentlelady.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. And I would gladly support the gentlewoman's legislation. 
   I will tell you, I talked earlier about the shot heard around the world. When it was stated that Walter Reed would be closed, that was the shock heard around the world. I think that that, probably of all of the closures that were to take place and are to take place, I think that one probably penetrated to the very heart and core of what a military service for veterans is all about.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Absolutely. And the bipartisan support for this is manifesting itself. I have noticed that partisanship, while it still exists, partisanship is not hopefully going to stand in the way of taking care of our veterans. 
   It is my hope that, as we look at these conditions and we recognize what is happening to our veterans as a result of being in these horrendous conditions, to be quite candid, that we will put aside the partisanship and we will do what we need to do to rebuild, reconstruct Walter Reed. 
   You mentioned the closure of it at an inopportune time. Clearly, while we are in a war, when our military hospitals and centers are most needed, we should not, we should not close the crown jewel. That sends a bad signal to people around the world as well when they hear that what is considered to be our top military medical facility is going to close. So I am completely with the lady; I support what she proposes to do. 
   And I would also add this. We are about to spend in Baghdad to construct a facility there, which is beyond the reach of this country in the sense that most Americans will never use it, and we are going to spend millions, untold millions there because we have cost overruns. We just don't know what we are running into as we are doing this, it seems. And it would seem to me that we can direct some of these dollars, make sure these dollars are used prudently and judicially. But there can be dollars spent here for our veterans who are returning home who are going to need the best medical attention that the world can provide.  
   And as further evidence, if I may, of what is happening at Walter Reed as the gentlewoman has explained in terms that are quite clear, in the infamous building 18, which is a part of the complex, a part of the complex. I have another quote here from the Washington Post, and this one speaks of life in building 18. It talks about how it is the bleakest homecoming for men and women whose government promised them, and we made a promise to our soldiers; we promised them, we committed to them that: If you go and defend the country, you go to war, put yourself in harm's way; if you will put yourself in harm's way and defend this country, we will take care of you when you return. 
   And this is from February 18, 2007. According to the Washington Post, this promise of good care in return for their sacrifices, they returned home to the bleakest home coming that the government could have provided given that this promise was made. 
   I am going to yield to another colleague who has joined us. But it also goes on to say that, and this is a quote: ``I hate it,'' said a soldier, who stays in his room all day. ``There are cockroaches.'' This is for our veterans. ``Cockroaches. The elevator doesn't work. The garage door doesn't work. Sometimes there is no heat and no water.'' No heat and no water in a facility for our veterans. 
   I think it is appropriate to get a response from the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. STEVE KAGEN, if he would care to add to this discussion.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. And I might add also, in terms of covering their backs when they come home, that these medical facilities, not just Walter Reed but others, are experiencing some concerns that we have to talk about as well, which can be a great segue into this Washington Post comment from March 5 of 2007. 
   This one reads that ``the mold, mice and rot of Walter Reed's Building 18 compose a familiar scenario of many soldiers back from Iraq or Afghanistan. Soldiers and veterans at other facilities report bureaucratic disarray similar to Walter Reed's indifferent, untrained staff, lost paperwork, medical appointments that drop from the computers, and long waits for consultations.'' 
   Now that kind of treatment is something that cannot continue. The bricks and mortar, we have to deal with, and I believe we can deal with that. But we also have to make sure that the computers work. We have got to make sure that persons have adequate staffing available to them at hospitals so that they can receive the kind of attention that they merit and deserve. 
   This problem is systemic, as the gentlelady explained, and I think that we have to take a systemic approach to dealing with it. If we only focus on Walter Reed, then I think we miss something important, an opportunity to look at the entirety of what we are confronting and to take corrective action, not for one circumstance but for all circumstances that we find ourselves confronting at this time. 
   Let's not let any aspect of this escape. While we are dealing with it, let's deal with it in its entirety. 
   And I would yield to the gentlelady.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Absolutely. And such that they can see it immediately, if not sooner, because you really don't need a commission to kill roaches. You really don't need a commission to go over and take care of a mold problem. You don't need a commission to repair doors, to make sure that the water runs and that it is hot. You don't need a commission to do the little things that make a big difference in the life of a patient in a hospital. 
   So it would seem to me, and I commend the President for appointing the commission, that while commissions have their role, there are things that can be done immediately that they can see such that they will have confidence that the committee is going to do its work because right now there probably is a failure of confidence in what the commission may ultimately conclude because we live in a world where it is not enough for things to be right; they must also look right. And it doesn't look right to have a commission studying a problem when roaches are running across the floor. So we ought to get in there as quickly as possible and allow the people who can do these little things that make a big difference in a person's life, give them the opportunity to make some change, immediate change, that the patient can see. 
   I think that this infamous building 18 is one that can receive the kind of attention that these soldiers, these veterans, will appreciate immediately. They shouldn't have to look through walls and see bathtubs above them. They shouldn't have to cope with the conditions of mold that can, in and of itself, become another problem for them. So I am hopeful that we will see some immediate change right away. 
   And I believe that the chairman is still with us, and I would like to have the chair give his response to what we are talking about with reference to immediate change.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I know each speaker will have some closing comments to make. If I may, I will start with the medical doctor, the first-term Congressperson who has already made a difference by being here and who has shared an infinite amount of intelligence with us. 
   I yield to the gentleman to please give closing comments so we can hear from the other speakers as well. 
   MR. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, during the past 12 years, our opposition party, during their power, during their control of Congress and our budget, the veterans budget for the VA health care system fell by 12.5 percent on a per person basis. This is at a time when they took us to war based on lies and deception, based ultimately on poor judgment, based on a time when there will be 263,000 of our Guardsmen and Army Reserve coming home and needing the care that they need. 
   This is not the time to reduce the veterans health care budget. This is a time for Democrats and Republicans across the aisle to work in a bipartisan way, to come together and move up our performance, not to deny that it exists at all. 
   This thing again from Walter Reed was a terrible, terrible blot on what otherwise would be a tremendous health care system, the veterans health care system.

   Let me close by saying this to my colleagues and friends: we are not talking about what we call a Third World country when we talk about Walter Reed and the facilities. We are talking about the richest country in the world, a country where we can spend $177 million per day on the war, and that was prior to January of this year. Now we spend over $200 million, not per year, not per month, not per week, but per day on the war. A country where one out of every 110 persons is a millionaire. 
   In this, the richest country in the world, where our soldiers and our veterans have made it possible for us to have these riches, these liberties, I think that we have to provide better services for them before, during, and after any injury that they may receive. 
   So I am honored that we had the time tonight. I want to thank the Speaker for allowing us to have this time tonight.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank Chairman Conyers. I thank Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH. I would like to also thank the co-lead on this piece of legislation, while it is a resolution, I consider it to be a piece of legislation, and that, of course, would be Representative LAURA RICHARDSON. I thank the floor manager, RANDY FORBES, all of the staff, and I especially thank the 60 persons that signed on as cosponsors of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have sponsored H. Res. 826, the condemnation of noose intimidation. Noose intimidation. It has received bipartisan support, and it has received it because America is a country of hope, not hate. In America, we celebrate our diversity. We love knowing that we can live together and that we can have the kind of harmony and peace that America has always promised all of its citizens. Noose intimidation has no place in America. Noose intimidation is the invidious hanging or displaying of a noose for the purpose of intimidation, humiliation, or denigration. When it is done under circumstances that may constitute a crime, it ought to be investigated. And if a crime has been committed, it ought to be vigorously prosecuted. 
   Recently nooses have been found in North Carolina at a high school, New Jersey at a Home Depot, Louisiana on a school playground, and in Houston, Texas, at a factory. Fifty to 60 incidents involving nooses have been reported since September 7. This is per the Southern Poverty Law Center. Thirty more lawsuits have been filed by EEOC concerning nooses. Four thousand seven hundred persons were lynched. Many of these were Latinos, Jewish Americans, Italian Americans and African Americans. This was done between 1882 and 1959. 
   America is a country of hope, not hate. For this reason, we believe in the words of the Pledge of Allegiance ``liberty and justice for all.'' That is why this legislation is important. We believe in the words in the Declaration of Independence that all persons are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That is why this resolution is important. 
   Dr. King reminded us that it is not where you stand in times of comfort and convenience but, rather, where you stand in times of challenge and controversy. I am so proud that my colleagues have stood with us in these times of challenge and controversy to condemn noose intimidation. And I close with these words from Dr. King. He said, ``It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me. But it can keep him from lynching me.'' And I think that's pretty important. 
   God bless you, and I thank you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the chairman and the ranking member, but I also thank the subcommittee chairperson, Maxine Waters, for the fine, stellar job that she has done with this piece of historic legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is an historic occasion with historic opportunities. This historic occasion provides the historic opportunity to not only cast an historic vote but to also be on the right side of history. 
   On July 2, 1964, this House made history when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which, among other things, outlawed discrimination in public accommodations and encouraged desegregation and education. 289 were on the right side of history. They voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   On August 3, 1965, this House again made history with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, benefiting millions of minority voters. 328 were on the right side of history. They voted right when they voted to protect voting rights. 
   On April 10, 1968, this House again made history when it passed the Fair Housing Act, prohibiting discrimination in housing. 250 were on the right side of history. They voted for equality of housing opportunities for all. 
   Today, we must cast another historic vote, a vote for a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. For the first time in history, in the history of the United States of America, we will have a fund dedicated to making the American Dream of a place to call home a reality. 
   And, yes, there are other housing programs, some say 30, some say more than 30. Every one of them is needed. Every one of them, even under a Republican-controlled House, Republican-controlled Senate, Republican-controlled administration, the programs were not eliminated. Every one of them is needed. 
   There is a need for this affordable housing trust fund as well, and I say to my friends, whether we will make history today with our vote is not the question. The question is what side of history will we be on. Will we be on the side of those who need this affordable housing trust fund or will we be on the side of the rhetoric that is in opposition to a needed program?

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I love America. America means something to me. No one loves the Constitution more than I. No one believes in the Declaration of Independence more than I. No one respects the flag and the Pledge of Allegiance more than I. No one appreciates the American soldier more than I. 
   So I stand here today in the well of the United States House of Representatives as a proud American who understands that it is not the Constitution that gives us or protects government of the people, by the people, for the people. It is not the Declaration of Independence that preserves the concept of all persons being created equal. It is the soldier. 
   It is not the Pledge of Allegiance that preserves liberty and justice for all. It is the soldier. It is the soldier who shields those who would make real the great American ideals. Regardless as to how we feel about the war, we should all thank God for the American soldier. 
   Mr. Speaker, our soldiers have done their job. More than 84,000 National Guard and Reservists have been deployed more than once since 2001. More than 170,000 soldiers in the Army have served more than one tour of duty. More than 23,000 soldiers have been wounded, and more than 2,200 of these from Texas were from Texas alone. More than 3,100 soldiers have died, including more than 200 from Texas. 
   Our soldiers have liberated Iraq from a ruthless, brutal dictator. Our soldiers have answered the clarion call for help for which too many will never come home for the holidays and far too many will never see home again. 
   So for this I say, God bless the American soldiers, their friends, their families, and their loved ones. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people have been that friend, indeed, in Iraq's time of need. In addition to blood, sweat and tears, the American people have spent more than $267 million, not per year, not per month not per week, but more than $267 million per day on this war. 
   Mr. Speaker, with this money, according to CNN and the National Priorities Project, we could have hired 6.4 million public school teachers. We could have built 3.3 million public housing units. We could have insured 220 million children for 1 year.  
   On a more lofty level, America has helped the Iraqi people develop a constitution. We have helped the Iraqi people establish democratic elections. We have helped the Iraqis reconstitute their military and overhaul their constabulary. 
   Mr. Speaker, after all that we have done, more than 23,000 wounded. After all that we have done, 3,100 are dead. After all that we have done, more than $267 million per day. After all that we have done, whenever we leave, it will not be cut and run. We have helped the Iraqi people to have the opportunity to embrace freedom and democracy. 
   It is now time for the Iraqi people to seize upon this precious, priceless opportunity and have a free and independent Iraq, something that all the money in the world cannot buy and not even the most powerful military in the universe can impose. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot want liberty and justice for all Iraqis more than all Iraqis want liberty and justice for themselves. 
   If the Iraqis want government of the people, by the people, for the people, then their soldiers, not ours, must provide it. We can stay in Iraq forever and never have a free and independent Iraq, not as long as the Iraqi people engage in an uncivil war with each other. You can debate whether it is a civil war or not, but there is no debating that it is an uncivil war that they are having with each other. 
   Mr. Speaker, because I support our soldiers and oppose the President's policies, I will vote for the resolution.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. However, the promotion I cannot claim. I'm still a lowly Member of the House of Representatives, not yet made it to that lofty level of being a reverend, but you are very kind. And I thank you for the many years of work that you have dedicated to this very issue that we have on the floor today. In fact, it can be said that your great work has caused us to have this opportunity to be here today. 
   I also would like to thank the ranking member, LAMAR SMITH, for his work in helping us to bring this to the floor, and the manager of the time, Member STEVE CHABOT, for your services that you've rendered as well. And I appreciate especially the comments that you've made today. 
   In celebrating or commemorating or recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, we are, in truth, recognizing the efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King because it was Dr. Martin Luther King who went to Memphis some 40 years ago to help what we call sanitation workers today, but back then we called them garbage men. 
   Dr. King had a basic premise of trying to help somebody. And to him, these persons, although known as garbage men, they were somebody. And he went there to help them in their efforts to obtain equal justice. And while there, the unfortunate circumstance occurred, and we lost Dr. King prematurely. But I do believe that he did not live in vain. 
   There is a spiritual song styled, ``If I can help somebody as I travel along, if I can help someone with a word or a song, if I can help someone from doing wrong, then my living shall not be in vain.'' Dr. King lived not in vain because this act, the Fair Housing Act, was passed after his demise. There are some historians who contend that it was his demise, in fact, that created the opportunity for it to pass as timely as it did. 
   And I am honored that Dr. King took up the cause of the lowly garbage men. However, 40 years later, there is still great work to be done, as has been indicated by the chairman, because 40 years later there are approximately four million acts of housing discrimination each year in this country. Forty years later, approximately 27,000 acts of housing discrimination and complaints are filed annually. Forty years later, 13 fair housing groups have closed their doors due to a lack of funding. Forty years later, 26 fair housing centers, or one-quarter of all fair housing centers, have either closed their doors or are at risk of closing their doors due to a lack of funding. 
   Forty years later, 87 percent of African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans meet with real estate agents and experience some form of steering. Steering occurs when the agent will send a person of one ethnicity to an area where persons of this ethnicity may be residing, whites to white neighborhoods, blacks to black neighborhoods, or neighborhoods that are going into some form of transition. Forty years later, 20 percent of the African Americans and Latinos trying to buy or rent homes have their cause ignored.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Less than 1 percent of housing discrimination acts are reported 40 years later. 
   So we need to do something to change this. We need to fully fund the fair housing programs. FHIP, the Fair Housing Initiative Program, should be fully funded to about $52 million. 
   This program allows us to do what is known as testing, the means by which we acquired the empirical evidence that housing discrimination has actually occurred. There is no substitute for FHIP and the testing that takes place. 
   But also there is a piece of legislation, the Fair Housing Act of 2007, or H.R. 2926, which will give HUD some additional authority, will establish competitive grants, will help us to examine the causes of housing discrimination and talk about what we can do and, in fact, conclude what we can do to make remedies. 
   If we want to live not in vain as Dr. King did, let's help somebody. Let's do something about discrimination in housing and make real the great American ideal of owning a home.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the House leadership for allowing this most important piece of legislation to proceed expeditiously. I also thank Chairman Barney Frank, the chairman of the full committee, the Committee on Financial Services, which has jurisdiction. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6455, the NASA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, which would require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of NASA. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Sheila Jackson-Lee from Houston, Texas, for sponsoring this most important piece of legislation. 
   On October 1, 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, began operations with about 8,000 employees and an annual budget of about $100 million. Today, NASA continues its mission to pioneer the future in space exploration, in scientific technology, in aeronautics, as well as to inspire Americans of all ages and backgrounds to experience firsthand the scientific wonders of our universe. 
   For 50 years, NASA has been the world leader in space exploration. On December 6, 1958, the United States launched Pioneer 3, the first United States satellite to ascend to an altitude of 63,580 miles. In July 1969, NASA astronauts were the first humans to walk on the Moon. And in 1983, NASA also sent the first woman and the first African American into space. The astronauts were Sally Ride and Guy S. Bluford. 
   It is through NASA technology and research that our world is a much safer and well-informed place. We are blessed to have NASA as a part of the American history and a part of our great American icons. 
   In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched, providing helpful insight into the history and fate of our universe. And in December of 1999, Terra, the flagship of NASA's Earth-Observing System, was launched to monitor climate and environmental changes on Earth. 
   Telecommunications would not be what they are but for NASA. Something as simple as the microwave is a development that has come into being as a result of NASA. 
   It is with great pride and sincere appreciation that we commemorate NASA's 50th anniversary with a gold and silver coin that honors NASA's remarkable achievements, enlightening research, and dedicated employees. 
   And on the note of the employees, let me just say that NASA employees are second-to-none. They are hardworking employees who have devoted much of their lives to the research that has made our lives much better, and we, by doing this, will pay them a great deal of respect and give an expression of gratitude. 
   Many of NASA's employees, however, have lost their lives during space missions, including the crews of Apollo 6, and the Space Shuttle Challenger, and the Space Shuttle Columbia. These Americans are owed a debt of gratitude, as well as their families, and today, we want to thank them, their families, for the lives that were lost and the tribute that we will pay to them for the price that they paid to help us to explore the universe. 
   This is not the first time that this Congress has voted to create a NASA 50th anniversary commemorative coin program. On July 30 of last year, the House passed H.R. 2750, a bill with 296 cosponsors that would require the creation of such a program. I was proud to be a cosponsor. The final vote of passage on the bill was 402-0. 
   Recently, the Senate passed an amended Senate version of H.R. 2750 on June 19 of this year. 
   As a result of the constitutional requirement that revenue-raising bills originate in the House, it was necessary to reintroduce the Senate bill as a new House bill. This bill, H.R. 6455, adopts the language of the Senate-amended bill. 
   Again, I thank my colleague Sheila Jackson-Lee for introducing this bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. Speaker, in commemorating NASA's 50 years, the 50th anniversary, if you will, we are talking about great accomplishments. We are talking about the past. We are talking about the destinations that NASA has taken us to. We have gone to the Moon; that's a destination. We have a space station; that's a destination. We plan to go to Mars; that's a destination. But our destiny is beyond the Milky Way. Our destiny is beyond Alpha Centauri. Our destiny is beyond the stars. NASA is in its infancy, and it will take us to our destiny.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the superlative life of a superb woman, the Honorable Juanita Millender-McDonald. Indeed, she was a devoted wife, a loving mother, a superior scholar, a preeminent educator, and a powerful legislator. 
   Notwithstanding all of this, Mr. Speaker, she had a positive air and a special flair. She was a pillar of probity. Her integrity was beyond reproach. She was a repository of respect. Her mere presence commanded respect. She was the queen of self-esteem. She was comely, courtly and stately with a positive personality. 
   We were truly blessed to have her among us, she will surely be missed by us, and I thank God for her.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Congressman Carney, for bringing this important piece of legislation before the House. 
   Today, friends, we will honor and we will respect the fourth anniversary of the Department of Homeland Security. In so doing, we understand that it has been a rocky 4 years, but the importance of this mission of Homeland Security has only grown. 
   We must never forget the crucial mission of the Department of Homeland Security and that it cannot be fulfilled without the people who make up the Department of Homeland Security. 
   While there have been some difficult times, it is time for us to acknowledge that there are some good people working in the Department of Homeland Security. These people are heroes who work day and night keeping our country safe. They sacrifice their time. They are often away from their families, and they do a thankless job too often. So we are here today to say thank you, not only to those who are in the lofty offices and who hold high positions, but we are also here today to say thank you to those who sweep the floors, those who file the paperwork, those who answer the phones, those who are making a difference in the lives of Americans by making sure that while we are on their watch we are protected. 
   I want you to know that while the Department came in dead last with reference to job satisfaction for Federal employees, according to a recent OPM survey, and we know that this is unacceptable, they were dead last; but I believe that they can improve. I believe that they will do better. And I want to share my optimism because the Department of Homeland Security is a Department that every one of us is depending on who lives in the homeland. So the leadership in this Department must do better. 
   Congress today, I believe, stands with the rank and file employees of this Department, and we want everyone to do better, and we are here to support all of those many employees who are working hard for us. 
   So I ask today that my colleagues join me in supporting and in embracing this resolution for the Department of Homeland Security. They are making a difference in our lives.  
   The Department recently saw its fourth anniversary. It has been a rocky 4 years, but the importance of its mission has only grown. 
   We must never forget that the crucial mission of the Department cannot be fulfilled without the people who make it up. . 
   These heroes work day and night keeping our country safe, sacrificing time with their families, doing often thankless jobs. We are here today to thank them. 
   The Department came in last in the recent OPM survey of job satisfaction of Federal employees. This is unacceptable. The Department's leadership must do better; it must listen to the people on the front lines. 
   Congress stands with these rank-and-file employees. We will do our part to see that the Department does better by them. 
   We have criticized the Department's management and decisions in the past, but no one should mistake this for criticism of the men and women on the front lines, day after day. 
   Please join me in honoring these everyday heroes.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (HONORING AND PRAISING THE NAACP ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 98TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, thanks to the subcommittee chairman, Congressman HOWARD BERMAN. I thank you much for the many things that you have done. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also think it appropriate to thank today chairman JOHN CONYERS of the Judiciary Committee for assisting in this and causing this piece of legislation to move forward quickly. I thank Senator HILLARY CLINTON and the more than 20 cosponsors in the United States Senate. 
   My understanding is that companion legislation will be filed there today. We would like to thank the 117 cosponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives, all of whom believe that this legislation is exceedingly important. And, of course, I would like to thank last year's cosponsor with me, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Congressman JAMES SENSENBRENNER. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are many organizations that have endorsed this legislation: the American Jewish Committee; the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League; LULAC, the League of United Latin American Citizens; and NCLR, the National Council of La Raza. 
   Today, H. Con. Res. 44 honors the NAACP for 98 years of service to America. Mr. Speaker, that is 98 years of upholding the constitutional notion of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. That is 98 years of standing on the Declaration of Independence and the premise that all persons are created equal; 98 years, Mr. Speaker, of saluting the proposition in the Pledge of Allegiance that we are indeed one Nation, with liberty and justice for all. 
   I thank God, Mr. Speaker, for the NAACP and those brave souls who assembled 98 years ago today on February 12, 1909, a group of people who met to fight for the rights of black people. They were an integrated group, both black and white, who believed in the Constitution of the United States of America. 
   And while we must remember that the NAACP was founded to make democracy work for black people, we shouldn't forget that it was Mary White Ovington, a white woman, who is said to have hosted the founders meeting. And we shouldn't forget that she did this in response to William English Walling, a white man who wrote an article asking citizens to rally in support of African Americans. 
   We don't forget in the NAACP, and we should never forget, the fact that this organization has never been a black-only organization. So, today, I salute the NAACP-ers, current and those who have gone on for their great work in this great country. I want to salute them by remembering those who are black, but I also pledge that we will never forget those who are white. 
   So as we remember Dr. Louis T. Wright, who in 1935 became the first black NAACP board Chair, we should not forget Oswald Garrison Villard, the white man who in 1911 became the very first Chair of the board of the NAACP. You see, there were two white NAACP board Chairs, Oswald Villard and Joel Spingarn, before we had a black NAACP board Chair. 
   And I believe we should remember James Weldon Johnson. He was the first black executive secretary and director of the NAACP. However, we should never forget Francis Blascon and Mary White Ovington, along with Mary Nurney and Royall Nash, all of whom were white and served before James Weldon Johnson. 
   Let us remember the brilliant lawyer and Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall. However, we should not forget Arthur Spingarn, the white NAACP-er who donated large sums of money and raised even more money for the NAACP Legal Redress Committee. While Thurgood Marshall was a great litigator, and he was, we should never forget that the Spingarns were great donators and made it possible for a lot of the litigation to take place. 
   I will remember and I beg that we all remember Medgar Evers, the black NAACP field representative who was assassinated in his front yard in 1963. However, we shouldn't forget John R. Shillady, the white NAACP executive secretary, because he was beaten by a mob in Austin, Texas, and he never recovered. 
   Through the efforts of a multiracial, religiously diverse and ethnically inclusive group, the NAACP has made great contributions to our society: the passage of the Voting Rights Act; the passage of the Civil Rights Act; the Fair Housing Act of 1968; filed and won many lawsuits, including Brown v. Board of Education; Shelley v. Kraemer; and recently contributed millions of dollars to assist the Hurricane Katrina victims. 
   So today we can literally say we eat where we eat, we live where we live and we sleep where we sleep in part due to the NAACP, and we are grateful that they have been there for us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I beg that all of my colleagues will support this resolution.

I also thank the ranking member. I would thank also the subcommittee Chair, SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, from the great State of Texas. She and I have districts that are juxtaposed right next to each other. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am supporting this legislation because it authorizes $140 million to Amtrak to improve tunnels in the Northeast corridor. It requires programs that will cause our transit employees to be trained on how to prevent, prepare for, and respond to terrorist attacks. Our first line of defense will be prepared to defend as a result of this bill. 
   This bill requires that we look forward, and it authorizes $200 million over the next 4 years to find solutions to security threats. 
   This bill protects those who would protect us in that the whistleblowers will be protected. I trust that while it may not be a perfect provision, it is better than what we had, and I assure the public that this is going to help us. 
   This bill will help us to get the additional inspectors that we need. We will move from 100 inspectors to 600 by 2010. 
   This bill helps us to protect America's future, our children, in that it provides for school bus transportation security assessments. 
   This bill provides for enhanced security for shipments of sensitive materials. 
   Finally, of the many things I can say, I want to remind us that this bill provides that violators of the act will be punished. There are both civil and criminal penalties for violators. 
   I think this is a good bill. I am honored to have my name associated with it as an original cosponsor.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Member Scott, and I thank you for the stellar job that you have done on this budget. I thank Chairwoman Kilpatrick for what she has done as well. 
   The Members on the other side talk about control spending. I think we need to give some indication of what ``control spending'' is. Control spending occurs when you spend $144 billion per year on war and you cut Medicaid by $500 billion over 10 years.     
   Control spending is spending $12 billion a month on war, and you are cutting Medicaid by $100 billion over 10 years. 
   Control spending means that you can't fully fund health care, education, first responders and infrastructure repair; but you can spend $243,550 per minute on war. 
   It is time for us to assess our priorities. If we can spend $395 million per day on war, then we can spend $32 million to fully fund FHIP, the Federal initiative to make sure that we end discrimination in housing. We can fund it for 1 year for $32 million. It has been cut. In 2006 we had 27,000 housing discrimination complaints; 18,000 were resolved. The administration is presently requesting $26 million in 2008. That is a 15 percent cut, given that $6 million of it will go toward a study. 
   FHIP is a way to end discrimination in housing. We have to have the will to fund it. If we fund FHIP, we can end housing discrimination. The Fair Housing Initiative Program deserves to be funded, and let's control spending in some other areas and take care of home.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the Honorable Barbara Lee for introducing the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day resolution. I also thank the 396 Members who voted in support of this resolution in a true spirit of bipartisanship. 
   And I ask the question, why is it important to support National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness? Why? Because as of 2005, 188,000 African Americans were living with AIDS. Why? Because African Americans are 12 percent of the population and over 50 percent of the new cases diagnosed. Why is it important? Because for African Americans, HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death. Why is it important, Madam Speaker? Because AIDS is the number one cause of death for African American women 25 to 34. 
   However, Madam Speaker, notwithstanding the impending crisis, I am hopeful. I am hopeful that we will allocate more funds, more funds for medication, because this disease can be treated. More funds for counseling because this disease can be prevented. More funds for research because this disease can be cured. And, Madam Speaker, I believe that we must end AIDS because it has the potential to be our end.

   Madam Speaker, the people of America can be proud today of what this committee is doing. They can be exceedingly proud of the bipartisanship that is being displayed between the current chairman and the former chairman, both of whom have worked tirelessly to bring this piece of legislation to fruition, so I think that today, the people of Mississippi and the people of New York should span the chasm and understand that bipartisanship is alive and well because of representatives that they have sent to the Congress of the United States of America. 
   I am honored to support and encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It does establish an Office of Bombing Prevention, and if the truth be told, whatever amount of money we spend on this legislation will be money well spent, money well spent. Protecting the American people from persons who would perform dastardly deeds is an absolute necessity of the government of the United States of America. 
   I am honored to say that the ranking member, without objection, and the chairman allowed a piece of legislation, this piece of legislation, to be amended so that we could have a public awareness campaign so that the public could be a part of protecting itself. If the public is aware of the methodologies that are being utilized by those who would perform insidious acts, the public can help us to defend ourselves. 
   This legislation requires this public awareness campaign. It will reach small businesses, it will reach the very large businesses. It also will, in an effort to reach all, make sure people are  reached who are physically challenged, those who are mentally challenged, those who may have some language deficiencies. In fact, in my district the ballot is printed in English, Spanish and Vietnamese. We must make sure that all persons have an opportunity to receive the education and the information that this bill requires that we impart to the public. 
   To the two outstanding representatives on this committee, the chairperson and the former chairperson, I want to salute you, and I want to thank you for allowing the amendment to go forward, such that it is now a part of the bill. 
   In closing, I would simply say, as the chairman pointed out, a well-informed public is a well-protected public.

   Madam Chairman, please let me dispel any notion that there is a surplus of affordable available housing in this country. In fact, in the State of Texas alone, we have a need for 437,000 units, and we are third in the Nation. New York is number two, with 528,000 units needed; California, 830,000 units. There is no surplus of available affordable housing. But we're talking about the public housing units, and there is no surplus of available public housing units. 
   Let me share a brief vignette with you. I had the privilege and honor, the pre-eminent privilege, if you will, of traveling to New Orleans with our subcommittee Chair, the Honorable Maxine Waters. While we were there, we visited the public housing units, and we actually talked to tenants. There were tenants who were pleading with us to give them the opportunity to return to what they called their homes. These were not just pieces of trash to them. These were places where they have memories, where they had hopes, where they had aspirations. And they were being denied access to property that they believed that they could live in. Now, was it to the standard that you and I my might want to live in? No. To the standards of those who live in the sweets of life, they were not; but to the standards of those who live in the streets of life, they were above standard. If you've got a choice of living on the streets or living in units that are not suitable for those who have much, you will choose to live in the units that are available to you. 
   I regret that some of us seem to think that the best way to help people who are living in conditions that we find unacceptable is to cause them to have no place to live at all. Now, there is something wrong with that kind of thinking. And at some point, we've got to consider what the people need, and not see these as projects. I beg that we support this legislation. Keep people off the streets of life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that I mourn the passing, and commemorate the courageous life, of my dear friend and colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos of California. 
   Congressman Lantos began a lifetime of passionate work for human rights as a young man when he escaped a forced labor brigade to join an underground resistance movement against the Nazis in his home country of Hungary. A Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, he was just a teenager when he undertook this important work, which began over 60 years of efforts to fight for human rights across the world. 
   Congressman Lantos' life of work on behalf of human rights culminated with over two decades of service in Congress, where he never failed to champion causes that he felt were just. In 1983, Congressman Lantos became a founding co-chair of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, a caucus on which he served for the remainder of his life. Under Congressman Lantos' leadership, this caucus was on the forefront of efforts to protect women's and children's rights, to free political prisoners, to preserve religious freedom and to halt ethnic cleansing. 
   In recent years, Congressman Lantos directed his focus to ending the ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan, which has already claimed the lives of over 400,000 people. In 2006, he was among a group of 11 individuals who were arrested for committing civil disobedience outside the Sudanese Embassy in protest of the genocide. I can only say that it was an honor to follow in this wonderful man's footsteps by doing the same thing myself a few short weeks later. 
   Beginning last year, when Congressman Lantos became Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he brought the crisis in Darfur and the recent violent crackdown on democracy activists in Burma to the forefront. It also must be noted that, under Chairman Lantos' leadership, the Foreign Affairs Committee finally began long-overdue oversight of the war in Iraq. 
   Congressman Lantos' inspiring leadership will be sorely missed, not only in this Congress, but by people around the world. I wish to send my deepest condolences to Congressman Lantos' friends, family and constituents for the loss of this irreplaceable man of good will. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to say good-bye to a beloved colleague and friend. 
   The sudden news of Chairman Tom Lantos' passing has left those who had the privilege to know him without adequate words to express our grief. 
   My thoughts and prayers go out to his caring wife Annette and to his family. I wish them strength and clarity during this difficult time. 
   Tom's life and accomplishments reached far beyond his contributions as a legislator. 
   Many words have been written about Tom's experiences as a youth in Nazi occupied Europe. But none of us will ever be able to speak here with the same level of experience and understanding that he had when referring to genocide, suffering, the suppression of human rights, and the denial of human dignity. 
   Tom carried a personal sense of responsibility to fight for those who cannot always speak for themselves: the underprivileged, the subjugated, the oppressed. It was evident in his words and actions, in every piece of legislation he crafted, and in every hand he warmly shook. 
   His convictions were never more evident than in his work to establish the Congressional Human Rights Caucus. He founded the Caucus to focus attention on human rights abuses around the world. Not only did he work to raise awareness and increase the scrutiny of abusive practices around the globe, he worked to stop heinous acts against our fellow women and men and to bring peaceful solutions to the conflicts that led to such atrocities. 
   His unwavering optimism and prudent leadership will be missed. 
   My words cannot satisfactorily articulate the loss that his death brings to me, the House of Representatives, and to the Nation he loved and served.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to be here tonight to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. And I want to especially thank Chairman Honda for the outstanding job that he has done, not only with this event, but also what he does year round, year in and year out with our caucus, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. I thank you for what you have done. 
   Mr. Speaker, I represent the Ninth Congressional District in Houston, Texas. The Ninth Congressional District is one of the most diverse districts in the country. It is 36 percent African American, 31 percent Hispanic, 21 percent Anglo and 12 percent Asian. And I am proud to say that this district, the Ninth Congressional District, has the ballot printed in three languages, English, Spanish and Vietnamese, soon to have it in a fourth language, Chinese. 
   I'm also proud to say that we have elected a Vietnamese to the State House in the State of Texas. The honorable Hubert Vo is a State Representative from a district that is within my Ninth Congressional District. 
   I am so honored that we have selected the theme ``Meeting the Challenges for Asian Pacific Americans.'' This is most appropriate. Why? Because in spite of discrimination and degradation, Asian Americans have met the challenges for America. They were there when America needed a national rail connectivity. In spite of discrimination and humiliation, they  helped to construct the first transcontinental railroad. 
   When the greatest generation went to war in World War II, they were there, not only for America, but for the entire world. Notwithstanding dehumanization and incarceration, Americans of Japanese ancestry were some of America's most decorated soldiers. 
   They were also there from the Philippines. During World War II, over 200,000 Filipinos fought in defense of the United States of America. More than half died. They answered President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's clarion call for help. They met the challenges of America, and it's time for America to meet the challenges of the Filipino veterans, who were promised, I might add, the same benefits as other veterans and who have not received them to this day. 
   It is time for Congress to pass the Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007. It is time to treat all who sacrificed during World War II the same. 
   Asian Americans have been there for us. It is time for us to be there for them.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. And I especially thank the chairman for the outstanding job that he's done on the broader bill. I thank Mr. LaTourette for the service that he has rendered with reference to putting this amendment together. While I take a small amount of assurance in knowing that I may have been there, it was really his stalwart work that made the difference in getting the amendment through. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to say that this amendment is one that should please persons on both sides of the aisle. Today in the Financial Services hearing there was much talk about transparency and talk of how we should be able to acquire the empirical evidence to ascertain whether or not new lending is taking place. This piece of legislation, this amendment, will, in fact, allow us to get some idea as to what's happening with the money as it relates to transparency. 
   So I thank the chairman for allowing this opportunity to speak on the amendment, and I thank Mr. LaTourette for his outstanding work on the amendment.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I compliment you for the outstanding job that you have done in bringing this bill to the floor. I also thank the ranking member for the support that has been shown. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill contains $39.8 billion for Homeland Security. It is worthy of noting that this is $2.1 billion more than the President has requested and that it restores some of the numerous cuts made by the President. 
   This bill provides accountability. This bill has a strong means by which our homeland will begin to move in the direction of getting the kind of support that it needs to be secure. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   This amendment is going to accord the kind of protection that tourists deserve and should receive in high-density areas. It is odd that Las Vegas, Orlando and San Diego were not adequately considered. We are talking about $746.9 million that will be allocated to 46 urban areas. 
   I strongly support the amendment. It will provide the protection that tourists richly deserve.

   I would like to, if I may, extend, my greatest appreciation to Mr. Castle for bringing this amendment to the floor. It is very thoughtful, and it is very timely. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must learn from the experiences of others. This amendment will provide us an opportunity to study the best practices available and to benefit from these practices by implementing policies and procedures within our country that will help to secure our rail system. 
   This is a good amendment, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it. And again, I commend the gentleman for bringing it to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (HONORING DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Speaker of the House, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi; our leader, STENY HOYER; our whip, JIM CLYBURN; our chair, Rahm Emanuel; and our vice chair, JOHN LARSON, for allowing us this time to commemorate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King. 
   Mr. Speaker, like Dr. King, I love America. I love the ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence, all persons are created equal; and the Pledge of Allegiance, liberty and justice for all; and the Constitution, government of the people, by the people, for the people. 
   So today, Mr. Speaker, I stand here in the well of the United States House of Representatives as a proud American, and I pay tribute to a great and noble American, Dr. Martin Luther King. 
   Dr. King was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1929, at a time when some Americans could buy a hat but they couldn't try it on; at a time when some Americans had to step off the sidewalk so that other Americans might pass; at a time when of the people, by the people, for the people did not include all of the people; at a time when liberty and justice for all did not include all; at a time when all persons are created equal, but some people were more equal than others. 
   So I thank God for Dr. Martin Luther King, because he refused to use the back door. He refused to sit in the balcony. He refused to drink from a colored water fountain. He refused to allow his name to be ``Boy.'' He was a man among men. 
   He stood up for the least, the last and the lost. He stood for the least, those who were born into a legacy of poverty; the last, those who were the last hired and the first fired; the lost, those who were lost in poverty in a land of plenty. 
   I owe a debt of gratitude to Dr. King and the many others who made it possible for me to be here. Because, you see, they fought for and secured the Voting Rights Act. Before the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we had five African Americans in Congress. This includes the House and the Senate. Now we have 43. We had four Hispanic Members of Congress. Now we have 30. We had three Asian Americans in Congress. Now we have nine. 
   Because of Dr. King and others, Congressman CHARLIE RANGEL has Ways and Means; he is the Chair of Ways and Means. Because of Dr. King and so many other countless faces, Homeland Security is securely in the hands of Congressman BENNIE THOMPSON. Because of Dr. King and those who fought for civil rights, Intelligence is intelligently chaired by Congressman SILVESTRE REYES, and the Judiciary Committee is in the hands of Congressman JOHN CONYERS. 
   Because of Dr. King and the great sacrifices that were made by the civil rights workers, women have made great strides, because the House is not only a woman's place, it is a place where a woman can be speaker. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. 
   So I thank God for Dr. King. I thank God that he was born, and I understand that had he been born in Europe, he could have been Pope. Had he been born Muslim in the Middle East, he could have been a prophet. In another time, he could have been President. I thank God that he was born when he was, however, because had he not been born when he was, I would not be in the United States House of Representatives. 
   Thank God for Dr. Martin Luther King.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my support for H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007. 
   With each passing day, a college education becomes increasingly important for the success of our workforce while simultaneously becoming more expensive and unattainable. H.R. 4137 would address this unfortunate trend by making a quality post-secondary education more affordable and accessible for all Americans. This legislation includes a number of commendable provisions that will help to reform our higher education system so that it can better serve the needs of students and their families. It offers a comprehensive approach to reducing educational expenses and provides targeted support to groups with the greatest need. 
   I am particularly pleased with the efforts that have been made to increase access for low-income and minority students. The bill allows Pell grants to be made available based on a year-round enrollment schedule so that low-income and non-traditional students will have the flexibility and resources to obtain a college degree. Additional provisions in the bill will expand funding for minority-serving institutions such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities. There are also measures designed to strengthen the GEAR UP and TRIO college readiness programs so that low-income and first generation students will be adequately prepared. 
   If we truly wish to enable our students to achieve their full potential, we must not let them be confined by their financial limitations. I support the College Opportunity and Affordability Act so that all Americans will be able to pursue a higher education and achieve the American Dream.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Chairman, allow me to first thank the chairperson of the Financial Services Committee, Chairperson Frank. He has done an outstanding job with his leadership. I also thank the Honorable MAXINE WATERS, the subcommittee chairperson, for her sound stewardship; and, of course, Ranking Member Bachus for his bipartisanship because it helped to synthesize this piece of legislation. And I also thank the cosponsorship of Congresswoman Biggert. She has been cogent with her cosponsorship. 
   Madam Chairman, let me simply say that this is bipartisan legislation that we are talking about and the striking of the 100,000 vouchers over 5 years will put an end to what started as bipartisan legislation in the committee. This was passed overwhelmingly in the committee, and it was supported by the ranking member of the committee. 
   This is not, as was indicated, a handout. It is really a hand up for the disabled. It is a hand up for the elderly. And it also benefits low-income to extremely low-income persons, many of whom are working and still not in a position to afford affordable housing. Many of them need the kind of help that this bill is providing. 
   The truth is, and you shall know the truth, and it will set you free. So at this moment, I am going to take the ax of truth, slam it into the tree of circumstance, and let the chips fall wherever they may. The truth is one in seven households in this country spends more than 50 percent of their income on housing. Three-quarters of a million people are homeless on any given night in this country. Congress has not provided new section 8 vouchers since 2002. The truth is we can pay for one of these vouchers with 2 seconds of what we spend on the war in Iraq. We can pay for all of these vouchers with what we spend on 2 1/2 days in Iraq. The truth is the need exists for these vouchers. The truth is it is time for Congress to act and to authorize these new section 8 vouchers. 
   Madam Chairman, at this time I would like to yield 1 minute to my outstanding colleague Congressman CHRIS MURPHY.

   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, it is beyond my comprehension to conclude that because people are working and in need of housing assistance, they should be evicted from the very assistance they are paying for because they don't make enough money to move to a better home. 
   I'm doing this not only for the people of my district, but I'm also doing this for the people in my colleague's district as well, because he has a deficit of 13,177 rental units for persons who are in need of this type of affordable housing. 
   This is not housing for those who don't need it and who are not qualified. The elderly need it. The persons who are with low-income and very low-income need it, and those who are disabled. And for edification purposes, when we talk about persons with extremely low income, we are talking about persons who make at or below 30 percent of the area median income. And many of these persons are using 50 percent of what they earn on housing. 
   So, Madam Chair, I am appreciative of what the gentleman has offered, but I'm going to ask persons to please vote against this amendment and vote for the disabled, vote for the elderly, vote so that persons with low income and extremely low income can have affordable housing. 
   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1, Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act, took  an act of Congress, a Congress willing to act, and leadership that knew how to act. For this I thank Senator Lieberman, the leadership on the Senate side, Ranking Member King, the 9/11 families who were very much involved in this process, and I especially thank the chairman of the committee, Chairman Bennie Thompson. He has been thoughtful. He has been brilliant. He has been the glue that has maintained the stability and kept this committee moving forward. Without his leadership, the committee would not have been able to achieve the bipartisanship that has made the difference, such as this legislation that's being implemented. 
   This legislation, in addition to the risk-based solutions, which are important, don't throw money at a problem, throw money at the solution that deals specifically with the problem, and the risk is where we are going to get the best bang for our buck. 
   It also deals 100 percent with the cargo screening, and that's important, because it's being done abroad not here in our country, and 99 1/2 won't do. 
   Finally, I would like to mention that it deals with national transit security centers. I am honored to say that one will be coming to Houston, Texas, and to Texas Southern University. I am honored to have worked with the chairman to have Texas Southern University become involved in this process of finding solutions to security problems in our transportation system. 
   I thank you for helping us to develop this most extensive and comprehensive piece of legislation that is going to help secure this entire country. I am honored to say that Texas Southern University will be a part of that process. 
   God bless you.

<DOCNO>Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. (AWARDING A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO MICHAEL ELLIS <em>DeBAKEY</em>, M.D. -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be the original sponsor of this bill. However, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make it conspicuously clear that to award this Congressional Gold Medal to the Honorable Michael DeBakey, many other persons are to be thanked. 
   I would like to start by thanking the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, my chairman, Chairman Barney Frank, for helping us to expeditiously get this bill out of committee. I would also like to thank the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, for the outstanding work that he has done to get this bill to the floor; my colleagues, Congressman Michael Burgess and the Congressman who is with  me right now, Congressman Burgess is en route, Congressman John Culberson. They have both worked with me, Mr. Speaker, to help us acquire the necessary votes, 290, and I assure you we have acquired more than 300 votes, to get this bill to the floor. The Texas delegation has worked with us and deserves an expression of appreciation. The 313 cosponsors in the U.S. House, the leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives, and of course we would like to thank Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, and the Members of the Senate for what they have done with this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Gold Medal has many judges. In fact, 535 people act as judges with reference to the awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal. Each Member of the House, 435, and each Senator has a vote. Each one judges the merits of a candidate for a Congressional Gold Medal. 
   I want you and all others to know, Mr. Speaker, and I understand this and I guess I want people to understand that I understand, that it is not easy to get 290 Members of the House and 67 Members of the Senate to agree. However, with Dr. Michael DeBakey, I found that it was a labor of love, and I found all of the Members that we approached to be most receptive to having this medal be accorded the Honorable Dr. Michael DeBakey. 
   Let me at this time explain what a Congressional Gold Medal is. It is the Nation's highest and most distinguished civilian award. It was originally awarded to military leaders and later became a civilian medal. It is the congressional equivalent of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
   Each medal is unique, and it will be coined by the United States Mint and designed by the United States Mint. There will be duplicates made in bronze, and they will be available for public consumption. 
   The Congressional Gold Medal has been awarded approximately 134 times to approximately 300 individuals. Some noted recipients include the first President of our Nation, George Washington; General Andrew Jackson; the Wright Brothers; Thomas Edison; Sam Rayburn, a former Speaker of this august body; sir Winston Churchill; Robert Kennedy; Lady Bird Johnson; Mother Teresa; Nelson Mandela; Rosa Parks; Pope John Paul II; the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King; and Coretta Scott King. And the last recipients were the Tuskegee Airmen. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank God for Dr. Michael DeBakey. He is truly one who epitomizes the American Dream. Born the oldest of five children, his parents were of Lebanese descent. He was born in my home State, New Orleans, Louisiana. And, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that he had his residency at Charity Hospital, the hospital where I was delivered, and I am currently researching to find out if it is entirely possible that I might be a person who was delivered by the Honorable Michael DeBakey. 
   He received his degree from Tulane Medical School. He was on the faculty of Baylor University from 1948 to 1993. He chaired the department of surgery at Baylor. He was the president of Baylor College and also a chancellor. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Honorable Michael DeBakey has earned the right to receive a Congressional Gold Medal. He served his country during World War II, helped to develop the mobile army surgical hospital units known as the MASH units. We probably would not have a MASH TV series if not but for the Honorable Michael DeBakey. 
   He helped to develop and establish the VA hospitals. He helped to establish the current Veterans Affairs medical system. He established the field of surgery in the area of strokes. He led the movement to establish the National Library of Medicine. He performed the historic multiple transplantation procedure. He was a leader in the development of the artificial heart. He operated on more than 60,000 patients in Houston alone. He has published more than 1,600 articles. He has been awarded 57 honorary degrees. He helped to establish health care systems around the world, in Jordan, Morocco, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Spain, to name a few. 
   Dr. DeBakey is a great citizen not only of the United States of America but also of the world. He has been a humanitarian par excellence, and he has helped both rich and poor alike. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we did not have a Congressional Gold Medal, we would have to create one to honor the Honorable Dr. Michael DeBakey. On his 99th birthday, I am proud to say, we called him to let him know that we had reached the 290 signatures necessary in the House. And his comments were, ``I am so grateful that I am a citizen of the United States.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to just make a few closing comments, if I may. 
   Mr. Speaker, as was indicated by Dr. Burgess, who has worked tirelessly, I might add, to help us get the necessary signatures to bring this bill to the floor, as was indicated, Dr. DeBakey is a living legend. But he is really more than that. He is a person who is loved by many people. The people over at Baylor College of Medicine, the staff, they have worked with us to help us get this piece of legislation through the Congress. 
   I am honored to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that Mrs. DeBakey is a real asset as well, and we don't want to overlook her. 
   He is a gentle spirit, a person who is warm, a person who exudes a sense of confidence that is almost infectious. He is a person who is not only a great citizen of the United States, a great humanitarian, but a person who will be remembered throughout history for all that he has done to help humankind. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will close with a poem, the author whose name is not known to me, but it is most appropriate for Dr. DeBakey: 
   ``While some measure their lives by days and years 
   Others by heartthrobs, passions, and tears 
   The surest measure under God's sun 
   Is what for others in your lifetime have you done.'' 
   Dr. DeBakey, we thank you for what you have done, and we honor you today for your great place in history that you will acquire. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
