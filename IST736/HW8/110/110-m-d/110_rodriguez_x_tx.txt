<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. Now, more than ever, American workers need effective bargaining tools to negotiate with their employers for higher wages, safer working conditions and better benefits. As the income gap between the wealthy and the middle class widens, it becomes more important to protect and support American workers. 
   Being part of a union can provide invaluable benefits to American workers. According to the National Bureau of Labor Statistics the median weekly income for unionized workers is 30 percent higher than that of non-union employees. We need to facilitate organization among workers, not impede it. The card check method authorized by this legislation will help to do just that. 
   For decades, workers have had the right to join a union and for that union to be recognized. Secret ballots have been beneficial in determining support for unions in the past, but a growing number of reports of worker intimidation and even job termination prove that secret ballots are no longer enough. 
   Secret ballot elections, a sacred and long-held tradition in American government, take on vastly different consequences in the workplace. Such elections often follow widespread harassment and coercion and the results become a byproduct of the fear and intimidation initiated by employers. If an election process cannot be conducted in a fair manner, then we must provide a legal alternative for unionization. 
   This legal alternative is the card check method authorized by the Employee Free Choice Act, which will allow employees to express their support for unions without being subject to anti-union propaganda leading up to a secret ballot. This legislation also enacts strict penalties that will deter employers from abusing and manipulating their workers. Our workers deserve the rights and protections that are required by the Employee Free Choice Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Water Quality Financing Act, an act that is essential for our country. 
   For the past 4 years, the water quality needs of our Nation's communities and my constituents have been neglected. Rural communities along the Texas-Mexican border in my district do not have the resources or the financial capacity to renovate existing water treatment plans and to construct sewage management systems. 
   These are basic issues in our country where people are still having difficulty getting access to potable water. 
   I have already heard from the small cities of Sabinal, Clint, Fort Stockton, Presidio, and Fort Hancock, Texas, all of which are in desperate need of assistance with their wastewater management. These and many other communities stand to benefit significantly from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. 
   This legislation will authorize a significant increase in funding for the fund, allowing these communities, like those in my district and throughout this country, to secure loans and begin work on the water improvement programs that are needed for our citizens. 
   I ask you to support this specific legislation that allows these individuals to be able to get access to good, potable water.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (FIRST 100 HOURS OF THE NEW CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to stand here today and report to the American people that we have completed the 100-hours agenda. We are demonstrating that we have kept our promise. We have set a tone for the 110th Congress that is one of cooperation, consensus, and compromise that extends beyond party lines. From the ethics reforms to restoring fiscal responsibility, to strengthening our national security, to giving more Americans a realistic shot at the American Dream, the new Democratic majority is committed to real and lasting results for the people that we serve. 
   On the opening days of the Congress, January 4, we adopted the most sweeping ethics package since the post-Watergate era. We restored tough pay-as-you-go budget rules, which will begin to reverse the record budget deficits that are passing on trillions of dollars to our children and grandchildren. We all recognize how important that is. 
   We recognize that we are some $8.6 trillion in debt, that each one now owes over $29,000. In fact, every child born now owes some $29,000 in order for us to pay the debt. 
   In the remainder of the first 100 hours, we have turned to passing the Six for '06 agenda to meet the everyday needs of all Americans. We made America safer by the passage of a bill that implements the recommendation of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, which were submitted by Congress in 2004. 
   We are extremely proud of that particular piece of legislation, because it allows us to address those needs that were identified by the commission, needs, especially, in south Texas, as we know, on border security, that are critical, other needs, such significant, although they might be considered not so important, but the importance of the agencies to be able to communicate with each other that was found to be one of the most difficult problems that we have still, but have not confronted. 
   We made our economy fair by passing a bill that increases the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over the next 2 years, affecting approximately 900,000 employees in Texas. Texas is hit the hardest with this, with the minimum wage; and we are extremely proud to have passed that piece of legislation. It also impacts some of 28.6 percent of the jobs that pay below the Federal poverty line in Texas. We have improved health care by passing and extending the Federal funding for lifesaving embryonic stem cell research, which will help 110 million Americans suffering from diseases. 
   We have helped to make health care more affordable by passing a bill that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct cost savings negotiations with the drug companies for lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. That is essential. The way the legislation has been written is basically un-American, not allowing us to bargain with the pharmaceutical companies to get lower prices, very similar to what the VA does now. 
   We know that they are able to get prices at 60 percent lower than what we can for our seniors under Medicare. This particular piece of legislation is going to be out there, and it is going to help all of us, and especially the taxpayer that has to pay for Medicare. So we are extremely proud to have passed that piece of legislation in the last 100 hours.  
   We also make college more affordable by passing a bill that cuts the interest rates on subsidized student loans for undergraduates in half over the next 5 years. This is particularly important, also, for Hispanic Americans, since 50 percent of Latinos, undergrads, receive Federal aid affecting some 205,000 students throughout this country. 
   We are extremely proud to have done that. The interest rates on those loans for those students is essential, that we can lower them to a level where it has a direct impact on the cost of higher education. We also know that tuition has been increasing. No one knows that better than parents and young people that are going to college. 
   We set America on the path to energy independence by passing a bill that repeals $14 billion in subsidies to big oil and gas companies and invests those funds, instead, in clean, renewable energy resources and alternative fuels. 
   This is just the beginning of the work we are going to be doing. I am really pleased.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (IMMIGRANT SOLDIERS -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. I want to thank my friend and colleague from San Antonio, Congressman Charlie Gonzalez, for taking this opportunity tonight for us to recognize those soldiers that have served our country and that have been immigrants and are noncitizens of this country. I want to personally thank him for allowing this opportunity for us to be able to do that. 
   There are approximately 69,300 foreign-born men and women who serve in the United States Armed Forces, roughly 5 percent of the total active duty force. Of those 43 percent, which is 29,800, are not U.S. citizens. I repeat, of those that are serving our country, of those 69,000, 43 percent, or 29,800, are non-U.S. citizens. 
   The Pentagon says more than 100 immigrant soldiers 
   have died in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last 5 years. I want to repeat that again, that over 100 immigrant soldiers have died both in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   This evening, I join my colleagues in paying tribute and recognizing the service of these men and women who, out of the desire to become citizens of the United States, enlist and fight proudly and bravely for our country. They display the ultimate symbol of patriotism and of commitment to defending a dream that we all share. 
   The service and sacrifice of these brave immigrants is often lost in our debate over immigration reform. That is why I am here this evening to share the story of immigrant soldiers from the 23rd Congressional District. The story and life of the soldier is of great significance to the State of Texas and the Nation. 
   Earlier this year, Texas State Representative Chente Quintanilla of Texas introduced a resolution to the Texas House of Representatives paying tribute to the life of Sergeant Israel Devora Garcia. Sergeant Garcia of Clint, Texas, died in Iraq on April 1, 2006, at the age of 23. 
   Sergeant Garcia was attached to the Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, based in Baumholder, Germany, and was serving his second tour of duty in Iraq. He was mortally wounded while conducting a dismounted patrol in Baghdad. 
   He was born in Zacatecas, Mexico. Sergeant Garcia came to the United States at the age of 6 and graduated in 2001 from Clint High School in Texas, where he was an honor student. Although he completed all of his required courses ahead of schedule and was told that he only needed to attend school part-time, he insisted on attending a full day and, in his spare time, helped tutor other kids. 
   Drawn to the military at an early age, Sergeant Garcia spent 4 years in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps and demonstrated a notable capacity for leadership. In addition to winning first and second place medals during week-long camps at Ft. Bliss, Texas, he attained the rank of major and served in the executive office of these units. 
   Family and friends will forever remember Sergeant Garcia for his cheerful nature, his great zest for life and his strong desire to help others. In his leisure time, he enjoyed playing the guitar with friends, and he had a special passion for soccer. 
   After fulfilling his commitment to the Army, Sergeant Garcia's plan was to study law enforcement at Texas A&M University and hopefully apply for the FBI in the Border Patrol. Sergeant Garcia earned United States citizenship shortly before he died, and he was officially proclaimed a citizen at the cemetery in Clint, Texas. 
   Notwithstanding the dangerous nature of his mission, this courageous soldier performed his mission with dedication and professionalism. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. Through his unfaltering devotion to duty, honor and his country, Sergeant Israel Devora Garcia embodied the highest ideals of the United States Armed Forces, and his valiant efforts in the memorable sacrifice are deserving of honor by every American. 
   Sergeant Garcia is survived by his mother and his father, Frances and Lorenzo Sandoval; his sister, Rosa Sandoval; and his brothers, Adrian Sandoval and Lorenzo Sandoval, Jr. Sergeant Garcia's story may not seem like that of other veterans, but this represents part of the American history that has too often been overlooked. 
   His story, like the stories my colleagues are sharing tonight, are stories of immigrants in this country. This evening we share those stories of individuals that are out there giving their all. More notably, the American public must understand and recognize that noncitizens have served and have died for our country, not only during the Iraq and Afghanistan war, but during every single war during this country's struggle. 
   I take this opportunity to once again thank Charlie Gonzalez for allowing us to have this opportunity.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, for the last 4 months, we have taken control of the House, and we have headed in the right direction, bringing back necessary oversight of this administration and producing positive results for the American people, especially as it dealt with the special interest groups. 
   We got off on a quick start, passing six bills during our first 100 hours that will make college and prescription drugs more affordable and will expand economic opportunities for millions of Americans who have not received a pay raise in the last 9 years. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to indicate to you that we will continue to do that. 
   We also passed the budget for 2007 that should have been done last year, striking out all earmarks and adding additional money for our veterans, $3.6 billion. 
   I am pleased to also announce that we passed a supplemental that added additional money for our veterans, an additional $1.8 billion for our war veterans. Unfortunately, the President has vetoed this piece of legislation. 
   We are going to continue to push forward in making sure that we have oversight over these committees.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (VETERANS' COMPENSATION COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, veterans with service-related disabilities deserve not only our admiration, but also our support. This is why today I rise in strong support of H.R. 327, H.R. 797 and H.R. 1284, a series of bills assisting our service men and women. 
   H.R. 327, The Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act will require the Veterans' Affairs Department to develop and implement a comprehensive program to reduce the incidence of suicide among veterans. Last year a survey study conducted among Army and Marine combat units returning from Iraq and Afghanistan found that one in eight troops reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Moreover, less than half of these soldiers experiencing symptoms sought professional help, primarily out of fear of being stigmatized by peers or hurting their military careers. With PTSD comes feelings of estrangement from others, loss of satisfaction in previously satisfying activities, and the feeling of hopelessness about the future. It is no wonder then, that veterans suffer a higher risk of suicide. This bill, H.R. 327, is an important step in the right direction to ending the soldiers' stigma for seeking help, and gives hope to thousands of veterans and their families coping with the costs of war. 
   Like H.R. 327, The Veterans Vision Equity Act (H.R. 797), is intended to providing our patriots with the care they deserve. H.R. 797 would change current law to provide veterans who receive disability compensation because of blindness in one eye, additional benefits if they are visually impaired in the second eye. This bill provides only a small change to the current code, yet it would aid an estimated 13,200 veterans in getting proper compensation for their disability. We blessed with vision often take our sight for granted, but the loss of one's sight no doubt requires an altering of lifestyle. Indeed, the sights that once filled eyes with beauty are regulated to memories and perceived only in the imagination. Many of our veterans are coping with such a change, and this bill is important in supporting their transition. 
   Finally there is H.R. 1284, The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2007. This bill would provide an increase in the rate of compensation for disabled veterans, as well as provide an increase in rates  of dependency and indemnity compensation for these veterans' families. The baby-boom generation understands why this bill is necessary: costs are going up. When I was young five dollars could buy you dinner and take you to the movies--now it can buy you a can of soda and chips. Indeed, inflation is slowly but surely driving up costs for basic goods and services. It is important that we meet our obligations to our veterans by providing them with benefits commensurate to their service. H.R. 1284 would achieve just that. 
   We are a nation at war. As such, now more than ever, maintaining the well-being of our veterans is paramount. Already, we have asked for so much from our service men and women, and now it is time that we return the favor. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting our troops and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 327, H.R. 797 and H.R. 1284.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Chairman, once again, thank you for this piece of legislation. As indicated earlier, we have four major polytrauma centers throughout the country. The fifth one has been selected by a commission that was established, with the selection of the site in San Antonio. These polytrauma centers look at those veterans that are the most vulnerable in our community, the ones that have multiple problems. So this major polytrauma center in San Antonio is going to be a great addition. 
   Let me just add also that as we look at providing services to our veterans, one of the realities is that approximately 80 percent of our veterans never get to have any degree of access, so we understand that there is a big void out there. What happened at Walter Reed, in spite of the fact that that is a DOD facility, we also need to look at the facilities in the VA sites. And we know that we have been negligent in not providing the resources to upgrade those. 
   The reports that are going to be required by this language allow an opportunity for us to get a good grasp of what some of our needs are out there in terms of our VA facilities, and allows an opportunity for us to improve on  those, from nursing homes that are out there to clinics and to others. 
   As also indicated, in South Texas we have a large number of our veterans that don't have access and have to travel long distance for access to health care. I want to thank the leadership on both sides for going there and listening to the reports, Congressman Ortiz, Congressman Hinojosa, Congressman Cuellar and others, about the lack of services for our veterans in Deep South Texas and the need for some of these facilities and resources. 
   Once again, I thank the chairman for allowing me this opportunity and for passing this piece of legislation.

   One thing I tell our veterans now is if they ever have had difficulties in the past, I am urging them to go back, go back and visit the VA. There is a lot of enthusiasm out there, and I am really pleased. Thank you very much for those comments, and you are welcome to come down and share a tequila.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to personally thank you for this piece of legislation. 
   I had the pleasure and the opportunity to serve 7 years in the area of mental health and work with heroin addicts, substance abusers and community mental health. 
   One of the things that I've realized is that a lot of people that do substance abuse as the result of having mental health problems as well as post-traumatic stress. During the Vietnam War, we left our soldiers and we abandoned them. A large number of them now find themselves as part of those statistics of being homeless. Part of the statistics are a large number of veterans that are committing suicide. This program that will allow the continuum of care is going to allow an opportunity for them to be able to get access to service. I want to thank both sides and the chairman for their leadership in this area. 
   In addition, let me just say that this area is one of the areas where we really need to make an emphasis. I am really pleased to see that, because when you do abuse drugs, when people do abuse alcohol, one of the difficulties is the fact that the family gets impacted. This allows an opportunity for that intervention to occur. 
   Thank you very much, and congratulations on this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (REQUIRING REGULAR UPDATES TO HANDBOOK FOR DESIGN FURNISHED TO VETERANS ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING ASSISTANCE -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer, thank you very much for this opportunity regarding H.R. 5664, a bill that I introduced to correct a bureaucratic oversight in the way that the Veterans Administration advises contractors as they deal with renovating housing for disabled veterans. 
   Madam Speaker, our veterans have made difficult sacrifices and secured our freedom and the way of life. This Memorial Day we honor veterans with our words and our actions, and this bill is a reflection of that. 
   My bill seeks to ensure that veterans whose homes are updated under the program benefit from all that modern technology and construction practice can provide. Today's veterans, particularly those from Iraq and Afghanistan, are sustaining injuries that in past conflicts would have resulted in their death. The variety of these injuries requires a fresh look at the ways the VA provides guidance to veterans in using special adaptive housing grants. The primary guidance that the VA provides contractors who modify homes under this grant program is VA pamphlet 26-13, titled ``Handbook for Design: Specially Adaptive Housing.'' The guide was last updated in 1978. This bill requires an update of this guide at least every 6 years. 
   I would like to thank also Congressman Hall for his assistance in getting the bill in the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee and being able to make it happen as quickly as possible, getting the cost of it assessed, and I believe that the bill will go a long way in  assisting our veterans and making sure that we have good housing. 
   Let me just give you one of the examples that we had. For example, the particular bill required that arm bars be built in these homes, that arm bars be installed in a restroom for a veteran who had his arms amputated, and there are other types of options that can be utilized, keyless entries and other forms. So this is definitely a bill that is helpful, and the purpose is to allow construction contractors who are updating disabled veterans' homes to be more flexible in employing state-of-the-art technology. 
   Once again thank you very much for allowing me this opportunity, Chairman Filner.

   I want to also just take this opportunity on this bill to thank the chairman because I have had the opportunity to serve on the VA Committee for, prior to being gone for 2 years, 8 years, and I know we had a series of things that occurred and we were not able to make things happen during that period of time, and there was a great deal of frustration. But I do want to thank the chairman because this past year and a half has been one of the highlights, at least in my career serving on the VA committee, having the opportunity to not only hear and be able to make something happen for our veterans and be able to do the right thing. We have been able to make some significant pieces of legislation. So I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the chairman for his leadership in allowing us to make that happen. 
   We are all keenly aware of the burden our current economy places upon our American families. The same difficulties are magnified with the veterans and the families who rely on disability compensation provided through the VA. H.R. 5826, the Veterans Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2008, seeks to address these challenges by increasing the compensation rates in line with the Consumer Price Index Social Security COLA. 
   We all know the difficulty that we are hearing back home with the cost of gasoline, the cost of food, and people losing their homes. This is essential, this cost of living. It's minimal, but yet it's extremely critical and important. I want to thank you for allowing me this opportunity once again to speak today, and for the considering of H.R. 5826, and I ask your support and I ask the possibility of a vote on this particular legislation, Mr. Chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Let me take this opportunity, first of all, to congratulate the chairman, Congressman Price, on this particular piece of legislation. Let me also share with you, as a member of this particular subcommittee, of this particular committee, we had some 22 hearings. The gentleman speaks about the importance of being able to see, in terms of transparency. We had 22 hearings. That is much more than in the previous time. 
   We had an opportunity, also, to visit the border. We went through Arizona all the way down to San Diego. We had a chance to look in terms of the border and the type of technology that is required in order to safeguard our border, not to mention the fact that we also looked at the different types of fences that are being utilized. And there is no  doubt that there is a need there, especially in the areas in Arizona and elsewhere where we visited, where there is a need for blocking vehicles from coming in. 
   I was really impressed with the type of technology that is already there. And I am impressed that the bill will also provide additional resources to allow additional technology throughout the entire border. 
   This bill is a bill that authorizes direct Federal funds to also help law enforcement officers on the border. I represent 700 miles along the Texas/Mexico border. I have probably the largest district that comprises those 700 miles along the border. And we have a tremendous amount of resources and need in that area in order to safeguard the community as well as provide good security. 
   One of the things that we provide is the Stone Garden project. That allows resources to be able to be utilized by the sheriffs and by the local law enforcement officers to help out, and all the other communities to be able to participate with the Federal officers to be able to make things happen on the border. 
   Let me just share a few examples. We get complaints from some of my communities that are very small, right on the Mexican border, that might have three to six policemen. One little car accident or one item can get them all engaged in that one activity while the local taxpayer has to carry the burden. The Federal Government has the responsibility, and this bill allows that opportunity to do that. 
   To us, homeland security is important. Homeland security is key. This bill has no earmarks. In the past, I have been informed that it has had very few earmarks. And so it is something that is critical and important. We felt that we needed to provide additional resources to some of those communities. There is also a need for us to provide those resources on not only the south, but on the northern border, also. 
   The bill provides grants to hire, train and equip local law enforcement officials in these communities. There is also some reimbursement for individuals that are caught, undocumented individuals on the border, whether they be trafficking with drugs or with human smuggling, which is also an area that we need to continue to work on. This bill allows that opportunity for us to begin to fill those gaps. 
   There is no doubt that we have not made the investment. This bill begins to provide that investment that is needed to protect our borders.     
   The reimbursement of county and city law enforcement agencies for costs also associated with detaining, housing and transporting individuals who have entered the country illegally is essential because my border community, the local taxpayer, has to carry that burden. This Federal Government has a responsibility. 
   So I share with my individual friends on the other side and say that it is important for us to pass this piece of legislation. I think it provides good resources for our communities throughout. 
   It also provides funding for the construction and maintenance and operation of detention facilities that are essential. As you well know, in some cases, sometimes we will find some 80 illegals coming in through Arizona, and you pick up a large number of individuals. So you have to have the number of staff required in order to process them and in order to bring them through. We also provide the resources that are needed to begin to enhance the technology that is being utilized in order to make that happen. 
   What is also important to note is we also need to begin to see what is more cost effective when it comes to the border in terms of the technology. There has been a lot of talk about the fence. The reality is that a border patrolman will tell you that the fence allows you 1 or 2 more minutes just to be able to do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise today, and I want to indicate how important this bill, H.R. 2638, is to the entire country as a whole. This bill has particular significance for any American concerned about promoting the necessary and difficult objective of protecting our homeland. 
   As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, it has been a pleasure for me to work with the chairman and the leadership on adding language and enhancing the quality of this bill and strengthening the general provisions of it. 
   As a Member who represents a district that goes from both the Texas to the Mexico border, I'm distinctly aware of challenges that confront law enforcement officers charged with upholding criminal laws such as the drug and human trafficking. In recognition of this inherent danger represented to the law enforcement officials, also to private landowners along the border, and elected officials concerned about the border issues and statutory requirements imposed on the Department of Homeland Security to erect, also, the fence barriers that span 370 miles along the southwestern borders. I was also pleased to dialogue with the chairman on these issues and making sure that we go about them in the right way. 
   The first objective that I want to just briefly mention and talk briefly about is the fact that our border communities need additional resources. This bill begins to provide those resources. Our law enforcement on the cities, as well as the sheriffs that are unanimously in favor of doing what they can to protect our borders and to protect our communities need help, and they need help drastically. This bill begins to provide this assistance. 
   I wanted to, again, reemphasize the fact that this bill is an essential bill that allows us to be able to protect this country in a way that we should. I know the other side has talked about the bureaucracy and the fact that we haven't responded appropriately, and I agree with them. We haven't, and that's why we have added some additional resources. That's why we also had 22 hearings of which I can tell you, because I have been here prior to this, and we had not had hearings the way we've had now to hold the agencies accountable. No one knows that better than myself. 
   I just had a community in Eagle Pass that went through a tornado that killed seven people, also hit the Mexican side, killing three, and the difficulty that I had in getting FEMA to respond and the administration to respond. So I understand the incompetency that exists within this administration and the fact that we've had difficulty in getting them to respond to our needs. 
   But the bottom line is that when we're hit with floods, when we're hit with drought, when we're hit with tornados and other, we have to be able to have the resources necessary for them to be able to do that. And so when we were hit in Eagle Pass, I remember distinctly going through there. I also went over on the Mexican side, and I deliberately went over there also because I know that they had been hit harder.     
   And I also went back because I know that the Mexicans, especially from the state of Coahuila, had come to help us during Katrina. They sent their support there in San Antonio, helping to feed some 20,000 that had come to San Antonio from Katrina, and I know that they had been extremely helpful. 
   But we have got to make sure that FEMA has the resources and that they are also held accountable. I know that we are going to continue to have additional hearings in order to make that happen. 
   I also want to personally thank our leader for helping us with the Stonegarden project. 
   I would like to yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.

   I know that you also provided some guidance as we went to New Orleans and visited New Orleans and got an opportunity to see still the devastation and the fact that we haven't done enough there, and I want to personally thank you for the leadership in that area. We not only went there, but you also took the committee along the border to look at the fences that are out there, the barriers for cars and those things that are important.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of this piece of legislation. This bill has particular significance for all Americans concerned about promoting the necessary and difficult objectives of protecting our homeland. 
   As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, it has been a pleasure for me to work with Chairman Price on adding language and enhancements that will make the bill stronger and generally more effective. 
   As a Member who represents a district that comprises 700 miles along the Texas-Mexico border, I am distinctly aware of the challenges that confront frontline law enforcement officers charged with upholding criminal laws such as drug and human trafficking. In recognition of these inherent dangers presented to law enforcement officials, also to private landowners as well as elected officials concerned about border issues, and the statutory requirements imposed by the Department of Homeland Security to erect a fencing barrier that spans 370 miles along the southwestern border, I was pleased to work with the chairman, who was working with me on these two distinct issues. 
   My first and most important objective that I would like to address is regarding homeland security grants that would hopefully help the border cities and the law enforcement personnel that are on the border such as the police and the sheriff, the first responders, for stemming the tide of drug and human trafficking along our border. Chairman Price was instrumental in working with me and helping us to obtain $15 million for funding for Operation Stonegarden, a program that this administration failed to seek funding for and which had previously been funded in 2006. 
   Operation Stonegarden began as a successful pilot program in 2005 and helped 14 border States on these issues. The initiative gave the States the flexibility that the Department grants provided to enhance coordination among not only the States but local community and Federal law enforcement agencies that are drastically needed. This pilot program resulted in an estimated 214 State, local, and tribal agencies working 36,755 man-days on various public safety as well as border security operations on the border. 
   The budgetary constraints imposed on the committee precluded more funding in this area, but the bill language sends a clear message that programs such as Stonegarden are viable and will serve as a funding aid to the law enforcement communities along the border. 
   Stonegarden did not receive funding last year. The funding assists local authorities with operational costs and equipment purchases that contribute to border security. The funds are intended to be used for operations involving both narcotics and human trafficking.  
   The second objective regarding the fencing and the barriers that are necessary, I want to thank the chairman also for working with us in making sure we provide these types of barriers in an appropriate manner. 
   I believe that the bill reported by the full committee and under consideration by the full House represents the most viable approach that can be utilized. I want to thank the chairman for allowing us to be able to present this bill. And as you well know, Mr. Chairman, this is a bill that is critical, an area that we have been lacking in this country where the administration has failed to provide the appropriate resources on the border. So I want to thank the chairman for allowing us to do that.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the American Braille Flag Memorial Act, H.R. 4169. I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Tiahrt, for drafting this important piece of legislation and for his leadership in this area. 
   Today, there are nearly 1.3 million blinded and visually impaired Americans, and approximately 187,000 of those are veterans. It is estimated that 16 percent of these veterans have sustained injuries in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom,  leaving them with some form of severe visual loss and impairment. These veterans, due to their disability, are often not afforded the opportunity to cherish and witness the American flag as those without visual impairment are. That is why passing the American Braille Flag Memorial Act is so important. It would authorize the Secretary of the Army to place an American Braille tactile flag on the grounds of the Arlington National Cemetery to honor the sacrifice of our Nation's blind veterans and members of the Armed Forces. 
   This legislation would also allow the Secretary of the Army to approve the appropriate design of the flag, as well as the site in the Arlington National Cemetery that would be most appropriate for the memorial, which I understand is likely to be at the visitors center. The bronze Braille American flag, generously donated by the Kansas Braille Transcription Institute, would include the Pledge of Allegiance, and allow the blind and visually impaired to feel the Stars and Stripes and colors of the American flag placed near Arlington National Cemetery Visitors Center. 
   I am pleased that the Blind Veterans Association, the American Council and American Foundation of the Blind wholeheartedly support this piece of legislation. Our efforts today will show the over 4 million visitors who come to the Arlington National Cemetery each year that we remember and honor the blind veterans who died in service to our Nation, as well as all veterans and servicemembers who live today with blindness and vision loss. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides a way to include all Americans in this wonderful patriotic experience when visiting Arlington National Cemetery and seeing the American flag where heroes are laid to rest. I am told that when feeling miniature mock-up versions of the Braille flag, blinded veterans and servicemembers often break down and cry. 
   It would only be appropriate to allow our blind and visually impaired veterans and servicemembers to share this experience by paying tribute and honoring them with the recognition they deserve at the hallmark of American memorials, the Arlington National Cemetery. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 4169 without delay. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, throughout the Nation's history, we have relied on the patriotism, valor, courage and unselfishness of those who wear the uniform of the Armed Forces. With this service comes the real possibility of receiving an injury in answering the call to duty. The global war on terrorism is no exception. To date, over 31,000 servicemen and -women have been wounded in action and nearly 4,000 killed. 
   For 30 years, the Department of Veterans Affairs has designated the week of February 14 as the National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans Week. The goals of the program are to pay tribute and express appreciation to hospitalized veterans, to increase community awareness, and to encourage individuals to become involved at their local VA as volunteers. 
   The VA's Voluntary Service is the largest volunteer program in the Federal Government. Over the past 60 years, VA volunteers have donated more than 689 million hours of service worth an estimated $12.9 billion. In fiscal year 2007, 85,428 active volunteers contributed a total of more than 11.6 million hours of service, equal to 5,574 full-time employees, worth $218 million. 
   Let's not forget those who have fought for this country in their time of greatest need. Join me in recognizing and paying tribute to the hospitalized veterans. I challenge each and every person to go visit their local VA medical center and brighten the smile on a veteran's face. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I would also like to commend the Washington delegation for the strong bipartisan support they demonstrated in introducing this resolution. 
   This resolution establishes a certificate of deposit in participating financial institutions that would automatically donate 50 percent of the accrued interest to the State of Washington's Veterans Innovation Program.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening, joined by my colleagues, to honor and pay respect and tribute to the contributions of the Latino and Hispanic soldiers who served so valiantly during World War II. 
   World War II was a major turning point for the United States Latinos, changing the world views of an entire generation. Approximately half a million Hispanics served in the Armed Forces during World War II. Unfortunately, many Latino soldiers who returned home found the same discrimination they had left behind, a system that held Latinos to a lower status. 
   Latinos and Latinas who worked in military installations and in other jobs previously denied them also questioned the status quo. 
   Understanding the importance of getting an education to better adapt after their tour of duty, many veterans used the GI bill to earn college degrees. In the years following World War II, those men and women made astonishing civil rights advancements for their people through school desegregation, in voting rights, and in basic civil rights. 
   Powerful organizations grew out of this era, including the American GI Forum founded by Dr. Hector Garcia of Corpus Christi in 1948 to advocate for veterans' rights. 
   Another organization that came out of the World War II generation of Latinos was the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund in 1968. This came about after Mexican American World War II veterans, including people such as Pete Tijerina; Gregory Luna, a Senator from Texas; Ed Idar and Albert Armendariz, among others, found that their clients, mostly low-income Mexican Americans, were being denied justice in the legal system. 
   For Puerto Ricans, World War II brought new questions in which the United States came to appreciate Puerto Rico's military importance in the Caribbean. The United States maintained that it needed to keep its sovereign power over the islands for reasons of national security, and World War II strengthened that position. However, over 53,000 Puerto Ricans served within the United States military with dignity. Soldiers from the island, serving in the 65th Infantry Regiment, participated in combat in the European theater in Germany and central Europe. 
   World War II was also the first conflict in which women other than nurses were allowed to serve in the United States Armed Forces. However, when the United States entered World War II, Puerto Rican nurses volunteered for service, but were not accepted into the Army or the Navy Nurse Corps, and it was not until 1944 that the Army Nurse Corps decided to activate and recruit Puerto Rican nurses so the Army hospitals would not have to deal with language barriers. 
   Sadly, Madam Speaker, the stories of these men and women have been virtually untold either in the mass media or in the scholarly writings, and that is why my colleagues and I are here this evening to begin sharing the stories of the Hispanic and Latino World War II veterans, so all Americans can learn about and appreciate their contributions. 
   Within our own body of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus I am proud to honor, to recognize the service of four of our own who have served the military with dignity: Chairman Silvestre Reyes, Chairman Solomon Ortiz, the Honorable John Salazar, and the honorable chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Joe Baca. 
   Chairman Joe Baca, who represents the 43rd District of California, was drafted in 1966 and served in the Army as a paratrooper with both the 101st and the 82nd Airborne Divisions from 1966 through 1968. 
   I want to take this opportunity to yield to our chairman, and I thank him for being here tonight.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, let me take this opportunity also to congratulate Congressman Baca not only as chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus but for his service to his country, and he continues to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. I thank Congressman Baca. 
   Let me take this opportunity also to just share with you that also I mentioned earlier Chairman Sylvestre Reyes, who also served in the military, now chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who represents the 16th District of Texas. He is a Vietnam combat veteran, and he was stationed in Marble Mountain in DaNang, and he served as a helicopter crew chief within the 282nd Combat Assault Helicopter Company from March 1967 to April 1968. I know that he was unable to be here tonight, but I know that he also cherishes and recognizes those individuals who served our country. 
   Let me take this opportunity to recognize a friend from San Antonio, Texas, which represents a community that has multitude and is known as Military U.S.A., San Antonio, because of the support that we have for our military with Lackland Air Force Base, Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Brooks that used to be here, and the military support and all the families there, Congressman Charlie Gonzalez.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Congressman CHARLIE GONZALEZ, I want to personally thank you tonight for bringing the story of Judge Machado, a great leader  in San Antonio. I also want to thank you for your comments as you regressed and talked a little bit in terms of the deficit. You have talked in eloquence, and I couldn't help but remember your dad, Henry B. Gonzalez, as he spoke in this House about the important issues that confront us. 
   I know that previous groups had talked about the deficit, knowing full well that this particular administration went into office with a surplus, one of the largest surpluses in recorded history. Now we find ourselves without that surplus and find ourselves in an $8.9 trillion debt. 
   That being said, let me also take this opportunity to mention a little bit about some of our own veterans here on the House, Chairman SOLOMON ORTIZ, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, represents the 27th District of Texas. 
   As a result of his father's death at the age of 16, Chairman Ortiz dropped out of school to find a job to assist his mother in paying the family bills. Shortly thereafter, Chairman Ortiz joined the Army, because, as he put it, it was the one place that would give him free room and board and let me send my check back home to my mother. 
   It was in the Army that Mr. Ortiz, Solomon, ever conscious of the needs for an education, got his GED. He received his basic training at Fort Hood, Texas, and was sent overseas to France for his tour of duty. He later found himself reassigned to the 61st Military Police Company, Criminal Investigation Office, a move that would color much of his future professional life. He remained as an investigator for the duration of his tour of duty, receiving his advanced military police training at Fort Gordon, Georgia. 
   Congressman JOHN SALAZAR, who represents the Third District of Colorado, graduated from Centauri High School in La Jara, Colorado. In 1973 he joined the Army. After serving in Heidelberg, Germany, Salazar received an honorable military discharge in 1976. Congressman Salazar is proud to be a veteran and proud to be both the son and father of men who have served. The Salazar family is honored to have served our country. Congressman Salazar tells a story of his father, a veteran of World War II, requesting to be buried in his uniform. 
   Today's generation of Hispanics and Latino American soldiers look to the brave men and women, veterans, who fought before them, as true inspiration. In the State of Texas alone, there are 197,173 World War II veterans who have fought so bravely and honorably to defend our beloved country. According to the 2000 census, the VA reported and recognized Texas as having 14,871,550 civilian population over the age of 18 and a total veteran civilian population of over 1.7 million. 
   Within the 23rd Congressional District, which is the district that I represent, a district that is one of the largest in the country that stretches from San Antonio to El Paso through Eagle Pass and the border, has some 700 miles of the border with Mexico. I represent the VA reports in their county estimates and projections of living veterans report, that as of September 30, 2006, there are currently 53,012 living veterans within the 23rd Congressional District. 
   Therefore, my colleagues, I stand today, this evening, in honor of the extraordinary service these men and women should be recognized for what they do. In so recognizing their efforts, we also need to recognize them in terms of what we provide them with. 
   Before I do that, let me take this opportunity to also tell a story of my father-in-law. Daniel Sanchez Pena was born on January 11, 1919, as the youngest son of Manuel Pena and Catarina Sanchez Pena in Las Colonias of Karnes County, Texas. He grew up in his parents' ranchito doing all the types of farm chores that kids do in a farm. He only went to the second grade in school. He learned to play the guitar at 14 and played at community and farmhouse dances around the community. He would use his skills while in the Army to entertain himself and his fellow soldiers. 
   To this day, he still enjoys, at 87, playing the guitar there at home. Daniel Sanchez Pena was registered on the 16th day of October, 1940. He reported to the Local Board No. 1 in Karnes County, Texas, at the courthouse, on March 25, 1942. This was part of the 35th precinct of what is referred to as the Robstown, Texas, ward. At the age of 23, in June of 1942, he was at the headquarters of the Armed Forces Replacement Training Center in Fort Knox, Kentucky, Company A, for training. Being a farm boy, he was an expert shooter and got excellent points for marksmanship. He still talks about the beautiful mountains in Kentucky that he recalls and the green valleys. 
   After training, he was sent to New York to board the ship and go overseas. This was a real adventure to Daniel. Daniel had never traveled far from his home, much less across the Atlantic Ocean. He still talks about the amazement of seeing the dolphins and the whales and other large fish that he saw. He recalls how seasick they were and how at night, how he looked on that floating city of lights. Coming from a small town, that seemed like a large city. 
   He served in the U.S. Army for 3 years. He was a rifleman in the infantry. He remembers crawling in the sand, freezing in the snow, climbing the steep mountains and the high mountains in Italy and forever marching, dodging bullets and digging fox holes. He saw his friends from Karnes County, a young man at that point that he talks about, and always remembers him, who was killed in front of him. To this day, he still remembers that specific incident when that occurred. 
   He recalls the many tragedies of the war for both soldiers and civilians. He remembers having to hold his plate of food so that they would not be stolen by the starving civilians and children who appeared around the camps when they went through both Africa and into Italy. He often wondered why he got out alive. 
   Truly, he experienced every emotion known to man, from profound sorrow to wondrous awe. Only in the last 2 to 3 years has he started to talk about these experiences. As he talks about his experiences, he remembers parts of the comments and the language, the Italian language that he picked up and some of the words. He returned from service in 1945, receiving the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with four bronze service stars, the World War II Victory Medal, and the Honorable Service Lapel Button for World War II. 
   He married Dora Mansanalez in September of 1947, another young lady who lived at another farm adjoining their farm. His father had seven children, three girls and four boys. Two of the boys, Roberto and Guillermo, my brother-in-laws, served in the Army. Carolina, his daughter, is my wife.     
   And so I mention Daniel Pena because he is typical of a lot of the veterans, a lot of Hispanic veterans who have served our country, who never spoke of the war until now as he reaches 87 years of age he begins to talk about those incidents. 
   Let me also take this opportunity, Madam Speaker, as featured by Gebe Martinez, a longtime journalist in Washington. I would like to share with you a story which she featured of a soldier from my own 23rd District of Texas, Nick Arzola. 
   Nick Arzola was defined as a skinny kid from Del Rio, Texas; service in World War II was the pride of his life. He never forgot the precise time he left New York for the war, 5 p.m. on October 7, 1943. Arzola went through the choppy seas, pitched in his ship so violently that he was sick for the entire 18 days' voyage to Scotland. 
   On land, he went from cooking on a gas stove on the battlefront to moving grenades and bombs at a munitions depot. Arzola was a proud American from Del Rio, even if he was considered the only Mexican with a bunch of Yankees, as he used to say. He was good natured despite the stereotype. His war buddies first thought he looked Filipino. Then, they called him Pancho Villa and they called him Casanova, according to the tales. 
   When he returned to Texas after the war, he traveled a road that would later be named for Cleto Rodriguez, the first Hispanic to receive the Medal of Honor for his bravery in the battle in Manila. 
   Nick opened a barbershop in Del Rio and painted signs freehand, including billboards for rising Texas politicians  such as Lloyd Bentsen. A veteran, he never missed an election and rounded up voters to take part in freedom as he campaigned. 
   Until he died in 2005, he was part of the uniformed honor guard at the funeral of Del Rio's war veterans, one where to this day you have a large number of veterans there in Del Rio that continue to volunteer as their veterans pass away and do the honors of burying them. 
   Nick Arzola's story may not seem unlike that of other veterans, but this is a representation of part of America's history that has too often been forgotten. His story, like the stories many colleagues have shared, have not been told. Nick never missed an election and rounded up votes as he worked and will continue to do so. 
   So I want to take this opportunity to also mention, as I have a few minutes left, we talked the last few weeks about the situation that we find ourselves with as PBS has a 14-hour program on World War II that will be released in September. There has been a great deal of concern about the lack of Hispanic participation in that particular program. We have had meetings with Ken Burns and others and have been pleased that we have been able to make some inroads. There is still a lot of work to be done. 
   I do want to mention that I am also concerned that within our own population we don't know the history of the role that Mexican Americans and Hispanics have played, not only in World War II but throughout all the wars. 
   I want to mention a group of Mexicans, these are truly Mexicans from Mexico that played a very significant role in World War II in defense of the United States and that was referred to as Escuadron 201, the Aztec Eagles, as they were called. The 201 Escuadron was a group of 300 Mexicans that were trained in the United States and fought on behalf of the United States, with some 38 Mexican pilots that were trained in this country. 
   On December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mexico severed its ties with Germany, Italy, and Japan. And in May 1942, the Nazis also sank a Mexican tanker, and Mexico declared war against the Axis powers. During that time, Mexico participated in the war, and one group was the Escuadron 201. This group of 300 individuals that were Mexicans were trained in this country. The 201 successfully participated in the Allied efforts to bomb Luzon and Formosa, known as Taiwan now, to attempt to push the Japanese out of the island. 
   Assigned to the 58th Fighter Group of the United States Fifth Air Force, the Aztec Eagles, as they were called, were also used in ground support efforts after the aerial threat from Japan weakened. During those ground assignments, the men of the squadron saw firsthand the fearlessness and war mentality of the Japanese soldiers. Japanese soldiers were often captured after trying to come into the U.S. military campsites for food, as they recalled during the stories. Several of these soldiers such as Captain Reynaldo Gallardo and others continue to remember their efforts. 
   I want to mention, on Veterans Day Carlos Faustinos, a former member of the Escuadron 201, always is proud of flying not only Old Glory but the Mexican flag, because he, as a Mexican, fought on behalf of the United States against the Japanese. He was also known for being able to down six Japanese Zeros, which basically makes him an ace, and was able to get credit and receive La Cruz de Honor, the Cross of Honor, which is equivalent to the U.S. Medal of Honor award in this country. 
   Very few Americans know of the 201 Escuadron. Very few of them know of the Aztec Eagles, these Mexicans who fought with the U.S. troops as troopers and fought over the sea in the Pacific. They continue to engage and continue to meet, and I know the G.I. Forum has recently honored their efforts, but much more needs to be done. 
   Let me take this opportunity in closing to indicate that as we honor our troops, it is not just sufficient for us to honor them with our words. We have to honor them with our acts. And that is why I am extremely proud to announce that this legislation has put more money for our veterans service than any other in history. I am glad that the budget for 2008 has $6.6 billion, and I know that the House of Representatives will be voting on that. That $6.6 billion is the resources that are essentially needed at this present time to help. 
   And for 2007, I am also proud to say that we were able to take that particular piece of legislation that should have been passed last year, that was passed by this Congress, the concurrent resolution, and that we added to that bill after we struck all the line items that were placed on that bill the previous year by the previous Congress, we struck every single line item, and we added $3.6 billion for the VA. 
   So I am pleased not only that we did that, but I am also pleased to announce that the supplemental that the President will hopefully eventually sign has an additional $1.7 billion for our troops for health care. That is the way to honor our troops not only with our words but with our deeds.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (EFFECTS OF TROOP DEPLOYMENTS -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. And I want to personally take this opportunity to thank you for your leadership as chairman of the VA Committee. And I can honestly tell you that I spent 8 years on the committee prior to leaving for 2 years and then coming back, and it has been day and night with your leadership there. And I want to personally thank you. 
   Nothing was more frustrating than to serve on the VA Committee for 8 long years and not be able to make things happen. And, in fact, during that period of time is when we were charging our veterans even co-payments and fees and those kind of things. But in the last 1 year and 4 months we have been able, not only with the 2007 budget, the 2008 budget, and the supplemental, we have been able to put $13 billion to our veterans. And so I want to personally thank you for your leadership on the part of the legislation that we have passed. 
   Just today in your committee, Mr. Chairman--and Chairwoman, thank you for this opportunity--we are able to pass a series of bills, one of them that seemed to simple, but picks up the COLA that addresses the needs of the survivor spouse as well as children, survivors of veterans, as well as disability compensation. So I want to thank you for that. 
   Let me just give you a couple of statistics. More than 700,000 children have had parents deployed at some point during the conflict, 700,000 children; 19,000 children have had their parents wounded in action; some 2,220 children have lost their parents both in Afghanistan and Iraq. Not to mention the fact that we have lost more soldiers, some 6,000 per year, to suicides, which is uncalled for. And I am really glad that we have started to move on working on posttraumatic stress with our soldiers and adding some resources, and including legislation that allows an opportunity for the first time to reach out and work with the families of those individuals that suffer from posttraumatic stress disorders. 
   I know personally, just like those families know, that when somebody suffers from posttraumatic stress, just like when somebody suffers from alcoholism, the whole family gets impacted, the children, the spouses. 
   I just got a call a couple of weeks ago from a soldier that is getting deployed for the fourth time. And he was basically telling me, ``Mr. Rodriguez, I have already lost my wife, we have gotten a divorce, and they are now taking away the opportunity for me to visit the children.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. It really does. And one of the things that we are now looking back, and we should even go back to the Vietnam era, a large number of those veterans that are homeless out there are suffering from posttraumatic stress from the Vietnam veteran era. So we cannot allow that to occur to this generation of soldiers coming in from Iraq and Afghanistan. So I am real pleased with the resources that we have come forward. Now, we have got to make sure that we have those programs and treatment that reach out not only to that veteran but to the entire family and community as a whole. We allowed for legislation because we don't have the sufficient workers out there to provide that treatment, to contract out with the community health centers, mental health centers, to reach out as quickly as possible to those specific soldiers. 
   We are anticipating, and we are trying to make it more flexible so that soldiers can go through that treatment, because we also know that part of that is we don't want them to go through the stigma, but it almost has to be required that every soldier in those kind of settings go through some degree of treatment to assure that we can come to grips with it as quickly as possible. 
   We know that the number of suicides that are occurring right now, some 6,000 annually, that is uncalled for. And it is disproportional on the side of veterans versus the general public in terms of those suicides. 
   I had a young lady in the military that committed suicide. And, believe me, when they commit suicide while in the military, they get treated very differently. The family does not get any compensation whatsoever. And we are having difficulty right now, as we had difficulty with the DOD, Department of Defense, when they ID'd some 22,000 soldiers with personality disorders. When that occurs, that means that it is a preexisting condition. We have to go back and assess. Maybe they do belong with that diagnosis, but we have got to make sure that they are not wrongly diagnosed and not given what they should be; otherwise, they won't be receiving their compensation. 
   So I want to personally thank you for allowing us to come here tonight and talk about our soldiers and their families and their children, because they are the ones who are also suffering, and those statistics are just alarming and we should not tolerate that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to personally thank both the gentleman from Tennessee and the gentleman from Illinois, Chairman Davis, for allowing me this opportunity. I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Honorable Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson for bringing forth this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Claudia Taylor ``Lady Bird'' Johnson. Mrs. Lady Bird Johnson was a woman of incredible caliber, a woman whose contributions of admirable causes have bettered not only Texas, but the entire Nation as a whole. 
   She redefined what it meant to be a First Lady. Along with championing the environment, Lady Bird Johnson was a confidante to her husband, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and was invaluable to his efforts, improving not only health care but education. She, like no one else, understood the importance of early intervention when it came to education. Her efforts in Head Start to this day are there to show that Head Start has been a program that reaches out to these poor youngsters. Head Start has also proven that those youngsters that participate in Head Start are less likely to drop out than those that don't. She understood that from the very beginning. 
   Lady Bird Johnson knew and had that Texas charm and wit. Her passion for the environment has left a lasting mark on America. Thanks to her tenacious effort in initiating beautification projects, the Nation's highways are more pleasant to drive on and the Nation's Capital is a lovelier sight. The city of San Antonio, where Lady Bird married President Johnson, has also benefited from the First Lady's efforts. 
   Her highway beautification projects had a lasting impact not only in San Antonio, but throughout Texas. The Texas Department of Transportation says Lady Bird Johnson's Highway Beautification Act that became law in 1965 annually dispenses over 5.6 billion wildflower seeds of some 30 varieties, including our State flower, the bluebonnet. Lady Bird devoted much of her later life to beautifying her home and the State of Texas with admirable work. 
   With eternal gratitude from all of us, I ask you to join me today in remembering the magnificent work Lady Bird Johnson has done for all of us. I want to thank her for what she has done for all of us. 
   Let me just say that every spring as we go along the highways and as the flowers bloom, we will remember her for what she has done for all of us. She now rests near the Pedernales River in Texas. Her legacy will forever be with us.

   Let me thank Chairman MILLER on his efforts and just indicate to you that the State of Texas is the one that has the most to gain. We have over 900,000 such workers that would be impacted by this piece of legislation. And, for those, let me also indicate that in Texas nearly 70 percent of low-wage employees work full time. I will repeat that. Seventy percent of low-wage employees work full time. And, among those, almost 40 percent of the low-wage workers are sole breadwinners. Forty percent are sole breadwinners. So this is something that is critical. This is something that is important, something that needs to happen. 
   The minimum wage increase improves the economic well-being of our families. It provides for better living conditions and improving the quality of life. And I cannot comprehend why Members of Congress that have been here over 10 years, who have voted on their own increase each time, and yet not allow an opportunity for individuals that are in the lowest part of the wages in this country be able to get a pay increase.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, as a proud Texan, I rise this afternoon in support of H.R. 584 in naming the Department of Education Headquarters Building in Washington, D.C. after the first ``Education President,'' President Lyndon B Johnson. 
   Like myself, President Johnson began his career in the field of education and, like me, he also had to borrow money in order to attend college. 
   In 1927, he borrowed $75, as indicated by the previous speaker, to attend the Southwest Texas State Teachers College in San Marcos, Texas. He temporarily dropped out of school to serve also as a principal and teacher, and he taught at a school in South Texas in La Salle County in a city by the name of Cotulla, which is a city that I had the pleasure of representing while I was representing the 28th Congressional District. There he taught a good number of Mexican Americans as a young man. 
   On August 19, 1930, President Johnson graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Science and continued teaching at Pearsall High School, also in the 28th Congressional District that I served. 
   Pioneering the importance of education as our President, on April 11, 1965, Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was the first Federal general aid to education law and focused on disadvantaged children, both in inner cities and rural communities throughout this country. 
   Madam Speaker, President Johnson has no Federal buildings in the District of Columbia named after him, and since he enacted over 60 education bills in his term, including the Economic Opportunity Act, Head Start, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (title I) and the Higher Education Act, (beginning student loan program), the Department of Education building is a fitting honor for President LBJ. 
   I urge my colleagues in joining me in passing H.R. 584.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. I want to personally thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership throughout the country and your efforts in providing for our veterans. 
   I know I had the pleasure of serving on the Veterans Committee, and nothing was more frustrating than during the period of time that I served to just give nothing but lip service, and at the same time see the major cuts of the administration when it came to our veterans after having served our country. When I saw the budgets of the administration continuously bring forth additional fees and copayments on our veterans when both sides were saying that that was not appropriate, he continues to do that with this present budget. And if that was not enough, I know that he cut priority 8 veterans. And I'm glad to see that this budget includes that on there, so I want to personally thank you for that. 
   In addition, the Democratic budget calls for advance pay and benefits to improve the quality of life of our troops and their families, including the emphasis on providing support and assistance to our troops and their families while they are deployed. And that is essential. It's unfortunate, and we cannot even comprehend how this has come about. 
   Let me just say, this budget also calls for a $15.9 billion cut for the next 5 years on our soldiers, on TRICARE. As it is, the reimbursements on TRICARE are real low, to the point that some of our doctors are not going to take some of those soldiers and provide access to health care that they need. 
   But I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairman and the leadership on this budget effort for making sure that our troops have the resources that are necessary, and to make sure that our veterans, after they come back, have the services that they're entitled to. We need to push forth on making sure those polytrauma centers get built so that access to health care is essential. 
   Thank you very much for this colloquy.  
   Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this Budget resolution. This budget provides for among many other elements the much needed resources for our country's defense needs. 
   As you know, I represent a very large district that spans from San Antonio in the east to El Paso County in the west and south to the Mexico border. The U.S. military is very important to my district as evidenced by the BRAC decisions that centralize military medical training in San Antonio and bring soldiers from Europe back to Fort Bliss in El Paso. While the defense budget is important to the Nation as a whole, it has a particularly strong significance to my constituents.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I stand before you offering my generous support for the commemoration of H. Res. 942, recognizing the significance of Black History Month. This is a month to honor the tremendous strides and achievements made by numerous African-American leaders and activists, and to signify our continued celebration of diversity in the United States. I urge all Americans to use this month as an opportunity to recognize the accomplishments made by past African-American leaders while continuing to work for the advancement of racial equality. 
   The enormous contributions made by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Dubois and other notable leaders in the African-American community have championed improved race relations and equality. We must also highlight the achievements made by a host of prominent African-Americans in other fields such as the arts, athletics, politics, and academia. 
   This year's theme, ``Carter G. Woodson and the Origins of Multiculturalism,'' honors the founder of Black History Month and applauds his commitment to the preservation of African-American history. Woodson was instrumental in popularizing the role the African-American community has played in enriching the history of the United States. His mission and legacy is one our country must uphold while continuing to inspire future generations to embrace diversity and equality. 
   Again, I would like to express my support for the significance of February 2008 as Black History Month. Let the following month serve as a reminder of our indebtedness to those leaders possessing the courage to combat injustice. They have completed the ultimate service not only for the African-American community in the United States but for all citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand here today in support of H.R. 6176, legislation to authorize the expansion of Fort Davis National Historic Site in Fort Davis, Texas. I would like to thank my good friends Chairman Grijalva and Chairman Rahall for their support of this legislation. 
   Fort Davis Historic Site is considered by many to be one of the most well preserved forts in the Southwest. This fort has historical and cultural importance to the communities of West Texas and it is our job to protect and preserve this piece of our Nation's history. In the 1800s the District I represent today was scattered with U.S. Army forts designed to protect travelers and settlers along the western trade routes from San Antonio to El Paso. The oldest and most preserved of these forts is Fort Davis, now a National Historic Site. 
   This legislation authorizes the National Park Service to acquire a prominent bluff on the western view shed of the site. It is the desire of the community of Fort Davis and the surrounding region that the Fort Davis Historic Site acquire the prominent bluff so that landscape of the Fort Davis Historic Site can remain the same as it was in the 19th century. 
   Fortunately a strong community movement led to the purchase of the land by a conservationist, who, in conjunction with the Conservation Fund, hopes to sell or donate the land to the National Park Service. 
   The bluff that the legislation aims to protect is vital to the experience of the visitors to the Fort Davis National Historic Site as well as the surrounding community of Fort Davis. It is my hope that this legislation will provide protection for this important historic site and will allow the park to continue to serve as an example of a typical western military fort from the 1800s. 
   Thank you for bringing this piece of legislation to the House floor for the communities of West Texas. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 6176, legislation to protect Fort Davis and this important piece of West Texas history.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, we have 46 million Americans that are uninsured, of which a large number are children. I have heard individuals come up and talk about the undocumented individuals. They are not covered by this particular piece of legislation. 
   If you live in rural America, if you live in rural Texas, you don't have access to insurance coverage. If you are not working for the government and if you are just working for a small company, you don't have access. If you make $20,000 or $40,000 a year, that is not sufficient to be able to cover your children. That is why we need a program that allows an opportunity for our young people to be able to get coverage. 
   These are Americans who are working hard. These are Americans who don't qualify for Medicaid because they are not poor enough and they are paying their taxes. These are Americans that don't qualify for Medicare because they're not old enough. Yet, they find themselves working hard every single day and are not able to cover their children. 
   We have to do the right thing. We have to make sure that we pay for those youngsters and allow an opportunity for them to have access. After all, they are the ones that are paying the taxes. They are the ones out there working hard, and yet they don't have their kids insured.

I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize our chairman, BOB FILNER, for his leadership on this issue, and I want to personally thank him for what's accomplished on a variety of issues regarding veterans. 
   I also want to acknowledge my friend, Congressman Miller, for his efforts also on this particular bill. 
   This is an important piece of legislation and the nearly 60,000 veterans in my mostly rural district will certainly benefit from this particular bill. 
   Earlier this year, I sponsored H.R. 2689, a bill that improves mental health services for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans. This bill would establish a program for peer-to-peer outreach and counseling for veterans. Many experts believe this method is critical for getting veterans in need of services into the VA system. 
   Additionally, under H.R. 2689, the VA would be required to look beyond its current services to ensure that veterans have access to the services that they need by embracing the expertise available in our communities and contract out to qualified providers such as community mental health centers who have been providing quality mental health services for families for many years. 
   Under the leadership of the chairman, my bill was incorporated into this bill, and I want to personally thank him. 
   Also included in this bill are provisions critical to veterans, as our Speaker today understands, in Texas, such as the transportation grants for rural veterans service organizations. In some parts of my district and throughout this country, veterans have to drive long hours to get access to services. This bill allows an opportunity for us to provide some needed assistance and services in this specific area. 
   I also want to acknowledge that this bill also has language that deals with Project SHAD, a bill that was extremely important to begin to identify those thousands of soldiers that we also used weapons such as nerve gas and other types of testing on, that we did on our own soldiers that allows an opportunity for them to continue to get service. 
   And other members of this committee, I want to personally thank them for their efforts. Once again, I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairman for his leadership.

While The Post should be commended for bringing the information to this Nation, it should never have gotten to this point. Last week, we also learned that some Republican colleagues knew of these conditions and basically did nothing. This response of doing nothing is not acceptable. 
   Rather than inquiring about such bad conditions and deciding to do something, they choose to brush it off and basically bring it under the table. And rather than finding out who was responsible for the housing of our troops that had mold, that had mice and cockroaches, the administration chose to look the other way. 
   Doing nothing is not acceptable. Last week, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, which I sit on, held hearings, and will continue to hold hearings, on the treatment of our wounded soldiers throughout this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a former social worker serving in the United States Congress, and I rise to honor the work of professional social workers across the country and throughout the world. 
   I would like to join my colleagues in the National Association of Social Workers in recognizing March as National Professional Social Work Month and today as World Social Work Day. Today we have the opportunity to acknowledge the important contributions that social workers make in our community and throughout this country. 
   Today the House overwhelmingly passed H. Res. 266 to recognize the goals and ideals of National Professional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day. This legislation offered the Congress a valuable occasion to support professionals who have helped individuals, families, and communities resolve complicated issues and make significant choices. 
   My experience as a social worker had a profound influence on my decision to enter public life. I could see that many of the challenges facing my clients and those that I worked with had stemmed from the decisions being made at the public policy level. Serving in Congress allows me to be able to continue to help my clients in a broader capacity. 
   Social work as a profession is a commitment to not only addressing the individual needs of clients, but also in creating a just system. As a Member of Congress, I work every day to create a just system for the American people. 
   This year, the theme of National Professional Social Work Month is ``Hope and Health.'' This theme allows us to highlight the considerable involvement of social workers in the health profession. 
   Social workers often work cooperatively with doctors, nurses and other medical professionals to ensure that their clients receive the highest quality care. Care and attention provided by social workers begins when the client enters the health care profession and does not end until he or she has recovered. 
   When dealing with health care, social workers will most often act as counselors and therapists. In that capacity, they must help the client and his or her family understand the diagnosis, the illnesses, and the emotions involved. In addition, social workers provide much-needed advice and support  regarding the difficult health care decisions that clients must make. 
   In fact, professional social workers provide more mental health care than psychologists, psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses combined, making them the largest provider of mental health services in this country. 
   These services are also extended to our Nation's veterans. Professional social workers provide counseling, substance abuse treatment, crisis intervention and other services to veterans and their families. 
   At a time when our Nation is involved in wars both in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is important that our returning soldiers have access to the compassionate care that social workers provide. The Department of Veterans Affairs employs over 4,400 social workers to assist American veterans, including those returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for joining me in support of H. Res. 266 yesterday and for honoring and paying their respect to our country's professional social workers and the services they provide. 
   I want to take this opportunity also to indicate that as a former social worker, I had the opportunity not only to teach 11 years in the School of Social Work, but also serve as a caseworker for heroin addicts for about 3 years, where I had the opportunity to serve directly with individuals that also had substance abuse, including adolescent substance abuse. I also had the privilege of working in the community mental health area, where I had an enjoyable practice and enjoyed working with individuals. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all the social workers throughout this country for the services they provide.

This act would provide assistance to Indian tribes, State housing finance agencies, State community or development agencies, local nonprofit organizations and community development corporations. 
   According to the Texas Low Income Housing Information Service, in Texas alone, more than one million people have lived in public housing over the past 60 years. In Texas and throughout the country, the majority of families living in public housing have very low income and have no alternative to public housing. 
   My Congressional District is very rural, and housing in these very low-income communities remains a top concern. This act would allow sustainable low income housing and improve the economic standard of our working-class families in Texas. 
   I ask all my colleagues to join me in supporting those in need of assistance by voting for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 42. Anne Richards's devotion to the state of Texas deserves our highest honor and commendation. Her work to promote the rights of women in politics, devotion to equality and her never-failing drive to better the lives of her constituents made her an iconic figure in Texas politics. 
   Governor Richards began her political career in the 1970's fighting for equality. As an advocate for female politicians, she managed Sarah Weddington's successful bid to become a member of the Texas State House of Representatives. She then joined State Representative Weddington as a legislative assistant in 1974, during this time she also participated in Wilhelmina Delco's campaign to become the first African-American to represent Austin in the state legislature. Not content to rest there, she provided training sessions across the state for female candidates and managers. She would continue this fight for equality for the next 20 years. 
   In 1982 she was elected to the post of state treasurer becoming the first woman elected to state-wide office in more than 50 years. She devoted herself to the modernization of the state treasury and to earning the greatest possible interest for the state of Texas. According to one estimate, the treasury earned 1.8 billion dollars under her leadership, representing a huge improvement over her predecessor. During her tenure she displayed the incredible wit that made her such a powerful public speaker and one of the most popular figures in Texas politics. 
   After two terms as state treasurer she was elected Governor of the state of Texas in 1990. What she accomplished in her four years as Governor was nothing short of amazing. Among the achievements for which we are honoring her here today, she revitalized the Texan economy, achieving growth during a period of national economic decline. She revamped the Texas prison system to improve rehabilitation for inmates and to better protect the citizens of Texas by establishing a substance abuse program for inmates, working to expand capacity and reduce prison overpopulation, and reducing the number of violent offenders released. The Texas Lottery was also instituted during Governor Richards' time in office as a means to supplement school financing 
   Education and school financing were focal points of her Governorship. She worked tirelessly to make school funding more equitable across districts and championed ``sitebased management'' programs to decentralize school administration. 
   Of her nearly 3,000 government appointments, 46 percent were female, 15 percent were black, 20 percent were Hispanic and 2 percent were Asian American. I rise today to honor her commitment to diversity, her battle for equality, and her lifetime of service to the state of Texas and the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3246, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. 
   This bill provides the opportunity for many communities along the border to receive the assistance and resources they have long needed in order for them to develop their infrastructure and economic prospects. 
   Mr. Speaker, I represent an expansive district spanning from El Paso County in far west Texas, to Dimmitt County about 550 miles south and to South San Antonio about 150 miles west. This district encompasses the longest stretch of U.S.-Mexico border of any district in the United States. 
   These communities along the border lack some of the most basic infrastructure including sewers, roads and health care. These mostly rural communities along the border are often too poor to take advantage of government grants and loan programs. These cities, towns and counties don't have the revenue to provide local matching funds to qualify for federal grants and programs or have the tax base to build million-dollar waste water plants on their own. 
   A regional economic development commission on the southwest border, I believe will put the hundreds of small, rural border communities on the fast track to becoming self-sustaining and developing economically. 
   Mr. Speaker, a Southwest Border Regional Commission would essentially bring the federal government to the border. This bill will not raise taxes, will not create duplicative programs and certainly not provide any services to illegal or undocumented immigrants; this bill instead provides opportunity for our communities that are most in need. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Smith. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in Senate bill 2840, the Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act, sponsored by Senator CHUCK SCHUMER of New York. I was a sponsor on the House side. Senate bill 2840 would address the growing backlog of citizenship applications of those men and women that are serving our country and happen to be foreign born. 
   This bill addresses some of the holdups with the FBI backgrounds, not only for the soldiers, sailors and airmen, but also ensuring that dialogue occurs also with the Department of Defense and the military in the applications. 
   It creates an office of FBI liaison with DHS and monitors the communication gaps that exist between them at the present time. This bill further requires that the agencies send notice out to the military applicants explaining the delay and estimating the date of completion for any application pending over 6 months. 
   This bill works in harmony with the recently passed Kendell Frederick Act. While the Kendell Frederick Act will ensure prompt processing of biometric data and timely adjudication after the FBI background checks are completed, S. 2840 will ensure that the background checks themselves are done expeditiously. 
   Taken together, this bill will be a one-two punch that's required and needed in order for our military servicemen to be able to move forward and become citizens. 
   Some 7,500 military applications are presently pending with citizenship and immigration services. These men and women represent the best of America, and they unquestionably deserve and are owed the full rights of every citizen in this country. 
   The provisions on this bill allow it to hopefully expedite this to occur.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (VETERANS' PROGRAMS EXTENSION AND CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this specific legislation. 
   Let me just indicate that the language that is on there regarding Project 112 efforts, those are studies that were supposedly conducted during the 1960s and 1970s on our own soldiers. There was a variety of studies that were conducted where, basically, we used nerve gas and other things with our own soldiers to see how they would react, and we have prioritized in terms of trying to provide the services and health care needs of these soldiers and to ID them. This allows extension of that language that is needed for us to continue to do the right thing when it comes to our veterans now that suffered under those studies. 
   Let me also say that this is a comprehensive piece of legislation that begins to fund a variety of different programs throughout the country, and including, Mr. Speaker, in your beloved area of Puerto Rico, which you know a large number of soldiers that served our country reside in and will have an opportunity to get extended health care needs there through the clinics. 
   In addition, I am proud to announce that we have four major polytrauma centers in this country, and the fifth one is located in San Antonio. This allows the opportunity for funding of that particular polytrauma center that will allow services to be extended to those soldiers coming both from Afghanistan and Iraq that are seriously injured. 
   So, once again, I want to take this opportunity to thank the leadership for their efforts, and I thank Mr. Filner for the dedicated work he has providing these resources to our veterans throughout the country.

   As a sponsor of H.R. 5826, the House version of this important piece of legislation, I am extremely proud to have had the opportunity to be here today. The House unanimously passed this bill on the 21st of May earlier this year. 
   We are all keenly aware of the burden our current economy places upon American families and the situation that we find ourselves in now with the economy. These same difficulties are magnified with our veterans and their families who rely on disability compensation provided through the Senate bill, S. 2617, the Veterans Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2008. It seeks to address these challenges by increasing the compensation rates in line with the Consumer Price Index for the Social Security COLA. 
   We now have an opportunity to send a bill to the President that will have a direct impact on countless veterans, over 3 million, and also their survivors and families. 
   Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak today during consideration of S. 2617, the companion bill to H.R. 5826. I ask for its support by the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (RURAL VETERANS ACCESS TO CARE ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. It is with great pleasure that I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1527, the Rural Veterans Access to Care Act. This bipartisan legislation, which I have cosponsored, is something that the veterans of my district have been seeking for some time. 
   This bill is in no way an indictment of the services of the VA facilities. Rather, it acknowledges that even health care networks as far-reaching as the VA can meet the needs of our veterans. This bill will provide the rural veterans from the western rural portions of my district the ability to seek health care in their communities rather than having to travel hundreds of miles to El Paso and sometimes even Albuquerque, although, as a pilot program, I am confident that the merits of bringing care closer to the veterans will prove to be revolutionary in the way that this Nation cares for its servicemembers and will be adopted nationwide. 
   I am pleased with the definition in the bill of ``highly rural veterans'' as one who resides in a location that is more than 60 miles driving distance from the nearest Department health care facilities providing primary care services, more than 120 miles for acute hospital care, and more than 240 miles for tertiary care. 
   Many of the veterans who reside in the 20 counties that I represent fall into this category. The Audie Murphy Hospital in San Antonio and the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio serve a large portion of my district's veteran community. About 600 miles to the northwest to the opposite end of my district is the El Paso VA Clinic and the William Beaumont Army Medical Center that serves a portion of the western part of Texas. 
   They provide quality health care for our veterans. However, neither the  Audie Murphy VA, nor the El Paso VA Clinic, are within my district. As a matter of fact, my district has no VA facilities at all, and it's one of the largest in the Nation. It spans 785 miles to the Mexican border, 650 miles straight from San Antonio to El Paso. Needless to say, extending current services into these areas are essential. This bill will allow that opportunity to make it happen. 
   I want to thank Chairman BOB FILNER, and I seriously mean this sincerely. I spent 8 years on this committee and we have been trying to get these types of pieces of legislation out. I want to thank him for his leadership and allowing us to be able to make this happen. 
   So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1527, to allow rural American veterans to be able to have access to health care in this country. Thank you very much.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (EXPRESSING GRATITUDE FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE AMERICAN GI FORUM ON ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and ranking member. 
   Let me take this opportunity, first of all, to congratulate the GI Forum on their extraordinary work. These are veterans that came after World War II and continue to give in their communities. 
   I speak today on behalf of a bill that I introduced, House Resolution 1291, expressing the gratitude for the contributions of the American GI Forum on its 60th anniversary. Some 60 years ago, Dr. Hector P. Garcia, a U.S. Army major and veteran of World War II, established the American GI Forum in Corpus Christi, Texas, to address the concerns of the Mexican American veterans who were segregated from other veteran groups. 
   Dr. Garcia initially formed the group to request services for the World War II veterans of Mexican descent who were denied medical services by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. The forum soon spread into nonveteran issues, such as voting rights issues, jury selection issues, and educational desegregation issues, advocating for civil rights of all Mexican Americans. 
   The GI Forum's first campaign was on behalf of Felix Longoria, a Mexican American private who had been killed in the Philippines in the line of duty. Upon the return of his body to Texas, he was denied burial services in Texas, and Dr. Garcia and the GI Forum were organized around this issue, requesting the involvement of then-Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, who secured Longoria's burial at the Arlington National Cemetery. This was a soldier whose body had been returned to Texas and was denied burial in a particular cemetery in south Texas. 
   The case brought the American GI Forum to the national attention and the charters were obtained throughout the country. A large number of GI Forum organizations were organized during that period, and continue to this day. 
   Ten years later, in 1998, Congress officially recognized the GI Forum with a charter. Its motto is ``Education is our Freedom and Freedom Should be Everybody's Business.'' The forum currently operates chapters throughout the United States, with a focus on veterans' issues, education, and civil rights. Its two largest national programs are the San Antonio-based Veterans Outreach Programs and the Dallas-based Service, Employment, Redevelopment-Jobs for progress. 
   I want to urge Members of Congress to join me in voting for the resolution and expressing the gratitude for the contributions of the GI Forum. 
   Let me just also indicate that the resolution that we drafted, at the end says, ``Whereas, the GI Forum continues to be a beacon of hope.'' These individuals continue to work with our veterans. They have a beautiful homeless project that reaches out to our veterans out there, and it's veterans working with veterans. 
   So it says, ``Now, therefore be it resolved that the House of Representatives recognizes the need for equal access to veterans benefits for all who have honored their service to, support the goals and ideals and deeds of the American GI Forum and its members, and commends the work of the American GI Forum on its 60th anniversary, and encourages others to join with the American GI Forum to ensure that veterans are never again denied the benefits that they rightfully deserve.'' 
   So I will ask for your support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Thank you. The intent, if you look at the final, ``Be it resolved that the House of Representatives recognizes the needs of equal access to veterans benefits for all who have honorably served and continues to support the goals and ideals.'' 
   Now the whereases that are there, those are the founding principles as to why that group got together right after the war. We all know that there was discrimination. We know that people were denied. There were the Mexican schools and the all-white schools. There were places where you couldn't go eat in Texas either if you were a Mexican. So that existed. 
   So the language is there as a result of the foundation of this group that organized. When that body came back, as a soldier, he was denied burial. We have Mexican burial sites and white burial sites. Unfortunately, we still have them, in some cases. But the reality was that that is the reality of then. So the whereases talk about the time then where the discrimination existed. 
   Yes, there were other groups that were discriminated and other people that were denied. But this is not about African Americans, this is not about women. It's about the veterans that served at that point in time that came back and experienced that discrimination. That is why the organization was organized. 
   By the way, the group now does a beautiful job, and if anyone espouses and loves this country more, it is those veterans that are part of the GI Forum, and they are the ones that have a beautiful program for job training, they have some programs that deal with the homeless, and a variety of other types of programs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Chairman, let me take this opportunity first of all to rise and indicate that I am here on behalf of the Napolitano amendment. The amendment would prohibit Mexican companies and inspectors from performing mechanical inspections of trains unless they meet specific U.S. standards, including rigorous training of inspectors. 
   I think that is essential. We have some 10,000 trains that cross the U.S.-Mexican border through my district alone. We had over four derailments in 2004. We think this is an amendment that is important and is critical in order for us to continue to have safety in those trains. 
   So I want to encourage the passage of the amendment by Congresswoman Grace Napolitano that will allow an opportunity for those inspectors to be well trained and to make sure that they specify U.S. standards before that occurs. 
   As I indicated earlier, I represent the longest stretch of the Mexican border of any Member of Congress, and I think that this is an area of significance and importance.

   The Iraqi government must meet the security, political and economic benchmarks that they have set for themselves. I would think that every Member of this Congress would want to hold the Iraqi Government accountable for the promises it has made earlier this year. 
   On our supplemental, the bill fully funds the troops for the next 2 to 3 months, ensuring that they have everything they need to conduct their mission. The bill includes additional funding to include improve military readiness above the President's request. The bill includes additional $1.8 billion for veterans' health care above the President's request. The bill also includes additional funding for the troops above what the President has requested. It is time for us to hold the Iraqi government responsible and ask them to come up to the plate as we have done ourselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (RECOGNIZING 63RD ANNIVERSARY OF BIG BEND NATIONAL PARK -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 483, to recognize the anniversary of Big Bend National Park. 
   Sixty-three years ago the State of Texas bestowed the 800,000 acres of pristine desert and mountain terrain that now make up the Big Bend National Park upon the United States of America. 
   Big Bend began as a small State park, but in 1942, just following the Great Depression, Texas purchased 600,000 acres of land from private landowners at the price of $1.5 million. 
   The cost was high at the time, but Texas donated the land to the Federal Government for the establishment of a national park. 
   With that gesture, the State of Texas provided the Nation and its citizens with a majestic national park that has been enjoyed for over a half a century so far. 
   This resolution pays tribute not only to the picturesque landscape of the park itself, but to those who made it possible to preserve this land for generations to come. 
   Everett Ewing Townsend, known as the father of Big Bend National Park, was the champion of this effort. 
   In 1894 Townsend traveled to the Chisos Mountains and later recalled that the breathtaking southern view from the mountains made him ``see God as he had never seen Him before.'' 
   He vowed to preserve the region in some way, and 63 years later we can see that he has made good on his promise. 
   His efforts, first in the State Legislature and later as the Commissioner of the national park, provided the United States with an unspoiled tract of land that has since been enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of visitors. 
   Big Bend National Park, encompassing the region where the Chihuahuan Desert intersects with the Chisos Mountains features a distinct landscape. 
   The park is surrounded on the south by the mighty Rio Grande. 
   The outer boundary is marked by the area where the flow of the river shifts from southeast to northeast, forming the giant bend after which the park is named. 
   With river, mountain and desert all in one, Big Bend National Park could easily be considered three parks in one. 
   However, west Texas is fortunate to have such a diverse environment preserved within the boundaries of one awe-inspiring park. 
   The establishment of Big Bend National Park in 1944 allowed the vast expanse of land to be conserved. 
   At the same time, it protected the rich history of the region. 
   Native people have inhabited the area for thousands of years, and in more recent years diverse groups of people have traversed the Big Bend. 
   In the past century and a half Spanish explorers, Comanche Indians, Mexican settlers and American ranchers have all traveled through or lived within the park's terrain. 
   Thus, this important resolution recognizes the 63rd anniversary of the establishment of  Big Bend National Park and the people who made their way through the region well before then. 
   H. Res. 483 also honors the National Park Service for their work in the Big Bend. 
   It is important that we recognize Big Bend National Park's contributions to our Nation as well as the contribution that the park's founders and staff have made to the land since then.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize and celebrate the 80th birthday of C&#233;sar E. Ch&#225;vez. 
   C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez was born in Yuma, Arizona, and grew up in migrant labor camps, into the poverty of the migrant worker's life. He became an historical figure who embodied humility and extraordinary strength during his peaceful struggle towards social justice. 
   He was an individual who represented the ones who had less and had no representation whatsoever. He dedicated his entire life to tirelessly championing the rights of the farm laborers; and along with him was Dolores Huerta, also founder of the United Farm Workers union, fighting for better wages and conditions for those individuals that pick our fruit and feed our Nation. 
   C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez has been an extraordinary icon in my home State of Texas. In San Antonio, we honor his legacy during the annual C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez march to recognize those individuals that labor picking up our food. 
   Additionally, we cannot travel anywhere in the United States without seeing a town or street named after this amazing individual. We in San Antonio, Texas, have C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez Boulevard as well as others throughout the country. 
   I hope that his legacy will continue to remain, and I rise today to encourage my colleagues, urging the President and the Congress to establish a national holiday for C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez and encourage them to support H. Res. 76.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, today the House of Representatives has an historic  opportunity to provide health insurance for 10 million children from low-income families. In fact, when the House takes up a motion to override the President's veto on the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act, it will be the second time in as many months that Congress votes to provide low-income, working families with health insurance for their children. 
   This legislation, passed by Congress in September, is an essential step in providing better access to healthcare for the 47 million uninsured individuals in this country, 5 million of whom are children. One could argue that the state of Texas, which has the highest percentage of uninsured individuals of any state in the Nation, needs this bill the most. Texas is home to a staggering 1.4 million children who lack even the most basic health insurance. 
   The CHIP Reauthorization that President Bush vetoed provides health insurance for 10 million underprivileged American children. The bill adds $35 billion for the CHIP program over the next 5 years. It maintains coverage for the 6 million children who are already enrolled, and allows for an additional 3.8 million who are already eligible for the program to start receiving benefits. 
   Instead of supporting this modest expansion, President Bush wants to increase funding for CHIP by a mere $5 billion over the next 5 years. Such a proposal would not allow for any new eligible, uninsured children to enroll in the program. In fact, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, President Bush's proposal would result in 840,000 children losing their CHIP coverage. 
   We cannot in good conscience enact a program that will push children from the CHIP rolls. I will stand behind the Congressionally-passed CHIP authorization and hope that my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me and override the President's veto today.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for this time and for your willingness to work with me on issues that are important to my district and to the State and the country as a whole. 
   As you know, I represent one of the longest stretches of the southern border with Mexico, my congressional district, the 23rd. Eleven counties in my district are on the Mexican border, and a variety of others are 20 miles away from the Mexican border. 
   As I travel throughout my district, one of the most common concerns is the lack of resources rural law enforcement officers have on the border. These departments often have just a few officers on the entire force, and they have to handle the same drug cases and human smuggling cases that large cities do. Except processing these cases in small communities means taking half or, in some cases, all of the staff in those particular communities. 
   I had planned to offer an amendment that would have provided necessary additional resources for the border to local police departments as well as the sheriff's departments to hire and equip and train additional officers. I have withdrawn that amendment with the hopes of being able to work with the chairman and this committee to bring this critical aid to our local law enforcement on the Mexican border. 
   Mr. Chairman, once again, I thank you; and I would ask for your help and your assistance.

   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Farm Bill. 
   I commend Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte for producing a fair compromise that will go a long way in sustaining our agricultural system as well as supporting vital nutrition, conservation and research programs. 
   I would also like to thank the Chairman for including language directing the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study of waste water infrastructure along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
   Many rural communities along the border are living with inadequate waste water treatment plants and sewer management systems. 
   Without improved infrastructure and access to clean water these communities face significant public health threats. 
   This study will determine what steps the Federal Government can take to bring inadequate waste water systems in rural border communities up to date. 
   In my district alone I have heard from the communities of Sabinal, Clint, Fort Stockton, Presidio and Fort Hancock, Texas, all of which are in desperate need of assistance with their waste water management systems. 
   I represent over 600 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border and when I travel through my district I hear over and over again that these communities need help. 
   Our rural and underserved populations need our support in addressing the health hazards that come with insufficient water management systems and this study is a critical first step. 
   Current programs at the USDA Rural Development agency provide for loan/grant awards for rural infrastructure needs. 
   More often than not, the loan portion is 75 percent or more of the award. As we all know, waste water systems can range from $5 to $10 million or more. Rural communities do not have the revenue or tax base to take on loans for millions of dollars. 
   If these programs are the only assistance we have to offer, then we need to reevaluate these programs. 
   It is my hope, that this GAO study will shed some light on this issue and will provide a critical first step to bring adequate waste water systems to our rural communities on the border. 
   Again, I thank the Chairman for his work on the Farm Bill and for the inclusion of this important language.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan resolution that expresses disapproval of the President's escalation of troops in Iraq. In October of 2002, I stood on this floor in this House and voted against giving the President authority to wage war in Iraq. And I did so because I strongly believed that Congress should not abdicate its war powers and hand over to the President a blank check on the war. 
   I also recognized, having served on the Armed Services Committee and on the Terrorist Task Force prior to 9/11, that the evidence was not there. I may not agree with how this war has been handled, but I, along with everyone here and all of my colleagues on both sides, firmly stand by our troops. It is our servicemen and -women who are making a great sacrifice on the battlefield on behalf of all of us here in this Chamber and everyone across the United States. 
   And they, the troops, all deserve our unequivocal support. This war is creating a new generation of veterans and a new generation of needs for them. Today, over 25,000 both dead and wounded have been reported, while this body continues to appropriate billions of dollars to the administration for this war. 
   Let us remember our veterans and the cost to fulfill the promise that we have made to them for medical care. Today, the issue is not whether we were right or wrong to grant the President such broad authority in regards to this war in Iraq, but instead how he has exercised that power, what the results have been, and what his plans are for the future. 
   We have now entered the fifth year of this war. And I ask you, what progress have we made? What is our exit strategy? It is not a new question. It was a question that was raised from the very beginning when we went into this war, and when we raised it in the Armed Services Committee. This war and the reckless strategy behind it have cost us Americans some $532 billion, and over 3,100 American lives, as well as over 3,000 serious injuries. 
   It has resulted in increased sectarian violence and an uncertain future in Iraq. Madam Speaker, I think most of us here know that we need a new direction, and a new direction is justified. I can assure you that the American people want a new direction. 
   But what the President has offered to them is more of the same. The President is now asking for a massive escalation of over 20,000 troops. The escalation plan will not work, just like the previous troop surges that we have had have not worked. Madam Speaker, the American people have asked and have had enough. And with an up-and-down vote on this resolution, this Congress will not only send a message to the President regarding his misguided policy, but also send a message to the American people that their Congress is listening, it is here, and it is calling for a new direction. 
   I oppose this escalation plan because more troops in combat means more casualties and more loss of American lives. I have been to Walter Reed Medical Center, and I have seen our injured young men and women coming back from the battlefield. I have seen the sacrifice of what this war has done to our families and our loved ones. 
   Earlier this week, my office was visited by Mr. Jim Goodnow. He is a veteran from my district and an active member of the Veterans for Peace. Mr. Goodnow has traveled all over the country from his home base in Terlinqua, Texas, aboard his bus dubbed the Yellow Rose. He has been spreading the message of peace for many years. 
   Mr. Goodnow is not alone. And with this resolution we want to make it clear that this Congress and America and the American people have had enough. No more blank checks, no more violence, and no more escalation.     
   Madam Speaker, it is time that we stand by our country and stand up for our troops. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, let me take this opportunity once again to thank Chairman Filner and the ranking member for this opportunity. 
   Let me just say that the 110th Congress will be seen as the Congress that has done the most for veterans in the history of this House in terms of the funding of over $13 billion from the 2007-2008 budget, in addition to the supplementals. This will be the largest amount of resources for the VA since its inception in any one session. So the 110th Congress is going to be seen as one of those Congresses that provided the resources, but also provided the programs that were needed and the accountability that needs to occur in order to make it happen. The result of that is because of the leadership in the form of Congressman Bob Filner, and I want to once again personally thank him for his leadership. 
   Let me just say this particular bill has language that begins to make services permanent for those soldiers that participated in what was referred to as Project 112, or Project SHAD, which were the studies during the Cold War that this country did on our soldiers from the use of nerve gas to other items to see how our soldiers reacted.  Now we know these soldiers are in need of services, and this language extends that opportunity for thousands of these soldiers to get those services that they are entitled to. So I want to thank the leadership for that. I know it was a struggle with the Department of Defense in just identifying these projects. 
   Secondly, I also want to signify that we have four major polytrauma centers throughout this country. The fifth one is going to be built in San Antonio. This particular center allows an opportunity for those soldiers that are out there that come back as veterans that have a multitude of problems, and this will allow the opportunity for returning servicemembers to be able to get the help they are entitled to and the construction of this facility, referred to as the fifth polytrauma center. 
   In closing, let me also just say that I have one of the largest districts in the Nation. My district runs in a straight line 650 miles and 785 miles along the border, over 20 large counties. Some of the counties are larger than some of the States in the country. I have an area where not a single clinic exists in the Rural Health Initiatives that are out there to provide access for these soldiers and veterans. 
   It is also important and essential, as indicated earlier, the fact that we have raised the amount of resources for reimbursement rates per mile for gasoline, and we know we might have to come back and revisit this because of the cost of gasoline. 
   So, once again I thank the chairman and the ranking member for allowing us to pass these pieces of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. RODRIGUEZ. (VETERANS' BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity regarding the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act. 
   This bill improves the treatment and service provided by the Department of  Veterans Affairs to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorders and substance abuse disorders, and many other provisions. 
   This is a great opportunity for us to deal with the issue of post-traumatic stress and be able to get the research that is needed, and also provide the services that are needed for our veterans coming in from Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   We know that our Vietnam veterans suffered tremendously from this, and we were negligent in not providing the services at that time. But I know that they worked hard and lobbied us, making sure that we are there for the soldier that is coming back from Afghanistan and Iraq, and also providing the services for those Vietnam veterans and those veterans from previous wars that are suffering tremendous heartaches and problems from this particular illness. 
   We know that this illness has created difficulties in terms of substance abuse. We know that a lot of them try to self-medicate in dealing with issues, and this will give us a better opportunity to do the necessary clinical work that will give us the insight that will help us to deal with those situations and help these soldiers as well as these veterans and their families. 
   Let me also take this opportunity, this bill also is a bill that incorporates H.R. 5664, a bill that I introduced to correct a bureaucratic oversight in the way that the Veterans Administration advises contractors constructing or renovating houses for disabled veterans. My bill seeks to ensure that the veterans whose homes were updated under this program benefit from all of the modern technology and construction practices that can be provided. 
   Today, veterans, particularly those from Iraq and Afghanistan, are sustaining injuries that in the past conflicts would have resulted in their death. The variety of these injuries require a fresh look at the way that the VA provides guidance to vets in using special adaptive housing grants. The primary guidance that the VA provides contractors who modify homes under this grant program is VA Pamphlet 26-13 titled ``Handbook For Design: Specially Adaptive Housing.'' This guide was last updated in 1978. This bill requires an update to that guide at least every 6 years. 
   I would like to thank once again Chairman Hall and Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for their leadership and their work.
