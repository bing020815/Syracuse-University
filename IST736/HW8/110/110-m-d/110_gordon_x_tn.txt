   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, for too long we have depended on a handful of finite energy resources to power our economy. So as energy prices inevitably rise, we can continue to hand our money over to foreign interests, or we can invest that in our own country's energy independence. 
   This week, the U.S. and world leaders are meeting to define the steps needed to address the challenge of climate change. This energy package will help give our country the technological bump needed to address CO  
   2 emissions and our dependency on foreign energy. This bill will invest in a wide range of energy technologies that use clean natural resources from the sun, the oceans, and our Earth. It will boost the energy efficiency of our vehicles, buildings, and heavy industries. And this bill provides significant increased investment in technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal-fired plants. 
   I am pleased that, over the last year, the Science and Technology Committee has worked hard to clear 14 bipartisan consensus-driven energy and environment research bills, nine of which are included in the House package. So I want to take this opportunity to thank those Democrat and Republican members of our committee, and the minority and majority staff, for their hard and good work. 
   And finally, Mr. Speaker, let me just respond to my friend who says if you vote for this bill, the price of energy is going to go up. The fact of the matter is we all know, whether you vote for or against this bill, the price of energy is going to go up. The question is, are we going the write the check to foreign energy cartels, or are we going to invest that money here in America in clean alternative energy? 
   Mr. Speaker, I am voting for America. I am voting for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Madam Chairman, today I am asking my colleagues in the House to ensure this country's leadership in space and aeronautics program by passing H.R. 6063, the NASA Authorization Act of 2008. 
   First, I want to thank and commend Chairman Udall of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics on his leadership in introducing this bill and for taking a clear bipartisan approach to the development of H.R. 6063. I was pleased to be original cosponsor, but I was even more pleased that ranking minority member of our Committee on Science and Technology, Mr. Hall of Texas, and ranking minority member of our Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, Mr. Feeney of Florida, were also original cosponsors. 
   Madam Chairman, their actions show that the importance of NASA's future in space and aeronautics is truly a bipartisan concern. And I want to thank them for their full support. 
   In that regard, I also would like to thank Ed Feddeman, Ken Monroe, Katy Crooks, and Lee Arnold of the minority staff for their help on this legislation. I also want to thank and acknowledge the hard work of our majority staff involved in the development of the bill, Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee staff director Dick Obermann, Allen Li, Pam Whitney, Devin Bryant, and John Piazza. 
   This bill passed the subcommittee and the full committee unanimously. And I think that record is in no small part due to the hard work that both sides of the aisle put into this legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, as we look to the transition to the new administration next year, it's important that Congress send a strong message on the best future course for our Nation's space and aeronautics program. The bipartisan consensus we have reached on H.R. 6063 signals that Congress believes a balanced NASA program of science, aeronautics, and human spaceflight, and exploration is important and worthy of the Nation's support. Yet I want to emphasize that H.R. 6063 takes a fiscally-responsible approach to providing this support. 
   The baseline authorization represents a 2.8 percent increase, which is inflationary at best, over the level of the authorization of fiscal year 2008. The bill also includes a special funding augmentation to accelerate the development of the crew exploration vehicle and thus minimize the human spaceflight gap that will make us dependent on the Russians to get our astronauts to and from the International Space Station until the CEV is operational. 
   I don't think any of us wants to or looks forward to the day when we must rely on another Nation to launch U.S. astronauts into space, but that is what we face. I want to minimize that dependency as much as possible. 
   However, even including that augmentation, the total funding authorization will only get us back to NASA's fiscal year 1992 funding level in terms of purchasing power. 
   H.R. 6063's baseline authorization also reflects the importance of NASA to the Nation's innovation agenda. NASA science and technology activities contribute much to our national competitiveness initiative, and I think we need to recognize NASA's role in that regard. NASA was included in last year's America COMPETES Act, but we didn't include an authorization then since we knew we would be reauthorizing NASA this year. 
   H.R. 6063 does that providing by providing a baseline authorization for NASA that includes a rate of increase over the fiscal year 2008 appropriated level that is consistent with the rate of increase proposed for agencies included under the America COMPETES Act. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill includes many provisions that are critical to ensuring the future strength of our Nation, including both the future health of our aviation system and our ability to better understand and respond to climate change and other challenges facing the earth's system. 
   It isn't always recognized that NASA counts for some three-fifths of the Nation's climate research funding. And it's a critical part of the Nation's climate research efforts. In addition, H.R. 6063 demonstrates that a properly structured human spaceflight and exploration program can provide benefits of technological, scientific, and geopolitical significance that are worthy of our Nation's investment. 
   This bill also includes provisions that will ensure a productive return on the Nation's investment in developing and  assembling an international space station and encourages the use of the commercial services to transport cargo and eventually crew to the station. We need to ensure that NASA has sufficient resources for all of these and other important tasks that the Nation has asked to carry out, and I believe this bill does that. 
   Madam Chairman, the United States has been a global leader in technology and innovation for decades. However, an esteemed committee of the National Academies raised a deep concern in its groundbreaking report, Rise Above the Gathering Storm, stating ``that the scientific and technical building blocks critical to our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength.'' 
   With China, India, and other global players committed to building robust aeronautics and space programs, that it is incumbent upon the United States to rise to the challenge. 
   This year is the fiftieth anniversary of the dawn of the space age and the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of NASA. NASA has been one of the crown jewels of the Nation's R&D enterprise over the past 50 years. I want to ensure that it remains so for the next 50, and I believe this bill will help turn that into a reality. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill has been endorsed by a host of organizations ranging from the American Association of Universities to the National Association of Manufacturers. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6063 to ensure America's continued leadership and accomplishments in space and aeronautics over the next 50 years. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Madam Chairman, first let me say very sincerely say that there is no Member of Congress that has had greater interest than Mr. Hall in NASA. As a Texan and a proud American, he has taken particular interest in the safety of the astronauts, as well as trying to reap the maximum amount of health benefits from the investment that we've made. He has played just an enormously constructive role, and I thank him for that.  
   We also thank Mr. Udall, the chairman of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, for working in a bipartisan way. He had a number of really thoughtful hearings. He's put together a bill that came out of his subcommittee unanimously, and because he did such a good job there, it was unanimous out of the full committee. So I thank my friend from Colorado. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Udall) 5 minutes.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Madam Chairman this is a bipartisan manager's amendment that has been developed in close collaboration with the Science and Technology Committee minority leadership. 
   It provides several aeronautics-related provisions in the bill to conform them to provisions that were included in last year's House-passed FAA reauthorization bill. 
   It also includes a provision in section 303 related to coordination with the FAA on sonic boom research, which will help ensure that NASA's research results can help inform any future FAA rulemaking. 
   The amendment also encourages the potential scientific utility of emerging commercial, reusable launch vehicles by citing them as potential options for suborbital scientific research once they become available. 
   The amendment also includes language provisions by Mr. Lampson on the value of NASA's EarthKAM and robotics competitions for aspiring students. 
   Both of these activities were great ways to inspire students to learn about math, science and technology by providing exciting learning experiences. And I want to commend Mr. Lampson for his initiative in this area. 
   The amendment also expands section 901 to include a sense of Congress urging NASA's use of entrepreneurial companies to conduct corporate R&D. 
   Innovative ideas and products have repeatedly come out of these small entrepreneurial companies, and this amendment encourages NASA to seek ways to ensure such firms are not disadvantaged when the agency seeks to procure technology development. 
   Finally, the manager's amendment includes several important NASA workforce-related provisions, including an extension of the RIF moratorium, a limit on the use of certain positions in fiscal year 2009, and temporary continuation of health care benefits. 
   We have worked with NASA, the IFPTE union, and Chairman Davis' subcommittee on Federal Workforce to come up with a reasonable set of provisions. 
   The workforce provisions included in the manager's amendment are acceptable to all parties, and I believe they will help strengthen and protect the NASA workforce. 
   In sum, I believe the manager's amendment will make a good deal even better. And I urge Members to support it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Madam Chairman, I also support this amendment, and I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa for his attention to the important issue of tornado research. 
   Tornadoes and tornado-force winds present serious hazards to life and property in the United States. We've already had ample and tragic evidence in recent days of the devastation that can be wreaked by these terrible storms. We need to do all that we can to improve our understanding of tornadoes and learn how to better predict them. 
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has the lead responsibilities for addressing tornado-prediction issues. However, NASA has existing cooperative activities with NOAA that may contribute to greater progress in this effort. NASA's existing cooperative activities with NOAA on facilitating research and data sharing are important to improving our understanding of tornadoes. I agree with Mr. Braley that the work that NOAA and NASA are doing related to tornadoes needs to be given a high priority. 
   That is the objective of this amendment. It is just common sense that we ensure that any relevant work that NASA and NOAA are collaborating on is given the attention and priority it needs to improve our Nation's ability to predict tornado events. 
   I thank the gentleman from Iowa for his initiative for this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. (METHAMPHETAMINE REMEDIATION RESEARCH ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 365, the Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act. This is the same legislation which passed the House a year ago, but was not enacted into law. Unfortunately, the need for this legislation is just as strong today as it was then. 
   We have a terrible problem with methamphetamine in Tennessee and the Nation as a whole. One side effect of the methamphetamine epidemic is the chemical waste dump left behind by meth cooks. H.R. 365 focuses on cleanup needs for former meth labs, a tremendous problem facing communities across the country. 
   The Drug Enforcement Agency reported more than 12,500 domestic meth lab seizures in 2005 alone. These meth labs, most often found in residential settings, are contaminated, not only with methamphetamine but also with other toxic residue associated with the production of meth. These chemical residues pollute the inside of a residence and also threaten septic and water systems. The meth epidemic has not only devastated families, it has also left thousands of potentially toxic waste dumps spread across the country. 
   Right now, there are unsuspecting families living in homes that were once illegal meth labs. Dangerous and hidden toxic substances on these sites threaten the health of these families, with children being the most vulnerable to the devastating long-term effects of exposure. 
   H.R. 365 addresses the specific problem of determining the level of cleanup required to ensure that a former meth lab is safe for occupation. 
   I want to stress that H.R. 365 is not a Federal mandate. Rather, it requires the EPA to develop model, voluntary, health-based cleanup guidelines for use by States and localities if they desire. 
   In addition, H.R. 365 authorizes this to initiate a research program to develop meth detection equipment for field use. 
   This will help law enforcement agents detect active meth labs faster and assist in measuring the levels of contamination in former meth labs. 
   Finally, H.R. 365 requires a study by the National Academy of Sciences on  the long-term health impact of exposure to meth labs on children and first responders. It authorizes a total of $5 million for EPA and NIST to carry out these activities over 2 years, a bargain by any standard. The bill is endorsed by the National Association of Counties, the National Sheriffs' Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Narcotics Officers' Associations' Coalition, the National Association of Realtors, the National Multi-Housing Council and the National Apartment Association. 
   H.R. 365 is not the complete solution to the methamphetamine epidemic. Unfortunately, there will always be people who decide to harm themselves by using methamphetamines, dangerous drugs such as meth or manufacturing dangerous drugs such as meth.     
   H.R. 365 aims to protect innocent people whose lives are endangered by these illegal activities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Hall, Representative Wu, and Representative Calvert for working with me on this legislation in the past Congress, and for sponsoring this legislation for reintroduction in the 110th Congress, as well as I want to thank Mike Quear for the good staff work that has helped bring this bill before us. 
   This bill is an important component in helping our local communities combat the meth problem. I would urge everyone to vote ``yes'' on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to place two letters in the Record.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. I want to say that I share the gentleman's concern about the issue of climate change and about the impact that it may have on our Nation. 
   My committee held three hearings on the working group reports, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, released earlier this year. The Committee on Science and Technology is marking up a bipartisan bill tomorrow authored by Mr. Udall and Mr. Inglis, the different Mr. Udall, H.R. 906, to restructure the U.S. Global Change Research Program to provide more policy-relevant information to Congress and to regional organizations, State and local governments, and to businesses and organizations that are developing and implementing adaptation mitigation strategies. 
   The Global Change Resource Program authorized in the Global Change Research Act of 1990 has guided our government's climate science agenda for the past 17 years. It has had many successes. Much of the research that has been summarized in the IPCC reports emerge from this program, and I commend the gentleman for producing a bill that makes additional money available for climate change. 
   I fully support the allocation of an additional $50 million for the important task of developing adaptation and mitigation strategies. We need to lessen the impact of climate change on our Nation. 
   However, the structure authorized in the bill for determining the research agenda and allocating the funds is not compatible with either the existing structure of the program or the bill the Science Committee will be marking up tomorrow. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have a responsibility to lead the Committee on Science and Technology in a fashion that produces good, consensus-based legislation. I take that very seriously. In the spirit of cooperation, and in the interest of comity, I will not support a motion to strike the climate change commission language from the bill with the understanding that you will agree to work with our committee as we go forward to allocate these funds in a manner that is compatible with authorizing legislation. 
   I am confident that H.R. 906 will provide a solid foundation for reaching the goal that you and I share, addressing the challenge of the climate change through applications of a solid foundation of science on adaptation and mitigation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a father of a 5-year-old daughter, I am deeply concerned about the future of our country. I am concerned that our children could be the first generation of Americans that do not have a better quality of life than their parents. I am concerned about the availability of quality jobs for our children. I am concerned that our country's competitive position in the world will continue to deteriorate. And I am concerned that our country will not have access to energy supplies needed to sustain our economy and our growth. 
   For far too long, our country has relied on foreign sources of oil to meet our energy needs. This dependency is bad for our economic security, it is bad for our national security, it harms our ability to create new quality jobs, and it harms our ability to maintain our competitive position in the world. Ten years from now, I want to look at my daughter and know that I did my part to find a solution. 
   The bill we are considering today will make a significant down payment for the development of new energy technologies. A stable domestic energy supply is essential to economic well-being and security of our Nation. For years, we have been chipping away at energy policy, increasing production here, a tax incentive there, funding energy R&D when it is convenient, and letting programs languish when it is not. 
   It is time we think of new ways to approach this problem. Replacing traditional energy sources requires an unprecedented basic research and development technology effort. We must be a world leader, developing new technologies and sustainable energy sources that will maintain our competitive position. 
   As chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, you have my commitment that our committee will be doing our part. We will be working to use R&D to accelerate the production and use of new biofuels, increase the use of renewable energy, like solar, wind, geothermal, and boost energy efficiency in part by making the Federal Government a model of conservation. 
   We will not ignore the potential contribution of clean coal, carbon capture and storage technologies and better, cleaner ways to produce oil and gas. And we will not shy away from engaging in a thoughtful dialogue of the role of nuclear power. In these ways, we will help ensure a strong, secure energy future for our children and help manufacturers keep jobs here by ensuring a stable, reliable, and affordable energy supply. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I will have the privilege of yielding my time to the next generation of leaders in the energy debate. These new members of the Committee on Science and Technology came to Washington to change things and to make a difference. This is their chance. This is their opportunity to leave a legacy that includes the creation of a reasonable, balanced, and effective energy policy for years to come. I am proud I can join with them in supporting this bill.

   You know, most of my life I have heard of red herrings. Today, I got to hear about a red tuna. 
   It is amazing to me to think that the opponents of this bill could categorize it as sending money overseas. The fact of the matter is what we are doing is we are going to be developing an energy efficiency, an alternative energy, renewable energy in this country so we don't have to send money overseas. It is just the reverse. And not only are we doing that, we are doing it in an economically responsible way in that we are paying as we go. And that is the reason that we are taking these unneeded tax breaks and using them to help us to develop a new type of energy for this country, new jobs for my children, for your children, and for our Nation.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Mitchell for yielding to me, and I want to thank him for the introduction of this important and outstanding piece of legislation. 
   As my friend Dr. Gingrey said, this is a bipartisan piece of legislation coming out of what I hope is thought of as a bipartisan committee. I want to thank him, as well as Mr. Wu, for their work as the subcommittee chairman and ranking member. I want to thank Mr. Hall for his help in getting this bill out as the ranking member of the committee. 
   We have passed more than 30 bills and resolutions out of the Science and Technology Committee, all of which have been bipartisan, and all but one have been unanimous. This is another one of those unanimous bills. I think that happens because we are working together to try to do it the right way. We had a good subcommittee hearing. We had a subcommittee markup, a full committee markup. When you do it that way, you get the type of third-party endorsements that Dr. Gingrey talked about. 
   We have the endorsement of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the National Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the National North American Training Directors, the International Fire Service Training Association, and the Congressional Fire Service Institute. That is quite a lineup to demonstrate the support for this good bill. 
   I also want to thank the members of the committee for their work as this bill was crafted. Ms. Richardson was particularly helpful in bringing her experience of firefighting from a coastal area, and made us realize that a curriculum in marine and port firefighting was important. 
   This is a good bill done the right way, and I thank all parties for their participation.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, my mother grew up way out in the country, way, way out in the country, and when she was a young girl their house burned. The only things they saved were their lives and the clothes on their back. Today, 70 years later, whenever my mother hears a fire engine or sees a fire truck, she tells me that story about how her house burned, almost in a trance. It is a very traumatic experience when a family goes through something like this. 
   That is the reason that our committee worked in a bipartisan way to try to come forth with a very good bill that would help to save lives, save property and help our firefighters do a better job of hopefully shielding some other families from that trauma that my mother went through. 
   It is really unfortunate after all of that work that the gentlewoman would come forth with a mischievous amendment that has had no discussion. We don't know anything about is there a liability problem or not. We don't know whether or not this is going to affect States' own liability or whether this is going to preempt it. 
   The gentlewoman had an opportunity, if this is such an important issue, to both come before the committee and talk to us at the subcommittee level. But there was no discussion. She could have come to the subcommittee markup, where it passed unanimously. But there was no discussion. She could have come to the full committee markup, where again it passed out unanimously, but there was no effort. Or she could have gone to the Rules Committee and asked to have a rule and be allowed to submit the amendment so we could have a discussion, even here at this late date. But there was no effort. 
   Quite frankly, I think this is a game of ``gotcha.'' It is an insult to the Democrats and Republicans on the Science Committee, who worked hard to put this good bill together. It is an insult to the firefighters, who are trying to do their job every day and who need these funds and training. It is an insult to all those individuals and organizations that endorsed this bill, like the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the National Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the North American Fire Training Directors, the International Fire Services Training Association, and the Congressional Fire Service Institute. They endorsed this bill because it is a good bill, a bill that will help firefighters do their job. It is very unfortunate that we are trying to play these games at the last moment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recommend that we vote down this amendment that we know nothing about and that we move forward with this good bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 971. 
   My home State is known as the Volunteer State, and over the last 8 days, the people of Tennessee have proven why we wear that nickname so proudly. When I visited with my neighbors in Macon, Sumner and Trousdale counties after the storm, the devastation was unimaginable. In many instances homes and businesses weren't just knocked down; they were completely gone. People were hurting.  
   But you could not spend time with them without recognizing how strong the community is. And I saw it again and again last week. In the worst of circumstances, friends, neighbors, complete strangers all banded together to help those who are hurting right now. As many of you watched the news last week you no doubt learned that, while Tennessee took the hardest hit, this was not something exclusive to us. People in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Indiana also put their lives on hold to help their neighbors recover. 
   While we can rebuild our communities, we cannot replace human lives. Today I rise to remember the 13 lives lost in Macon County, the 7 in Sumner, the 2 in Trousdale. I also want to honor the First Responders and the volunteers who have treated the injured and who are working so hard to put our communities back together. It's going to take some time, but we're going to get there. And I want to thank President Bush and Governor Bredesen for acting so quickly to get help to our communities. 
   I thank my colleagues for their support last week and their continued support throughout the recovery process. As the President accurately stated a week ago, at times like these, ``Prayers can help and so can the government.'' In Middle Tennessee and throughout the South, we will continue to need those prayers and need the President's help as we work to rebuild the lives and communities affected by these storms. 
   The national cameras are gone and the debris is being removed, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us.

<DOCNO>Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation. Our Nation sits at a crossroads--we can follow the path of business-as-usual, or we can transform our energy paradigm by tapping into the Sun, the oceans, the Earth, and America's most abundant and renewable resource--the human spirit of innovation that has given us the standard of living we enjoy today. 
   The Committee on Science and Technology has worked hard to address our energy challenges, and passed twelve bipartisan, consensus-driven energy and environment research bills, seven of which are included in the legislation before us today. 
   My bill, H.R. 364 establishes an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, or ARPA-E, which will focus on developing transformational energy technologies; 
   H.R. 906, The Global Change Research and Data Management Act introduced by Mr. UDALL and Mr. INGLIS, restructures Federal climate research to provide much needed information for developing response, adaptation, and mitigation strategies for communities and businesses; 
   H.R. 1933, also by Mr. UDALL, authorizes large-scale demonstrations of carbon capture and storage technologies, so that we may continue to use our vast resources of coal in a more environmentally benign way; 
   H.R. 2304 by Representative MCNERNEY will expand our existing geothermal energy R&D, in particular to develop Enhanced Geothermal Systems; 
   H.R. 2313 by Representative HOOLEY will give researchers in the field of Marine Renewable Energy the support they need to move experimental marine energy technologies to commercial viability. 
   H.R. 2773 introduced by Mr. LAMPSON will set forth new research on biofuels including studies on infrastructure needs and studies to improve the efficiency of biorefineries; 
   And finally, H.R. 2774 by Congresswoman GIFFORDS creates several important solar R&D programs, including programs on energy storage technology for concentrating solar power plants and solar energy workforce training; 
   Each of these pieces which are part of the package before us today will enhance our country's energy security and I commend my colleagues for their leadership and vision. The sheer scale and complexity of our energy challenge means that Congress should begin laying the groundwork today. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recognize that we have had differences of opinion, differences of policy and differences concerning procedure for the last couple of days. You have that at the end of a session before you go into a work period, and I am afraid we are going to have some more, and that is unfortunate. But we have an opportunity, at least for the next hour, to have a little window of civility, a little window to work together on a bill, a conference report that is bipartisan and bicameral. It is a competitiveness bill. It is a bill that is going to make America a better place for all of our kids and grandkids. I want to take just a little time to tell you about it. 
   This bill is a compilation of five bills that we passed out of the Science Committee on a bipartisan basis that came to the House floor, none of which received more than 23 votes against them. Then we piled them all together as a suspension and it passed unanimously. 
   Lamar Alexander in the Senate did yeoman's work by going to the Senators and getting 70 cosponsors. It passed in the Senate 88-8. Truly this is a bipartisan, bicameral bill. 
   The reason is, it is a good bill that is going to help manufacturers and businesses, it is going to help workers, it is going to help teachers, it is going to help students, to be able to help America to be in the lead in the world in terms of manufacturing, research, technology and innovation. 
   Again, I want to tell you how this bill came about. Three years ago, Sherry Boehlert, then the chairman of the Science Committee; Lamar Alexander, who was chairman of the Science Committee in the Senate; myself and Jeff Bingaman, we all asked the National Academies to do a report on the competitiveness of America in the 21st Century. It was a sobering report. 
   Norm Augustine, the former chairman of Lockheed, Craig Barrett, the chairman of Intel, and several noted scholars and other business individuals came together and said America was on a losing track, which meant that my 6-year-old daughter, many of your children and grandchildren, these two children right here, could be the first generation of Americans to inherit a national standard of living less than their parents, a complete reversal of the American dream. That is why so many of us came together to try to do something. 
   This is not a Democratic bill. It is not a Republican bill. This simply is a compilation of the recommendations of the report ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' 
   Let me tell you a little bit about this bill. It really composes three general areas. 
   The first is they said we have got to lead the world in terms of our science and our research, our innovation. So this bill is an authorization that is going to double over the next 7 years the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and the Department of Energy, as well as the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
   Let me remind you, because I know there are some folks who are going to say this is going to be too much money. This is an authorization. My friend from Tennessee and the other appropriators will determine whether it is going to be too much. We will work together to make that determination. This is a responsible, I think, 7-year increase. 
   Then they came back to us and they said that American manufacturers and American workers have to work at a higher skill level. There are 7 billion people in the world right now, and half of them make less than $2 a day. We don't want to compete like that. We can't compete like that. So that means if they are making one widget in India or China, we have got to make 50 widgets here in America. And we need to be not only making the widgets, we need to be inventing the widget maker and manufacturing that widget maker here in this country. 
   If we are going to do that, then whether you are a high school graduate, a junior college graduate, a college graduate, you have got to work at a higher level, which means you are going to have to have science and math skills. 
   But the report tells us we are not doing very well in that area. As a matter of fact, right now, only Cyprus and  South Africa have lower scores than we do in the science and math areas.     
   So what do we do about this? Well, they looked around and tried to figure out what the problem is. Are Americans just not as smart? No, that is not the problem. Do we need maybe smaller classrooms or more equipment? Those things would help. But the real problem is this, and listen to this: The fact is 67 percent of the teachers that teach in middle school in this country have neither a major nor a certification to teach math. And 87 percent of the physical science teachers in this country have neither a certification nor a major to teach those subjects. So it is very difficult to teach or inspire if you haven't had an opportunity to really understand those courses. This is not a slur to those good teachers. I want to give you a personal story. 
   My father was a farmer. World War II comes along. He enlists, comes back, and he wants to be even a better farmer. So he takes advantage of the GI bill and goes to college at Middle Tennessee State University. He gets a degree in agriculture. Well, a few years later I come along and my mother had to give up her job. She was working at a high school cafeteria. So my father applied to be a teacher in addition to being a farmer. He was the last person hired to teach at Smyrna High School in my home county. So since he was the last person hired, you might imagine, he was assigned to teach high school science and to coach girls basketball. I am not sure which he knew the least about, which really wasn't fair to him or his students. 
   And so we want to take care of those good smart people, those good smart teachers, and help them do a better job. So we are going to bring those kinds of teachers during the summer and, with stipends, allow them to get their certifications, hopefully AP, IB. Hopefully they will get a master's. 
   We are also going to have a whole new corps of teachers. We want to provide competitive scholarships for 10,000 students a year that will go into math, science and education and agree to teach for 5 years. And 5 years is important, because we find that half the teachers quit teaching in the first 5 years. We have to get them over that hump. 
   Next they said, and this may sound familiar, they said that America needs to be energy independent. This was before we started talking about the price of oil going up. This was before that. They gave us a way to do that. They suggested we look at the Department of Defense, DARPA, for a model. There is something in the Department of Defense called DARPA. It is an advanced research operation that takes high risk, high rewards. It is where the Internet was discovered and developed, and it is where stealth technology was developed. 
   They said this is a proven model. Take it over to the Department of Energy and set up a high-risk, high-reward agency there, but have very narrow management. Have a few employees and let them manage programs. Take the seven or eight most cutting-edge types of technologies, those that can really jump us ahead, and let's crash on them. Let's bring in the national labs, the private sector, the public sector and our universities, and let's make some real breakthroughs. Now, if one doesn't work, fine; pull the plug. But let's not be afraid to fail because we have to make these types of jumps in technology so we can have not only energy independence, but we will also have new jobs and new exports for America. 
   That is what we did. We brought all of these things together, and that is why we have a bipartisan, bicameral bill. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I certainly understand my friend from Wisconsin's concerns. In the House, we did pass a 10-year doubling of the National Science Foundation. In the Senate, they passed an authorization for 5 years. Seven was a compromise, I think a reasonable compromise, and I remind everyone that we're in a pay-as-you-go budget, and the appropriators know they have to pay for what they appropriate.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Thank you, Lady Sutton. I will grace you by not taking that full 20 minutes. 
   I want to thank Mr. Welch for his kind words. I want to thank Mr. Hastings for not being too ugly about this bill, and I want to make my friend on the Science Committee, Mr. Gingrey, feel better about this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the last few hours of every session, it doesn't matter who is in the majority or who is in the minority, things get a little bit tense. Folks want to get going for their district work period, and so this is an opportunity for us all to come together. 
   This is a bill that was based on a suspension that passed out of this House unanimously, based on a bill out of the Senate that passed 88-8. This is a bipartisan, bicameral bill. 
   The National Chamber of Commerce supports this bill. The National Association of Manufacturers supports this bill. The Business Roundtable supports this bill. Every university that is represented in this body supports this bill  because it is a good bill. It's going to help American workers, businesses. It's going to help students and teachers be able to compete in the world. It's going to help us regain and maintain a leadership in research, innovation and technology. 
   Let me just take a moment and tell you a little bit about the bill. 
   Well, it's also based on, of course, Sherry Boehlert, the former, very good Republican chairman of our Science Committee, myself when I was ranking member, Lamar Alexander, who has done Herculean work in the Senate, as well as Jeff Bingaman asked the National Academy of Science to do a report on the competitiveness of America in the 21st century. Norm Augustine, the former head of Lockheed Martin, Craig Barrett at Intel, many other scholars, as well as academic and business individuals, came together and they told us in a very sobering way that America was heading in the wrong direction in terms of competitiveness in the 21st century. 
   Now, this is not just an idle thought for the ones of us that have kids and grandkids, because I am very concerned that the next generation of Americans could be the first generation of Americans that inherit a national standard of living less than our parents if we don't do something. This bill will help change the corner, turn that corner. 
   Let me tell you about it; it deals really with three main areas. First of all, following the recommendations of the rising above the gathering storm, we are going to increase our expenditures and research in this country, in the National Science Foundation that does such a good job, the National Institute of Standards and Technology. And, again, for my friend from Georgia, these are just authorizations. 
   If they can't justify what they are doing, then the appropriations will not appropriate those funds. This is just authorization. It doesn't spend any money, but it does give us a great blueprint. 
   The next thing we are going to do, we have to recognize that there are about 7 billion people in the world, half of which make less than $2 a day. We can't compete with that. We don't want to compete with that. We don't want our kids and grandkids to have to be in that situation. 
   What do we do? We have to compete at a higher level. If they are going to make one widget in China or India or elsewhere, we have got to make 50 in this country at the same time. We need to be inventing the widget maker and we need to be manufacturing the widget maker. That's what this bill is going to help us do. But to do that, our workers have to perform at a higher skill level. We have to help them do that. 
   When you look, and it's a sad situation right now, but only Cyprus and South Africa have lower overall math and science scores than we have in this country right now. What is the reason for that? Is it that we are not as smart as other countries? No, that's not the case. 
   The problem is we have very good and talented teachers in this country, but unfortunately, when it comes to math and science, about 63 percent of the math teachers at the middle school have neither a major or a certification to teach math. 
   The science teachers in this country are trying to do a good job, but 87 percent of them have neither a major or certification to teach the physical sciences. It's hard to inspire. It's hard to really convey information when you don't have a good background. I want to give you an example of that. 
   My father was a farmer. He went to World War II, and he came back, and because of the GI Bill, he was able to go to college. He got a degree in agriculture. I come along, and my mother had to give up her job at the cafeteria, so my father needed a second job. 
   So he applied to teach, and he got the last teaching job at Smyrna High School in my home county. So since he was the last person to get a job, they assigned him to teach high school science and to coach girls basketball. 
   I am not sure which one my father knew the least about. He was a bright, able fellow, but they put him in a difficult situation. And it was tough for his students, I am sure.     
   Well, we have got to do better than that. And so what this bill is going to do is really two things in that area. We are going to take those good teachers like my father, bring them back into school. We will do it in the summer, so they can get their certification, hopefully go ahead and get a master's, get an AP certification so they can do a better job. 
   We are also going to provide scholarships for approximately 10,000 students each year on a competitive basis that want to go into math, science, and education and agree to teach for 5 years in high-need areas. This is going to go a long way to helping our skills. 
   And so, finally, we are going to look at one other area, one other area that Rising Above the Gathering Storm mentioned, was we have to become energy independent in this country. We have been talking about a lot of energy bills and are going to hopefully pass an energy bill at least in the House. The Senate has done. It is a long way to getting something completed. 
   But, today, this is a conference report. This is not just a bill that then goes to the other body and goes to conference. This is a conference report that was passed out of that conference on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, and it does something about energy independence today. And let me tell you about that, and this is a recommendation that came from the National Academies of Science. 
   We are going to set up an agency within the Department of Energy modeled after DARPA, which is in the Defense Department, a high-risk, high-reward group. It is going to look at the the seven or eight most cutting-edge types of new technologies. And we are going to bring our private sector, the public sector, the national labs, the universities all together with a very narrow bit of management that is only going to be like project directors to bring all these folks together. And, just like in the Department of Defense, the Internet was developed, stealth and technology was developed, but there were a lot of things that didn't work out, because they weren't afraid to try. High risk, high reward. That is what we are going to do. 
   We are going to get in there, and we are going to find those areas that are new technologies that are going to bump our ability to create renewable energy in this country, which is going to help us become energy independent, it is going to create jobs, and it is going to create exports. 
   This is a very good bipartisan, bicameral bill that is endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, by the National Association of Manufacturers, by the Business Roundtable, universities. And this afternoon we will talk about this some more. I am going to bring you a list of businesses and organizations that support this that is going to go on and on and on. 
   So, my friends, let's put aside I guess just the natural bit of tenseness that goes with ending a session. Let's work together and get something good today and pass this bipartisan, bicameral bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CHEMISTRY WEEK -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support, Madam Speaker, of H. Res. 751, a resolution recognizing the importance of chemistry and honoring National Chemistry Week. I want to congratulate the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes) for introducing this important resolution. 
   The importance of chemistry and chemical engineering in our lives cannot be overstated. These disciplines contribute to public health by helping to keep our water clean and our food pure. They contribute to advances in medicine through new biomaterials, drug design and drug delivery techniques. They help make cleaner and more efficient energy technologies possible, and they help keep toxins out of our home and our natural environment through the development of green chemicals and materials. 
   In short, chemistry and chemical engineering contribute in immeasurable ways to the economic strength, security and well-being of our Nation and all of its citizens. 
   This year marks the 20th anniversary of National Chemistry Week. National Chemistry Week was started as an annual event by the American Chemical Society in 1987 to make elementary and secondary school children and the general public more aware of what chemistry is and its importance to our everyday lives. 
   National Chemistry Week activities are carried out by local sections of the American Chemical Society located in all parts of our Nation. They work with local industry, schools and museums to develop hands-on activities, provide demonstrations and develop exhibits. Through these activities, they help stimulate the interest of young people in science and in pursuing careers in science and technology. 
   This Congress recently passed into law the America COMPETES Act. That bill was an important bipartisan effort to keep America competitive in the 21st century by supporting innovative research at universities and in industry, and by ensuring that there is a sufficient pipeline of students pursuing studies and careers in science and technology fields well into the future. 
   The goals of the National Chemistry Week fit well with the goals outlined in the COMPETES Act. 
   The theme of this year's National Chemistry Week is, ``The Many Faces of Chemistry.'' This theme emphasizes the diversity of chemistry careers, from science teacher to laboratory researcher, as well as the diversity of people in chemistry professions. 
   While women and minorities continue to be underrepresented in chemical science fields, they have made important contributions to chemistry. 
   Women received about one-third of all chemistry Ph.D.s in 2003. Hispanics and African Americans combined represent only 7 percent of all chemistry Ph.D.s awarded in 2003, even though they make up more than 25 percent of the entire U.S. population. 
   We will need to make use of all the talent we have to stay competitive in the 21st century, but it isn't just a numbers game. The interaction and collaboration of diverse individuals with differing perspectives enriches the process of discovery and innovation and helps give the U.S. an edge over countries that easily beat us on numbers. 
   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the American Chemical Society for its efforts to establish and sustain National Chemistry Week, and once again, I commend Mr. Reyes and his cosponsors for introducing this resolution and urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the importance of chemistry in our daily lives and the positive impact of National Chemistry Week by voting in favor of H. Res. 751. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the House will consider today H.R. 3776, the Energy Storage Technology Advancement Act. I would like to thank my colleagues on the Science and Technology Committee for their unanimous support in making this a good, bipartisan piece of legislation. 
   In particular, I would like to thank my good friend and ranking member, Mr. Hall, for his interest in this field of research. In crafting H.R. 3776, I adopted several provisions from a bill Mr. Hall introduced earlier this year, and he and his staff have worked hard to make this a good bill. 
   H.R. 3776 authorizes research, development and demonstration activities for energy storage technologies that offer a wide range of economic, environmental and security benefits. 
   Stationary energy storage systems will bring efficiencies to the electric delivery system, will improve grid reliability and security, and can even help to postpone the need for additional, costly electric generation facilities. 
   Energy storage technologies can also help to integrate renewable energy sources into the grid by making electricity from these intermittent resources more stable and reliable. 
   Furthermore, advanced battery systems can revolutionize our transportation sector by allowing for more electric-drive vehicles, thus reducing our reliance on conventional transportation fuels. 
   But unfortunately, we may be fast losing our ability to develop and manufacture these technologies at home. Through the collaborative public-private research, development and demonstration programs authorized in H.R. 3776, we can ensure that the United States establishes a robust domestic manufacturing base for these technologies. 
   To truly transform the way we manage our energy use, we must do more than make incremental improvements to current technologies. Our economic and environmental security lies in our ability to deploy the next generation energy technologies. Advances in energy storage are vital to diversifying our energy supplies and transforming our transportation sector. 
   Once again, I thank my colleagues on the Science and Technology Committee for working with me on this legislation, and I urge all Members to support the bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

It charts a course for continuing American prosperity in the decades to  come. I recommend that my colleagues heed the warning of this report and pursue policies to implement its four major policy recommendations. 
   One of those recommendations is to ``sustain and strengthen the Nation's traditional commitment to long-term basic research that has the potential to be transformational, to maintain the flow of new ideas that fuel the economy and provide security and enhance the quality of life.'' The Gathering Storm report goes on to propose specific high-priority action items to realize this recommendation. 
   In this bill, H.R. 363, we have identified several of these action items that have broad bipartisan support. We call the bill the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Hall from Texas, ranking minority member of the Committee on Science and Technology, who helped craft the current version of this bill. 
   Six weeks ago, the committee voted unanimously to favorably report this bill. We have heard from such groups as The Business Roundtable and the Council of Competitiveness expressing their support for the bill. These organizations represent a broad spectrum of business interests, understand that new technology ideas are necessary for the U.S. prosperity in a global 21st century economy. In fact, some economists have estimated that half of the economic growth in the United States since World War II can be attributed to technological innovation. H.R. 363 is needed to prevent the United States from falling behind other nations whose national commitments to research are increasing, just as ours have been decreasing. The fear is not just about falling behind scientifically, it's about falling behind economically. 
   The first two provisions of H.R. 363 focus on support for early-career scientists and engineers through grant programs at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. These grants will identify and support our best and brightest young researchers who are engaged in high-risk, high-reward research that is transformational or highly innovative. By focusing on young researchers, we promote new ideas and research on the frontiers of knowledge. 
   The bill also supports graduate student training grants for individuals interested in research areas relative to industry's technological needs, establishes a Presidential Award for Innovation, creates a planning mechanism for maintaining the Nation's major research facilities, authorizes the National Science Foundation to support research on innovation, directs reports on Federal efforts to recruit new scientists and engineers, identifies NASA as a key player in the national competitiveness policy. 
   This bill doesn't merely seek to fund all of science, it focuses on fostering the most innovative elements of a scientific enterprise. It is through research such as these that we lay a foundation for future of global economic competitiveness. In the future, a healthy scientific and technological enterprise spawns innovation, creating jobs that pay good wages and produces products that make our lives better.     
   We must pave the way to that future, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 362, and yield myself such time as I may consume for an opening statement. 
   In 2005, the National Academies assembled a blue-ribbon committee of national leaders in academia, business and government to address concerns about the national prosperity and the global economy in the 21st century. The Academies' report was entitled, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future.'' That report catalogs a number of worrisome indicators and presents recommendations that the Nation must follow to maintain its competitiveness. 
   What did this distinguished committee tell us is most important to the future of the economic health of our Nation? Here is the first recommendation from the report: Increase America's talent pool by vastly improving K-12 science and mathematics education. 
   The Gathering Storm report goes on to tell us where the focus should be in efforts to improve K-12 science and mathematics education. In brief, it says, ``Focus on the teachers.'' H.R. 362 follows that blueprint. 
   In January, I partnered with Mr. Hall, ranking minority member on the Committee on Science and Technology, to introduce H.R. 362, whose purpose is to implement all of the action items from the Gathering Storm report and address the report's first recommendation. 
   I want to thank Mr. Hall for his assistance in developing this bill. With his support, it was favorably reported by the Science and Technology Committee by a unanimous vote.     
   This bill is endorsed by a wide variety of educational organizations and business coalitions, including the Association of American Universities, the Business Roundtable, the Council of Competitiveness, the National Education Association, the National  Science Teachers Association, and the STEM Education Coalition. These organizations are enthusiastic about H.R. 362 because it will dramatically improve the national corps of math and science teachers. 
   We call the first title of the bill ``10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act.'' The bill will create thousands of new teachers with content and teaching skill expertise in their area of teaching. 
   The vehicle for accomplishing this goal is the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation. Noyce awards go to universities that build model programs for recruiting math and science students into teaching. These programs provide mentoring, early field experiences, and a streamlined path toward teaching certification. Students who enroll in this program will receive $10,000-per-year scholarships. In return, they will make commitments of several years to the teaching profession. 
   H.R. 362 will also create summer institutes and graduate programs that provide sustained, content-oriented professional development to in-service teachers through the Math and Science Partnership Program at the National Science Foundation. We have a critical shortage of math and science teachers in the U.S., and many of our math and science teachers have no degree or certification in the field they teach. In fact, 87 percent of middle school and 58 percent of high school physical science teachers lack these qualifications. 
   This bill tackles this problem from both ends. On the one end, we bring in a new cadre of math and science teachers who are well-educated and well-prepared. That is what the Noyce program does. On the other end, we improve the teachers that we have through innovative, effective programs led by disciplinary faculty from higher education. That is what the Math and Science Partnerships program does. 
   Other provisions of H.R. 362 include an expansion of the STEM Talent Expansion Program at the National Science Foundation, a program to enhance the undergraduate education of the future science and engineering workforce, and a pilot program at the NSF to improve laboratory science in high-need secondary schools. 
   To maintain our high national standard of living, we need a workforce that is prepared in a world-class math and science education system. But there is a dark cloud looming. American students have performed poorly in recent years on an assortment of international tests of math and science achievement. That does not bode well for the future. Our next generation of innovators, where will they come from? That is what the gathering storm on the horizon is all about. To rise above it, we need to reform the math and science teaching profession. That is what this legislation now before us will do. 
   The stakes are high and the concern is urgent. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 362. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

The NSF Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, as amended by H.R. 362, is specifically designed to help place highly qualified STEM teachers in every classroom across the Nation. I further agree with the gentleman that it is particularly important to reduce the number of out-of-field teachers in the schools that have a high proportion of minority students, who are currently underrepresented in science and technology.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, let me take just a moment to thank the staff, Jim Wilson, and our minority staff for the time they have put in on this bill. Two years ago, LAMAR ALEXANDER, and our former chairman, Sherry Boehlert, asked the National Academies to do a recommendation on the competitiveness of America in the 21st century. The recommendation was good news and bad news. The bad news was that we are in a very competitive environment and that we are on a losing track. 
   The good news was we had some recommendations. That is what we tried to do. We didn't try to make a Democratic or Republican bill; we took their recommendations and made a bipartisan bill. I think that today the bipartisan bill is the result of that. I again thank all the Members for their constructive efforts in doing this. 
   I understand that the Speaker is so committed to this bill that she is on her way to the floor, and she is not only on her way, but she has arrived, and I yield her the balance of my time.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation aims to increase the number of first-rate math and science teachers in the U.S. 
   The program targets two resources from which to recruit these teachers: one, undergraduates who are majoring in the math and science field; and, two,  science and math engineering professionals who want to switch to a teaching degree. 
   The reported version of H.R. 362 considerably expands the Noyce program. It also amends a part of the program that targets undergraduates. But the part of the program that targets professionals was left for the most part unchanged. This amendment establishes within the Noyce program a new model for recruiting professionals to a teaching career. 
   This new model is based on a program called Math for America, which has shown astonishing success in making first-rate teachers out of former scientists and engineers. Math for America was launched in 2004 by James Simons, a mathematician who founded an enormously successful private investment firm in New York City. 
   Mr. Simon's philanthropic foundation has provided much of the funding for Math for America. This is just the third year of Math for America, but already they have recruited 90 teachers for New York City public schools. The math for America model has so much in common with the Noyce program at the National Science Foundation. 
   Consistent with the Math for America model, my amendment has the following features: An institution of higher education wishing to establish this new program must create a partnership with at least one non-Federal entity to be eligible for the NSF support; a scientist or engineer participating in the program must demonstrate advance content knowledge through a nationally recognized standardized test; participants take specialized education courses in a 16-month teacher certification program during which they receive a stipend; graduates from the program must teach in a secondary school for a period of 4 years, during which they receive a teaching supplement to their ordinary salary. 
   The teaching supplements are provided by the partnerships from non-Federal sources. This amendment, therefore, adds a component to the Noyce program to develop the kind of public/private partnership that we see working so well in Math for America. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Noyce program at the National Science Foundation has up to now required scholarship recipients to teach in high-need schools. H.R. 362 substantially expands the program, scaling it up from fewer than 1,000 pre-service STEM teachers per year to 10,000 per year. 
   The Noyce program is being scaled up by H.R. 362 to address the needs of schools in all parts of the Nation which have large numbers of out-of-field STEM teachers. For example, the percentage of physical science teachers in  middle schools with neither a major in the field nor certification is nearly 90 percent. 
   As part of enlarging the program's scale, the bill also removes the requirement that all graduates teach in a high-need school. But the bill also adds in its place an incentive for teachers to serve in high-need schools. The amendment I am proposing makes clear that we are not backing away from our firm commitment to address the requirements of high-need schools. 
   The amendment has two provisions. The first provision requires the NSF to broadly disseminate information about the program, including to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. This is to ensure that students in minority schools have improved chances of seeing a minority teacher prepared through a Noyce program. 
   The second provision requires the foundation to maintain a clearinghouse on teaching opportunities in high-need schools. This will assist Noyce scholars in finding their ideal placement. 
   Without this amendment, Noyce scholars seeking placement might not know which schools meet the definition of high-need in any given year or which such schools have openings. 
   This amendment will both help increase the number of individuals from minority-serving institutions who participate in the Noyce program and will help recruit Noyce scholars to teaching positions in high-need schools. I recommend adoption of this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 487, which recognizes the contribution of modeling and simulation technology to the security and prosperity of the United States, and recognizing modeling and simulation as a national critical technology. 
   Modeling and simulation is an important technology. It allows scientists to understand the functioning of complex systems that would otherwise be impossible to comprehend. It allows developers to understand their products better. It allows industry to save money that would otherwise be spent on experimentation and to allocate those funds to other activities, and allows our military to understand the impacts of their weapons. 
   In short, modeling and simulation is a very powerful tool that has improved our lives in many ways. Americans lead the world in this technology, and we should acknowledge that. It's important that we nurture this industry and stimulate its further growth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I would submit the following editorial from the Los Angeles Times for the Record.   
   When the CIA Comes Calling  
   When I was director of Central Intelligence during President Clinton's first term, I had occasion to go hat in hand to the private sector several times. In one case, it was a detail that, if made public, could have caused a valuable source to be captured or killed; in another, there was a technical feature of a system in production that, slightly modified, was of great help to the nation. In these several cases, executives of American companies heard me out and willingly met my requests, to the substantial benefit of our national security. 
   They had no legal requirement to do so, and they knew it. They were helping solely out of a sense of patriotism and an understanding that some steps that the nation needs to take in a dangerous world cannot be taken in public, simply because informing the public informs an opponent or an enemy. 
   Shortly after 9/11, something similar happened. Senior U.S. officials asked telecommunications companies to assist the government in intercepts involving terrorist groups such as those that had just attacked us and killed thousands of people. In these cases, President Bush authorized the intercepts and the senior officials gave written assurances to the companies that their cooperation was legal. 
   In my judgment, the president acted properly; he had the authority under the Constitution to ask for such intercepts. In addition, his request was reasonable because surveillance of enemy-to-American communications is a time-honored means of intelligence gathering in the U.S. George Washington did it; those under his command intercepted and read correspondence between Benedict Arnold and his spy handler, foiling the plot to turn the fort at West Point over to the British. 
   But even if one believes the request was illegal and unreasonable--and there are distinguished constitutional lawyers and patriotic citizens on both sides of this debate--the issue currently before the Senate Judiciary Committee is much narrower. It is whether the telecommunications companies that complied with the president's request and trusted the government's assurances of legality should be granted immunity from about 40 lawsuits demanding billions of dollars. 
   Sen. John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has stated that companies ``should not be dragged through the courts for their help with national security.'' And now Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, has endorsed his statement, saying that the companies should not be ``held hostage to costly litigation in what is essentially a complaint about [Bush] administration activities.'' 
   Feinstein is a member of the one-vote Democratic majority on the Judiciary Committee, and it is possible that her position will determine the outcome. I hope it does. Her stance is farsighted. Having once, when I was practicing law, taken depositions for months about a single one-hour meeting, I know something about how burdensome litigation can be. If, in the end, the surveillance request made by the government is deemed improper, the government should be held accountable, not those who complied with its request. 
   We live in a world of terrorism, the possible proliferation of nuclear weapons and a host of other risks to our security. Intelligence, and the cooperation of the private sector in obtaining and protecting it, will be among our most important tools to avoid catastrophes such as 9/11 or worse. 
   If some future senior government official needs to make a call on a CEO of the sort I did, and that others did after 9/11, we and our children will be better off if the official can answer the question ``Can you guarantee that my company won't be sued if we help the country?'' with ``If it happens, we'll get protective legislation approved as in 2007.'' We would be in much more danger if, because companies that helped after 9/11 became ensnared in years of litigation and financial losses, that official has to answer the question with a shrug.

<DOCNO>Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support of H.R. 6063, the NASA Authorization Act of 2008, as amended by the Senate. As you know, the House first passed H.R. 6063 on June 18 by an overwhelming vote of 409-15. After receiving this strong bipartisan mandate, we worked with our counterparts in the Senate over the summer to ensure that the legislation before us today would continue to reflect the priorities and policies endorsed by this body. 
   I believe that we succeeded in that effort, and I want to express my appreciation to the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee Chair, Mr. Mark Udall, for his leadership in introducing this  bill and successfully shepherding it through the legislative process. 
   I also want to thank my friends on the minority, Ranking Member Ralph Hall and subcommittee Ranking Member Tom Feeney for their constructive participation in the development of this legislation. Of course, I want to express my appreciation to Senators Bill Nelson and David Vitter for their efforts in helping to forge the bipartisan compromise that we will be voting on today. 
   Finally, I want to thank the House and Senate staff on both sides of the aisle who tirelessly supported our efforts to get this legislation developed and enacted. In that regard I want to specifically recognize Dick Obermann, the staff director of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee; Pam Whitney, Allen Li, Devin Bryant, John Piazza and Wendy Adams of the committee's majority staff; as well as Ed Feddeman, Ken Monroe, Lee Arnold and Katy Crooks of the committee's minority staff. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that the characterization of H.R. 6063 that I gave back in June is still very valid. The legislation before us today retains the key provisions and principles of that earlier version of the bill. As a result, I will not spend our limited time today describing the provisions of H.R. 6063 in detail. Instead, I would simply like to make the following points. 
   H.R. 6063 is a fiscally responsible measure that sends a strong message to the next administration that Congress believes that investing in a balanced NASA program of science, aeronautics and human space flight and exploration is important and worthy of our Nation's support. I think that it is a valuable message for this Congress to send, especially as we witness the emergence of other spacefaring nations in the world who clearly recognize the value of such investments. 
   This bill contains a number of provisions to ensure that NASA has properly structured human space flight, science and exploration programs that can deliver significant technological, scientific and geopolitical benefits to this Nation. 
   H.R. 6063 also demonstrates that NASA's capabilities and programs are relevant to meeting our needs back here on Earth and that properly utilized, those capabilities and programs can deliver a significant societal economic return to our investment in NASA. 
   This legislation includes provisions to ensure the future health of the Nation's aviation system and to develop the tools needed to better understand and respond to the challenges of climate change and the contribution to achievement of our Nation's innovative agenda 
   The bill before us today is not identical to the one we passed in June, although it certainly retains the key provisions of the earlier version of this legislation. For example, it did not prove possible to retain the OSTP study of the impact of current export policies on commercial and civil space activities. I think it is very important that such a review occur, and I am disappointed that the provisions had to be dropped. But I am encouraged that there is likely to be movement on this issue once the next administration takes office. 
   In terms of additions to the earlier versions of H.R. 6063, this bill contains a prohibition against NASA taking any steps prior to April 30th of next year that would preclude the President from being able to continue to fly the Space Shuttle past 2010. That provision should not be construed as a congressional endorsement of extending the life of the shuttle program beyond the additional flight added by this bill to deliver the AMS to the International Space Station. Rather, it reflects our common belief that the decision of whether or not to extend the shuttle past its planned 2010 retirement date should be left to the next President and Congress, especially since both of the Presidential candidates have asked for that flexibility to make that decision. 
   In addition, NASA has indicated that delaying the shuttle shutdown activities until at least April 30 of next year will not impose additional costs on the agency. So, on balance, I believe this is a reasonable provision to include in this amended version of H.R. 6063. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House-passed version of H.R. 6063 was endorsed by a host of organizations, ranging from the Association of American Universities to the National Association of Manufacturers. I believe that they would agree that H.R. 6063, as amended by the Senate, is equally worthy of that support. 
   As I mentioned earlier, we have worked hard to retain the key features of the House-passed bill, and I believe we are were successful in that effort. 
   Mr. Speaker, next Wednesday marks the 50th anniversary of the day that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration officially opened for business. I can think of no more fitting birthday present that Congress could bestow than this legislation, the NASA Authorization Act of 2008, because it provides direction and support for the agency that will enable NASA during the next 50 years to be as productive and exciting as it was in the last 50 years. 
   With that, I urge my colleagues to vote to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 6063 by an overwhelming margin so that we can send it on to the President for his signature. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I will quickly conclude by saying that just because we have all talked nice here today and been civil and we have a bipartisan bill, doesn't mean that this was not a difficult bill to put together. A lot of work went into this, a lot of respectful collaboration on a bipartisan way. We have a good bill. I thank my friends for helping.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, for Members who weren't here last Thursday, let me just remind you and recap some of the testimony on this authorization. 
   This is a bipartisan bill that passed unanimously out of the Science and Technology Committee. It is fiscally responsible. It is a balance between aviation, science research and human exploration; and, quite frankly, it is too important to our Nation, both to our prestige as well as to our future, to jeopardize it trying to score political points. 
   This amendment was not offered in the subcommittee markup, although there was an enormous amount of collaboration. And it was not even presented to the full committee until less than 24 hours before we voted on it. If this was so important to the Nation, you would think that my friend during the previous 6 years when there was a Republican House, a Republican Senate and a Republican President could have easily passed this. This bill is too important to try to score political points. We need to get something done for the Nation. 
   Let me just remind you of some of the endorsers of this good bill, and this is a very small listing of so many: Association of American Universities, Aerospace Industry Association, National Association of Manufacturers, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Universities Space Research Association, Information Technology Association of America, National Business Aviation Association, and General Aviation Manufacturers Association. I can go on and on and on. This is too good a bill to be killed on this floor today for partisan reason. 
   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman).

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   The gentleman from Georgia has been talking about examples. Well, let me give you an example, we just heard about whining, whining about chocolate and whining about tobacco. Here we are trying to give you an example about leading, about doing something about this country's very, very, very major problem with global warming and with alternative energy and energy dependency. 
   Let me tell you what, I have just been through 3 hours of a hearing, 3 hours, where representatives of the IPCC, which represents 113 nations including the United States, came before us and said after 5 years of study, 30,000 comments, 600 scientists; they made a recommendation, and that recommendation was that with 100 percent certainty, there is global warming, and with 90 percent certainty, human action is making it worse. 
   Today, our example is trying to do something about that. Today, we have the first bill on this floor to deal with alternative energy, to deal with making our Nation energy independent. So this is an example of us trying to move forward. 
   It is a bipartisan bill, and I might remind the gentleman that when, after 9/11, when Speaker HASTERT was the first to be given transportation for security reasons, I don't think anybody over there complained. I don't think anybody over here complained. 
   When the President of the United States, George Bush, said that it is a matter of security, we didn't hear anybody complain; when the Department of Defense has also given a ruling on this, that again what is available will be available for the person who is the second-ranking person to be President of the United States. 
   Now, if Speaker Pelosi is going to be attacked here on this floor for eating chocolate or anything else, you can imagine what more serious people might be doing. So, yes, this is an example today. We have an example of, if we want to, on a bipartisan basis do something about global warming. 
   Let me tell you, we talk about 10 years from now, maybe. Or is it 20 years? Sometimes you can say, well, to have a serious problem with global warming, it might be 30 years or 50 years. Well, that is not hypothetical. I have a 5-year-old daughter. Some of you probably have young children or young grandchildren. If any of them were born in this century, in all likelihood, they are going to live till the end of this century. They are going to inherit a much different world. 
   So this is real. So I think now the time is to lead by example. Let us do something about this. We have a good bill on the floor. This is our example. You can have whatever example you want.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Interesting, Mr. Chairman, the report of this amendment has reached the White House. I would like to report to you the official statement from the White House just given by Tony Snow. 
   Quoting Mr. Snow, ``This is a silly story. I think it's been unfair to the Speaker. What happened in the wake of September 11 is the Department of Defense in order to protect the Speaker began offering aircraft to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, did it with Representative Hastert, doing so with Speaker Pelosi. 
   ``We think it's important that the Speaker of the House enjoy the same kind of security that we arranged for Speaker Hastert in the wake of September 11. And like I said, I think that there's been a lot of overhyped reporting on this.'' 
   I certainly concur with Mr. Snow. This is a silly story. We have a chance to get on to serious business. To put this to rest, as the author of this bill, and as the chairman of the Science Committee from which it came, we want to accept this amendment and allow this country then to get on to the serious business of trying to do something about alternative fuels.

As I heard BARNEY FRANK say here one time, I can read it to you, but I can't understand it for you. But I would be happy to read it to you again: 
   ``This is a silly story, and I think it's been unfair to the Speaker. What happened in the wake of September 11 is that the Department of Defense, in order to protect the Speaker, began offering aircraft to the Speaker of the House of Representatives; did it with Representative Hastert, doing so with Speaker Pelosi.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding. 
   Once again from the White House: ``This is a silly story. I think it's been unfair to the Speaker.'' 
   And let me tell you what else is silly. It is silly for the party that inherited the biggest surplus in our Nation's or world's history and then turned it into a deficit, the biggest deficit in history, to come in here and try to be fiscally conservative. 
   And let me tell you what is even more silly about that. What is even more silly about that is they have a silly amendment that has been accepted; yet they want to continue to talk about the silly amendment, pretending to be fiscally conservative, although it is costing the American taxpayer to keep this Record going even though this amendment, silly amendment, has been accepted. And that is what is silly about this.

   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I want to concur with my friend from Texas in terms of his concern about coal being a part of the overall package of dealing with energy independence. He is absolutely right, and I think everyone in this body recognizes that clean coal will be a part of our energy independence. 
   Unfortunately, though, this amendment does not really deal with clean coal. This amendment is a continuing effort to try to undermine this good bill today dealing with alternative energy. This is a very narrow bill. 
   This is a bill that was cosponsored by myself as chairman of the Science Committee, the ranking member of the Science Committee, and many others, and passed out of the committee unanimously because we are trying to deal with the problem today. We want to deal today with the infrastructure problems that stop our alternative fuels from being able to be used in existing infrastructure. 
   Clean coal will be a part of a solution later, but clean coal is not available right now. And so why are we stopping dealing with something we can do today for something that there is no solution for today? 
   Clean coal will be a part of what we do over in the Science and Technology Committee. We have been in discussions about this. I think everybody should know that. So that is off the table. 
   The question today on this motion to recommit is, do you want to move forward and do something today about alternative energy? If you do, vote down this amendment. If you do not want to do anything about this today, if you want to talk and talk and talk and come back another day, then vote ``aye.''

<DOCNO>Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. (NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 5940 is a bipartisan bill which myself and Ranking Member Hall jointly introduced, along with 23 additional Democratic and Republican members of the Science and Technology Committee. The committee believes this legislation will strengthen our Nation's competitiveness in the rapidly advancing field of nanotechnology. 
   I want to particularly thank my colleague, the gentleman from Texas, for working with me to craft this legislation. I also want to thank Dr. BAIRD, the Chair, and Dr. EHLERS, the ranking member, respectively, of the Research and Science Education Subcommittee, who were both instrumental in development of this bill. 
   Finally, I want to thank all the members of the Science and Technology Committee on both sides of the aisle for their contributions to this bill and for helping to move it expeditiously and unanimously through the committee. Certainly, I want to thank Jim Wilson, working with the minority and majority staff, in putting together this excellent piece of legislation. 
   The term ``revolutionary technology'' has become a cliche, but nanotechnology truly is revolutionary. We stand at the threshold of an age in which materials and devices can be fashioned atom by atom to satisfy specific design requirements. Nanotechnology-based applications are arising that were not even imagined a decade ago. 
   The range of potential applications of nanotechnology is broad and will have enormous consequences for electronics, energy transformation, storage materials, and medicine and health, to name just a few. Indeed, the scope of this technology is so broad as to leave virtually no product untouched.  
   The Science and Technology Committee recognized the promise of nanotechnology early on, holding our first hearing a decade ago to review Federal activities in the field. The committee was substantially instrumental in development and enactment in 2003 of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, which authorized the multi-agency National Nanotechnology Initiative, or the NNI, as it's called. 
   The 2003 statute put in place formal interagency planning, budgeting, and coordinating mechanisms for the NNI. It now receives funding from 13 agencies and has a budget of $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2008. The NNI statute also provides for formal reviews of the content and management of programs by the National Academy of Sciences and by a designated advisory committee of nongovernmental experts. Their assessment of the NNI has been generally positive. 
   The NNI supports productive cooperative research efforts across a spectrum of disciplines and is establishing a network of national facilities for further support of nanotechnology research and development. H.R. 5940 is based on findings and recommendations from several hearings during the current Congress that examined various aspects of the NNI. It also reflects recommendations from the formal reviews of the NNI by the National Academy of Sciences and the NNI advisory panel. Finally, it incorporates many suggestions from various communities of interest that reviewed early versions of the bill. 
   H.R. 5940 does not substantially alter the NNI, but makes adjustments to some of the priorities of the programs and strengthens one of the core components, environmental and safety research. 
   Nanotechnology is advancing rapidly, and at least 600 products have entered commerce that contain nanoscale materials, including aerosols and cosmetics. It is important for the successful development of nanotechnology that potential downsides of nanotechnology be addressed from the beginning in a straight forward and open way. 
   We know too well that negative public perceptions about the safety of technology can have serious consequences for its acceptance and use. At present, the level of scientific understanding is sufficient to pin down what types of engineered nanomaterials may be dangerous, although early studies show some are potentially harmful. 
   One example is the recent finding that certain types of carbon nanotubes may mimic the effect of asbestos in causing cancer. More research is needed to determine what characteristics of nanoscale materials are most significant with regard to determining their effects on living organisms or on the environment. 
   Although the NNI from its beginning has included research to increase understanding of environmental and safety aspects of nanotechnology, it has not yet put in place a well-designed, adequately funded and an effectively executed research program in this area. The environmental and safety component of NNI must be improved by quickly developing a research plan and implementation strategy that specifies near-term and long-term goals, sets milestones and timeframes for meeting near-term goals, clarifies agencies' roles in implementing the plan, and allocates sufficient resources to accomplish those goals. 
   This is the first essential step for the development of nanotechnology to ensure that sound science guides the formation of regulatory rules and requirements. It will reduce the current uncertainty that inhibits commercial development of nanotechnology and will provide a sound basis for future rulemaking. 
   H.R. 5940 addresses risk reduction research by requiring that the NNI agencies develop a plan for the environmental and safety research component of the program, as well as a roadmap to implementing it. This plan must include explicit near-term and long-term goals, specify the funding required to reach these goals, and identify the role of each participating agency. 
   The bill also assigns responsibility to a senior official at the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House to oversee this planning and implementation process and to ensure the agencies allocate the resources necessary to carry it out. 
   Finally, the bill requires accountability by establishing a publicly accessible database containing information on the content and funding for each environmental health and safety research project supported by the NNI. 
   Another key component of H.R. 5940 I want to highlight involves provisions to help capture the economic benefits of nanotechnology.     
   Too often, the U.S. has led in the basic research on the frontiers of science and technology, but has failed to capitalize on commercial development flowing from these new discoveries. 
   The NNI has so far invested approximately $7 billion over 7 years in basic research that is providing new tools for manipulation of matter at the nanoscale and is increasing our understanding of the behavior of engineered nanoscale materials and devices. Increased consideration should be given to ways to foster the transfer of new discoveries to commercial products and processes. To that end, H.R. 5940 includes provisions to encourage use of nanotechnology research facilities by companies for prototyping and proof of concept studies and it specifies steps for increasing the number of nanotechnology-related projects supported under the Small Business Innovation Research initiative and by the Technology Innovation Program, established under the COMPETES Act. 
   To increase the relevancy and value of NNI, the bill also authorizes large-scale, focused, multi-agency research and development initiatives in areas of national need. This approach will advance the development of promising research discoveries for demonstrating technical solutions in targeted areas, which will contribute to economic competitiveness and other social benefits. For example, such efforts could be organized around the development and replacement of silicone-based transistors, developing new nanotechnology-based devices for harvesting solar energy, and nanoscale sensors for detecting cancer. 
   Finally, I want to highlight some provisions of the bill that address another key issue, future STEM workforce needs. The Nation needs a full pipeline of talented engineers, scientists and technicians and a scientifically literate public able to exploit and understand this new science. 
   One provision of H.R. 5940 builds on the National Science Foundation's Math and Science Partnership Program to use nanotechnology education activities as a vehicle to raise the interest of secondary students in possible STEM careers. A key component of these new partnerships is involvement by the nanotechnology companies in offering hands-on learning opportunities at their facilities for students and teachers. 
   Another educational provision supports the development of undergraduate courses of study in nanotechnology fields. This will help prepare future technicians, scientists and engineers who will be needed to meet the demands of industry as nanotechnology commercialization continues to expand. 
   Mr. Speaker, nanotechnology will soon touch the lives of all Americans. It is already in our cell phones, cosmetics, paints and clothing. It will soon help to protect the lives of our police officers and military servicemen, and is showing promise in the treatment of cancer and promoting wound healing. There is no doubt that the potential of this technology is great. The bill before us today goes a long way toward ensuring that nanotechnology is developed in a safe and environmentally benign way, and that the Nation reaps the benefits of our research investment. 
   H.R. 5940 has the support of many business and professional associations, including the Semiconductor Industry Association, the NanoBusiness Alliance, the American Chemical Society, the American Physical Society, SEMI North America, the National Chemistry Council, the American Electronics Association, the Association of Science-Technology Centers, IEEE-USA, Materials Research Society, Semiconductor Research Corporation,  the National Science Teachers Association, American Psychological Association, the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering, Texas Instruments, IBM and Applied Materials, among just a few. 
   These organizations, like my colleagues on the Science and Technology Committee, recognize that H.R. 5940 will enhance America's efforts in nanotechnology research and development and will help bring its many benefits to the public. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend this bipartisan legislation to my colleagues and urge their support for its passage in this House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

There were 50 lives lost, 32 in Tennessee, 22 of those were in my district. Many folks were displaced. We are not going to have electricity back in many areas for another few days. 
   As I ask for a moment of silence, I also want us to feel the community of our entire House and our entire country. I think we felt that as we have helped in other places. Again, I just remind Members that this happened in our area this time. It can happen in your area next time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I have watched this healthy debate over the last 2 days, I keep thinking about an e-mail that I received from a lady in Springfield, Tennessee. You would never accuse this woman of not supporting the troops because her husband was a soldier serving in Iraq. He was a month from returning home to his wife and his two daughters, but he was ordered to stay in Iraq for another 6 months because our troops are spread so thin. He hasn't been home since October of 2005. These are the words that she wrote to me: ``Mr. Gordon, we need to help other countries, but there are already 3,000 families in America whose lives will never be the same. I want, need, and would love to see my husband again.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this lady supports the troops. I support the troops in Iraq, and I believe everyone in this Chamber supports our troops. They perform their missions with bravery and honor, and I commend them for the job they are doing. But I am unconvinced that deploying more troops and spending more money is the right strategy. And I am not the only one. General Colin Powell said in December: ``I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for purposes of suppressing this civil war will work.''  
   General George Casey, the former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, said last month: ``It's always been my view that a heavy and sustained American military presence was not going to solve the problem in Iraq ..... '' 
   In December it was reported that the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously disagreed with the concept of troop escalation. 
   General Colin Powell, General George Casey, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, these are men who support the troops. Yet these American generals, the Iraqi Study Group, and the Iraqi Prime Minister have all opposed this troop surge. 
   We have had four other surges since we first went to Iraq. None produced a lasting change on the ground. In October more combat troops were sent into Baghdad to fight the growing violence there. Unfortunately, the sectarian violence has only grown worse. Many have endured great sacrifices in the 4 years this war has been waged. More than 3,000 Americans have lost their lives; 23,000 more have been wounded. We have spent more than $350 billion with many billions more to go. We have been in Iraq longer than we were involved in World War II. And there is no end in sight. 
   For 1,300 years Sunnis have been fighting Shias. Now is the time for the Iraqis to take more responsibility for securing the peace in their own nation. No one has offered any evidence that 20,000 more American troops would change the direction of a 4-year-old war or 1,300 years of history.
