<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (HONORING FIRE CHIEF FRANK WICHLACZ -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, it has been said that when a man becomes a fireman, his greatest act of bravery has been accomplished. What he does after that is all in the line of work. 
   Well, yesterday in my district in northeast Wisconsin, the Pulaski community began to mourn the tragic death of Fire Chief Frank Wichlacz, a volunteer firefighter who died in a freak accident on Wednesday. The 76 year-old Chief Wichlacz gave 50 years of service to the department, which serves parts of Brown, Oconto, and Shawano counties. The last 20 years he served as chief. 
   In 2007, Chief Wichlacz was honored as an Everyday Hero by the Green Bay Press-Gazette newspaper for his long years of service to his community. You know Winston Churchill said, ``You make a living by what you get, but you make a life by what you give.'' Frank Wichlacz lived those words. 
   His service, not only as a volunteer firefighter, but as a fire chief, made the Pulaski community a safer and better place to live. On behalf of the people of the Eighth District in northeast Wisconsin, allow me to express my deepest sympathy to his family and friends and to all in the Pulaski community. 
   May God bless Chief Wichlacz.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, what kind of Nation are we? And is anyone really listening? 
   Forty-seven million citizens have no health care coverage at all. Zero. And the costs, the costs for care are simply impossible to pay. People cannot afford to pay for their pills, for their doctor bills, for their hospital tests and treatments. They can't even afford their cancer treatments. And why? It's simple. They don't have the money. 
   And what kind of Nation are we when, in Shawano County in Wisconsin at the courthouse, 19 out of 20 families going bankrupt do so because they can't pay their medical bills? 
   We need a uniquely American solution to this crisis and we need it now because my patients can't hold their breath any longer. 
   Mr. Speaker what kind of Nation are we? Let's all agree here, right now and right here to change this situation. This is a national disgrace. My constituents are listening and so are yours. Let's end this national nightmare and guarantee access to affordable care for everyone everywhere in these United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support today's energy bill. This is the change we need, for America needs a reliable energy partner, one that is home grown. 
   This bill restores our Nation's independence and will help to secure our future. It will also stimulate our economy and protect our environment. It will allow for clean, renewable energy and move us away from the dangerous dependency on Arabian oil. It will also decrease our imported oil by 2 million gallons per day. It will create jobs and strengthen our economy as we move towards efficient, clean, and renewable energy resources. 
   This bill answers the question whose side are we on. Do we stand with Big Oil and the past or do we stand with the future? 
   I stand with the future and will continue to fight to cut the price of energy and fight hard for the people of Northeast Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Welch. Thank you for the hard work that you're doing. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's a very good thing that the American people can see today that we're working together, not just working together but we're beginning to join hands to begin to solve this energy crisis that we're all facing. 
   I think we can all agree that we have to drill for new oil right here in America and guarantee that the oil that comes from our hands stays within our boundaries and is sold to American citizens first. We can all agree that we have to invest in every single form of renewable energy--biomass, wind, solar--and indeed we have to look into the newer and modern techniques and nuclear energy in finding a way towards becoming an energy-independent nation. 
   Thirdly, we have to prevent any price manipulation in the market price not just here in the United States but also throughout the world. We have to guarantee that there really is a free marketplace in oil where places like OPEC don't control the supply and determine the price. We need a competitive and open marketplace, and we've done that here in this Congress moving the ball forward. 
   But it's not just about drilling. It's not just about investing. It's not just about preventing things. The people I represent, that I have the honor of representing in northeast Wisconsin, they need help now. I mean, their fingernails are not long enough to hang on to what is coming. They need help now. 
   So in the long term, drilling brings oil 10 years from now, investing 5, 10, 15 years from now, but preventing price manipulation in the marketplace, that can have an immediate effect. So I would urge the CFTC to do its job and provide the oversight to guarantee that we don't have to pay more than the price ought to be. 
   Finally, the President did accommodate us. We sent letters to him asking him to stop purchasing oil and putting it into our SPR, our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And he accommodated. And that was put in effect July 1. Now he should listen to us again. He should begin to release 5 to 6 days' worth of our Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserve. Why? Because it will immediately drop the price of oil.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Our Strategic Petroleum Reserve has about 703 million barrels of oil. If we release 5 to 6 days' worth, it would immediately drop the price at the pump by putting immediate supplies onto the marketplace. These are things that the President can do right here and right now. Our constituents need help today as we begin to invest and plan for the future. 
   But first and foremost, let's understand that this crisis we're in was absolutely and totally predictable since  1973. And our government on both sides of the aisle has failed in the past. Let's not fail again. Let's work together.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, today's impossible prices for oil have finally forced America to ask the essential question: ``Where's the plan?'' We're in a situation where every business, every homeowner, every retiree, every local and State government and every United States citizen is being forced to live under crisis management which is a recipe for failure. 
   To become an energy-independent nation, the first step we must take together is to develop a plan, but not behind closed doors, but to do it right here in the open. So let's stop pointing fingers and start holding hands. Let's join hands. Let's begin to think together because we're really all in this together. 
   And let's agree. Let's begin by agreeing that a successful energy plan must begin to include three essential elements. First, drill for new oil right here in America with any such oil obtained from within our territorial waters or national boundaries being sold to American citizens first. And the Oil for America Act will do just that. Secondly, we must invest in every form of renewable energy available and provide the tax incentives for wind, for solar, geothermal, biomass, cellulosic and every form of clean, home-grown energy. We have to provide those incentives so private industry will take charge and take the lead. And third, we must act to prevent any price manipulation anywhere in the world in our oil marketplace. 
   Now we have already passed legislation. We passed H.R. 6377. This was to direct the CFTC to do immediate oversight to prevent manipulation. We passed a farm bill that moves us towards energy independence, towards home-grown ethanol and energy. But we can't grow our way out of this problem. We also closed the Enron loophole, guaranteeing that the marketplace will work more effectively. 
   Drill for new oil in America, invest in renewable forms of energy and prevent energy price manipulation. But our economy is still dependent on fossil fuels today and foreign sources of energy, unfortunately. But oil is still one of our most precious assets. So let's make certain that the more than 140 billion barrels of oil that are underneath America go to Americans first. 
   Now you have a choice here. We have to work together. Under your approach, we will have a solution 10 years from now. Under our approach, we will have a solution in 10 days, because the SPR, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, was opened up several times in the past. In 1991 there was a 33 percent decline in the price of oil almost immediately. In 2000, it went down nearly 19 percent. The oil price went down 9 percent in 2005. We can bring about rapid short-term relief even as we plan for the future. But we cannot solve this problem by drilling alone. We cannot solve it by growing corn alone. We have to work together. We have to drill for new oil, invest in renewable sources of energy  and prevent any marketplace speculation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, my good friend Mr. Ryan from Wisconsin, I was elected to send a message to Congress to balance its budgets and to be fiscally responsible. As PAUL RYAN notes, in Wisconsin thousands of hardworking people have lost their jobs; and when they lost their manufacturing jobs offshore, much of the wealth of this Nation was sent offshore along with those jobs. 
   We need a positive change in America, and it needs to start now, right here and right now in the people's House. Let's begin to build a better future for everyone by dedicating ourselves to becoming fiscally responsible today, not next week. And then when we do, let's ship our values overseas and not our jobs. 
   I rise before you today to urge you to support pay-as-you-go as a means to become fiscally responsible. We cannot realistically begin to solve the many problems we face until we completely reverse the misguided fiscal policy of borrow and spend, and borrow and spend, and borrow and spend, which has driven our country into more debt than our children can possibly repay. Let us agree to live within our means here in the House as we do in our own homes back in Wisconsin.

Are you on the side of families who are working hard, but still cannot afford the cost of health insurance today in America? Are you on the side of the American people who demand, who demand that this Congress find a solution to the impossible costs for health care across the country? Or are you on the side of powerful special interests? 
   The bill before us will cover nearly 38,000 additional uninsured children in Wisconsin, and I'm on their side. Whose side are you on? The American people will remember tonight, how you cast your vote. That question tonight will be answered in your vote, and tonight will answer the needs of those who need us the most, and that's our Nation's children, for they are our future.

   Mr. KAGEN. But I don't want you to hold it against me. And I won't hold it against Mrs. CHRISTENSEN that you have ``M.D.'' behind your name. 
   But if you ask around the Chamber and ask around back home, everyone that I know understands that how you spend your money and where you spend your money is a reflection of your values. And the current administration has shown us where their values are, and they are not with people. They are not really helping us to provide care to millions of people, 48 million, who don't have access to affordable health care, in this country. 
   His State of the Union was very uplifting. He should be commended for bringing up the subject of providing access to health care for everyone. But his policy, as we talked about last week, raises taxes and offers no hope of lowering the cost of health care for insurance costs or prescription drug costs. And, more recently, with his 2,500 page budget, which I haven't finished all the fine print yet, he has shown us his values once again. 
   The first thing he did was to cut benefits to veterans and make it much more difficult for veterans to get the well-deserved benefits that they have earned and that they deserve. 
   What did he do? He is asking for $3.4 billion to come from veterans who have already earned their benefits, but now they have to kick it in. They are going to have to pay for their benefits that they have already earned. There are increasing copayments for veterans in their budget. I don't know where he is coming from on this, but he can't be coming from Wisconsin.

   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you very much, Congressman Pallone. And what Congressman Perlmutter says is true. Really, let's ask the right question. A lot of times in your career, being an attorney, you have to ask the right question to get the truth out of somebody. So what kind of Nation are we, and in which direction shall we move? Are we a Nation that values and treasures those who have served in harm's way in our military? I think we are. Are we a Nation that values the health and education of our children and the mothers that care for them? I think that we are. And that is really where Democrats differ from our opposition party. I really believe that our core values resonate with everyone, not just in Wisconsin where I come from but everywhere, in Florida as well. 
   I yield to Congresswoman Castor.

   Mr. KAGEN. Well, the question then comes up, it is not just about values; it is about choices. So, if we are not going to be spending our hard-earned tax dollars for the good health of children, children who are in need, where are we going to spend that money? Where does the budget choose to spend it? Not here in our country, but in the sands of Iraq.  
   And I would suggest to you and everyone listening that we really cannot solve our health care problems, we really cannot solve many of the problems we are facing until we begin to bring an end to that involvement in that civil war in Iraq. I do not think any day should go by that we do not all stand up and ask the question where do you want to spend your hard-earned money, here at home or in the sands of Iraq? 
   You are quite correct; the budget the President has proposed is deficient, is neglectful to those who are most at risk, the children in poverty, and if you are not healthy, if you are not well fed, you cannot go to school and learn anything. If you do not get your education, you are not going to build a better future that we all require.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Yes, they do. We go into medicine, most of us, because we care about people. We seek to solve problems for people. 
   The model at our clinic was how can we help you today. So we take people, and we take all people, but the real question is this: Is Medicare able to pay for the cost of producing the service at an institution? They do not. So that cost is shifted to others who can afford to pay, and those prices are sky high. 
   So many of the problems that we face, government has not really had its feet put to the fire saying, you know, you should pay for the cost of producing the service, at least for the overhead plus a margin of profit; you should pay for the entire cost of producing a medication or a vaccine, or it will not be there. 
   There are two ways to get rid of anything. Let us take cigarettes as the example. If you want to get rid of cigarettes, tax the heck out of it or do not pay for it. It will be gone. The same is true in health care. If you do not pay for the service, the institution at the hospital, it cannot stand. It cannot balance its budgets. 
   Most hospitals that I am familiar with in Wisconsin are running margins of profit anywhere from 3 to 5 percent, if they are profitable. So it is very difficult to make it. 
   But to summarize Medicare, it is over 40,000 pages of rules and regulations. I do not know that there is anyone that fully understands it, and just think of it as a mess, and it does need to be repaired. But I think the more important point is institutions, hospitals, research centers, educational facilities are not being compensated, and the people that will suffer are those yet to become aged, because we are not really adequately funding higher education for the physicians' training and their fellowships and the nurses' positions. 
   So there are a lot of problem to go after. I will not put you to sleep with the data.

   Mr. KAGEN. It does not have to be that way. With the money we have already spent in Iraq, we could immunize every human on Earth with every vaccine that we know about for the next 95 years. We could have sent 14 million children, our children, to a college education. We could have built over 100, maybe 150, hospitals in each and every State in the Union. There is a lot we could be doing with the money we are spending overseas in Iraq, and it is all about values, and it is all about choices, and we are really getting to a tipping point, I believe, not just in our economy, but people feel it in their gut that we are headed in the wrong direction still, even though the difference makers, the three of us that just got the opportunity to serve here in Congress, have arrived.

   Mr. KAGEN. One of the things that I learned by listening to people on the campaign trail, perhaps the greatest lesson, came from a Native American, an outspoken woman, Gwenn Carr, who said, Dr. KAGEN, it is not doctors that determine who lives and who dies, it is politicians. It is politicians that take us to war based on lies and deception. It is politicians that prevent people from having access to affordable health care that they require. 
   I will share with you a story of Jerry Gajeske. Jerry Gajeske I discovered by knocking on his door. It was not even on his door. It was in Waupaca, Wisconsin, with a college student who 2 days earlier in a dialysis center fainted because of the blood that was available for the eye to see. 
   We were at the door, and I knocked, a gentleman came and said, ha, are you a real doctor? I said, yes, sir, I am, but I am running for Congress now. He said, well, if you are a real doctor, would you take a look at my cousin? 
   I said, sure. Because there were barking dogs, I asked him to come out on the porch. While he went out to retrieve his cousin, I turned to my assistant, I said, Katie, are you going to be okay with this because you don't know what this is going to be. ``Doc, what could it be''? 
   Well, his cousin came to the door and stepped out into the sunlight and had an obvious tumor protruding like a softball at the side of his sinus pushing his eye into the orbit. I said, sir, I can tell you it is not an allergy because I am an allergist, but what did your doctor say? He said, well, I saw my doctor several months ago. I could afford him, but I couldn't afford the tests. The tests were going to cost thousands of dollars. But I had lost my job. I had no coverage. I didn't get the tests. I have been hanging out here. I have 75 bucks to my name hanging out here with my cousin. 
   Well, I said, that ends right now. 
   I took him to the local hospital and asked one of my colleagues to see him. We referred him to a tertiary care center. Several weeks ago, he died of a cancer of the sinus. 
   It is not bad enough that you have to find these people knocking on doors, trying to get elected to office to change things. It is not bad enough that he died without any money or by getting care delayed. 
   To me, the bad thing was he died of the same cancer that my golden retriever did. But my golden retriever got better health care than Jerry in this country at this time. Jerry didn't make it. 
   We will never know if by being seen early and diagnosed early, having the availability of the tests, the radiation, the chemotherapy, if he would not be here today. Don't think that it was opportunistic for me to tell this story, he didn't even live in my district. 
   Jerry is like many, many other people today, who have just fallen off the edge into the crack of the sidewalk; is not being forgotten. Our party, this time, will change health care, not State by State, but across the country and guarantee access to care for everyone. 
   I will share with you this story that I tell often about Jenny, a single mother of two asthmatic children, who came to see me, and I wrote some prescriptions for the children to get medicine for their asthma. They were missing school. 
   When she returned a month later, the children were still sick. I said, Jenny, you know, this is good medicine but it only works if you put it in their mouth. She took the same prescriptions out of her purse and said, here they are. I went to the pharmacy, I stood at the counter, and I could see the medicine, but I couldn't afford to put it in their mouth. What are you going to do? I said, well, I am going to run for Congress because I couldn't help her in the office. 
   I think, by working together, we can build a better future and a better Nation for everyone by changing our health care system now, not later.

   Mr. KAGEN. Well, thank you very much, Congressman ED. I really appreciate being with you, not just here on the floor, but many people don't realize that you're my roommate. We've got an apartment. We're working together to pay our rent, we're working together to pay our Nation's bills, and we're working together to build a better nation for everyone. 
   And before I mention anything about our economy, you have to all be thinking about the Green Bay Packers this weekend. We've got a football game up in Green Bay that we're going to rock the world. We're going to demonstrate not just how professionals can work together as a team in athletics, but we have to imitate them here on the House floor by beginning to work across party lines. 
   And if you're looking for a good example of how corporate America should be run, look no further than the Green Bay Packers because they will never, ever be outsourced. They cannot be shipped overseas. Why? Because the community owns the Green Bay Packers. Not a bad example. 
   I'd like to turn your attention to two questions, questions that I think are important for all of us in this class of '06, what some of us call ``America's Hope,'' whose side are we on? Now, does anybody sitting here, standing here having this conversation with America, anybody here sitting in a board room of a major corporation? I don't think so. We're working hard for everyday people who are trying to make it through the day. 
   The second question is, what kind of Nation are we, what kind of Nation are we when we don't educate our children, when we don't guarantee access to affordable health care for every child in America, for every citizen, every legal resident of this country? Who are we now as a Nation? Now, you don't want to talk much about statistics because it will put people to sleep at this hour of the night, but the Department of Labor has given us these numbers. The Consumer Price Index went up by .3 percent. That's a little bit of inflation, a little whiff of what we're going to get at the end of 2008. The unemployment rate up to 5 percent nationwide; some areas of my district even more. We got the news today earlier this morning that a paper maker in Niagara, Wisconsin, they're going to shut down 320 jobs. That's 320 homes in a very small neighborhood that won't have a bread earner, in Kimberly, Wisconsin, just outside of my district, 120 paper making jobs. 
   Now, how does it happen in this country at this time, how does it happen when we allow Communist China to target each and every sector of our economy and our manufacturing economy for extinction? They've targeted our steel. And what happened to steel production? It went down here and went overseas. They've targeted textiles. They've targeted auto production. So, what are we going to make in America? Because if we don't make anything, quite simply put, we won't have anything. 
   The unemployment claims for the month of December, 322,000 jobs lost, people looking for work. What about the minimum wage, $5.85? You can't feed a family on $5.85 per hour. You can't educate yourself and your children. 
   So, we have got a lot of work to do, not just in the Green Bay football game. I don't know who we're playing, some team from New Jersey or the New York Giants. I wish them well. I hope no one is injured because--well, they do have pretty good health insurance, I hear. 
   So, we've got a lot of problems that we have to face together. I am very proud and honored to be able to serve with all of you here tonight as we talk about this economic stimulus, as I send it over to my colleague, Mr. Ellison, who represents the great State of Minnesota. And he is going to, perhaps, allude to the fact that we 
   have to have an economic stimulus that's timely, that's targeted to those who really need it, and temporary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you very much for yielding. I just wanted to make a more accurate diagnosis of the condition that you are in. Mr. Walz, it's not $30,000 of Federal debt sitting over your head or your newborn son. It's $375,000 on an accrual basis when you factor into all the debts that we're going to owe to those of us who very soon will be on Social Security or Medicare as we retire. 
   So you have to begin to accurately diagnose the problem in health care, physically, or an architect has to do it, a plumber has to do it. Let's identify what's really going on here. What is it that has caused millions and millions of manufacturing jobs to jump overseas, to be taken away from the workers that we represent, the families that we represent? Because people back home are asking me, as they are asking you, Hey, Kagen, what are you going to do for me? The first thing you have to do is identify the two causes I believe are doing this. 
   First, it's the trade policy. A trade policy that allows corporations to take away our jobs. Listen, Mr. Perlmutter, if I go to your home and I take your car and you don't even know about it, if I steal your car, I go to jail. I get punished for stealing, for taking away your property. But if I go to where you are working, if it's a paper company, if it's a steel factory, if it's some auto manufacturer in Detroit, if I take away your job, I get rich. So there is something wrong with our trade policy that allows communist China to compete unfairly using an abundance of what I would call slave labor. 
   The second reason is we have had a fiscal policy by the Republican administration that has plowed more debt onto everybody. The debt in 2000 on an accrual basis, according to the most trusted man in Washington, David Walker, the Comptroller General of the GAO, was $20 trillion and at the end of 2006 was $53 trillion. From $20 trillion to $53 trillion is a debt no one in this room, no one living today can afford to repay. So we have to repair our trade policies, and we have to come to an end with this policy of borrow and spend and borrow and spend and borrow and spend. We cannot afford to stay on this path. 
   I believe in large part those are the reasons why we came here to the House to do the people's work and why we are going to speak up every day for the people that tell us their problems. And I will share with you just one story of my constituents. 
   I went up north to northern Wisconsin. On the way back, I stopped into Two Angels Restaurant in Antigo to see what's going on, to put my finger on the pulse of their community. And there at the counter was a 55-year-old former carpenter, a former carpenter because he has gone through bankruptcy not once but twice because of health care bills. The first time, since he works by himself, he's his own employer, he went bankrupt because he didn't have enough health insurance when he had cardiac surgery, and the second time he had a new heart valve put in. The second bankruptcy he went through, and he went through it twice, was due to an abscess in his brain. He can't think straight. He can't work. And he's counting on us to do something to help him, to guarantee he has access to health care he and his wife can afford. They can't take away his home, but they have destroyed his spirit. 
   So I think we are here to give hope to everybody, that by working together we will repair not just this idea of borrow and spend with pay as you go, with fiscal responsibility, but also ultimately, and we won't get to it tonight, we have to fashion a trade policy that is not just fair but is balanced. 
   I yield to Mr. Perlmutter.

He said, Heck, I want a border I can see and defend. I want my Nation back. Without any borders, we cease to exist. I agree with him. 
   Several blocks later in that same parade a retired teacher pulled me in and said, Hey, KAGEN, we sent you to Congress because we want our country back. I said, What is this, an epidemic? I said, What do you mean by that? He said, Well, I want my constitutional rights back. I want my government to protect my fourth amendment rights, my rights to habeas corpus. 
   People want their country back. We all feel it here in Washington. We want our country back. We don't want to take it back; we want our values back. We want a government again that believes in being responsible with our hard-earned tax dollars. Everywhere I go, I ask people in Wisconsin, Hey, I'm working for you. I'm your hired hand. I have got your hard-earned tax money here from your family. Where do you want me to spend it, overseas or right back here at home? And everybody tells me they want it spent at home. 
   But, Mr. Walz, this United States dollar doesn't buy what it used to buy. It has been devalued. In Milwaukee we've got Miller and Miller Light beer. Well, we have got dollar light. The gold hasn't changed for millions of years, but it takes a lot more money to buy an ounce of gold. The oil that drives our economy, our fossil-based fuel economy, our oil that we are purchasing hasn't changed in millions of years, but it takes a lot more money today. How much? Almost $100 a barrel. To do what? To drive our economy. 
   Folks, we have to get our country back, and it begins by working together, no matter what party you're in, to give people hope and confidence that their government can work together across party lines. But we have to be able to see the same problem and begin to work on it together. 
   This economic stimulus that we are putting together in Washington today, that the Democrats are preparing to work with the Republicans, is great for America. It gives me hope that we can work together across party lines and put together a stimulus package that will help every working family in America. Because what do we have to do? We have to reward work just as we do wealth. 
   I yield back to my colleague from Louisville.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, thank you and I thank as well Tim for being not just a classmate in this great class of 2006 but also for serving the country and speaking out so eloquently and forcefully. You do not have to work out later like I do. You just had your workout. 
   But you bring up something that is terribly important. These are not just words or phrases. The boards are accountability, responsibility. This is something that you know from living your life as you have that we must do not just here in Congress but in our everyday lives as citizens. 
   I am sure you would much rather be home teaching and serving your country as you were, but you were called to a higher duty. You were called to come here, and it was meant to happen. 
   I would like to mention a few things about values. I believe that the President has put forward a budget that is a reflection of his values and his party's values. Where you spend your money is a reflection of your values, and the President sought to cut $3.8 billion from veterans health care and veterans benefits. The President and this administration was asking our veterans who have already earned their benefits to pay for them again. Why pay for something you have already earned? This is something that I consider to be disrespectful to those who have served in harm's way. 
   We will be talking about Iraq in several days and several weeks here on floor. We will be talking about supporting our troops, not just before they go in with adequate training and preparation and all the armament they need, not just during the combat itself, but after they come home, they must receive the care that they deserve in a prompt and meaningful fashion. 
   I served our veterans for a number of years in VA hospitals in Wisconsin and Illinois, and I can tell you the VA hospitals are superior, much better today than they were in the 1970s and 1980s and early 1990s when I was working there. They are much better than what we saw in Walter Reed, much better, but what happened at Walter Reed was this infection, if you will, this malfeasance, this bad idea, that government cannot help people. It is called privatization. 
   We should not privatize the health care of our veterans unless you are going to offer every veteran who served in harm's way with a card and say, here you go, soldier, you served in harm's way, you covered our back, now we have got yours; go to any doctor, any pharmacy, any hospital of your choice, we have got you covered. 
   Well, we are not ready to do that yet, are we? This administration has to come to understand there is a better way. Our class of 2006 represents America's hope, hope for a positive change and new direction, not just in veterans health care but in health care for every citizen in this country. I believe that is what we have to offer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from Oregon and Florida. I appreciate their support on this important resolution. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 421, to honor the first American women to participate in the United States space program. Known as the Mercury 13, they were extremely accomplished pilots and aviators and were selected from a pool of women to become astronauts. Conducted in secret at the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, New Mexico, they excelled in the same physical and psychological tests as the male candidates for astronautic school did, the Mercury 7. 
   Although many of these women outshined and outperformed their male counterparts, they were never allowed to fly into space. The prejudice of the day grounded their mission before they could reach the stars, but it did not ground their dreams. 
   In 1961, just before their final phase of training at the Naval Aviation Center in Pensacola, Florida, the Mercury 13 women received notice that the program had been canceled. Twenty-two years later, NASA sent our first American woman into space, Sally Ride. 
   In these past decades, the groundbreaking achievements of the Mercury 13 women have often been overlooked. Author Martha Ackmann wrote this about the Mercury 13 and their quest for flying into space: 
   ``While the Mercury 13 did not get their shot at space--at least not yet--  they refused to let someone else trim their dreams. They fought for what they wanted, what they believed in, and spoke out against discrimination.'' 
   The Mercury 13 women, as already stated, were Jerrie Cobb, Gene Nora Jessen, Wally Funk, Irene Leverton, Myrtle ``K'' Cagle, Jane Hart, Jerri Truhill, Rhea Hurrle Woltman, Sarah Ratley, Bernice ``B'' Steadman, Jean Hixson, Jan Dietrich, and Marion Dietrich. 
   I had the honor of meeting several of these very tough and spirited women at the University of Wisconsin in Oshkosh in a commencement ceremony, and I was privileged and honored to present to the Mercury 13 women an honorary degree, an honorary doctorate. Today, I have the extreme privilege to honor these phenomenal and extraordinary women on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and their pioneering spirit that has advanced the rights of women everywhere. As these Mercury 13 women have demonstrated, the sky is not the limit.

The President needs our help to support our troops before, during, and after serving in harm's way, and to guarantee our soldiers receive everything necessary to heal their wounds from battles fought on our behalf. 
   The President needs our help to fulfill Abe Lincoln's promise to our veterans, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphans. The President needs our help to hold the freely elected Iraqi Government accountable to his own benchmarks. And the President needs our help to accept the new direction away from Iraq back towards al Qaeda. 
   The people of Wisconsin urge the President to sign the Iraqi Accountability Act, for in doing so he will be able to once again tell our troops and all the American people: ``Mission Accomplished.''

   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, our Nation's values are reflected in how we spend taxpayers' hard-earned money. Yesterday, rather than encouraging us to invest in the good health of our children here at home, the President asked for permission to spend $200 billion in Iraq. Well, it is okay to ask and it is okay to respond by saying, ``No, thank you.'' The health of our Nation's children is more valuable than making more of a mess in Iraq. 
   My friends, enough is enough. It is time to spend our tax dollars right here at home. Last week, 44 Republicans joined the Democratic majority in attempting to override the President's veto of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, known as SCHIP. This issue is not going away. We will prevail. It is a matter of how long it will take. 
   Here are some facts to keep in mind: SCHIP saves tax dollars by sending children in need to the doctor's office, not to the costly emergency room. And over 90 percent of those in SCHIP earn less than $41,000 a year. There is a better way of doing things in America. By working together, we will find it and guarantee access to health care for all those in need.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (MILO C. HUEMPFNER DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINIC -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of H.R. 2408, a bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Green Bay for Milo C. Huempfner, Brown County, Wisconsin's most highly decorated veteran of World War II, recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross, second only to the Medal of Honor, the Bronze Star, and numerous other commendations. 
   Having cared for thousands of veterans as their physician, and now as their elected Representative, I would also like to thank the members of the leadership and the members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee who worked hard to bring this legislation to the floor today, especially Chairman Filner. Thank you. And thank you as well to Ambassador Mark Green for beginning this good work. 
   We need to remember Milo C. Huempfner. He was a hero. His bravery, his dedication to others and his selflessness to serve is a beacon to guide all of us today. 
   Milo served in one of the best trained units in the U.S. Army, the elite 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion. It was a unit where courage was common. Yet even in this company, Milo distinguished himself. 
   Milo Huempfner was literally a one-man army. For 2 days in December of 1944, Milo Huempfner was literally a one-man army. He singlehandedly waged war against a German tank column in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. 
   In that chaotic battle, Milo and a colleague were separated from their convoy with a truckload of ammunition. They were near the Belgian town of Leignon when their truck slid off the road into a ditch. Milo was left behind to guard the truck until a tow truck could return. He had instructions to destroy it if the Germans arrived. He turned down opportunities to leave. When he heard an armed column of Panzer tanks approaching, he burned the truck and retreated into the local city. Over the course of the next 2 days and 2 nights, Milo waged a one-man battle, a one-man guerrilla war against the town's Nazi occupiers. He destroyed tanks; he destroyed trucks. He stormed the machine gun positions and engaged in hand-to-hand fighting with enemy troops. 
   When he was not protecting townspeople of Leignon, Milo would sneak out of town to warn approaching troops, allied troops, that the enemy was nearby. He saved many American soldiers' lives. 
   One evening, a freezing evening, the townspeople came to him and asked if he would go to church and protect them. The people wanted to go to church and he could not understand why. Well, it happened to be Christmas Eve, they reminded him. And he stood outside armed only with a pistol to protect them on Christmas Eve. As the people of Leignon celebrated, he stood guard as he stands guard now. On Christmas morning, Milo received his present when allied forces began their counterattack and surrounded the town. Milo didn't stop. He sprang into action against a German artillery hidden in a barn, and 18 Nazis surrendered to him. When Milo finally met the allied troops, they almost mistook him for a German spy. They couldn't believe that a single soldier could hold them off from this town and couldn't understand how a single American soldier could bring so many enemy troops into being captives. 
   For these deeds, Private Huempfner was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The after-action report on Private Huempfner's deeds ends with these words, and I quote: ``His gallantry, intrepidity and extraordinary heroism while operating within the very limits of the German units, without being ordered to do so, and when withdrawal could have been accomplished with honor and safety, reflect the highest standards and ideal of the military service and favorably demonstrated to the citizens of Leignon the courage and daring of the American soldier.'' 
   After the war, Milo Huempfner preferred not to talk about his experiences. This was common for many soldiers in World War II. His own children did not know any of what I just spoke about until his funeral, when Milo's comrades stepped forward to speak of their cherished comrade. 
   Despite his silence, Milo remained a committed patriot and dedicated to the men he served. Over the years between the war and his passing in 1985, Milo attended the funerals of over 900 veterans in Brown County, Wisconsin. He used his dress uniform so frequently that he wore it out. As a mark of respect and thanks, local veterans organizations paid to have it restored. 
   By naming this temporary community outpatient clinic building in Green Bay after Milo Huempfner, we are paying respect to one of Wisconsin's great heroes.  
   I would like to thank Milo Huempfner's children, Jackie, Wayne, Geri and Milo, for their help and also his friend, Bernard Depry of Green Bay, who brought this request to my attention and worked tirelessly over the years to make this a reality. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2408. We are recognizing the deeds of a brave and noble man.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Chairman, I support H.R. 720 because it will renew our commitment to a positive change in a new direction by investing in our Nation's substantial water infrastructure needs. To me, it is all about our health. It is about clean water and the success of our economy. 
   As a physician, I am particularly concerned with the health risks directly related to contaminated drinking water and am pleased this Congress understands the need to invest in wastewater infrastructure needs. The EPA predicts that without significant investment and upgrades in our water pollution system, this pollution will continue excessively. By investing in the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, we will ensure the communities receive the financing they require for their wastewater treatment projects. 
   In northeast Wisconsin, the Clean Water Fund program has helped Brown and Outagamie Counties invest and develop and rehabilitate wastewater and sewer treatment plants. The projects funded in my district alone are indicative of the demand across the Nation for this bill. By encouraging long-term planning for our Nation's clean water infrastructure, we will reduce overall maintenance costs and create more sustainable systems, even as we create higher-wage jobs back home in Wisconsin where they belong. 
   Finally, I am particularly pleased the Davis-Bacon Act requirements provision will prevail and that the wages of Davis-Bacon will be upheld and local prevailing wages will take place. 
   This bill will be great for our health, our economy, and our environment. I encourage all of us on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yea.''

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, what kind of Nation would we be if we did not stand up and speak out in favor of liberty everywhere in the world? 
   On January 6, 1941, right here in this Congress, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt enunciated a voice for all the world, our four essential human freedoms, freedom from fear, freedom from want, freedom of speech and freedom to worship God in one's own way. These are the freedoms we fought two world wars for and won. These are the freedoms we must endorse everywhere in the world. I encourage the current leaders of Communist China to support these four essential human freedoms everywhere in the world. 
   Soon, very soon, the Olympic games will be held in China, and wouldn't it be grand if China would compete fairly and openly on a level playing field, not just in the Olympic games but in marketing their products as well. We must ship our values overseas, not our jobs. 
   That is the goal of our presence here on this floor. We must represent people here in these United States, not in China.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity to be here with you this evening. 
   Everyone in this room, everyone in this country has a health care story to tell. But if you want to talk first about the President's proposal, I think it falls not in terms of a Trojan horse, but a smoke screen, much like the Social Security crisis was a smoke screen to distract people from what was really going on. 
   I have a chart here that demonstrates that the number of uninsured Americans exceeds the cumulative population of 24 States in our country. Really what we are talking about is the uninsured and even those that have insurance coverage, just having insurance coverage doesn't guarantee that you are going to get coverage. After all, in my medical practice every day, when I would write a prescription, maybe one chance in two, one chance in three, it wasn't covered, it wasn't on the plan, or in Medicare part D on the 44 different lists we had in Wisconsin. 
   I would start off on a positive note and say that the President should be commended for raising this important crisis. It is, in my view, the most important crisis facing our economy. The impossible costs of health care are holding back employment. Employers are unable to employ new employees because of the high cost of insuring them. 
   In my hometown of Appleton, a new teacher this year will be paid $30,000, but his or her insurance coverage will be $12,000 to $13,000, in another neighboring city, $17,000. For anyone earning less than $48,000, the cost of health insurance coverage is simply out of reach. 
   Medically speaking, I would say thank you to the President, but your idea is DOA, dead on arrival. It simply won't work, and it will not solve the crisis we are all facing. 
   He had some other interesting and positive ideas. The idea of the health savings account, I think it is a great idea that people are saving money, but no matter how much money you are saving, it doesn't affect the cost of health insurance, it doesn't affect the cost of your physician's charges, the hospital expenses, or the prescription drugs that many people need. 
   Everyone has a health care story to tell, and it is for those people and everyone in the country that this 110th Congress must address this crisis. 
   Now let me ask all of you, Mr. Altmire, don't you want to know the price of a pill before you swallow it?

   Mr. KAGEN. If you are buying a car or truck or new suit, don't you ask the price? And when you ask the price, you find out the price. 
   I challenge all of us in this room tonight and everyone listening at home, call up your local hospital and ask: Excuse me, what does it cost for a mammogram, and 99.9 percent of the time you are going to get this answer: ``Well, what insurance do you have?'' 
   I think we need to have transparency, and this is one of the ideas that President Bush is in favor of, and I am sure our Republican colleagues would be as well. 
   I believe we need to openly disclose all prices in health care. I believe every citizen should get the same discount. I don't believe in discrimination. 
   Today, on average, if you are covered by Medicare part D, if you go to the pharmacy and you are in line behind somebody from the VA, you are going to pay 46 percent more for that prescription, the identical prescription being sold to a veteran patient, and yet you are paying more. I feel that is a form of discrimination. 
   So if we have an open and transparent marketplace where everyone gets the same discount, where prices are openly disclosed, we form one nation again, not State by State solutions which are very difficult and challenging and unique to the region. 
   I believe if you are a citizen, you should be in the risk pool across the country. Everyone has a health care story tonight, and what they need to understand is that the Democrats are really listening. 
   This health care crisis is something that I see and feel every day as a physician. It is something all of us in Congress hear about here in Washington and when we are back home listening to our constituents. I think we need to spread the word that this Congress, the 110th Congress, and especially if I can say the word, our freshmen class, will address this issue and take it on straight away.

   I believe our President must be kind to seniors and kind to all Americans, and he would be kind in signing the opportunity to negotiate for a lower price for medications. I believe it is discriminatory, as I said. 
   I look at the world and say, okay, what I am about to do, is it kind or unkind. I think it would be terribly unkind to all senior citizens, to anyone certainly in AARP, if President Bush were to veto that bill.

   Medicare part D has already been privatized because no longer is the benefit money going to go to a constituent, to a Medicare enrollee. It goes to the insurance company. In fact, all of us taxpayers paid money to private insurance companies for the marketing of this most fiscally irresponsible program ever to be rolled out by the Federal Government to help them to be successful to privatize the Medicare patients.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>

   Mr. KAGEN. I want to make it perfectly clear to everyone in this room and beyond that we Democrats are very much in favor of profits. We believe in capitalism, and the problem that your hospitals have in Florida or Pennsylvania or New Jersey or Wisconsin, the problem we have in large part is this thing called ``cost shifting.'' The cost of providing a service to a Medicare enrollee does not cover the overhead, does not cover the operating expense to provide that service. So someone has to make up that difference. It takes so much money to run a business, to run a hospital or a clinic or a drug company, but we want people to be profitable. So we are not against profits, but we are against the idea of privatization of what is an essential service, one of the greatest social programs ever rolled out by this Nation being Medicare. 
   Now, I would be the first to admit that Medicare is a mess. I do not know of any doctor or administrator that really understands all the 44,000 pages of the rules, but it does not mean that it cannot be fixed. It does not mean that we cannot take a positive attitude toward it and address it and fix it. 
   Now, I am also a small businessman. I want everyone in this room and beyond to understand, the Democrats are pro-small business. Every small business in this country is facing a crisis because they cannot afford their health insurance premiums. Whether you are a farmer, a photographer or an employer of 50 or fewer people, health care is out of reach. The cost is out of reach, and this Congress needs to step up, not with the President's idea of tax benefits, but we should take part of the good from his policy and bring it to the floor with a new idea.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. I agree with you that many people get very confused when you start talking about bean counting and you get into the numbers. It gets very confusing. We might be better off for everyone to understand health care and simplify it if we talk about trying to identify the essential elements that should be in any successful universal health care initiative. 
   Those essential elements that I don't think anyone would disagree with would be that if you are a citizen, you should be in the risk pool. Because in every State, what they are trying to do now as they seek to find a solution to this urgent problem, every State is trying to form a larger buying group, a larger insurance pool. That is really their only game plan to leverage down the costs. But if we have 300 million in an insurance risk pool with regional modifiers, we can really begin to leverage down insurance costs. 
   I would ask this question, what is the purpose of having health insurance? Health insurance is a form of delayed income. You put your hard-earned money into the insurance company's hands so that when you or a member of your family becomes ill, you get it back. But unfortunately today, when the money goes into the insurance company, you have to fight like heck to get it back, and it may not come back in total. 
   Health insurance should be available to everyone at an openly disclosed price, so everyone has an opportunity to buy something that is affordable. 
   Let us look at the numbers. In 1989, 83 percent of Americans had health insurance coverage from work; in 2004, 56 percent. It was because employers couldn't afford to pay the price. The cost was impossible to pay. If we had numbers today, it might be below 50 percent. More and more people that are watching tonight are falling into this category, going to bed at night knowing that if anyone in the family is ill, they are going to lose their house. 
   What insurance ought to be all about is guaranteeing, if you do become ill or anyone in your family becomes ill, you  are still in your house and not the poorhouse. If we identify the essential elements that need to be in any solution that is universal, I think there are several. First, openly disclose the prices. 
   Second, every citizen should be allowed to pay the lowest price. 
   Third, I think we need that insurance risk pool to be nationwide. If you are a citizen, you are in with no cherry-picking. 
   Fourth, we need to have a deductible that is 3 percent of a household's Federal taxable income. 
   If Mr. Altmire were to make $100,000 a year, he and his family could afford $3,000 on health care. But then give it to him as a tax deduction at the end of the year, up to that 3 percent limit. 
   Fifth, most importantly, I believe the measure of any nation is in how we treat those who are in need. So I would say it this way, that local, State and national governments must provide for those in need. 
   I think it is up to us here as Democrats and Republicans to come together and decide who is in need and what is it we should provide for them? If we can agree on the essential elements that should be in any national solution, the next step will be much more easy to take.

   Mr. KAGEN. It is a tremendous concept, and it will work. It is an old saying, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It works in health care. It works across the country, works on your automobile and will work on your body as well. 
   Here is another sentinel idea. Right now the insurance companies write their own policies that benefit them. I think it is time for Congress to consider writing a Federal standard, a basic health insurance policy. It becomes a Federal standard. We have Federal standards in automobile manufacturing. We have Federal standards in construction, in health care, in every industry that you can name. But we don't have a basic health care policy that each and every insurance company should have to sell. 
   You see, if every insurance company was selling the same piece of paper, then we could compare them based on the quality of their services and their price. 
   I think it is time to take that step. It is time for us in Congress to decide what should be covered. If it is in your body, head to toe, I think it should be covered. I think it is time to start writing a basic, standard health insurance policy, not mandating prices, but allow the insurance industry to set their own prices and compete for us. 
   Right now, back home in Wisconsin, my patients are on their hands and knees crawling to the insurance companies hoping to get in. Farmers will have their wife or themselves working on the farm during the daytime, working a nighttime job, just to get the health care benefits.

   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, impossible costs for health care are a major concern for everyone, and the President should be commended for addressing this difficult crisis. But his proposal is really a tax hike for people who cannot afford it: businesses and working families. 
   We must establish an open and transparent medical marketplace, and it is really not that difficult to do. 
   We need to, one, openly disclose all prices in health care everywhere; two, give every citizen the same discount; and three, establish a single risk pool, 300 million strong, across the country to leverage down prices and costs for all of us. In other words, if you are a citizen, you are in. 
   It is past time that the Congress should establish a single basic Federal standard health insurance policy that every insurance company must offer to each and every one of us. In doing so, we will be able to compare insurance companies based on the quality of their service and their price. 
   The President means well, but you cannot use tax hikes to lower health care costs.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (TIME TO ACT ON THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, it's time for the President to act. Record high prices for gasoline and diesel fuels are crippling our economy and taking our hard-earned money and putting it into the bank accounts of Big Oil and market speculators. The President must take action today to provide relief for small businesses and ordinary people who are fighting just to keep their heads above water. 
   With the price of diesel fuel hitting $4 per gallon and the strategic petroleum reserve at 95 percent full, it's time for action. The petroleum reserve has 695 million gallons within it, approximately the same in August of 2005 when the President released, due to Katrina and due to Hurricane Rita, the oil supplies. According to independent analysts, if we suspend purchasing additional oil into the reserve, it will lower gas prices by 25 cents per gallon. Whose side is this administration on? 
   Times are tough, and the two things the President can do right now is to cut the cost of fuel at the pump and also to reduce health care costs. Today, I ask the President, again, to join me in working together to put more money in the pockets of ordinary taxpayers instead of Big Oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, what kind of Nation are we, and is anyone really listening? We have over 47 million citizens in this country going without health care coverage; 47 million citizens have zero, and they've been left behind. Why? They don't have the money. They simply don't have the money to be able to afford the impossible cost of health care today. People cannot afford to pay for their pills; they cannot afford to pay their doctor bills or their hospital tests or their cancer treatments. These treatments now are out of their reach. And why? It's simple. They don't have the money. 
   And what kind of Nation are we when, in my home State of Wisconsin, in Shawano County, 19 out of 20 families filing for bankruptcy recently did so only because they couldn't afford their health care bills. We need a uniquely American solution to this crisis, and we need it now because my patients and my constituents cannot hold their breath any longer. 
   Mr. Speaker, what kind of Nation are we? Let's agree right here and right now that we need to come together in a bipartisan way and help to begin to solve this national disgrace. My constituents are listening tonight, and so are yours. Let's end this national nightmare and guarantee access to affordable care for every citizen. 
   Now, we're very fortunate to have a Democratic majority in the United States today. We're fortunate because we have the SCHIP bill that will be coming back to the House floor on the 18th of this month, that's one week from this Thursday. We're hoping to get enough votes to override President Bush's recent veto of this essential piece of health care legislation. 
   The SCHIP bill is a State-run program. There have been a great number of misrepresentations about what it really is, and tonight for a few moments I would like to review with you what the SCHIP bill really is all about. It's a State-run, private program. It's aimed and focused at the poorest working families. It will cost $3.50 every day to ensure a child, $3.50 a day. Compare that to the millions and millions and billions of dollars we're spending in the sands of Iraq, $3 billion per week, nearly $400 million a day, and $3.50 to guarantee access for a child to see their pediatrician or their family practitioner. What kind of a Nation are we to say no to that? 
   The eligible people will be those who are in the low-income group. Low-income is three times the Federal poverty level. People who earn $50,000 or $55,000 a year simply don't have the money to spend on health insurance policies, which are now averaging $12,000 to $14,000 every year. 
   It will cover up to 10.8 million children in our country. But don't take my word for it about health care. These are cards I've received from my constituents in Wisconsin. Joe from Hazelhurst writes, ``I am more likely to die because I can't afford the medical care needed than I am in danger of being killed by terrorists. Fix this, please.'' He's not a child, but he needs our help today. 
   Megan and Eric from Appleton, Wisconsin, ``We are a young family with four kids, 6, 3 and twins age 5 months. Our insurance is out of control. Our family earns about $38,000 a year, and we pay $520-plus each month to have health insurance. Our country needs to make affordable health care a priority.'' 
   And what about Pat from Green Bay, Wisconsin. ``Health care issues are critical. We need to develop a plan to help the elderly and the uninsurable.'' For too long, insurance companies have been allowed to discriminate against citizens. Why? For their own personal and individual corporate profits. For too long, our insurance companies have been able to deny people access to affordable care because of a preexisting condition. We haven't addressed that yet, but we will and we must. Allan from Green Bay writes, ``Universal health care. I need affordable medical insurance.'' Rhonda, from Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, ``Our middle-class income cannot support the increase in medical premiums, copays and deductibles. What will be done for the middle class?'' 
   The SCHIP bill is a great start. It's aimed at ensuring the children of our Nation, those who are most at risk of going without, become healthy once again. 
   What kind of Nation are we if we don't care for our own children? Our children, after all, we are dependent on their future. I thank you for listening.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (COMMENDING GREEN BAY PACKERS QUARTERBACK BRETT FAVRE FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE RECORD FOR MOST CAREER TOUCHDOWN PASSES -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague. 
   Madam Speaker, Green Bay, Wisconsin, the Green Bay Packers and quarterback Brett Favre have a great deal in common. They're hardworking, dedicated to the community and believe in competing with, not against, one another to bring out the very best performance possible for each and every athlete and every time on the field. 
   Today, the United States House of Representatives offers its praise to Brett Favre, to his family, to the Green Bay Packers and to the people of Wisconsin who together own the most storied team in professional sports. 
   In fact, the Green Bay Packers, unlike any other corporate entity in America, can never be offshored because the team is owned by the people living in Green Bay and Wisconsin. 
   There are three things our Nation can learn from the success of Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers. First, the team competes with one another to bring out the very best performance from every athlete. 
   Secondly, Brett, like successful Olympic speed skating champions that I've come to know, does his personal best every single day, in practice and on the field. If one does one's personal best each and every day, no one can criticize you. 
   And lastly, the two words that form our American competitive spirit: ``move up.'' Don't settle for second place. Shoot for the gold and settle for the silver, but at all times, never, never stop trying to move up. And remember, we know from our experiences that everybody falls. We all have failures. But it's not how far you fall; it's how high you bounce back. 
   Compete with one another. Do your personal best every day and move up. These three ideas tell the story of the Green Bay Packers and their quarterback Brett Favre. They reflect the spirit of the people in both Wisconsin and in Mississippi, and they will continue to be lived out by Brett Favre during his career in professional sports and beyond. 
   I ask my colleagues to join with me in recognizing the accomplishments of the Green Bay Packers, the hardworking people of Green Bay and the people of Wisconsin and our future Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre. 
   If I may read the resolution, which reads, H. Res. 697, ``Commending Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre for establishing a National Football  League record for most career touchdown passes, and for other purposes. 
   ``Whereas on September 30, 2007, Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre established a National Football League (NFL) record by throwing his 421st touchdown pass; 
   ``Whereas in addition to the career touchdown mark, Brett Favre also holds the NFL record for greatest number of wins by a starting quarterback and the NFL record for playing in the most consecutive games as a starting quarterback; 
   ``Whereas Brett Favre is the only 3-time winner of the NFL's Most Valuable Player Award; 
   ``Whereas Brett Favre's 16 consecutive years of dedicated service with the Green Bay Packers has enhanced the lives of the people of Northeast Wisconsin and exemplified the Wisconsin work ethic; 
   ``Whereas Brett Favre's contributions to his community have extended beyond the football field; 
   ``Whereas Brett Favre was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, was raised in Kiln, Mississippi, and attended the University of Southern Mississippi; 
   ``Whereas Brett Favre's loyalties to his home State of Mississippi and adopted State of Wisconsin are reflected in his participation in and organization of numerous charitable activities in those States, including the Brett Favre Fourward Foundation, the Special Olympics, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America; 
   ``Whereas the Brett Favre Fourward Foundation aids disadvantaged children in Wisconsin and Mississippi and has raised more than $1,000,000 for people affected by Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi; 
   ``Whereas Brett Favre and his wife, Deanna Favre, co-founded the Deanna Favre Hope Foundation, which provides assistance to women in need affected by breast cancer; and 
   ``Whereas Brett Favre has demonstrated that hard work and single-mindedness of purpose can bring success, and epitomizes the words of NFL Hall of Fame Coach Vince Lombardi: `People who work together will win, whether it be against complex football defenses, or the problems of modern society.': Now, therefore, be it 
   ``Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- 
   ``(1) commends Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre for establishing a National Football League record for most career touchdown passes; 
   ``(2) recognizes Brett Favre for his outstanding community service in Wisconsin and Mississippi and his 16 consecutive years of dedicated service with the Green Bay Packers, a community-owned organization; and 
   ``(3) directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to transmit a copy of this resolution to Brett Favre, to the Green Bay Packers organization, and to the Commissioner of the National Football League.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to respectfully request that the administration be kind to Wisconsin's elders by granting a waiver to SeniorCare, an extraordinarily successful prescription drug program. SeniorCare does three things we should all appreciate: It saves tax dollars, it is nearly half the cost of Medicare part D, and it offers a broader range of prescription drugs to our elders. 
   The AARP found that 94 percent of SeniorCare enrollees are better served by SeniorCare than by part D. And SeniorCare is easy to understand. It has a simple, one-page application form and an annual fee of only $30. Simply put, SeniorCare is a better program than Medicare part D and it should be imitated across America. 
   But SeniorCare cannot continue without permission from the Bush administration. I am appealing to the conscience of the President. Please, please be kind to our elders. Allow SeniorCare to continue, for it saves not only taxpayers' money, it also saves their very lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (GAS PRICE RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my colleagues for bringing attention to this important aspect of our economy. As everyone understands, the cost of oil and the cost of energy is hamstringing and pulling down every one in our economy. Northeast Wisconsin, much like the State of Iowa, is very similar to many places in the country. It's highly rural, and in large part in Wisconsin we've got the northern forest lands and farm lands. 
   Our way of life, like the rest of America, depends upon oil as a primary source of energy. Our way of life depends on affordable energy for our industries, such as agriculture, manufacturing of paper, of ships, and many other essentials. 
   Why all of this insight into northeast Wisconsin? Well, much like your friends and your families and your coworkers, my friends in Wisconsin are wondering how much longer they will be able to continue to farm, to drive to work, to transport their goods, to run their trucks at today's impossible gas prices. And what about our senior citizens who are struggling to live on fixed incomes? We owe them and everyone in the Nation to respond to the oil energy crisis that we face together. 
   Now, there are many causes for the increased price of gasoline, and Congress cannot address all of them. But the one thing Congress can do is to make certain that the price paid by our constituents for gasoline is not the result of anti-competitive practices and that the Department of Justice will devote necessary resources to address this issue. 
   In May of 2007, Congress passed H.R. 2264, the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, otherwise known as NOPEC. This was by a vote of 345-72. And at that time, we were outraged, outraged that the price of crude oil was $65 a barrel and at that time, $3 for every gallon of gasoline. Now, compare that to today in May of 2008 when crude oil is over $125 a barrel and $4 at the pump. By passing NOPEC, the House agreed it was time to give U.S. authorities the ability to prosecute anti-competitive conduct committed by international cartels that restricts supply and drives up prices. 
   OPEC, the world's most well-known oil cartel, accounts for more than two-thirds of global oil production, and OPEC's oil exports represent 65 percent of the oil traded internationally. 
   What NOPEC did was to remove the immunity of sovereign states, and appropriately so. However, the conduct of OPEC and its members has been beyond the reach of Federal prosecutors. NOPEC addressed this legal barrier for prosecution by removing their sovereign immunity and bringing the conduct of international oil cartels within the reach of United States antitrust laws. 
   This bill I submit today, the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act of 2008, builds on NOPEC by doing three things: first, it incorporates the NOPEC provisions as passed last year; secondly, the bill authorizes the creation of the Department of Justice Petroleum Industry Antitrust Task Force. Among its responsibilities, the task force will examine such issues as the existence and effects of price gouging in the sale of gasoline, anticompetitive price discrimination by petroleum refineries, unilateral actions to withhold supply in order to inflate prices, and manipulation of the futures markets; and third, the bill provides for a GAO study as to the effect of prior mergers on competition and order divestitures in the petroleum industry. 
   Recent data reveal that at the same time oil supplies were going up and U.S. demand was going down, the oil prices continued to rise due, as some have suggested, to speculators in the oil and gas marketplace. 
   Well, like many others, I believe it's time to shed some light into the dark regions of the speculated oil markets, and this bill will do just that by allowing the Department of Justice, the GAO, and Congress to do its work to guarantee that oil prices reflect supply-and-demand economic rules instead of the wild and speculative and, perhaps, illegal activities of some. 
   Until we finally have an energy policy other than drill and burn, this bill will begin to set things right for the American people. Although this bill will not end the pain at the pump for us this month, it will deliver the information and the insight we need to construct a meaningful energy policy aimed at beginning to become an energy independent nation once again.

   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Scott. 
   Mr. Speaker, we just heard an argument made for that we shouldn't do another study, that we shouldn't look into the darkness of these oil-speculative marketplaces, that we shouldn't do anything but continue more of the same, more and more of the same. 
   Well, let me offer, Mr. Speaker, some numbers. The first number is 7. For 7 years, we have not had an energy policy. We have had an energy policy that was designed behind closed doors. The next number is 300, 300-percent increase in the cost of gasoline at the pump. The people in Wisconsin, the people across America need a positive change in their energy policy, and that we can do some time this fall. 
   The other number I would offer is 200. It's a 200 percent increase in fuel oil prices. Now, if you're living in northern Wisconsin and you are using fuel oil to heat your home and you are on a fixed income, this is pain not just at the pump but also at home. And I want to bring attention to the fact that we are bringing about that change, but we can't do it without studying and getting the facts; and this bill will offer that opportunity.

   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you, Congressman Yarmuth. I really appreciate your words of wisdom and your counsel. And I would like to engage you in some conversation this evening. 
   Earlier this evening we heard our colleagues on the Republican side raise some interesting issues, and one of the questions that someone raised was, almost facetiously, I hope, ``Where's Waldo?'' If security, if international security depends upon finding anybody, it's not Waldo. We took our eye off the ball. Where is Osama bin Laden, and what are we doing about him and his violent extremists and the people that follow his way of thinking? 
   So, may I ask you a question? Congressman Yarmuth, is it really true that our intelligence community went dark? Are we no longer listening in on conversations? 
   Is some of this fear mongering actually real? Is there any truth in there at all? Are we going dark? Are we not listening to people who want to do us harm?

   When you indicate that there is a question of immunity, is that not another word for ``amnesty''? Is it correct to say that the current President, President Bush, is seeking amnesty? And if we are going to give amnesty to someone, isn't it a natural thing to ask what are we forgiving somebody for? Don't you think we should understand exactly what someone did before we forgive them and give them amnesty? Isn't that a reasonable thing to ask?

   Mr. KAGEN. Isn't that also one of the reasons why we were sent here to Washington to try to fix this situation where the 109th Congress failed to ask questions, failed to ask the pertinent questions, failed to hold hearings to find out what it is we are fighting for, why we really invaded Iraq, where's our money being spent? I've been told that 20 percent of the money we spent in Iraq is simply unaccounted for. And 20 percent of over a trillion dollars is a lot of billions of dollars. So I think the 110th Congress has a duty, a responsibility, and, yes, a constitutional responsibility to balance the balance of power, to reset the balance, and to also investigate wherever possible and ask questions. 
   So the questions I would pose to my Republican friends is, what is it you're afraid of? What is it that someone has done wrong? And whom is it we are trying to protect? Are we trying to protect America, or are we trying to protect special interests, either the telephone industry or the people that ask them to break the law in the White House? 
   Do you think it's possible that what they are really concerned about is their own immunity in the White House? Is that a possibility?

Isn't it true that Quest in Colorado said, no, not without a court order? And isn't it true that what we are trying to obtain is judicial oversight of the executive branch? And isn't it also a fact that the telephone companies didn't just volunteer the information, that they were being paid to do so, and at one point when they weren't being paid, they stopped turning over the information and stopped the wiretaps? 
   So I don't think it's just out of a patriotic duty that the companies had. There was a monetary compensation that went along with it. So I think that we have a constitutional duty and the right as representatives of the people that we have the honor of serving to ask these questions and to bring out the reality and the truth of this situation.

   There were two very valuable lessons that I learned during my campaign and election to Congress. The first lesson was that people will believe a lie if it's represented to them with great skill on television repeatedly. People will believe something that just simply isn't true. 
   Here, the kind way of putting it is misrepresentation of reality. I am continuously amazed at how people are misrepresenting reality. We have never gone dark in our intelligence community. We have continued to survey those who seek to attack us and do us harm. We must stand strong behind our Constitution, and most especially our fourth amendment rights, which reads, ``The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons and things to be seized.''

   But let me come back to this idea about cherry picking our laws and cherry picking it apart to the point where the law doesn't mean anything. Earlier today in this Chamber we had the distinct privilege of passing a law about mental health care, about mental health care insurance. We laid the foundation, the foundation that would establish our constitutional rights in health care, so that people will not be discriminated against on the basis of a preexisting condition, albeit mental health care or a heart condition or otherwise. 
   But the idea of cherry picking our Constitution and our laws, are the signing statements, the many hundreds of signing statements by this administration or by this President, is that a sign or a symptom of cherry picking our laws? Is this a situation we are in now, where we finally have found a President that doesn't believe in the Constitution, that won't enforce the laws, either immigration or our constitutional rights?

   We passed a FISA bill that guarantees that we protect not only our Nation but our constitutional rights. Every single Member of Congress has sworn to uphold our United States Constitution, and that means we have judicial oversight, oversight of our administration and the executive branch that may reach far too deep into our personal lives. No administration has the constitutional right to listen in on U.S. citizens. And at no time has FISA gone dark. Our intelligence community has at all times been listening in on conversations of those who seek to destroy our freedom and our rights.

But this national nightmare is measured best not in numbers, but in human lives. Families across Wisconsin are going bankrupt because they can't afford their medical bills. Teenagers across the country will go blind because they do not have access to the care they need for their diabetes. 
   Congress doesn't need a census report to feel people's pain. And as Members of Congress, we must not wait for yet another census report before we act. It is our duty and our moral responsibility to act now.

They involve lease projects from Eugene, Oregon, to Mesa, Arizona, to Mansfield, Ohio, and, of course, Green Bay Wisconsin, where the needs of our veterans require the construction of a new CBOC and also the presence of an outpatient surgical specialty area. This bill will take a major step toward developing the infrastructure of our Veterans Administration. 
   Let me add by saying that as a physician who has served for 6 years in veterans hospitals, we need to invest in our infrastructure of the Veterans Administration throughout the country, not just in Green Bay. H.R. 5856 authorizes $5.8 million in fiscal year 2009 for the lease of a new facility to expand the Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Green Bay. This lease will extend for 20 years. 
   Heretofore, we have had thousands and thousands of veterans in Northeast Wisconsin who had to drive beyond Green Bay, beyond Appleton, south to Milwaukee, to Zablocki in order to get the care they require. The new facility will offer specialty services heretofore not available in Northeast Wisconsin; lab work, radiology, physical therapy, pharmacy, mental health care services, dietetics, dental, podiatry, dermatology, urology, neurology, audiology, and social work. For many soldiers, the Comp and Pen examinations will be done closer to home, not just for their convenience, but also for their personal-family economy. After all, when the price of gasoline reaches $4 per gallon, it costs everyone a lot more to travel. 
   Madam Speaker, 1,500 patients now are waiting on a fee basis for service at the veterans facility in Green Bay. Hundreds and hundreds of veterans are on waiting lists to receive care that they require. 
   This project could not have happened without the strong bipartisan support of not just the chairman, but also the ranking member. So I thank you, Mr. Filner, and also the subcommittee chairman as well. Thank you for putting your best efforts forward to making sure that the veterans in Green Bay and Northeast Wisconsin get the care they need close to home.

   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, on this date, September 11, 2001, we were attacked. But that was not the end of the American story. The American story is still unfolding, as it has in my home area in Kimberly, Wisconsin, with the closing of the Kimberly Paper Mill. 
   One of the workers there is Randy Gossens. With his wife, Vicky, he has worked at that mill for 32 years, and he says, ``With the closing of the Kimberly mill, we will not be able to help out with our daughter's education the way we did with our son. My wife and I are very proud of the fact that our son graduated from college and that we were able to help him financially with his chosen career. With the mill closing and our future income so unsure, we will not be able to do the same with our daughter.'' 
   What kind of Nation are we when we turn our back on our own American workers, when we have trade deals that are unfair and unbalanced? On this very special day, we need to look back and think back, but at the same time we have to take a positive step forward and change the direction of this country and the direction of our trade deals as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, for too long our Nation has been dependent on foreign oil. Today all of our constituents and all Americans are feeling that lack of independence at the pump. It is time for this Congress to enact realistic and effective energy legislation that will help America become energy independent. 
   We must begin to invest in the resources we have right here at home. We must work together to create solutions to rely on our own ingenuity rather than the unreliable sources of foreign energy. Some of these solutions begin right on the farm, like in my own district in northeast Wisconsin. Biodiesel, methane digesters, cellulosic ethanol, all of these measures will help us become independent once again. It begins with a $5 million investment in our own family farms, the energy independent family farm program. This provision will be included in the farm bill, and I urge all my colleagues to support it, along with the other positive measures within it. 
   By investing and creating energy independence on the farm, we will take the first step in becoming less dependent on foreign sources of energy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday in my hometown of Appleton, Wisconsin, the price for a gallon of gas hit  $3.45. Since President Bush assumed office, the price for gas has nearly doubled. Higher prices for gas punish all Americans, punish small businesses, students, senior citizens, farmers, and even our local, State and Federal Governments as well. 
   Everybody is asking, why? Why did the price at the pump go up even when the cost per barrel went down? The most likely answer is price gouging somewhere along the supply line, from the oil company to the refinery to the speculators in the options markets who buy and hold the oil for only a nanosecond. 
   People everywhere want answers, and here is what we can do. Today the House will consider the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. And along with Congressman Stupak and Congressman Rush and others, we will put a cop back on the block. What we need is effective and active oversight, not hide-and-seek politics. 
   Let's take this step together in the right direction. This bill defines what price gouging is. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1252.

In these words, Armistice Day became our Nation's day to give our gratitude to all, to all of our servicemen and women, as President Wilson proclaimed: ``To us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of nations.'' 
   Peace and justice. Peace and justice. 
   President Eisenhower would later, in 1954, change this title to Veterans Day. This 110th Congress has fulfilled its duty to the spirit and the meaning of Veterans Day by passing the largest increase in veterans benefits in the past 77 years, making certain all vets receive the benefits they have earned.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (BALANCED TRADE NOW -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, last Friday it was announced that the Democratic leadership had struck a deal with the administration and the United States Trade Representative regarding how this country will approach trade agreements with other nations. 
   While very few have seen the actual text of what this deal looks like, many of us in Congress have concerns as to how these new standards on labor and environment will realistically and effectively be enforced. 
   As a member of the newly elected class of 2006, I was elected to help change the course of this country, to help change our Nation's trade policy in particular, a policy that cuts the legs out from under American workers and places our industries at a competitive disadvantage. It threatens our quality of life and our global environment at the same time. 
   We are now operating under a flawed model; and until that model is fixed, our Nation's jobs and the livelihoods of our constituents in Wisconsin and elsewhere are in jeopardy. 
   As we have seen in our trade with China, we have been unable, unable to stop illegal subsidies, unable to stop illegal dumping and blatant violations of basic human labor rights and environmental standards. What will we Americans have to give up next? 
   Trade deals in the past were flawed, and the ones still being negotiated must show promise of helping American workers, of helping their families and American communities. 
   I believe that John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, put it clearly in his statement when he said about a new deal: ``Our trade policy will not be fixed overnight. The Bush administration's consistent unwillingness to enforce trade violations against nations like Jordan and China remind us there is no guarantee the executive branch will enforce any new rights workers may gain through these negotiations, and President Bush has negotiated flawed agreements with gross human rights violator Colombia and a losing, one-sided agreement with South Korea.'' 
   My friends, it is time that the United States of America begins shipping our values overseas and not our jobs. It is time for America to take back our rich history of manufacturing, of making things. After all, if we don't make anything, we won't have anything. What everyone in Wisconsin is asking for is balanced trade, and we need it now.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (A COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY WILL LEAD TO A BETTER FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   To solve our crippling crisis of impossible gas prices that are now over $4 per gallon in Wisconsin, we need a comprehensive national energy policy and strategy. And we need leaders who are on our side--not Big Oil. But where is the administration's plan? You see it at the gas station at the corner every day. 
   This crisis was totally predictable and, unfortunately, it is forcing every family, every business, and governments at every level to operate in a perpetual state of crisis planning. In fact, today's impossible gas prices are threatening the survival of major manufacturers and small businesses alike, even as ongoing speculation in oil futures remains unrestrained. The truth is there is no shortage of fuel. We just don't have the money in our pockets to pay for the energy we need. 
   There is a better way of doing things in America. Although alternative energies will not be available to meet our needs for a number of years, we cannot just wait any longer to make plans for our energy independence. We need to start producing more of our own energy right here and right now. If we want to keep more of our money here at home, support the U.S. economy and provide American jobs, then we must produce more of our own oil and natural gas as well. 
   It's time to say ``no'' to the campaign cash handed out by big oil corporations to lobbyists and other special interests here in Washington. The first priority is to stop pointing fingers and instead start joining hands across the aisle. 
   Let's begin to work together and develop a comprehensive energy plan, a plan that is created not behind closed doors, but right here on the House floor, right here in the open. 
   For months, I have been advocating a three-point policy plan. First, we do have to drill for new oil and natural gas here in America. Our Nation has substantial untapped oil reserves, both under Federal land already leased to oil companies and offshore in U.S. territories. With appropriate safeguards, like giving States the right to decide if they will allow drilling off their shores, these reserves should be drilled and the oil extracted from them, which is our own oil, should be sold to Americans first. 
   Second, we must invest in every form of renewable energy available, whether it be solar, wind, geothermal, and even the new nuclear technologies. We have to invest our money here at home in renewable energy. 
   Washington's role should include promoting millions of new jobs with the tax incentives for United States companies to invest in this new technology. 
   Third, we must prevent price manipulation everywhere in the world. Stopping the unfair speculation in the oil market can immediately lower the price of gas at the pump and provide families and small businesses with immediate relief. 
   Also, I have called on the President and his allies time and time again to sell a portion of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would immediately drop the price at the pump. 
   These three steps are fundamental to the success of an independent energy future for America, and they will create millions of new jobs. 
   In the coming days, Congress will take up a comprehensive package that will provide relief for consumers, will end our dependence on foreign oil, and create millions of new jobs and grow our economy. We must promote energy efficiency and invest in renewable sources of energy. We must responsibly increase domestic supplies, and without taxpayer subsidies to oil companies. It is my hope that this will be a bipartisan energy bill that will address all of these concerns. 
   I look forward to joining with my Democratic and Republican colleagues right here in Congress to try a different approach, something that will work. Let's try working together for a change, and find a legislative solution. It will require compromise. And in the legislative process, that is how business gets done. 
   None of this will be easy, and some of it won't be quick. But the time is right to craft a national energy policy that allows working families in Wisconsin to spend less of their money padding the bank accounts of oil executives, and more of their money on their own families. 
   By working together, we really will build a better future, and an energy independent future for all of us.

   The State of Wisconsin became the first State to ratify the amendment. And following Wisconsin's lead, two-thirds of the States approved the amendment which became the law of the land. The 19th amendment gave women their full rights as citizens. 
   It says, simply, citizens of the United States shall not be denied the right to vote on account of sex. The 19th amendment brought this Nation one step closer to fulfilling the promises enunciated by our Founders. 
   As the first Chamber of Congress to approve the amendment, we showed the way, and the Senate followed.

   Fiscally responsible, pay-as-you-go, and real budget reforms were supported by many, many Republicans. Sixty-eight joined in implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Eighty-two Republicans helped to increase the minimum wage, and 36 joined in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY'S BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Yarmuth from the great State of Kentucky. And I thought what I would do is I'd share with you some of my feelings about how things are going here in Washington. 
   We were presented with Bush's proposal, which, medically speaking, is dead on arrival. It just doesn't face up to and it doesn't really reflect our traditional American values of putting people before things. People ought to come first. 
   I am very much opposed to the President's budget which seeks to really destroy Medicare and take away Medicaid, which is the health care access for those of us who are in the greatest need. And so I think we have to take a look at the numbers. When the President suggested $497 billion cut from Medicare, nearly $100 billion cut from Medicaid, how are these people going to get the essential medical care that they need? 
   I look at it, in the big picture, as this way: We've been elected to change the direction of the country and to do four essential things: First, defend America. We have to enact, as we did, the 9/11 recommendations. We have to begin to move our troops away from Iraq and back after our real enemies, Osama bin Laden and his followers. And they weren't in Iraq when we went there; they were in Afghanistan. But we cannot remain in a hundred-year war and continue to borrow money from China and spend it in the sands of Iraq. 
   Everywhere I go in Wisconsin, my good friend, people are telling me, Look, you have got our hard-earned tax dollars. Spend it here at home. Build our roads. Build our bridges. Rebuild America. Let's not rebuild another country. Let's rebuild our own lands. This budget does not reflect our values. It doesn't protect anyone except corporate greed and those at the very top of the ladder. It doesn't do what we should be doing: educating our children, caring for our veterans. 
   The Democratic budget seeks to put in over $3 billion above what we did last year because we have 330,000-plus soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.     
   And they need help now more than ever, not just before and during their service in harm's way, but when they come home with PTSD and other injuries that you may not see that are mental, and also those physical injuries. We have to have a budget that makes sense not just for us here, but also for people at home. 
   I have here a chart that shows you the change in real median, which is like your average household income, by Presidential term. If you look over here right by the right, this is something people in Wisconsin understand straight away. We are not better off today than we were before President Bush took office. And this Republican policy of borrow and spend and borrow and spend has put us in the drink. 
   There is a difference between Republicans and Democrats. Right now, the difference is about $33 trillion of debt on an accrual basis. When President Bush took office, we had a debt of about $20 trillion on an accrual basis. We are now up to $53 trillion of debt. We have obligations we have to meet to those people that we serve and represent. 
   During the Clinton Presidency, there was an increase of $6,100 of median household income; with Bush I, a decline of $1,000. So we have to return and get back to the basics of balancing our budget, and most importantly, balancing our trade as well. We cannot continue to have a negative trade deficit with our partners overseas and have any kind of economy left at all. 
   This budget does not make sense. I thought I would go through with you, since you are from Kentucky, some of the things that might be happening if we followed President Bush's and the Republicans' budget. Homeland security grants. In the State of Kentucky, well, you would lose $7 million. In Wisconsin, $9 million. Homeland security grants are important sources of revenue for small governments and cities and towns to help defend America on the local level. 
   Assistance to firefighter grants, the AFG grants, puts valuable equipment into volunteer fire departments across the country, giving them communication gear so we can communicate during an emergency. Well, in Kentucky, oh, my poor friend, you're not even on the list. Let's go to Wisconsin. We're losing $13 million. And Kentucky, $12.5 million with the President's budget. 
   What about the Clean Water State Revolving Fund? This is an essential source of revenue for guaranteeing that we have infrastructure that makes sense, that functions as it should, wastewater treatment plants and the like. In Wisconsin, under President Bush's budget, we would lose $4 million. In Kentucky, you would lose almost $2 million. It goes on and on. 
   Community Development Block Grants, Dislocated Worker programs. These are people-oriented programs that need to have financing to make sure that people have a safety net that they can count on. 
   If you want it in general terms, you used the analogy about a sale, you know, 2 days only, or should we say, ``to the rich only.'' That sale, that tax break, that has to end because otherwise we're passing the buck. We're passing our debt on not to our generation, but to our children and our grandchildren because sooner or later these debts must be paid. 
   We're seeing it now with the decline of the dollar. The decline of the dollar has caused what? The oil hasn't changed for 1 million years, but its value has gone up because our purchasing power for the dollar has gone down. The gold hasn't changed, but it now might take $1,000 someday soon, real soon, to get 1 ounce of gold. So your purchasing power of the dollar has declined. Interest rates are going down, making your investments, if you saved any money at all and you're on fixed income, it's much harder for you now to make it through the week. 
   As we look at the budgeting process here in Washington, the essential difference is there are debt lovers and debt haters. We want to pay our bills. We want to be fiscally responsible and socially progressive to guarantee that people are more important than things and people are more important than corporations. 
   And I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. I couldn't agree with you more, and I appreciate your yielding. 
   Think about it. I'll ask it rhetorically: Can you name one thing that President Bush has done to help us become an energy independent Nation? Just one thing. I can't think of a thing that he has done. There is so much that we could be doing to become energy independent. 
   But let's look at taxes just for a minute. I can lower your taxes by investing in people, by having healthier children who will have healthier lives. They will get a better education if we educate them and invest in education. I can lower your taxes. I can lower the taxes of every city, every county and every State in this country if we would invest in a health care system that makes sense, that's affordable, and guarantees access to affordable care for everyone, especially our children on whose future we all depend. We can lower our taxes by having healthy senior citizens who walk straight, who don't need canes, who actually have access to the essential services that they require. 
   We have to invest in people, their education, their health care, and especially our veterans. And it's going to cost more and more and more the longer we remain in a religious civil war in Iraq. We're spending $12 billion of our tax money that we have to pay back sometime. Now 80 cents on the dollar that we're borrowing from foreign countries, 80 cents on the dollar we're taking from foreign countries right now. So who owns America? Who are we? And in which direction are we going to turn? We have become a debtor country. 
   Let's take a look at some of the numbers that are a bit frightening. I'm going to scare you for a reason. This is the way it is: 2.8 million homes are going to go through foreclosure in a short time through the subprime mortgage crisis. But the number at the end of the day, when this recession is done in 2011 or 2012, may be 20 million homes. Now if you have three people per home, that's 60 million American citizens. Sixty million people might have to lose their home. If I came up to you and said, hey, you know, 20 percent of the population in Cuba is homeless, you would say, well, yeah, it's a Third World country. We're already getting there. 
   Now 10 years ago, in conversations with my physician colleagues, we would have an agreement that we were doing fine in America so long as the value of the dollar was upheld and so long as Arabians took our dollar in payment for their oil. Well, last year, the Japanese started buying their oil and paying in the yen. Germany is now paying in the euro because they get more for their money. So our dollar has been devalued because of these failed and losing economic policies that we're now underneath because of President Bush. 
   We must turn a page. We must come back to the basics of being fiscally responsible and paying as we go as we've done in this House in the 110th Congress. 
   Now if we don't invest in our children's education, where are we going to get? We're getting nowhere. If we don't invest in our children's health care early on, we'll never be able to afford their expensive care later on. Remember the old tire commercial, ``You can pay me now or you can pay me later''? That's true in the health care field as well. 
   I feel very strongly that we have to take on all of these issues. We have to have a fiscally responsible budget. And the very first thing we have to address is our skyrocketing, impossible costs for health care, which are a drag on every small business I get to meet with. I don't care if you're in farming or if you're a shoe salesman or if you're a small manufacturer, the number one cost you have of running your overhead is your health expense for your employees, if you're fortunate enough to have the money to pay for it. 
   Today, the average cost for a family of four is $14,000 for health insurance, on average. If you're making $50,000 annually, how can you afford to give $14,000 to the insurance industry? You can't afford it. That's why we have 47 million United States citizens with no health care coverage at all. I think we have to become fiscally responsible. This Congress will do it. 
   I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you for yielding. You bring up an interesting point about paying taxes. Do you really believe that people who are going down can pay more? It doesn't make any sense at all. Let's take a look at some of the numbers. 
   Twenty-five percent of all workers in the United States earn less than $8.70 per hour. One half of all women working earn less than $8.70 an hour. That's about $18,000 in a year. One-fifth of all children in America are living in poverty, which is the highest among the 17 industrialized nations, and we are the only industrialized nation that doesn't have guaranteed access to health care for everyone. So who is going to end up paying? 
   Well, we had dinner tonight. Somebody has to pay the bill; right? So we can't just get up and turn it over to somebody else. Our kids aren't there. Our grandchildren aren't there. We had to come up with the money to pay for our bills. But if you don't have any money, and I'm not accusing you, but if you don't have the money, I'm going to have to cover you. 
   Now, who has benefited from all these tax cuts? It's the people at the top of the income scale. It should be no surprise who is going to have to pay the bills when they come due. It's not going to be people that don't have any money. They're going to the banks now looking for money. 
   I was in a diner in Oconto, Wisconsin, Northeast Wisconsin, having a bite to eat on my way to an event. And I asked the guys who were working there that are city workers how I could help them with an economic stimulus package. 
   And they said, Doc, look out the window. It's right there. There's the price of gas. If you want to put more money in my pocket, cut the cost of gasoline. 
   Well, we haven't done it yet because we have got an oil Vice President and an oil President. We can't do it while they're in office. 
   The second thing he said was, look, the other thing you can do is knock down the cost when I go to the pharmacy to get my medication. I think I'm paying too much. 
   And let me share with you some reality. In the State of Wisconsin, we have a program for senior citizens who are in need of assistance in paying for their prescription drugs. So if you can't afford your prescription drugs and you're in need and you're lower income status, you will qualify for senior care, and by buying into it with $30 a year, you get this kind of a benefit. Virginia, for her medications, pays over $330 per month at the pharmacy for her medications. On senior care it's $89. The same pharmacy, the same prescription drugs, the same drug makers. The only difference is the State of Wisconsin formed a purchasing pool. 
   I will give you a second example. The Veterans Administration has negotiated steep discounts for a vast number of very effective and therapeutic prescription drugs. And, on average, if you're a veteran getting your prescription drugs from the VA, you're paying 46 percent less than a Medicare part D patient. But, my friend, the veterans who fought for this country, for our freedom, for the right not just for themselves to get a discount, they fought for everybody. Don't you think it's only right but that everybody be able to get those same medications at that same steep discount? They didn't fight a war--they didn't defend America--for themselves. They did it for every citizen across this land. If the VA can use its resources to leverage down and purchase prescription drugs at a steep discount, shouldn't everyone benefit from that steep discount? 
   So we have to begin to think differently in America, about us. Not me, about all of us. We have to begin to return to the days when health insurance was sold to an 
   entire community. You know those letters u-n-i-t-y, unity? We have got to put ``unity'' back into ``community.'' We have to return to community-based ratings so we can insure everyone in the community without any discrimination. And when we do that, we can leverage down the cost of prescription drugs and insurance coverage for everyone. So I think this is our time when we can begin to have a discussion with the American people about what's important to them. 
   In Wisconsin paying your bills is just the way of life. So is working. Two feet of snow, three feet of snow, we're still there on time. So from our Wisconsin point of view, and I am certain it's true in Kentucky as well, people want to pay their bills. But what's happening today in households across my district is people are running faster to stand still. They are working harder to make a little bit more. But their energy costs for their gasoline, for the diesel; for the farmers, for their fertilizers, their feed, for their cows, the energy cost is escalating. That's called inflation. And on top of that, they can't buy as much with their hard-earned dollar. So what good does it do if you're milking cows and you're getting $20 per hundred weight and your overhead is eating it up? The margin, your profit, is almost the same as when it was $12 per hundred. 
   So we have to begin to change our Federal policies, and our budget must reflect not just our Nation's values but our true American traditional family values of pay-as-you-go. 
   Now, when I was just 12 years old, my grandmother from Poland taught me, Steve, if you see something you like and you've got the money, go ahead and buy it. If you see something you like and you don't have the money, don't buy it. And that's all you need to know about money. 
   We have to take that idea here in Washington as well and say, look, there are things we must do. We must defend our country. We must grow our economy, expand the middle class. At the same time, we have to protect our planet from global climate change and global warming. All of these are very complex issues, but it begins with money. 
   Now, my friend, I look at money as a problem solver. If you've got money in your pocket, you can solve some problems. And this government has built up such debts that we are now getting handcuffs on us, monetary handcuffs. Our debt load is so heavy, we are having more and more restrictions on what problems we can solve. So I think we have to get our financial House of Representatives in order, not just our congressional House but our financial house.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. I appreciate your comments. And I have learned a great deal just working with you here in Congress. And I appreciate your sacrifice of leaving your business and your life in Kentucky to work here in Washington even as you live back in Kentucky, as I work here in Washington and live in Wisconsin. 
   I will just remind you what we both agree on. We need to have not just a budget policy, but a tax policy that rewards work more so than wealth. Because what you see with this graph is that the people that are being rewarded are the wealthy who are not necessarily working as hard as people. 
   Now whose side are we on? We do not sit in a boardroom. We are standing on the workplace floor. We understand the pain and feel the stress that ordinary Americans are going through and families are making it just a tough time every single day. The policies that we are putting forward have to be people first, and our budget must not only be balanced, but we have to balance the other deficits that we face. We have a budget deficit, and we have a savings deficit. We have to become, once again, a Nation that saves money and not just spends money. We have to lead the way here in Congress. 
   And I look forward to working with you in the years to come and certainly in the next several weeks as we pass a budget here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, joining me this evening is Congressman Altmire from Pennsylvania. 
   I think it's only fitting that on this Valentine's Day we begin to have a discussion about health care in America. It's a heartwarming day. It's a day of friendship, a day of conversation between one's loved ones. 
   When I was sent here by the people of northeast Wisconsin, I was sent here to listen to their concerns. In my previous existence, I was a physician caring for many thousands of people across northeast Wisconsin. And I continue to listen to them while I'm here in the halls  of Congress, and I want to share in the first few minutes of this hour some of their conversations with me. 
   Tom and Sue Wright from New London, when I asked them what was important to them, 50 million people without health insurance is a disgrace. Tom and Sue are right, but they're not alone. Bob from Green Bay writes, ``If taxpayers can't get the same health insurance as Congress, at least get drug costs down so we can afford our pills.'' 
   What about from Casco, Russ writes, ``I'm 60 years old, and I have a $5,000 deductible on my health insurance per family member; all of my health expenses out of pocket. We need help desperately.'' That's Russ in Casco. 
   In Greenville, it's the same story. This is from Al and Linda. ``As we near retirement, we know we can't afford health insurance premiums or drugs on our own. Please help. We're getting towards retirement. We don't have the money.'' 
   From De Pere, it's Kathleen. ``It's time for all Americans to have the same health care benefits as their Representatives in Washington.'' 
   And finally, from Crivitz, Al writes, ``Without a job that pays a fair wage, I won't have money to pay for health care, gas, a war, Social Security, or anything else.'' 
   My friends, my colleagues, it's time for us to have an open and honest discussion about what's important in America. And if it's not your health, I don't know what it is. Because if you don't have your health, you don't have anything. 
   I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire).

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. I appreciate your being here tonight, Mr. Altmire. Your contributions to Congress have already been exemplary, and I look forward to working with you in the future on health care issues. And it's not just you and I, it's not just the Members of the class of 2006, a group I call America's hope for a real change and a positive change in the direction of our country, it's not just the people that call us up, not just the people who send us postcards, not just my patients back home; but it's the most trusted person in Washington, DC that understands the importance of health care costs today. And who is that person? That's our Comptroller General, David Walker, who, on January 28 before the Senate Budget Committee, had these words to say: ``Under any plausible scenario, the Federal budget is on an imprudent and unsustainable path. Rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a Federal budget problem; they are our Nation's number one fiscal challenge. The growth in health-related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing the State and local governments. Unsustainable growth in health care spending is a system-wide challenge that also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage for their workers and undercuts our ability to compete in a global marketplace.'' 
   And he went on to say that the key points in his presentation are: ``Although recently declines in our annual budget deficit are good news, our longer-term fiscal outlook is worse, and absent meaningful action, we will  face spiraling levels of debt. Our long-term fiscal challenge is primarily a health care challenge.'' 
   Well, I think the Comptroller General has it right. It's our health care challenge. And people every day in Wisconsin and across the country are challenged when they receive in the mail a solicitation from an insurance company, one such as this: with happy smiling faces on the front, they invite you to call an 800 number to see if you qualify. But here's the list, and it reads: ``Important information about preexisting conditions. Although we make every effort to extend coverage to all applicants, not everyone will qualify. If you have had treatment for any of the following conditions, you may not qualify for coverage.'' And it lists a long list of conditions that many millions of people have. And at the very end there is a real teaser, and it says: ``This list is not all-inclusive. Other conditions may apply.'' 
   My friends and my fellow Americans, I believe it's time on this Valentine's Day, February 14 of 2008, to bring an end to the discriminatory actions that insurance companies now enjoy. We have to bring an end to the discrimination against any citizen in this country based on their preexisting medical conditions. 
   Before I highlight the bill that I am putting in for submission today called No Discrimination in Health Insurance Act, I'd like to review with you what we have today in our health care system, and it's here to my right. 
   Our health care system is simply unsustainable. There are three tiers to health care. In tier one, in red and orange, we have Medicaid, which is 61 million Americans; and Medicare, 43 million. These people, in general, don't pay for the bill. They don't feel the economic costs because government is providing for their needs in most cases. 
   So in tier one, you have a group of people that aren't paying the bill. In tier two you will pay a portion of your bill, and this has to do with the 149 million Americans that have health insurance. But increasingly today, the health insurance premium is skyrocketing, and the cost for care averages $14,000 each year for a household of four. This price and this cost is beyond what the normal hardworking family in Wisconsin and elsewhere in the country can afford to pay. 
   In tier three, this is the 47 million American citizens who have no health care coverage at all, and I am one of them as the only Member of Congress who has not signed on for health care benefits. For I didn't come 
   here for a benefit; I came here to guarantee access to affordable care for everyone. But 47 million Americans who choose not to purchase insurance either because they don't have the money in their pocket or they can't afford it. So our system, as it exists today, is unsustainable, unbalanced, and is tipping over rapidly. 
   That is why I submitted for passage a bill called the No Discrimination in Health Insurance Act. This bill seeks to do three things: first, it guarantees that if you're a citizen, you're in because no insurance company in group or individual health should be allowed to sell you a policy that excludes you from the community. We have to begin again to ensure communities rather than individuals because what's happening amongst the insurance world today is you will be cherry-picked away from your mate. A husband will qualify but not his wife. A mother may be separated from her family. And what's worse, your neighbor may have a completely different health care coverage only because we're being cherry-picked and divided. 
   I believe we have to get back to community ratings. It's not just my opinion. Many millions of Americans agree with me. The SEIU agrees with this idea, families USA as well. And our Constitution, in fact, guarantees any citizen and every citizen has protections against discrimination. This is the result of very long and hard-won gains by ordinary people who for decades showed extraordinary courage fighting for positive change and the rule of law to protect each and every citizen. Now I believe is the time to apply this fundamental principle of anti-discrimination to our health care system, because my patients, quite frankly, cannot hold their breath any longer. And that's why I have introduced this bill, the No Discrimination in Health Insurance Act. This essential piece of legislation will guarantee access to affordable care for every citizen in America by bringing an end to the discriminatory practices employed by insurance companies today who deny lifesaving coverage to millions of Americans only because of a preexisting medical condition. 
   Look, the grim reality is that our Constitution protects us from discrimination unless and until we become sick. I believe our legislation here that I am putting forward will put discrimination where it belongs: in the past. 
   Ending all forms of discrimination is essential, I believe; but it's also time we pull back the veil of secrecy because today the real price of health insurance, the real price of a pill, the real price of a hospital service is hidden. And that's why the second thing that this bill will do is to show us the price, openly disclose the price, and then allow every citizen to purchase that product, that health insurance policy at that same lowest price within the region. Ending all forms of discrimination is paramount and tantamount to why we are here as a Congress. 
   If you go to your favorite restaurant, you'll find the solution to our health care crisis right in front of you. They'll hand you a menu, and when you open the menu and see that your ice cream for dessert might cost $5 for you, what's the price that the person sitting next to you or across the table will pay? $5. Show us the price, and everyone gets to pay the same price. 
   If you go today to a pharmacy anywhere in the country and you're standing in line with five people to buy the same prescription drug, you may all pay five different prices for the same product because the price is not openly disclosed and there isn't a free and open medical marketplace. 
   As a physician for the past 30 years and now as a Congressman for the past 13 months, I understand how difficult it is for families to pay not just their health care bills but their insurance premiums. People today all across the country are choosing between taking their next pill and skipping a meal or vice versa. 
   But you don't have to be a doctor to know our system is broken because ordinary people cannot afford to pay for their health insurance. These skyrocketing costs are excessive. They're simply out of reach for small businesses. They're out of reach for families across America. 
   We need to do more. We need to do more now. We need to pass legislation that contains the essential elements of openly disclosing the price, guaranteeing if you're a citizen, you're in and you will not be discriminated against, and that everyone in your region, every citizen or legal resident can pay the lowest price possible. 
   The reality is our Nation's insurance industry has been successful. It has been successful beyond all measure. And it's been successful by dividing and conquering. Dividing you by your neighbor, dividing up families, and individually insuring people based upon their preexisting condition. We have to put the letters ``unity'' back into community and restore community-based ratings. We can begin to heal our Nation by doing this, by becoming a community once again. 
   My No Discrimination in Health Insurance Act requires companies to openly disclose their price, to charge every citizen the same fee for the same service within the region, and allows all citizens to find a benefit by paying the lowest available price. It will end discrimination in health insurance. It's the right thing to do, and it will reduce the cost for everyone across the country for health care. Simply put, if you're a citizen, you're in, without any discrimination against you due to a previous medical condition. 
   I ask all of you to join me in this effort because it will be a big battle. There are some very strong forces in the insurance industry that don't want to compete for our business. This legislation is essential not just for you and your family; it is essential for small business to survive. 
   The greatest expense everywhere in Wisconsin, as I went around the district to listen to different employers, whether you're in agriculture and a family farmer or a small businessman trying to run a photography shop, the greatest expense in their overhead is their health care cost. We can and we must do better. And we can do better  by forming an openly disclosed marketplace where people begin to compete once again for each other's business. This is important. It is essential not because I say so, but because the people that I represent say so and, as I mentioned earlier, the Comptroller General agrees. 
   Everyone in this House, every Member of Congress in the Senate and the House has a health care story to tell. I can share that with you nonconfidentially because they come up to me on the floor and ask me about their health.     
   They ask me about the pills they are taking. And I am here, I am available, and I can't bill them because, well, I have taken an oath. I only get paid by the people I represent. 
   The fact is everybody has a health care story to tell. We have to make certain that we don't discriminate against people based on their political affiliation, be they independent, Democrat, or Republican, but by the condition that they are a citizen and they ought to be involved in the risk pool. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will close my remarks on health care by suggesting very strongly that every Member of Congress consider this. Either you are for discrimination and on the side of the insurance industry or you are against it and you are on the side of the consumer, the patients, and the millions and millions of Americans who need health insurance at prices they can afford to pay. 
   It was said first in the White House several years ago, either you are with us or you are against us. But this bill allows everybody in the House to decide whose side are you on. Whose side are you on? Are you sitting in the boardroom with the CEOs of the insurance company or are you sitting at home at the kitchen table with mothers and fathers who are struggling to pay their bills every month? 
   In my State of Wisconsin, and it is true across the United States, the most common reason that people go bankrupt today is they go bankrupt because they cannot afford their health care bills. They cannot afford this. In Shawano County several months ago when I stopped into the county courthouse, I was told that 19 out of 20 families who had come through an education policy after going bankrupt did so only because they couldn't afford their health care bills. We can and we must do better in America. And it starts by reforming our health care system. When we drive down the cost of health care, we are going to cut taxes for everyone. Now this sounds like it is voodoo economics, but if I lower the cost of doing business for every city, every county, every town, every State in the country by lowering health care costs, I can reduce your taxes. This is not just a health care issue. It is a business issue. It is a tax issue. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with you some words I was privileged to listen to in a small town in the northern part of Wisconsin, a district I have the honor and privilege of representing. It is a city called Niagara, Wisconsin. And as Niagara goes, so goes our Nation. Niagara is a small town of 1,880 people. And the major employer there is a paper mill, which was recently purchased and then closed. Three hundred twenty jobs in this small town are about to disappear in April. And I went to Niagara to interview some people and listen to their concerns to see what government can do to help them. I spoke with George. George is nearly 80 years old. I would like to share with you his words for our country. They will be available, if not today, then tomorrow at my congressional Web site, Kagan.house.gov, as a video clip. 
   I asked George, ``Are you still working?'' And George responded, ``Nope, I'm retired 19 years. Put 41-plus years in there. But what I want to say is that Congress should have been aware of this happening because it has been in all the union papers.'' And he is referring to the closing of the mill, the one major employer in town. ``People been talking about it. They put one or two paper machines out of there. They pulled the machines out. And what do they do? They ship the machine to India. That machine was 100 years old, and now it is operating in India. So why was Congress so lax? All these jobs been deteriorating right along.'' 
   And I asked him, ``How long have you lived here?'' He responded, ``All my life.'' 
   ``You were born right here?'' 
   ``Yup. I will be 80 years in April. And I have five brothers who worked in the paper mill also, 41, 42, 45, they all worked there that long. And my children during the summer months worked in that mill.'' 
   I asked him, ``What did you do in the mill?'' 
   ``I worked on the paper machines.'' 
   ``Which one?'' 
   ``I worked on them all, all machines. Started off in the old mill, number one, went to number two, and then went to number three, and then to number four'' 
   ``And do they have any retirements,'' I asked him, ``at the mill?'' 
   ``I have very good benefits, and I am thankful for that. That is what I am worried about now, though. I was told that at the end of 2008, things are going to change. I am going to have to get something else. I don't know that. Nobody told me that. But that is just the rumor. So we have to start looking into something else.'' He is referring to health care benefits and the prescription pills. 
   ``What makes me mad is that we found out we can get medication in Minnesota and in Canada. And what happens? They tell me I can't do it no more because we would get sued, the company would get sued. They would save the mill about $300 every 3 months, and we would save ourselves $250 every 3 months. And they said, ``No, we can't do it,' so now we have to buy them at Wal-Mart.'' 
   And I asked him, ``So you think there is a better way of doing things?'' 
   ``You better believe it.'' I asked him then at the end of my conversation if there is anything else he would like Congress to hear? If he were talking then with Congress and with President Bush, what would he have to say, what would you ask him to do. 
   And George responded, ``Get on the ball. Take care of the United States, not foreign countries. They always said foreign countries are going to take us from within. They don't have to fight a war with us. Well, that is what is happening right now. They are buying up all the United States.'' 
   George had it right. We have to be able to take care of our own people. I represent people in Wisconsin, not foreign nations. And taking care of people in Wisconsin means, first of all, guarantying them access to health care that they can afford, high-quality care that is delivered right close to home. And how can we do that? How can we afford to continue to pay for those costs when our jobs are being shipped overseas? 
   So, Mr. Speaker, as a close this evening, I would like everyone to begin to think differently in America. Health care is intimately tied up with our employment opportunities, with our jobs. We need higher wage jobs that will sustain America and provide living wages, a living wage that can afford health care. Health care is intimately involved with our jobs and also with our environment and the education of our children. You can't unwrap all of these problems. They are all stuck together. But the single greatest problem we face today is our health care crisis. And by submitting this bill for passage today, the No Discrimination Health in Insurance Act, I hope to lay the first brick in the new wall for the foundation of the House of Health Care. We have to begin to think differently in America, and hopefully that starts today.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, our Nation has faced many challenges in our history, and none more serious or deadly than our battle against violent extremists. Make no mistake, we must do whatever it takes to defend America and keep hostilities from our shores. We must be tough and we must be smart. We have the tough part right, and now more than ever we must be smart. 
   The bill now before the House asks the American people to give up our Fourth amendment rights--without firing a single shot--even when the facts reveal we already have laws to allow intelligence agencies to protect all of us. 
   The Senate-sponsored bills trades our Fourth amendment rights for a false promise of security. It pretends to offer our people the reassurance that the current Attorney General--a man few believe to be honorable or honest--will exercise good judgment in defending all of us. 
   Our Nation has lost faith in this administration's competence, and has lost faith in the ability of President Bush to understand and obey the rule of law. Having lost our faith in this President, we must not lose our constitutional rights as well. We must defend our Nation, and we can continue to do so under the rule of law.

   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor of this resolution, I rise in strong support of its passage. 
   Next week, on Veterans Day, our Nation will pause to honor the many sacrifices made by veterans who have served in the defense of our country. And I appreciate the attention of our House leadership that they have given to this resolution and to our veterans who have served with incredible honor, with incredible skill and courage. 
   H. Con. Res. 162 recognizes the value of their dedicated service and begins to address the economic sacrifice of veterans as they endure their economic pain. 
   Because we rely on a voluntary citizen Army, we are now more indebted to those who have foregone higher pay elsewhere in civilian employment, especially as the value of our United States dollar continues to decline. 
   As Congressman Murphy personally understands, our military has historically been underpaid. Service men and service women receive much less than they could earn in the private sector. And like my colleagues, I believe their pay must reflect their sacrifices. 
   This resolution calls upon Congress to fairly increase basic pay by 3.5 percent. We all understand that we must begin to pay all of our Nation's debts, and this resolution is a good first step in doing so.

   We've cut costs for higher education. We've increased veterans' benefits, and in Wisconsin, we saved SeniorCare, the best prescription drug plan in America. And yesterday, we passed legislation to guarantee access to health care for our elders and for those among us who need it most, our children.

Dan Nerad, the superintendent of the largest public school system in my district for the past 7 years, is leaving to assume a similar position in Madison, Wisconsin. 
   Dan began his career in Green Bay 33 years ago. He is known for his intelligence, for his integrity and for his candor. He tackled the toughest problems of our time in Wisconsin--school security and the achievement gap between minority and Caucasian students--while at the same time dealing with a shrinking financial resource. 
   While his leadership will be missed, he is to be congratulated for taking the next step in an already distinguished career. Green Bay's loss will almost certainly be Madison's gain. He leaves an indelible mark on our children, on our educators and on our community. And I wish him well.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, we must begin to think differently in America, because the path we are on now is morally unacceptable. More than 3,000 brave Americans have perished in Iraq and more than 650,000 Iraqi civilians are dead. President Bush's newest war proposal is not a complete and comprehensive plan, and more importantly, it is not based on realities on the ground and in the region. 
   The President believes that 20,000 additional U.S. troops will change the outcome in Iraq. He was wrong to invade Iraq, and he is wrong now. Instead of decreasing the violence, last night's proposal will increase the risks to everyone in Iraq and the surrounding region, and it will not bring an end to the Iraqi civil war. Clearly it was bad judgment to have invaded Iraq. It will be even worse judgment to remain.  
   Simply put, we do not belong in Iraq, and we are still headed in the wrong direction. We all support our troops, but we must not support the administration's policy of more of the same poor judgment. We must begin to withdraw our forces and allow the Iraqis to take control of their own future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Foreclosure Prevention Act on which would address today's crisis in the housing market and help many American families work out their financing to avoid foreclosure, although it comes a little bit too late for the gentleman I talked to in Green Bay an hour ago who will be losing his home. 
   As we are all aware, foreclosure rates have risen, Housing prices are declining, and too many families nationwide, including many veterans who served us with bravery, honor, and courage in Iraq and Afghanistan are overwhelmed with their monthly mortgage payments, many having fallen into the trap, the adjustable-rate mortgage trap. 
   For these reasons, I commend Chairman Frank for graciously including a provision I offered that would provide funding in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 for grants to be administered to the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for mortgage foreclosure and credit counseling for veterans recently returning from active duty. The mounting mortgage delinquencies and defaults pose a serious economic threat to our economy, to say nothing of what it does to affected families and their communities. 
   Preventing foreclosures for our veterans will benefit all communities, and more importantly, by providing additional counseling, resources to veterans, it will enhance their ability to make sound financial decisions during these challenging times. Our soldiers need our help now, and toward that end, I'm pleased that the Foreclosure Prevention Act would also assist returning soldiers to avoid foreclosure by lengthening the time a lender must wait before starting the foreclosure process from 3 months to 1 year following a soldier's return from military service. 
   This act is not a handout. It is a hand up. And I urge my colleagues to support passage of this very important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask all of us what kind of Nation are we when we neglect the needs of our senior citizens. 
   In the past 2 weeks, I have received over 15,000 cards from voters in Wisconsin, just like this one from Elaine in Peshtigo which reads: ``I am soon an 80-year-old woman and a widow. My husband and I farmed, and we certainly had hard times the first years. But the years now are harder for old people. Oil companies take a huge profit. The CEOs make a salary no man on Earth is worth. The pill companies are taking huge profits with no consideration for our old people. The people of my generation lived through the Depression, World War II and two more wars, and now, in our old age, we face other obstacles.'' 
   My friends, there is a better way of doing things in America, and by working together, we will find it with no patient left behind.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you very much for yielding. I must say that Mr. Welch has explained it quite clearly. If I could put it in just different words that I understand. Back home in Wisconsin, we speak a little different that you all do in Vermont. 
   We would say it this way. President Bush has done all by himself, all by himself, what the Germans and Japanese could not do in World War II. He has destroyed this country and everything, everything that he said he was, he is not. He is the opposite. He is not conservative, he wasn't compassionate. You cannot call it compassionate when the President and the Washington, DC, Republicans produce collateral damage like the family picture I show you here. 
   Now this could be Kimberly, Wisconsin, it could be West Palm Beach, Florida, it could be Denver, Colorado, it could be anywhere in Ohio, where a family has been dispossessed of their job and their hopes and their dreams. This is a hardworking family. This is the Wendel family. Don and his wife Ann. He worked at a paper mill for 30 years. And because of our trade deals that remain unenforced, unbalanced, and unfair, the Chinese paper that came into our domestic marketplace cut off the business opportunity for the Kimberly mill. I am talking about Kimberly-Clark, where it came from, in Kimberly, Wisconsin. 
   He lost his job. He lost his hope and his future. And he has to ask this essential question, as do every single voter this fall, every American right now has to ask themselves this question: Whose side are we on? 
   We are on the side of the Wendel family, whose been dispossessed. This is a picture of the middle class. And this is what I would call collateral damage. We are in an economic battle, an economic war. We have to get our act together, not just here in the House, but in the Senate and in the White House. We have to work together and have judgment, good judgment lead the way. It was poor judgment, after all, that took us into war, based on lies and deceptions, and it was poor economic decisions by this administration that led to the policy of borrow and spend and borrow and spend. I don't have to remind any of my colleagues what the first two letters are of borrow and spend. 
   We have got to this point in time. It may be dark. The lights aren't out yet. We have some ideas, we have got the energy, and we are on your side. We are here to help lead us to a brighter future. 
   I yield back my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Perlmutter. I couldn't agree with you more. It really begs the question about not just whose side we're on, but what are the lessons that we've been learning. 
   I have not been in politics. I was in student council in 1966, and now I'm in Congress. I was a physician. Still am. I had a nice medical practice, but I got involved in this line of work because we were headed in that wrong direction we've been describing. We have taken since 2007 in January a positive change. We've been making incremental, small, little changes. It is so frustrating having come from the world of business to the world of government where changes are so slow, but it's so necessary. One would think that the President took office to prove what government could not do, and it's really incumbent upon us to prove that good government could really make a positive difference in everybody's lives. 
   The two lessons I've learned since getting into this world of politics is that people will believe a lie if it's presented with great skill on television. People will believe a lie if it's presented over and over with great skill. The other lie is that--well, it's not really a lie. It's a lesson. Politicians will determine who lives and who dies. It's politicians here in this Chamber. It's politicians in the White House who will determine who has access to health care and who does not, who will determine who gets a great education and who does not, who will determine whether or not we truly become an energy independent Nation or if we do not or who will determine if we ever go to war again based on lies and deceptions. 
   That is why I emphasize the fact that we need in the White House today people with good judgment, people who can think things all the way through, someone who will sign a bill to guarantee access to 11 million children who are in need, someone who will sign that bill, not veto that bill. I'm referring to the change, to the positive change, that we really need. 
   When you talk, Mr. Welch, about the war in Iraq, does anyone question that that war was a war of choice, not of necessity? Does anyone believe that it had not something to do with oil? Has the price of oil gone down since we've occupied and have invaded Iraq? Not at all. Quite the contrary. 
   So what we have to do in this Chamber is to begin to find a way forward to become fiscally responsible and to stay true to our beliefs that we are also progressive-minded and that we really do care about the middle class. We need to resuscitate that middle class as soon as possible. In the next several days, that is why we are going to take up an energy independence bill, a comprehensive national strategy to become energy independent once again. That's what this Chamber has the responsibility of doing in a bipartisan way, and I look forward to doing that in the next several days. 
   Thank you, Mr. Welch, for bringing up the subject of war. 
   Again, as Mr. Perlmutter pointed out, it is our soldiers, the men and women who have volunteered to serve in our Armed Services, who are paying the price for our continued and seemingly endless occupation in Iraq. Those  are the soldiers who have covered our backs in battle, and we owe it to them to cover their backs when they return. 
   I yield to Mr. Klein from Florida.

   Mr. KAGEN. Would the gentleman yield? Thank you for yielding. 
   On that front, the single greatest fiscal economic challenge we are going to be facing is a health care crisis. It is the number one fiscal challenge for our budget in the Federal Government. It's also the major challenge of every business, be it small or large business. It also challenges city governments, whether it's a town or a county government and every family across America. And that is why I believe we have to begin to have a discussion about making a marriage between our Constitution and health care. 
   Now, if you read the Constitution, as I have, it doesn't say anywhere in here that we have a constitutional right to health care. But we do have a right that protects us against discrimination. We have to apply that right that guarantees us protection from discrimination to health care, to the health care industry, so that all insurance companies will lose their opportunity to discriminate against you on the basis of a pre-existing condition. If we don't stand up for our rights, we're going to lose them, every single one of them, every single one of them. 
   So I look forward in this session and the next, working with a President who understands that discrimination is taking place today in the health care industry. We must end discrimination and put it where it belongs, into our past.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because of a great change that is taking place in northeast Wisconsin, a change brought on by the failed economic policies of the current administration, an administration that doesn't care about people, rather, they care about corporate profits. What is taking place in Wisconsin is taking place across the middle part of this country. We are losing our jobs overseas. 
   The paper industry in Wisconsin is being decimated, and recently a paper mill closed. One of the families that lost their position was Bruce Van Zeeland, who writes, ``It turned our life upside down, working at one company for 28 years and having no other skills in this horrible job market. My wife is struggling to find a full-time job now. We cannot help out our three kids in college. We worry about losing our home.'' 
   This is the change that came about from this Republican dominated House for 12 years and the current administration. We do need a change in Washington, and the Van Zeelands need it now.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (UNFAIR TRADE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to present some of the stories from northeast Wisconsin, a region in the country known as ``Paper Valley.'' 
   We have, for over 150 years in Wisconsin, been the leaders in the paper industry, not just paper manufacturing, but paper research, designing new ways and new methods of manufacturing and using paper products all throughout the world. We have led the way because we've invested our educational system, our time and energy in developing the industry. And now, across the country, all the paper industry is imperilled because of unfair, unbalanced trade deals, and a trading partner that breaks the rules, and that is Communist China. 
   Recently, in November, the International Trade Commission ruled that there was illegal paper coming into the United States, but there was no damage, no damages to the paper industry here in these United States. Well, shortly thereafter, New Page Corporation closed the Niagara Paper Mill in Niagara, Wisconsin, displacing hundreds of workers who had been there for generations. 
   More recently, several days ago, in Kimberly, Wisconsin, the Kimberly Mill--and you've heard of Kimberly Clark, you've heard of Kleenex, you've heard of other paper products and Huggies and diapers--listen, Kimberly, the only mill that they've had, has been closed and shut down, shut down because of the illegal competition from Asian governments like both South Korea and China. 
   The decision by the International Trade Commission was that there were no damages. Well, I beg to differ. In my office, I have a scroll signed by nearly 5,000 people from Kimberly and the surrounding villages who have been damaged. They are real people with real damages. One of the families, the Van Zeelands, are here with me in picture form. Bruce and his wife Nancy have three children, Alicia, Scott and Courtney. And here is his statement which I read on the floor this morning, ``It turned our life upside down. Working at one company for 28 years and having no other skills to compete in this horrible job market. My wife is struggling to find a full-time job now. We cannot help out our three kids with college. We worry about losing our home.'' And he's not alone. There are hundreds of other workers and other families with real damages that the International Trade Commission may not have considered. 
   What about the family of Tom Sternhagen, who had worked for 29 years at the Kimberly mill? His wife Maureen, his son Ben and daughter Lexi, and here's what he has to say. ``Can't pay the mortgage. Can't pay the property taxes. Our son can't go to college. We have no more health insurance. Can't make car payments. This is nothing but corporate greed with no regard for human life.'' That is Tom Sternhagen.  
   These are the views of normal, hardworking people in northeast Wisconsin who are suffering because of unfair trade deals and an administration that will not allow the rule of law to take place. 
   The International Trade Commission got it wrong: There are real damages throughout Paper Valley and throughout northeast Wisconsin. 
   Now, what's it going to take? What's it going to take to wake up America? We've been bleeding our jobs overseas when instead we should be shipping our values overseas, not our jobs. As Niagara, Wisconsin goes, so goes our Nation. And as Kimberly goes, so goes our Nation as well. 
   It's time for us here in the House of Representatives to work together across party lines and make certain that we design balanced trade deals such that when a ship comes over from China with $50 million worth of goods and materials, they take back $50 million worth of goods and materials made by our hardworking Americans. 
   Look, given a level playing field, we can out-compete and out-work anybody. We are the most productive people ever on Earth. We have had a successful middle class only because of our work ethic and the fact that we've had fair trade deals, free trade. The CAFTA and NAFTA style trade deals are nothing more than a free giveaway of American jobs. 
   It's time for America to wake up. Yes, let's wake up together, let's roll up our sleeves, let's work together in this House and in this next election. Let's elect a President who can think things all the way through, someone who is on the side of the Van Zeeland family, someone who is on our side for a change.

   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, this is a great day for our Nation's children. This is a great day for our seniors and their doctors. For, today, we will begin the necessary process of guaranteeing access to affordable care for the people who need it most, our children and elders. 
   And this is a great day for the House of Representatives as well, for we are beginning to solve our Nation's most important domestic crisis, access to affordable health care for every citizen. The CHAMP Act begins to allow for the practice of medicine that really believes in prevention. We will finally provide dental and mental coverage for our kids. With this bill, we are being fiscally responsible and socially progressive, just like America; and I am proud to serve in a Congress that finally pays for its bills. 
   Today, we are shifting money away from overpaid insurance companies to benefit children and seniors. We are bringing down costs for the 80 percent of all Medicare patients who are now paying too much for their premiums. In my home State of Wisconsin, an additional 81,000 children will acquire coverage. 
   I was honored to work with the committee chairmen, Chairman Rangel and Chairman Dingell, to ensure that there will be an express lane to enroll kids who are already in similar programs and eliminate the late fee for those who signed up late who are in need. 
   People in America can see, the Democratic majority will leave ``No Patient Left Behind.''

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, in Wisconsin and throughout the Nation,  manufacturing has been the backbone of our economy and of our communities, but during the past decade, we've seen many of our jobs being shipped overseas, not because we are not hardworking and not because we are not producing high-quality products but, rather, because of unfair and unbalanced trade deals. 
   The free enterprise system depends upon working Americans having a competitive workforce and productive employees. These are vital to the success of every business be it large or small. 
   Congress will soon vote on an economic stimulus package that contains $500 million for worker and job training assistance. Included in that legislation is a piece that I had the opportunity to write, entitled the ``Incumbent Worker Development Act.'' This legislation will guarantee that States and Federal Governments work together to train our workers. 
   This is not a time for ideology. This is a time for action, and I encourage all of us to vote for this stimulus package.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Ellison, and thank you, Ms. Clarke. This is a very difficult hour to be with you. I cannot tell you how much it hurts me, how much it hurts the children of Wisconsin, of New York State, of Minnesota, and all the children throughout the country who don't know yet that their President has left them behind, that the President has turned away from children in need. 
   What we are talking about is the difference between seeing a physician and gaining access to good health and not. Those children that don't get health care don't get well. When you are sick in school, you cannot learn. You cannot progress. You cannot move up into the middle class. 
   This bill, the SCHIP bill, and the veto by this President, a President who no longer represents traditional American values, he does not represent our values, this is a stark contrast between the two parties today. It really asks the question, whose side are we on? I am a Democrat. I am proud to be a Democrat. We are on the side of people who are in need. It is the role of government, isn't it, to care for those who are in need? Not just Hubert Humphrey. It goes back 2,000, 5,000 years, into all of our cultures, into all of our religious beliefs, into all that we hold spiritually sacred. We must care for those who are in need. 
   The SCHIP bill has been lied about by many politicians. Some have said it's going to cover illegals. That's a lie. There are no illegal human beings, no illegal citizens covered in SCHIP. It does not cover rich people. Ninety percent of people that would be covered by the SCHIP bill have incomes below $41,000. Folks, the average cost of health care in this country is 12 to 14 grand per year. If you make $40,000, you can't afford health insurance today. You mentioned, Ms. Clarke, $3.50 a day. What are we spending in the religious civil war in Iraq, $400 million a day? $3.50 versus $400 million. The American people get it. 
   When I go back home to Wisconsin, I am just as frustrated as our electorate. People believe their elected officials are not listening to them. We are listening. We understand your frustration. We feel it in our heart, as well. This is a veto that must be overturned. 
   When I was running for Congress, when I left my medical practice, I left my medical practice because 30 percent of the time I would write a prescription, but my patients either couldn't afford the medication or it wasn't covered on the insurance company's list, or they simply couldn't get it. They didn't have the money. So I ran for Congress. 
   During my trails across the district, I had a 15-minute conversation set aside for a Native American activist. That conversation lasted 2 1/2 hours. It took me 2 weeks to recover. But she taught me that it is politicians who determine who lives and who dies. It is politicians, in this House, that will determine who has access to health care and who does not. It is politicians that will take us to war based on lies and deceptions. We are the people's voice here. 
   If you would allow me to take a moment, I would like to express the viewpoint of some of the people I represent. Chris Dion in Marinette wrote to me and said, ``I am a single person but can't afford medical insurance unless it has a very high deductible. Then it is still expensive. I have many medical problems and cancer runs in my family. But I can't afford tests or treatments because I don't meet requirements for free checkups.'' Her story is one of millions. 
   Forty-seven million don't have any coverage at all. The SCHIP bill makes fiscal sense. It is paid for. It doesn't raise taxes on anyone who isn't smoking. It is responsible. It is morally responsible to care for those who are in need. In my opinion, the President's veto of this bill is morally unacceptable not just to me, not just to me as a physician, but as a husband, as a father, as a Congressman. It is unacceptable to every citizen everywhere in this country who has a human heart. I think we have to work hard with our colleagues in a bipartisan manner to care for those who are in need. We can do it with the SCHIP bill that we created here in this House, the People's House.

   Mr. KAGEN. I am just as frustrated as you and the American people. Where are you going to run and hide on this vote? There will be no place to run and no place to hide. You have to show your cards. Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of physicians and nurses who want access to their patients and their patients who want access to their doctors and nurses? Whose side are you on? We do not sit in the boardrooms, we are not the CEOs of insurance companies, but we are representative of peoples' voices. 
   You quoted some Republican Senators. I will go back home again and quote someone who writes to me, Jean, from Appleton: ``What is it with this country? Health care for the rich and those in government; the rest can just die or try and live with broken bones and illness.'' Or Mary Anderson: ``Health care issues, affordability is destroying my family and our financial stability.'' 
   I agree with you, we have to do more. We have done our job. We have created a bill that is fiscally responsible, it is socially progressive, it is the morally acceptable thing to do. That bill went to the Senate. It came back without caring for our senior citizens. It got chopped off. 
   We have here before the House an opportunity in the next several days to have a discussion with the American people about what kind of Nation we are. What kind of Nation turns away from its children who are most in need? 
   Mr. Speaker, now let's just mention something so that people listening understand about the eligibility factor. If you have got a family income that's below 300 percent of the Federal poverty level, you will qualify for this SCHIP program. All of the resources in this program will go to the poorest, the poorest working families. These are the people that need a boost. These are the people that need a lift up. These are the people who need a humane Congress, a Senate and a House to move this bill back to the President. 
   Let's give President Bush another chance to think this one all the way through. My friend, my colleagues, many times I have asked myself: Are we really thinking these problems all the way through? Are we really using the best judgment? Because it really does matter who your mayor is, who your Congressman is, and it really does matter who the President, the next President is. Why? Because judgment, good judgment must be used in everything we are doing. Otherwise, it could be a catastrophe.

   Mr. KAGEN. The reality is that it takes doctors and nurses to get into the room to get health care done. If you don't have a doctor and a nurse in the room, you don't have health care. And to get a child into a room, you need a parent. That is why in Wisconsin, by expanding in this State grant money, the State of Wisconsin sought to increase the enrollment of those children who are eligible, and thereby they covered the mother of these children who are close to poverty. By mothers being covered, the enrollment went up. It went up because they brought their children in. 
   I have practiced medicine for over 30 years, and I will tell you, I never saw a kid in the office unless the mother or one of the caregivers was there. So if you are going to get a child to a doctor, you have to include, in my opinion, the parent. 
   But this overarching theme is really about values. When the President vetoed this bill, it was a reflection of his values. And how you and your homes spend your money, your hard-earned money, is a reflection of your family values. How our Nation spends its money is a reflection of our national values. And there I come back to the $3.50 a day for a child and the $400 million a day making war and occupying Iraq.

   Mr. KAGEN. I look at it as an investment. The children are our future. If we don't invest in our children's health, if we don't invest in their education, this Nation has no future. So we must make important decisions based on our values. We must invest in our children. 
   In Wisconsin, 95,000 children and 110,000 adults are covered by SCHIP. We could enroll an additional 37,800 children with the authorization with a President who will sign a bill instead of vetoing a bill. 
   I believe we need a President who will work with us in a bipartisan way, a real uniter so we can take that step forward and build a healthier Nation for all of us in these United States. I can't agree more with you. 
   This is not government-run health care; it is not even close. It is an investment in our next generation, the generation we are going to come to depend on as we age.

   Mr. KAGEN. Most people I know in Wisconsin are hardworking and they are just trying to get through the day, just like us. We are trying to get through the day and get our rest in. But this is a time for our country to raise up and ask questions, to find out about the conscience of America, and really ask the question about what kind of Nation we are and in which direction we are going to turn. 
   If we stay on this divisive path, this path of partisan politics, we are not going to be able to solve any of these complex problems we face, whether it is war and peace or health and disease. If we stay on the path that the President has put us on with his veto, it is an expensive path. He is asking our children and their caregivers and parents to take them to the emergency room and not to their doctor. The President is asking us to take a path not towards prevention, to prevent illness and to prevent the big bill that is coming, but he is taking us down the road that leads to an end we don't want to be on. It's a path we cannot afford to take. We have taken a path, a wrong path, that led us into Iraq. It may lead us into a recession yet to come that no American citizen can afford. It will at some point in time raise our taxes, depreciate the value of our dollar and create inflation in this country because we haven't paid for a dime of our involvement in Iraq yet. We borrowed the money from China, and it is our next generation, this generation of children that won't be healthy, that won't be working. 
   We understand it makes sense. If you are working, you earn money and you pay taxes. We can lower people's taxes by having a healthy generation of children. It is just that simple. If our Republican colleagues would understand, if it is just about money, we are going to save you money. Give our children, the children who are most in need, an opportunity to see their physicians and their nurse practitioners. Give them an opportunity to be healthy. They will get the education they need, and we will pay less in taxes and we will all be better off for it. 
   What can people do? The first thing they have to do is believe. People must truly believe there is hope. I do believe our class, our class of 2006 is America's hope. It is America's hope for a different direction, a positive change and a new direction. I think by our being here tonight, by staying overtime and having this conversation with one another, hopefully the American people are listening to it and they will begin to have faith and hope that there is going to be a positive change. 
   And I hope that the President is listening, if not to us, he should listen to the American people. I will share with you one other constituent's thoughts. Donna Killian: ``Our country desperately needs health care reform. In this very wealthy country, there should be no one denied good health care because of a lack of insurance or income. I, myself, am disabled and 54 years old. I am disabled due to excruciating, chronic pain all over my body. If something happened to my husband, then I would be uninsurable.'' 
   What kind of Nation are we when Donna has to be concerned about this, when every single American understands they could be next? Lose their insurance, get sick, and lose your house. 
   As I stand here tonight, as my colleagues know, I 
   respectfully declined my health care coverage when I came here. I wanted to make a statement that until each and every American has that same opportunity to make a selection of health care coverage, I didn't feel it was right for me to accept something that everyone back home was not also offered. 
   I think this Congress has to consider health care a crisis. It is a national nightmare. We should consider health care access more like hunger. If every Member of Congress was hungry, we would solve this problem in a week. If every single Member of Congress had no coverage, with the bills you can get in the emergency room or if you get cancer, we would solve this problem in several weeks. 
   Again, I come back to believing in hope. I do believe that we will have an opportunity to take this Nation in a different direction, a positive change. My only hope is that it happens sooner than later. But mark my words, it may not occur until we paint the White House door a different color, from red to blue.

   Mr. KAGEN. I want to thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, for sharing with the American people what's happening here in their House, the House of Representatives. 
   I would remind everyone here on the floor and at home that we are all in this together. As the poorest among us go, so go we all. We have an obligation to care for all those who are in need right here and right now, and by working together I'm absolutely convinced we have the opportunity to change America, but we can't do it without the people's help. 
   They should call their Representatives. They should e-mail and write, but bear in mind, we have writing that's slow mail. Send an e-mail. Call your local Congressperson. Express yourself. Your voice will be heard. 
   It is our duty to listen to the American people. That is exactly what we've been doing, and their voice has been heard tonight in the House of Representatives. We must stand up and fight for the health care for our children on whose future we depend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, this morning President Bush said ``no'' to 95,000 children in Wisconsin and to millions more across the Nation. His veto of the SCHIP bill is morally unacceptable. It is unacceptable to me as a father, as a husband, and as a physician. And to everyone living in Wisconsin and across this Nation who has a human heart. What kind of Nation are we when a President turns away a child in need? And what kind of Nation will we become if we remain on this partisan path? 
   My friends, this administration no longer represents our traditional American values, for no one anywhere in these United States believes we should abandon children in need. We need a President who believes in children and taking care of ordinary people and the needs of our children, our senior citizens, and the needs of America first. 
   Madam Speaker, today, right here and right now, we must begin to work together and build a better future for all of us, especially our children on whose future we depend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, before I begin my remarks, let me extend my heartfelt gratitude to Chairwoman Slaughter for her years of struggle to bring about this day and let everyone know that on this day, May 1 of 2008, we're beginning to apply our constitutional rights to protect us against discrimination to health care so that one day very soon, equal protection may mean equal treatment. 
   I rise today in strong support of the rule for H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, and the underlying legislation. 
   As a physician and a geneticist, I fully understand the critical need to prohibit discrimination based on an individual's genetic profile. Specifically, this bipartisan, Republican-supported and Democrat-supported bill would prohibit employers from using genetic screening results in hiring, in assigning, and promoting people at work. It would also bar insurers from making coverage choices or setting premiums based on results of such genetic testing. By establishing these protections, H.R. 493 will allow every citizen and their physicians to benefit and participate in the progress that gene therapies provide for all of us in early treatment and prevention of countless afflictions, while maintaining their essential insurance coverage. 
   And perhaps in the near future, I will be able to rise here on the House floor and ask that we support legislation to bring an end to all forms of discrimination in health care. And after all, our constitutional rights to protect us against discrimination should be applied to the area of health care throughout the industry, not just to genetic information, not just to one's skin color or one's skin chemistry or the content and structure of one's bones, but to everything in the human condition and every preexisting condition. Let's begin to put discrimination where it belongs: in the past. 
   We are moving very quickly out of this information age into a time when physicians will be able to diagnose and even treat your condition before you feel it. 
   In closing, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and vote in favor of this important and tremendously progressive bill.

   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you very much. But what we are talking about is not bricks and mortar. The buildings didn't fail. The windows didn't fail. The furnace didn't fail. It was a failure of leadership and, really, a failure of this administration. It adds yet another failure to the long list of failures. After all, this current administration, would you not agree, has failed to secure our Nation, our borders, our ports. It has failed to strengthen our middle class. It has failed even to educate our children. But, most importantly, for all the brave Americans who have put themselves in harm's way, this administration has cut and run from them at their military hospital, the Army hospital at Walter Reed. 
   It is a disgrace. And it is not about bricks and mortars; it is about failed leadership, something that this Congress, the 110th Congress, can turn around and will as we already have.

   Mr. KAGEN. Every physician, every nurse, everyone on the floor at Walter Reed is doing their personal best to take care of the soldiers, and they are getting great care.     
   But the thing I find extremely upsetting, on the night of the State of the Union address, my wife, who is a nurse, was in town. She is president of the social organization for the spouse's club of the freshmen class, both Democrats and Republican; and she went to Walter Reed on a fact-finding tour to see that the soldiers were getting all the care and all the prosthetic devices that they required. 
   Well, they gave her the company tour. They didn't give her a tour of Building 18. And come to find out, according to testimony revealed, that Lieutenant General Kevin Kiley knew about these conditions as far back as 2003, when one soldier reported that the conditions were extremely poor and he wasn't getting what he needed. 
   So I have the opinion, as a physician, and having years of experience of caring for thousands of military veterans, that if they had our back covered during conflict, we must not let them down. We have got to cover their back when they come home.

   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you very much, and thank you for being there to ask the tough questions. 
   What I think the American people have to understand is that there has been a positive change and a new direction in this country and in this 110th Congress. You are looking at two new Members of the Class of 2006. It is the class I call America's hope.     
   It is America's hope that we intend to represent. 
   But I think everyone watching tonight and everyone in America must really be asking themselves several questions: What are these people's values, and whose side are they on? Things have changed in the 110th. I think you measure a person's or an administration's values based upon how they spend their money or our money, and this administration was seeking to cut $3.8 billion from the health care of veterans. They were asking our veterans, who have put their lives on the line, to pay for the benefits they have already owned. Those are not the values of the people I represent in Wisconsin. I am sure they are not Arizona's values either. 
   And the other question: Whose side are we on? Well, the current administration is choosing to help the politically connected, private, inside contractors, not just in Iraq but here at home at Walter Reed, rather than the wounded who seek the best care possible. This administration, in my view, has chosen to help insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies rather than our hardworking families and the senior citizens that I take care of in Wisconsin who cannot afford their prescription medication. I don't believe the values of this administration reflect those of the American public, and that is why I think I got elected to this Congress, to bring a positive change. What you see at Walter Reed is a symptom of a bigger problem in the White House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to cosponsor legislation that will stop pollution from sewer overflows and preserve our clean water everywhere. 
   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act. This important legislation will authorize grants to municipalities and States to reduce combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows in our Nation's water supplies. 
   Everyone should be glad that we are ensuring clean water is a top priority, not just for our families but for our Nation and certainly for every citizen in Wisconsin. 
   I am pleased that this Congress is addressing this serious problem and this challenge that our Nation's water and sewerage infrastructure poses. This legislation, along with the other water bills offered later this week, will finally begin to update and repair the outdated and aging systems that have been ignored for far too long. 
   By adding this critical funding to the Clean Water Act, we will ensure the communities like those in my northeastern Wisconsin district, who would otherwise be unable to upgrade their aging sewer systems, will have the necessary funding to do so. 
   CSO and SSO overflows in the Great Lakes are a particularly serious impact on all the health of everyone living in our region.     
   Our environmental stability and the economic prosperity of the region depend upon clean water. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation that will aid communities and municipalities. In eliminating overflow pollution, it will create separate sewage and storm water flows. 
   I also wish to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Johnson for bringing this important legislation to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you for yielding, Congressman Hodes. It is an extreme pleasure for me to be with you this evening and with our Speaker BRALEY from Iowa. The American people have been posed a number of questions by you this evening. I think the most important question was posed to our generation many years ago by Bobby Kennedy on the evening of the assassination of Martin Luther King when he asked the country this question: What kind of Nation are we? And which direction shall we turn? 
   We were confronted several days ago with a 
   Presidential veto of children's health care called SCHIP. The State Children Health Insurance Plan, SCHIP, saves lives. SCHIP saves lives for children and for pregnant mothers. We have to do all we can to guarantee access to affordable care for everyone in our country. But first and foremost, what kind of Nation are we if we don't care for our children? 
   I have here a placard that gives us the SCHIP facts. People may have heard a number of things in the last several days about SCHIP, but these are the facts. SCHIP is a State-run private program. The States get grant money from the Federal Government to run their own programs. It focuses on the poorest working families in America, families that earn just above what would qualify for welfare or Medicaid health care coverage. It also provides $3.50 cost per child per day. Now, if you want to compare what you can do with your hard-earned tax dollars, you can invest $3.50 of your hard-earned tax money into the health care for children who need it most, and on 1 day we are currently spending $330 million to $400 million a day in the sands of Iraq. 
   Now, where I come from in northeast Wisconsin people are asking me this question: ``Doc, how can I get my country back? I want my country back.'' We need to create jobs here in America, not overseas. SCHIP fact Number 4, who is eligible? The poorest working people in America. People that are three times the Federal poverty rate, which is just under $58,000, $59,000 per year. Also, who is it going to cover? It is going to cover 10 million, 10.8 million, we hope, children who need access to their pediatricians, children who require their family practitioner to guide them and make them healthy. 
   If our children are not healthy, they can't learn in school. If they are unable to learn in school and progress with their education, what kind of future do they have? Our children, after all, are our own future. Our future depends on the good health of our children. 
   So these are the SCHIP facts that we are going to be taking about in the next several days. You will see more and more Congressmen and Congresswomen talking about health care for children. But I haven't seen in my medical practice over 30 years a single child in my examination room without a mother, a father, or a caregiver. 
   So we have to begin to broaden this discussion not just about children's health care, but access to health care for every citizen everywhere in these United States. So SCHIP is a proven program. I hold it against no one that it started out as a Republican program. It is a Republican-inspired private program administered by States with moneys appropriated through the Federal Government. It focuses on working families, the poorest among us, and focuses on putting children first. 
   It only involves U.S. citizens. If you are not a citizen, you are not a legal resident, you are not going to get these benefits that come with it. It is a private, private-run plan, private doctors, private health care plans, and children up to 19 years of age can be covered. 
   This is a program that works for kids. In my view, in the view of most people living throughout the United States and especially northeast Wisconsin, the President was being morally unresponsible. It is morally unacceptable to say ``no'' to our children. 
   I yield back my time for a few moments, to my good colleague from New Hampshire as we talk more about health care and its relationship to Iraq. Because the way I look at it, Iraq is a health care issue. They are using real bullets, real people are being killed, about 700,000 Iraqi civilians are dead, and they are not coming back. Thousands of our soldiers have given everything, have given their lives as they have served with courage, with honor and with incredible skill. We have done our job in Iraq. We have taken down Saddam. We have done everything the Iraqi Parliament needed us to do for them to help them in their religious civil war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you for yielding. One of the nice things about being in the majority is we have an opportunity now to have oversight, to ask questions seeking the truth about where our hard-earned tax dollars are being spent. 
   I have always believed and I believe everyone in Wisconsin believes that your family values are reflected in how and where you spend your money. The values of this administration, of this President, will be reflected in how and where he is attempting to direct us to spend our hard-earned dollars. 
   We have heard from you, Congressman Hodes, the voice of the administrator from the new Iraq, the freely elected government of Iraq. I would like to share with you now some of the words of people from my district who have concerns about money and their health and where we are going. 
   Albert from Crivitz writes, ``Without a job that pays a fair wage, I won't have money to pay for health care, gas, a war, Social Security or anything else.'' 
   Albert in Crivitz understands. He has to balance his checkbook every month and he can't spend money that he doesn't have. 
   Lloyd in Wisconsin, who I spoke with this evening before coming down to the floor, he is from Kaukauna, said, ``Do  something to help your senior citizens for health care and drug programs. Thank you.'' 
   When I spoke with him this evening, he went beyond his postcard to me to explain that he has two daughters who are retarded who are dependent upon him. And even though he is trying to retire, he is a retired paper worker in the paper industry and his wife has diabetes, he is having a hard time making it. And without the role of government, what kind of future would he and his daughters have? 
   From Waupaca, Dianne writes to me, ``We know numerous people over 50 who have lost their jobs so companies can cut health care and payroll costs, and cannot find any other work and no longer have health insurance.'' No health insurance for 4 years. 
   In speaking with Dianne's husband this evening, Ken, he explained that his son is shipping out on the 26th of this month to Iraq as a member of the Guard. He is a gunner on a Humvee. He is a college graduate, and he is making a sacrifice. 
   No one in this administration has asked the American people to sacrifice for this poor judgment of entering into the Iraqi civil war. But who is he really asking to pay the price? He is asking us to forgo health care for the poorest among us and for our Nation's children who are near poverty. That is a poor choice. It is poor judgment that got us into Iraq. But we have to stand up in this House, in this, the People's House, expressing citizens' points of view. It is their money, and that is who we represent. 
   From Appleton, Wisconsin, my hometown, Leroy and Lois: ``We are retired, over 80. We need drugs for high cholesterol, but the cost for this drug is extremely high. Also it would be great to have some alternative auto fuel.'' 
   These people in Appleton really get it. And they are listening tonight. I called them to tune in on C-SPAN, because we are expressing their views here this evening. 
   From Fremont, Wisconsin, Larry writes, ``My wife and I spend over $900 a month for drugs now. When we hit the doughnut hole, that is when we really will pay.'' In speaking with him tonight, his wife is in the doughnut hole. That is over a $2,400 hole, and their copay is $600 for their medications. 
   We have some values that we have to reflect here in the People's House. Where are we going to spend the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars--overseas, or here at home?     
   Bonnie from Biron, Wisconsin, writes, ``We need to start worrying about the people of U.S.A. before we worry about others in the world.'' 
   Robert from Green Bay, ``Iraq, bringing them home. If taxpayers can't get the same health insurance as Congress, at least get drug costs down to the VA amounts.'' 
   My friend, people in Wisconsin understand the deal they are being handed. My honorable friend, Congressman Hodes, you point to a chart that shows $330 million a day being spent in Iraq. I can build 10 brand new hospitals in Wisconsin with that amount of money. Each and every day, 10 hospitals in your State, Texas, California, Missouri, everywhere in these United States and that money is gone and it is not coming back.

   We agree with Linda, but we also believe in good government. And I believe good government can make a real difference in people's lives. That's why I left my medical practice to come to Congress to speak up for people who can't pay for their prescriptions.

   Mr. KAGEN. Being a songwriter and a singer yourself, I understand, you remember the song, ``There's a Hole in the Bucket.'' Well, when we came to Congress, we discovered there is a hole in the bucket. We feel, and I will just speak on behalf of myself, I feel just as frustrated as everyone back home that change can't happen fast enough, that we can't plug the leaks as fast as humanly possible. 
   We have not got the ability. I wasn't elected President; I was elected to be one of the 435 Members of Congress who express the people's view. We are not the administrators. Our job is to do oversight, to legislate, and to fund those things and place our values on the table and put our money where we believe the people best want it spent. 
   And people watching have to ask themselves: Whose side are we on? Are we on the side of large insurance companies? Are we on the side of no-bid contractors? 
   I am a Democrat. I am not on their side. I don't sit in the boardrooms. I sit and stand with you on the House floor speaking their voice. 
   All these issues come together. You cannot solve our situation in Iraq and health care and education and our environment and the safety and security of this Nation without talking about how we are going to spend our hard-earned money. It always requires money, and that's obvious. It is simple. Money is a problem solver. If you have a problem, you throw money at it and the problem should go away. Well, we are throwing money into Iraq and the problem isn't going away. 
   Here are the words from Tom and Sue from New London: ``Number one, 51 million people without health care is a disgrace. Number two, the war in Iraq is like Vietnam all over. Number three, outsourcing is unacceptable and morally wrong.'' Tom and Sue from New London understand. There is a connection between outsourcing by hiring people offshore, lower wages, lower tax base that we don't have the money to solve our problems here at home. 
   Vicki from Green Bay writes, ``Better medical care for poor seniors.'' 
   Well, SCHIP is not focused at seniors. It is focused first at our children who are most at risk, those with lower-income families. Those are the people I think we have to focus on first, and never think for a moment we are going to neglect our seniors, our military veterans and active military people who have served and put their lives on the line. They covered our back. It is time we cover theirs as well. 
   This is Kathleen from DePere: ``It is time for all Americans to have the same health care benefits as their representatives in Washington.'' 
   Well, Kathleen, you don't want my coverage because I respectfully declined the health care benefits here until everyone in my district and the State and the country is offered the same cafeteria menu of choices. I felt it was wrong. 
   Deb from Little Chute in my district. ``I want to see lower drug prices for everyone, not just seniors.'' 
   People back home get it, Congressman Hodes. It is not just about kids, but we have to start somewhere. If we can't stand up and say--what kind of Nation are we, that we would turn our back on those most in need, children from hardworking families, what kind of Nation are we? It is morally unacceptable for the President to have vetoed this bill. This bill is paid for, and it is paid for in a responsible manner. It is a good deal for the American taxpayer. It is a great deal for our future to invest in our children's care.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you for yielding. One of the lessons I learned when I entered the world of politics and politicians was that it's politicians that determine who will live and who will die. It was, after all, politicians that took us to war based on lies and deceptions, and it's politicians today who are preventing my patients, my constituents and those who are most in need from having access to their health care that they require to survive. It's politicians that are very important. 
   So our politicians I believe on every level, whether you're a mayor, an alderman, a county board person, a Governor, a President, our elected leaders must now, more than ever, have good judgment, and good judgment will yield good results. 
   Now, this bill isn't just paid for with SCHIP. It saves money. Instead of a low-income family taking their children with a strep throat to the emergency room, they will get to go to a doctor, and you know, I can share with you a scientific fact you already know, but sometimes people who point out the obvious are called geniuses. You know, a cataract never had a name on it like Republican or Democrat. Strep throat never had a name like Independent or Progressive or Republican. Human disease has no political affiliation. I have not asked my patients what political party they're in before we decide what's best for them. The motto is, the thematic idea is, do what is best for your patients if you're a physician. 
   Here in Congress we have to have that same mantra, that same idea: do what is best for our constituents. That's our duty. That's our job, but we have to have good judgment. 
   Now, the other thing I've discovered here, when I served in the Veterans Administration hospitals as a physician during my training days, we had a slogan that said, hey, wait a minute, if it makes sense, don't do it; it's the military. If you served in the Marines or the Army, you might have that same idea, wait a minute, if it makes sense, what are we doing it for? 
   But we have to now make sense of our judgments, especially with health care for our children. They are the ones most at risk. Early in life, the early development of the human brain, the first 5 years of development are so critical to the future health and psychology of that person. We have to invest in our children's health care. SCHIP is not perfect but it is the best way forward. It just makes too much common sense for many people. 
   I'm hoping that tonight people watching throughout America will understand, yeah, it does matter who my politician is, who my congressperson is. They should call and write their congressman and congresswoman today. Don't wait till tomorrow. This is far too important. 
   This is a matter literally of life and death. It's not just your pocketbook. We're talking about your neighbors, the people that live just down the street that don't have access to care that they require. 
   We can change it. I believe in good government. I know you do as well. I know people listening want good government. This is their opportunity to participate. We have shared their stories here tonight. It's their story, and it's their lives that we're attempting to improve. Their quality of life is on the line on the 18th of October. 
   This President has failed to listen to ordinary people, people from my district who are asking for access to their doctor, who are asking him to take a new and different direction away from Iraq and back after Osama bin Laden and his followers. 
   The President, who I believe is a good man, has poor judgment on this one, is listening to some people that are giving him bad advice. We'd like to work with the President. 
   The third lesson I've learned: One congressperson can't make a tremendous change, but they don't have to give up trying. What really matters here in our government is who's in the White House. I'm convinced, now more than ever, with this recent battle over health care for children that makes sense, that's paid for, that saves money, saves tax dollars, if we can't win over this President and the Republican Party on this argument, they don't deserve to be in the White House for a generation. Their judgment is ill, spoken like a physician, and no joke meant. 
   I cannot tell you how hard I took it when the 
   President said ``no'' to our children, to our Nation's children most in need. It's the most unkind act, other than taking us to war based on poor judgment and deception.

   Mr. KAGEN. I appreciate your sentiment, your energy, and I agree with everything that you have been saying, and I would ask another question of the American people, not just what kind of Nation are we, but this essential question that you will recognize. If not now, when? And if not you, then who? This moment does matter. 
   I am so grateful for our leadership in giving us this opportunity this week to have an ongoing conversation with constituents and voters and parents and children all across the country. We need to have a discussion about what kind of Nation we are and in which direction we're going to turn, shall we invest in the health of our children, those who are most in need, or shall we be unkind and immoral and turn away from them? I think most people would agree with us, that it's a great idea to be healthy and especially to invest in the health of our children.     
   In the State of Wisconsin, the SCHIP program under BadgerCare, what we call BadgerCare, 16,527 children are covered. We can enhance with this bill up to 37,000 additional children who have access to health care. My friends, if not now, when? And if not you, then who? You must contact your representative to make sure that he or she is speaking the way you want them to speak. 
   We have been listening to you all throughout our election and all throughout our careers, we will continue. Because a politician is someone who is looking forward to their next election. We are statesmen looking out for our next generation.

And what kind of President would turn more towards saving the profits of a corporation than the lives of our children? 
   The SCHIP bill is good for our Nation's health. It is good for our children. It is far more economical to have children be seen by their physicians in their doctor's offices than in the emergency room. It just makes sense. But sometimes I am coming to find here, if it makes sense, it may not happen while we have the President that we do. 
   I have been witnessing a great deal of misinformation about this bill. I have read every single page of the SCHIP bill, and I have heard the opposition in the minority speak up regarding with what I call misinformation. The fact is that this bill provides for children who are 19 years and under, and yet I have heard them say age 25. 
   I have read the bill and it says it is two times poverty, $41,000 of annual income, and yet I have heard them stand up and claim that it will cover people up to $83,000. That is misinformation. 
   I have heard them claim it is not really private health care but the slippery slope to socialized medicine. Well, we don't need socialized medicine in America. This is private health care. It is private doctors, private clinics and insurance companies, private hospitals providing the care that these children require. 
   It does not cover any illegal immigrants. It covers people who are here legally. So no more misinformation, no more lies. SCHIP is good for our children. It is good for our economy. It is good for our Nation's soul. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask everyone to understand that the people of Wisconsin sent me here because they feel the same as we all do. We want our country back. People all across Wisconsin are saying the same thing, they want their country back. They want a country that has a border they can see and defend, and they want a country that believes in providing access to affordable health care for all of our children, no matter their economic means. We must have this time to discuss SCHIP all across the Nation and answer the question: Whose side are we on and what kind of Nation are we?

   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, today is Tax Day and everyone in America is asking the question: Whose side are you on? 
   Well, I am on the side of Wisconsin taxpayers, and my record proves it. I have kept my word. 
   In September of 2006, I stated we should do two things: First, balance our Federal budget here in Washington like people do back home; and, second, to reduce taxes for middle class families. 
   We have kept our word. And like other Democrats, I voted to cut taxes and balance our Federal budget. We saved 62,000 households in the Eighth District of Wisconsin from paying the AMT tax; for tax deductions for health care expenses and property taxes; we voted to cut taxes for small businesses and S corporations; and we are trying to make mortgage payments deductible for everyone, whether you itemize or do not. 
   We also voted to close tax loopholes that encourage our jobs to be shipped overseas. We are on the side of the taxpayers. My record proves it. Today is Tax Day. Whose side is your representative on?

Madam Speaker, as we move closer to Memorial Day weekend and the summer months ahead, families in Wisconsin and across the country will be packing up their families to head off on vacation, like up north in Minocqua, Door County in Wisconsin. And once again, gas prices are hitting record highs. American families and  small businesses everywhere are bearing the full weight of the Bush administration's failure to enact a meaningful energy policy. 
   On Monday, the President announced his most recent attempt to do something, and once again it is another insufficient and inadequate solution. This failed attempt at energy policy is a placebo. It is a fake solution to a very serious problem. There is a better way of doing things, and it begins with energy efficiency, developing renewable energy resources and moving away from fossil fuels.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, we've been talking the last several weeks here in Congress about the SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Program. This is the SCHIP face I'd like to show America. Before I discuss with you in the next several minutes the SCHIP program, I'd like to show you the face of Kailee Meronek from Appleton. I represent her. She's not here to speak for herself, so I have the great honor and duty of speaking on her behalf. She has a younger sister who is 3 months of age, and a young mother who's earning $2.33 an hour at a restaurant. She qualifies for SCHIP. She has benefited from SCHIP; and because she is covered by this state-run program, she sees her doctor in the doctor's office and not in the emergency room. Kailee needs our help and she needs our support. She will some day have to pay for a war that is costing the American taxpayers $400 million a day. And yet we're not even paying for this war. The occupation of Iraq is being paid for by borrowed money from China that Kailee and her younger sister, Cassidy, will have to pay back some day. 
   The SCHIP program is a state-run program that's been very successful. We aim to reauthorize this program and expand its coverage to all children in America who are eligible. That's up to about 10.8 million to 11 million children who are the lowest income strata in the country. 
   The SCHIP program will focus on the working families who need the help the most. It will guarantee access to health care at the doctor's office, not at the expensive emergency room. If anyone listening thinks that SCHIP is not a good deal, you're going to spend much more money taking care of Kailee and her family at the emergency room than at the doctor. 
   SCHIP reduces your taxes. It cuts the cost of caring for families who are most in need. 
   How about the money? $3.50 a day. Kailee is not asking for that money; she deserves it. 
   What kind of Nation are we? What kind of Nation would turn their back on Kailee and Cassidy and their mother, Wendy? Not this America. 
   I want my country back. I want a country that still cares about people more than corporations. I want a country that respects its laws and obeys all of its laws, including signing statements. We don't need signing statements. We need someone in our offices in the administration who cares about people. 
   Kailee and her sister, Cassidy, need our help. I'm asking all Republicans, all Democrats, forget your party leadership. Forget your association with your party. Think about the people you represent, like this young girl. 
   We aim to cover 57,778 people in Wisconsin on the SCHIP program, and hope to expand it another 37,000. We do it in a fair way, in a way that's called pay-as-you-go, not like our occupation of Iraq. We're going to pay as we go. 
   I ask America tonight to put a human face on the SCHIP program. Help Kailee. Support Kailee, her sister and her family and everyone in this country who needs our help. 
   What kind of Nation are we? We'll find out on Thursday. America is listening. 
   My colleagues, Mr. Speaker, I ask you to support the SCHIP bill and override the Presidential veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Peterson and thank Ranking Member Goodlatte for allowing me to participate on a bipartisan committee, a committee whose example should be followed by the remainder of this Chamber. It has been a great pleasure for me to participate on this Agriculture Committee. 
   My home State of Wisconsin has been a leader on this issue of renewable energy. Why? Because we need an energy policy today that is not put together behind closed doors but out in the open, in a committee forum and here on the House floor. 
   Wisconsin has established its own renewable energy standard of 10 percent renewable by 2015, and judging by today's oil price that may reach $85 per barrel, it can't come too soon. 
   This resolution of 25x'25, which I'm a proud cosponsor of, indicates our Nation's desire to become energy independent. By declaring our intent to provide 25 percent of our Nation's energy from renewable sources by 2025, we're taking a critical step in securing the energy and environmental needs of our future generations. 
   As a member of the Ag Committee, I know the potential of our farms, the potential of our forests, especially in northern Wisconsin, and the potential of our working lands across the country. If we achieve the goals outlined in this resolution, we will not only provide for our Nation's energy requirements, but we'll also develop innovative industries and supply countless numbers of new jobs in this developing field of renewable energy and at the same time will continue to guarantee that we will all serve our Nation well as a leader in the world. 
   Madam Speaker, it is no surprise today that we need a new energy policy, and this is a great start to a great new beginning.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (OVERRIDE THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE SCHIP BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, last evening I introduced you to a young girl that I had the honor of representing in northeastern Wisconsin. This is 3-year-old Kailee Meronek. Kailee and her family live in a trailer home just north of Appleton, and she receives care only because the United States Congress passed a Republican-inspired bill called the SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Program. And through that program, funds were sent to Wisconsin, and we created in Wisconsin a program called BadgerCare. BadgerCare guarantees that nearly 57,000 citizens throughout the State have access to health care. And because they see their doctor in their doctor's office, the costs for their health care go down. They are not seen in the emergency room. They are seen in the doctor's office. 
   Kailee gets health care because of BadgerCare. But BadgerCare and SCHIP are in limbo. Their futures are in doubt. Why? Because this Congress is considering and will vote on Thursday morning whether or not to override President Bush's veto of this fundamentally important program that provides health care to millions of our children who are most in need across the country. The SCHIP bill, which was vetoed by the President, guarantees that our children, the children of our Nation, have access to health care at the physician's office. It focuses on  those who are among us that need us the most: our Nation's children. It is a private program because private doctors, private insurance plans, and private hospitals deliver the health care. It spends $3.50 per day for a child like Kailee. 
   But Kailee doesn't live alone. She lives in a family and in a community, and allow me now to introduce you to her mother and her new sister. This is Kailee's mother, Wendy, who is a food server. She's a waitress. And she earns $2.33 per hour and tips. She is working hard to support her family and lives with her husband, Keith. Keith takes care of the children while Wendy is working. And this young girl, Cassidy, is 3 months of age. Cassidy doesn't understand health care. She only knows that she gets hungry and she has her mother to care for her. 
   This country, our Nation, must decide what kind of a Nation we are and in which direction we are going to turn. In several days we will decide here in Congress whether or not to override a veto, which I believe to be morally unacceptable. We cannot say no to our Nation's children. We must accept the responsibility of caring for those who are most in need. 
   That is not just my point of view. This bill is supported by everyone who is involved in delivering health care in this country, the American Medical Association, the American Nursing Association, and more. The American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology; the American Academy of Family Practice; the Federation of American Hospitals; the American Hospital Association; Catholic Charities; the March of Dimes; Lutheran Services; the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops; and more and more. 
   Everyone understands that we as a Nation must care for our Nation's children first because if our children are healthy, they will be in school and be able to learn and gain the education that they require to compete in this global marketplace. But it all starts right here Thursday morning when this House must vote to override President Bush's veto. 
   I believe we are at a precipice here in our country. It is getting dark, but it's not dark yet. We have to stand up for those who are among us that need us the most. Please reconsider your votes. Our people, our children need us. Please reconsider your votes.

And this bill, voted on and supported by 103 Republicans in a bipartisan manner, will help to do just that. It will make it illegal for anyone to conspire to raise our price of gasoline.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule for the National Defense Authorization Act and the underlying legislation. 
   As Congress authorizes this critical funding for the defense of our Nation and its interests abroad, we also have an opportunity to make sure that the current nationwide mortgage housing situation does not adversely affect our veterans. 
   Current law provides some protections from bankruptcy and foreclosure for the men and women in uniform while serving in harm's way. But it does not provide for debt forgiveness or other relief from contractual obligations of servicemembers who have been called to active duty. 
   Given the frequency with which military homeowners are forced to move to different bases throughout the country and overseas, our brave service men and women should not have to worry about forestalling or even preventing mortgage foreclosure. 
   I commend Chairman Skelton and Mr. Hastings and ranking members for including provisions of a bill that I authored that calls upon the Secretary of Defense to establish a mortgage foreclosure and credit counseling program for members of the armed services and those who are returning from overseas. 
   Credit counseling is available from many sources, including State and local governmental agencies, but not all counseling services are the same or even legitimate. Providing veterans with credible information through the Department of Defense will enhance their ability to make sound financial decisions during difficult times and to provide assistance before a potential problem or crisis arises. 
   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support passage of the National Defense Authorization Act.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act. 
   While this critical legislation is replete with numerous provisions that would make a variety of necessary changes to the Coast Guard's operations, I would like to focus on the portion of the bill that would regulate ballast water, which is of particular importance to northeast Wisconsin. 
   As my constituents know, ballast water is an easy way for invasive species to enter the Great Lakes. These species quickly take root and displace native species to the detriment of local environments. 
   There are also serious economic consequences associated with attempting to manage and control these aquatic invaders. 
   In the Great Lakes, it is estimated that roughly $5 billion in damages has been caused by the zebra mussel; while the cost of lost native species may never be known. 
   Additionally, there is an enormous recreational cost associated with the loss of fish and wildlife in the Great Lakes, which account for nearly 22 percent of the world's fresh surface water. They are a tremendous and extraordinary natural resource that we cannot afford to harm. 
   I would like to commend Mr. Oberstar for his leadership on this issue, and for including in his manager's amendment the requirement that each vessel provide monthly reports on ballast operations. 
   This prerequisite will allow for greater transparency in ballast management, and will sanction early detection of invasive species. 
   I am also encouraged that H.R. 2830 permits alternative ballast management measures for recreational vessels. In establishing rules for recreational vessels, I hope the Secretary recognizes that local boaters and fishermen should not be subjected to unreasonable overregulation. 
   In closing, I would urge all my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.

   Forty-seven million citizens have no health care coverage at all, zero. And the costs for care are simply out of reach for everyone.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to share with you some of the stories of people that live in northeast Wisconsin. Northeast Wisconsin is a hardworking area where people work hard and play by the rules, and we expect to get compensated with a living wage, a wage that's necessary not just to educate ourselves but also our families. 
   In recent times, because of unfair trade policies and unfair trade agreements, particularly by the Asian corporate governments--let's just call it Communist China--we've witnessed the disappearance of many thousands of jobs, particularly in the paper industry. 
   Now, Wisconsin is an agricultural State, and one of the things that we do manufacture is paper. We grow trees; and after a generation, we harvest these trees and process them into paper. 
   You've heard about Kleenex. You've heard about Puffs, Huggies and many other paper products that have made your life much more valuable, much more convenient. But what's happened recently is a corporation has closed a paper mill in Niagara, taking away the livelihoods of hundreds and hundreds of workers who for over 100 years have worked in the Niagara Paper Mill to produce a valuable product. 
   More recently, in Kimberly, several days ago in Kimberly as in Kimberly-Clark, as in Kleenex, the Kimberly Paper Mill was closed, and when it shut down, it turned away hundreds and hundreds of people. In Kimberly, Little Chute, Combined Locks, Kaukauna, Appleton and the surrounding area of Darboy, these people who had been working hard no longer had their jobs.  
   So I wish to share with you tonight some of those families' stories and what this closure, what the stealing of American jobs means and also comes with a warning, a warning that I've been repeating for the last 6 months. As Niagara goes, so goes this Nation. And as Kimberly goes, so goes our country. 
   This is a photo I'm showing you of the Wendel family. This is Don Wendel who worked for 30 years in the Kimberly mill. His wife is Ann on the far left of the picture; his daughter, Kathleen; and the son is Anthony. And he said, ``Our daughter is a junior in high school and the thought of paying for college with this uncertain future is daunting. We also need to move to a larger home or add on to ours, and this now needs to be postponed indefinitely. We may have to sell our car we bought in March.'' 
   To sum it up, ``It is shocking and disheartening that the owners, instead of researching options to make this mill profitable, made such a quick decision to shut it down. It is causing such great devastation to so many families, and the entire Kimberly community.'' 
   He's not alone. There are hundreds of others, like Jerry Jansen who worked there for 41 years. His wife is Donna; children, Craig, Scott and Matt; and many grandchildren. What does he say about this impact of the closing of the mill? ``Just over 2 years left until I can collect Social Security. I don't know what I'm going to do until then. Nobody is going to hire someone my age.'' 
   To sum it up, ``I feel like my life has been sucked out of me.'' 
   For generations, his family has worked at that mill, not just his family but his in-laws as well. 
   Another family, Tom Kilsdonk has been there for 24 years. His wife, Jodi; his children, Karley, Camie, and Hannah. And he said, ``I have a major changes coming in a short period of time. Financial, emotional, social. My wife now works two jobs with no health care. It will not be enough.'' 
   To sum it up he said, ``I feel like someone blindfolded me, dropped me off in the middle of the forest and left me there. I am angry, frustrated and nervous.'' 
   Well, to Tom Kilsdonk, to the Jansen family, to the Wendel family, there's somebody listening, and I have the honor of representing you and coming here to Congress to share with my colleagues your story. Your story must be told not just across Wisconsin, the Midwest, but across the country. Your story is not alone. 
   These unfair and unbalanced trade deals and the failure of this administration to administer justice, to apply the law equally, and to allow the illegal dumping of Chinese paper and South Korean paper into our domestic marketplace has damaged not only your lives but your entire city and entire region. This is a matter of national security. It's called job security. It's something that we have to fight for each and every day here in Congress. 
   And, yes, it's true, there are three components to the cost of doing business in the paper industry: energy, raw materials, and labor. We have to work hard here in Congress together and join hands across the aisle to solve these complex problems of energy and the economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring to the country's attention something devastating that is happening in northeast Wisconsin. Our paper industry, the very industry that grew the jobs and grew the future of northeast Wisconsin, is being devastated because of unbalanced and unfair trade with Communist China, who continues to export illegal paper. 
   Just recently, a corporation called New Page closed the Kimberly Mill. You've heard of Kimberly-Clark and Kleenex. Well, Kimberly has had a mill since the 1890s. 
   I am going to present every morning and every evening the stories of real people and their real damages. And one of the families is Don Wendel and his wife, Ann, with their two children, Kathleen and Anthony. He worked there for 30 years. ``Our daughter is a junior in high school, and the thought of paying for college with this uncertain future is daunting. We may have to sell our car we bought in March. It is shocking and disheartening that the owners, instead of researching options to make this mill profitable, made a quick decision to shut it down. It's causing such great devastation for everyone in Kimberly and throughout the Fox Valley in northeast Wisconsin.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it's time we had balanced trade deals, not free trade.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (GAS PRICE RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, last month, I had the opportunity and the pleasure to work with the bipartisan majority of 221 Democrats and 103 Republicans, including the entire Wisconsin delegation, to pass the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act of 2008. This will in time decrease gas prices for everyone and will make certain that no one is able to manipulate oil prices and to control the free markets. 
   One year ago, crude oil was selling for $65 a barrel, and all of us were paying around $3 per gallon at the pump. We thought things were bad then. The cost per barrel for crude oil has more than doubled since last year while, this week, we are forced to pay in northeast Wisconsin over $4 per gallon. Yet this is taking place during a recession when demand for oil is down. This is not the way of the free marketplace. 
   Like you, I was more than a little surprised to learn that, during this past January of 2008, we had so much oil right here in the United States that American oil companies were exporting 335,000 barrels of diesel per day to Europe and to Mexico. Enough is enough. 
   The Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act that we passed would allow us to attack gas price manipulation, something we do not currently have the authority to do. It would authorize as well an antitrust task force within the Department of Justice to begin to root out any anticompetitive activities and price manipulation in the speculative and volatile futures markets. For the first time, it would instruct the Federal Government to evaluate the damaging effects of past oil company mergers and acquisitions and these effects that they have had on our families and on small businesses alike. 
   This is the first step in beginning to reestablish a free and open marketplace in the world's oil delivery, something that Teddy Roosevelt attempted in the early 1900s. 
   My friends, we are today no further advanced in establishing a free and open marketplace than we were in 1910, but all of us who live in Wisconsin are struggling to fill our tanks today, and we need relief as fast as possible, and that's why I and an overwhelming number of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle passed this act to begin to cut gas prices immediately, realizing it will require some time to reverse the failed energy policies of the recent past. If studies show we don't have enough oil refineries, then let's ask the question: Is it time that we build refineries on each side of the Rocky Mountains? 
   Skyrocketing gasoline prices are crippling family budgets and profits for small businesses everywhere in the country. Our long-term energy solutions, however, must include creating a new national energy policy, implementing provisions like those I fought to include in the new farm bill that will promote alternative sources of energy, leaving behind, once and for all, all of the losing ideas that we have had, namely, the drill-and-burn and drill-and-burn philosophy and policy of the Bush and Cheney administration. We cannot drill and burn our way out of this energy crisis. 
   Although there are many causes for today's record-high gas prices, we should not be afraid to take on specific steps today to ensure that prices for middle class families and small businesses come down. That is why we have given the Department of Justice these new tools to, in effect, put a cop back on the beat, making certain that those who are profiting from our pain at the pump will be held accountable. 
   With regard to the facts of the situation, let's look at some of the facts here, at the United States' oil facts. We, the people, have leased 42 million acres to oil companies, and of the 42 million acres, they are using 12 million. What else is going on? 
   Since the year 1980, we have lost over 200 refineries, decreasing our capability to produce more oil and diesel when we require it. What else is going on? 
   The outer banks. Everyone is talking about leasing the outer banks, the Outer Continental Shelf. Well, 82 percent of that property has already been leased, and they're not drilling. Some people have asked: Why aren't we drilling in ANWR? By drilling in ANWR, what are we going to get?  
   This is an old idea. If we took all of the oil out of ANWR, it would drop, economists say, the cost at the pump by one to two pennies per gallon, and that would take place 10 or 20 years from now. Furthermore, there is no guarantee whatsoever that the companies bringing the oil out of ANWR would deliver it to the United States citizens. It may go to Japan or to Europe or to the highest bidder. So ANWR and drilling, drilling and burning is not the solution. 
   What is going on in our marketplace? Recent investigations and testimony here in the House and in the Senate have shown that there is a concentration where pension funds are now beginning to invest more and more since the year 2000 into our commodities futures market. So it is now time to ask the question: Isn't it appropriate that we ask you, if you're buying oil, to take possession of what you buy?

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you for yielding, and thank you for carrying on for the first few minutes before I was able to attend. Our Committee on Transportation just ended its subcommittee meeting at 9:20 this evening where we were hearing some testimony about the possible merger between Delta and Northwest. And it was a very educational seminar, to say the least. 
   But it's still an example of how we are working hard to gain oversight over these mega mergers, and taking a look at big business and big insurance and big corporations and the big war machine that's now costing Americans millions and millions of dollars every day. 
   And if you like numbers, my friend, it's $14 million an hour that we're spending in Iraq instead of here at home. It's $338 million per day, $2.4 billion per week, and $10 to $12 billion per month that we have our hard-earned tax money going over to the sands of Iraq and not investing here at home in our own infrastructure, in our roads and our bridges, in our schools and in our social system. 
   Now, if you like numbers, and I like numbers, I've got a head for numbers. I'll give you the number 300, 200 and 13. 300 percent is the increase in the gasoline price since the current administration took office in 2001; three times as much as what you're paying at the pump as when they started. 
   Now, my friend, Mr. Ellison, the right honorable sir, mentioned Iraq and some Iraq tragedies. On Mother's Day I had the occasion, in Wisconsin, to dial up and wish a happy Mother's Day to a fallen soldier's mother, and I spoke  with Donna Opicka. She had lost her son, Dean. And in her words, quote, ``It's not working.'' 
   She's been against our involvement in Iraq from the start. She has two sons that are there. And we will always support our troops, but not a failed policy. And in her words, ``It's just not working.'' 
   They told us oil prices would go down. They've gone up 300 percent. 
   The Number 200, it's 200 percent, the increase in fuel oil that many people in Northeast Wisconsin rely on to heat their homes. And it was a long winter this year. 
   And what about the number 13? 13 percent increase in your cost for groceries. Your food went up 13 percent. 
   My friends, if the cost of our food went up 200 and 300 percent, we'd see a revolution in this country. And so earlier today we passed a farm bill that will fundamentally and dramatically change the way we're feeding ourselves. This farm bill determines what farmers will plant, what they're going to grow and, ultimately, what we're going to eat and what we're going to look like. 
   That farm bill had the overwhelming support of over 300 Members of Congress, and it's a very good example of how Congress really ought to work, in a bipartisan way, Republicans and Democrats together putting their minds together and working out a way in which we can feed not just our own families but continue to feed the world. 
   Now, as this increase in energy for food and energy for oil has gone skyrocketing, the food prices have held their own until recently, when the energy cost has crept into our food supply. 
   At the same time as these costs are going up, your income is going down. The median income went down 2 percent since 2001. So at the very same time that middle class Americans are having a hard time keeping their head above water with the escalation in the cost for energy, both food and oil, their income is not going up. 
   And so I think people watching tonight have to ask a fundamental question. Whose side are we on? Are we on the side of big business? Are we on the side of big insurance, big oil companies? I think not. We're not sitting in a boardroom. We're standing on the people's floor here in the House. And I'm very honored to work with my Class of 2006, the class I brand America's hope for a real positive and a new direction; not just in our farm policy, not just in our foreign policy, but our domestic policy as well, as we pay attention to and continue to work hard for the American people to give them a fair shake in our future. 
   And I yield back.

   Mr. KAGEN. Not the boats in my district, but median income might be $28,000 to $32,000 a year. 
   When I was home in northeast Wisconsin, I was at a diner, Tina's Roost, in Oconto. And I was meeting with some workers there, and I said, well, listen. We're about to take up this discussion about an economic stimulus package to revitalize our economy and get us out of this upcoming recession; and one of the city workers stood up and took apart some of the six layers of clothing because it was still pretty cold in northern Wisconsin, and he said, Kagen, look out the window. You can see it right there. The price of gas. You drop the price of gasoline, I have got more money in my pocket. And while you're at it, knock down my health care bills. Those are the two things we could do immediately to put more money in people's pockets. 
   But my response was very direct and very honest. We're working hard to do that, but it's hard to do it when you have a President who's an oil person and you have a vice president who's an oil person and a Secretary of State who is an oil person. So if you've got oil in the White House, it's hard to move it out until we look forward to that date in November when we get that real positive change that we really need. 
   So we can drive our economy, but we have to have an energy policy that makes sense, one that is designed in the open and not behind closed doors; an energy policy that will be fashioned towards renewable sources of energy, away from fossil fuels, and it has to make sense for our environment at the same time. 
   But fundamentally, people are like back home in Wisconsin. A lot of people are like turtles on their back. They just want to get back on their feet and get started. And that's what we did with the energy stimulus bill, and we're also doing that with this housing bill that we put forward, trying to find a pricing floor in the housing market.

   Mr. KAGEN. What we did the other day in terms of trying not to put more petrol into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to increase the supply. And the President said what we should be doing is increasing supply by drilling more. But there's a fallacy in that argument. There are thousands of acres available for drilling on public land, and they're not drilling. 
   So the fallacy is the price of oil is going to shoot up and up and up as long as we have fewer and fewer oil companies that are chasing down the oil. But we cannot drill our way out of this energy crisis. We can't drill and burn and drill and burn. We're going to end up choking on our own exhaust. We're going to inflate the temperature so much in this globe that we're going to melt not just the ice caps but our future at the same time. 
   So we need to have that energy policy that is not based on increasing supply but finding alternative sources of energy.

   Mr. KAGEN. We're doing that with the Department of Energy building because our Transportation Committee has decided that the energy building, the Department of Energy, should be led with some solar power. It's called future fitting. And if you future fit your home, put up solar cells, not to take it off the electrical grid but knock down your electric footprint, your carbon footprint, you will save much in your electric bill and also in terms of the CO  
   2 production in the atmosphere. 
   These are the little things that when they add up, when thousands of homes across the country begin to future fit their homes, we can gain a great deal of energy independence and stimulate the economy. People underestimate the millions of jobs that can be created by future fitting their home, and we have to help them out here in Congress to create that legislation to incentivize that.

   Mr. KAGEN. Let me put it in a different perspective, if you will allow me to. It's not about profits. I'm in favor of profits. We have a capitalistic marketplace. I'd like people to be profitable. It certainly beats the alternative of being negative in red ink. 
   But let me submit to you that the oil that we're pulling up out of the ground hasn't changed in millions of years. The gold we're mining out of these mines, it's the same gold as it has been for millions of years but it costs more. It costs more because the purchasing power of your United States dollar has declined. 
   So there's a decline, a reevaluation south of everything you own and everything you do. Every working man and woman today is earning money that has less purchasing power than before, and it's because of our failed economic policy of this administration and the Republican party, the philosophy of borrow and spend and borrow and spend. 
   You cannot borrow your way into national prosperity. You cannot spend your way into prosperity. We have to have a fiscally responsible and socially progressive House and Nation, and when we do that, when we reinstill these values, we'll begin to grow our way out of this current recession and restore some balance to our economy, wherein an oil company may not have to make that much money at the expense of every consumer who is struggling just to keep their head above water.

   Mr. KAGEN. Let me make a comment about that if I may, and many people would like to say, well, why can't government run itself like a business. And in one sense, we can because in business there are three questions you have to ask yourself: Will it work? Will it be profitable? And the third most important question is, is it the right thing to do? 
   These are the three questions we can ask ourselves as well here as we begin to fashion legislation. Will it really work? Is it going to have the outcomes that we hoped that it would, whether it's health care or a housing bill or a farm bill? Will it work? 
   Secondly, is it going to be profitable? Will it be something for generations to come? Seven generations forward will feel that was a good investment of your time and your natural and national resources? 
   And finally, is it the right thing to do? Is it the ethical thing to be doing?  
   These are the three questions that apply to business. These are the three questions I think apply to our government, and I'm happy to say what we've been working on here in the 110th Congress, all three of these questions have been asked and answered, and we're doing the right thing for America. We're really moving it in a very positive direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, as your Congressman, I'd like to share with you the difficult reality our Nation faces in the religious civil war in Iraq. The truth is things are bad in Iraq and getting worse--with no end in sight. 
   After 4 years of conflict, with more than 3,400 courageous American soldiers dead--and counting--with more than 650,000 civilians killed, and after spending billions and billions of our hard-earned tax dollars on private no-bid contractors, the Iraqi government is still not standing up to help themselves. 
   I was shocked to learn that 1/3 of the elected Iraqi government does not even live in Iraq--they live in London, England--even as our own children are being killed in their centuries-old religious civil war. And their parliament, well, in the middle of a war--they're about to take a 2-month vacation--even as our children continue to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
   Unfortunately, today's vote cannot, and will not, end this war, because we do not have enough democratic votes to overcome the president's veto. And make no mistake--Iraq is President Bush's war--and he is the only one, today, who can stop it. 
   The current commander of our forces in Iraq told Congress the civil war in Iraq cannot be won militarily--it can only end with a political solution, not a military one. 
   I have been working hard to find a way home for our troops, and I have supported every effort to improve the safety and readiness of our soldiers, to guarantee they receive expert medical care when they come home, to increase their pay, and to deploy our forces away from Iraq--and back after al Qaeda. But, the President vetoed, or threatened to veto, all of our attempts to support our troops. In my opinion, the President is unable to see and hear the realities on the ground in Iraq. Plainly put, Congress cannot follow a President with poor judgement--period. Enough is enough. 
   I have been listening to many Wisconsin veterans at the American Legion, the veterans of foreign wars, and to parents and grandparents of fallen soldiers. Military veterans from Appleton to Green Bay, from Ashwaubenon to Pulaski, and from Waupaca, Clintonville, Shawano and Marinette have shared their feelings with me. 
   Please, just for a moment, listen to their heartfelt thoughts: 
   ``We need to get our boys home.'' 
   ``We went in with not enough troops.'' 
   ``It is just like Vietnam.'' 
   ``This war can never be won--we don't belong there.'' 
   ``We all back our troops--but not this dumb policy.'' 
   ``Our President has a complete disregard for humanity.'' 
   ``We need a President who really believes in diplomacy.'' 
   ``The President will not listen to ordinary people, and he does not understand when he is wrong.'' 
   Today, I voted to support our troops by protecting them from a President who cannot understand reality. I support our troops, but not this failed policy. 
   Finally, allow me to share with you the pain of a grandmother whose grandson perished in Iraq: ``Oh, Steve. It is so hard to talk about. He was such a bright young man. He wanted a college education and was going to use the money he was being paid to go to school. 
   Where is this war getting us? We got Saddam. Let's bring our military home. 
   I have another grandson ready to go over to Iraq. Let the higher-ups send their kids to Iraq. I don't want to see it happen to anyone else. Enough is enough.'' 
   And remember this: The vote today was not about ending the Iraqi civil war. it was about supporting our troops by protecting them from a President who cannot understand reality. Congress cannot continue to give a loaded gun to a President with poor judgement. I will always support our troops, but not this failed policy. I believe there is a better way to do things in America. By working together, we will find it as we build a better and more secure nation for all of us. 
   Thank you for listening, and God Bless America.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, everywhere in Wisconsin, people are asking for help to cut the cost for gasoline and diesel fuels. People are having a tough time just keeping their heads above water, paying one out of four of their paychecks toward gas just to get to work. We must do everything possible to make certain gas and oil become more affordable. During the past year, I've been listening to everyone involved in the oil industry, and one thing is clear. Current oil prices are not explainable by normal marketplace forces of supply and demand. Why are gas prices so high? 
   Well, there are many reasons, including increased demand from China and India and the declining value of the dollar, but these reasons alone do not explain today's surging oil prices. 
   While ignoring cries for help from ordinary people, President Bush and Vice President Cheney--the two oil men in the White House--have been unwilling to investigate the anticompetitive activities of big oil companies and speculators in large investment banks. Their only response to the surge in oil prices has been to beg for more addictive oil from the Arabian kings in the Middle East, even though last year, as we emptied our pockets, Saudi Arabia enjoyed a windfall of $500 billion. 
   We cannot afford to follow the advice of the White House oil men and of their supporters. For, if we do, we will become not just bankrupt but a nation of beggars. 
   Aside from begging, the White House oil men also offered more of the same losing ideas that caused this mess in the first place: More drilling rights for Big Oil. Their old school drilling idea is shortsighted for it requires years--years, not weeks--to explore, pump, refine, and deliver gasoline and diesel fuels. We need gas price relief now, not next year. Here is how we get started. 
   First, we need leaders who will stand up to Big Oil and who will provide the necessary oversight to the oil markets to prevent speculators from manipulating prices for their own benefit. On June 23, just yesterday, an Oppenheimer equity research expert, Mr. Gyte, testified before an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, focusing on oil price manipulation. 
   In his words, ``I believe the surge in crude oil price, which more than doubled in the past 12 months, was mainly due to excessive speculation and not due to an unexpected shift in market fundamentals.'' 
   His testimony and that of others is that speculative manipulation in the oil futures market is real and that, by designing effective regulation of the oil markets, prices for oil may decline immediately, anywhere from $45 to $65 a barrel immediately, not in 10 years. 
   Based upon all of the information available today, the first and best choice for Congress is to prepare appropriate legislative and regulatory actions, which, according to experts, will drop prices dramatically in several weeks. 
   In addition to better oversight of the oil markets, Congress must begin to invest in the development of reliable and affordable energy resources. We can do this by continuing to drill for new oil on Federal lands already leased to American oil companies even as we invest in renewable sources of energy using solar, wind, geothermal, cellulosic, and biomass-based technologies. We must also ask: Is it time to build new and more modern nuclear sources of electricity? 
   By investing in these new renewable energy resources, we will create millions of new, higher waged jobs, and we will develop what we've been talking about--the green economy right here at home--as we become an energy independent Nation. 
   We cannot neglect again to mention the OPEC kingdoms, which have been manipulating both world oil prices and supplies for years. To push back against their illegal manipulation of the oil market, I sponsored and passed major legislation that will, in time, bust up the oil cartels and will reestablish a freely competitive marketplace to make prices reasonable once again for everyone. 
   What is it? What is it that my colleagues on the other side have against free markets? Simply put, we cannot continue to be held hostage by OPEC and by the manipulative partners in Big Oil. 
   The final piece to solving the surge in oil price is the declining value of the dollar. Here, you see a picture form of the dollar in 2000, when President Bush took office, declining by 38 percent in the last year. In several more months of this economic activity of borrow and spend, you will be able to take your dollar, paste it with some glue on an envelope and use it as a postage stamp. 
   Regretfully, as a direct result of President Bush's economic policy of borrow and spend, our money has lost its purchasing power. It simply doesn't stretch as far as it did before. As a direct result of dollar light, prices for everything have gone up, not just for gasoline but for a loaf of bread, for a gallon of milk and for everything we require just to survive: Our rent, our mortgage payments and our health care bills. 
   People are screaming, ``It's the dollar, stupid!'' 
   Prices for everything are up, but by working together, we can bring about a different economic policy, one different from borrow and spend. We're working hard to bring about the changes we need. By working together, we will become an energy independent Nation, and we will make available, affordable energy for all of us.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, kindly join me in honoring the memory of Naval Chief Petty Officer Patrick Wade from Manawa, Wisconsin, who perished in combat on July 17, 2007. 
   Pat Wade was a true American patriot. 
   While some people spend their time talking about what they think is wrong in the world, Chief Wade spent his time doing what he knew was right. Believing in personal sacrifice for the betterment of others, he made a selfless commitment to defend all of us. 
   Rear Admiral Michael Tillotson, deputy commander of the naval Expeditionary Combat Command on which Wade served said, ``Pat Wade gave his life saving lives. He was doing what he wanted.'' 
   It is difficult for most of us to comprehend such selflessness. Chief Wade's life was one of putting principle into practice. He wanted us to be not only better Americans, but better people. 
   Today, with this in mind, please join me in honoring his life of service.

   Let me point out where I and my Democratic colleagues stand: We stand with American farm families who plant, who grow and who harvest everything we eat. We stand with those most in need. We also support a strong nutrition program. We stand with our Nation's children, and are providing them with access to fresh fruits and vegetables. We stand with local agricultural businesses connecting local farmers to their communities to bring their products to market. And we stand for responsible reforms to our Nation's agriculture policy. 
   The question is simple: Whose side are you on? 
   We do not sit in the boardrooms. We do not represent corporations who take advantage of loopholes in our tax codes that even the Bush administration and the Treasury Department have said need to be plugged.

   Mr. KAGEN. I thank my colleague, and I appreciate your kind words and your passion and your introductory remarks about SCHIP, which in Wisconsin is under the name of BadgerCare. BadgerCare cares for about 57,000 Wisconsinites today. 
   Would the President change his mind and sign the bill we passed, by enacting SCHIP in Wisconsin, we could sign up an additional 37,000 children and perhaps their young mothers as well. This is a bill that will determine what kind of Nation we are and which direction we are going to turn. 
   It will also answer the question whose side are we on. Are we on the  side of special interests, the big insurance companies, or are we on the side of ordinary people, hardworking families that simply don't have enough money to purchase private insurance. 
   Ninety percent of the people in the SCHIP program across the country earn less than $41,000 a year. And I submit if you are making $41,000 every year, you don't have $12,000 or $14,000 to pay for private health insurance. This is a necessary program that will determine the life and the health of our children, on whose future we all depend.

   Mr. KAGEN. I would say it is a smokescreen, like many of the attempts of this administration to cloud the issues and kick up some smoke, to confuse the American people. 
   The State of New York asked for a waiver to cover those people under $83,000 of income. They were refused under the SCHIP program; but that refusal became a fact. The fact is that we have never enacted legislation that covers people above $41,000. $63,000. I think $60,000 will be the number now. But, look, this is about kids. Let's put a human face on this before we go any further. 
   This is a young girl. She is 3 years of age. She is Kailee Meronek. She lives in a trailer home with her 3-month-old sister; her mother, Wendy; and her father, Scott, who is a stay-at-home dad. Her mother, Wendy, makes $2.33 an hour working in a restaurant, plus tips. 
   They don't have the money to pay for insurance. They are covered by BadgerCare funded through SCHIP. This is the face of America. We cannot turn our backs on our Nation's children. They are our treasure.

   Mr. KAGEN. So let me review and see if I get this straight. 
   These funds come from the Federal Government in the grant form. It's capped in this expense. It goes to every State, and every State that we have in the Union fashions their own program, whether or not they choose to cover the mother of a child. 
   Listen, as a doctor, I have to tell you, in 30 years of practicing medicine, I have never seen a child in my examination room without the mother or a caregiver that was responsible for the children. So we, in Wisconsin, cover the parent, the mother, as well in order to increase the enrollment in this program. 
   This reauthorization of this SCHIP program, it's primary intent is not just to retain the 3.8 million children who are covered, but to expand it to all the children in the country who are already eligible and to expand it from 200 percent of Federal poverty level up to 300 percent. 
   So, if I understand the facts, the facts are these. It's a State-run private program. Poorest working families are the focus. It costs $3.50 a day per child to keep them covered, and we hope to cover 10.4, 10.8 million children across the country. So these are the facts as I understand them. Covers kids up to age 19; is that right? 
   And did you hear the same argument that I heard on this floor, that it might cover illegal aliens? Is that a fact?

   We present this bill. It's already a compromise. We passed a bill that cared not just for children but for our senior citizens on Medicare. Medicare beneficiaries, when we sent the bill to the Senate, would have gained what? At no additional co-pay, they would have preventive health care measures like mammograms, cancer screening, diabetic education coverage. But the Senate chopped off the health care additions for our senior citizens, said, no, this is a children's bill, and they sent us a bill that I felt was morally responsible. 
   This bill meets the needs of children. It's accepted by doctors, by insurance companies, by private hospitals. This bill is passable. This bill should not have been vetoed.

People in Wisconsin have been writing to me and sending me postcards and e-mails, and I'll just quote from a constituent from Appleton, What is it with this country? Health care for the rich and those in government? The rest of us can just die or try and live with broken bones and illness. 
   I think the American people are beginning to understand whose side we're on and where we need to be going in this country. We cannot allow this veto to stand. It's morally unacceptable. It's bad for our business. It's bad for the health of our Nation. 
   We know from our studies that children, if they're healthy, well-nourished in the first 5 years of life, it sets them up for good health for years to come. We know that the developing human mind in the first 5 years is beginning to jell and form neuronic structures and connections that will help them all throughout their days. 
   We have to be kind to our youth and our seniors as well. Of course, I would like the original version of this bill, but things in this place aren't always the way we like them. We did compromise. This is a compromise bill. It's one that makes sense and is good for our health.     
   We often tell ourselves that America is the greatest country on the Earth and it is the greatest country in history. Now it is time for us to live up to that expectation and to that level of greatness and protect our children, our children from age 0 to 5, they are forming, their brains are forming and they are going to develop attitudes and health characteristics that follow them their entire lives. We need to protect the least among us, those that are least able to defend themselves and protect themselves. We need to make sure that we give them the start in life that allow them to achieve great things and continue to lead our country into greatness, defend our liberty, to defend our ideas. And we start that with good health at the youngest age.

But I don't think that message of confusion is confusing anyone like Wendy and her 3-month-old baby Cassidy. Cassidy, the 3-month-old baby that she is holding, she doesn't understand health care. She doesn't think about having insurance. She is looking for her next meal. She is hoping that she has got someone there to support her, to help her out, to help lift her up through her early years, I am sure. And Wendy is working hard at $2.33 an hour plus tips. She is working hard. She needs a little lift, a little help along the way. 
   But I know that people in Northeast Wisconsin, because I've asked them: Look, I'm working for you. I'm your hired hand. Here is your hard-earned tax money. Where do you want me to spend your money, here at home on your children to guarantee that they are healthy, that they can see their own doctor, their own physician in their doctor's office and not in the emergency room?

   Mr. KAGEN. I don't want anyone to mistake my position on this. I am not in favor of government-run health care. We don't need socialized medicine in these United States. We do have a VA system that was in disarray until we got here. This class of 2006 helped to save our military veterans' health care. We helped to save our active military from a condition that was deplorable. Everything that the President has said he was, he is not. He was not conservative. He spent us into the drink. It is borrow and spend, and borrow and spend. 
   But this discussion, really, is about our Nation's children. It is really about where we are going as a Nation and what kind of Nation we really, really are. From your report of the recent poll, the American people get it. And we are resonant to their message. We are listening to their message. We have got the judgment. But, my friends, people of the country have to understand that Cassidy doesn't have a murmur of a prayer unless we get in the next several hours, by tomorrow when we vote on this bill, another 15 votes from our Republican side. We have got the Democratic votes. We need our Republican colleagues to come on over, to understand that this is not about partisanship. We cannot separate the politics and the policy. We have to put them together. They have to be in harmony for our children to get the health care that they so richly deserve. 
   I believe in my heart that with good people thinking this thing all the way through; one of the problems we have had in this country in the last several years, we have had an administration that in my opinion doesn't think things all the way through. You cannot say ``no'' to Cassidy; you cannot say ``no'' to Kailee and the millions of other children that need our support in the next several hours.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Walz, I thank you for yielding. And I'd like to share with you, my colleagues, one of the lessons I learned as I left my medical practice and entered the world of politics to become a candidate and now Congressperson here in Washington. 
   I used to think it was doctors and nurses that really determined who would live and who would die. But really, it's politicians like you and I. It's politicians that will determine whether or not Cassidy has access to health care that she requires. It's politicians that took us to war based on lies and deceptions. It's politicians that have to get over the fact that they're not going to get a political donation from a child. The children don't have a voice in this body. We have to stand up and speak for them. 
   One of those people, not a child, from Marinette, Wisconsin, wrote to me this: ``I'm a single person but I can't afford medical insurance unless it has a very high deductible, and then it's still expensive. I have many medical problems, and cancer runs in my family, but I can't afford tests or treatments because I don't meet requirements for free checkups.'' 
   You know, my friends, it's not just about children. This bill is focusing on the health needs of our children. 
   Later in this session, and next session, we will also take up the cause to guarantee access to everyone. Every citizen in this country deserves the right to see their doctor, their doctor when they need it. And I believe, in my heart, that we'll come around to get these 15 votes to override this veto and begin to change America. 
   We have to begin to think differently in this country and solve our problems by getting together, by working together and building a better future for everyone. It has to start tomorrow, in my opinion, and the opinion of many people throughout the country. It has to start now, right here and right now by caring for those who are most in need, our Nation's children, on whose future we all depend.

   Mr. KAGEN. Well, when an attorney asks me a question, I have to give a short answer, yes. You're right. In more detail, and quite seriously, every study that's ever been performed has proven that preventive 
   health care, that disease management, saves money and saves lives. In diabetes it saves limbs. If you have a diabetic that is more under control, with their glucose maintained within a normal range, you gain longer life, less kidney failure, less heart disease, and your limbs, the circulation in your limbs, your lower extremities, in particular, are maintained. Diabetes is one example. In asthma it's yet another. 
   Several years ago, 5,000-some children and adults would die from asthma attacks in this country, and with a disease management program, we've reduced the hospitalization rate of children with asthma. 
   Asthma is the number one cause of hospitalization for children. Asthma is a very common illness today. It's in epidemic proportion in our major cities. Where, in our major cities? Well, there's lower poverty rates in our lower cities. And it is our Nation's children who are in low-income stratas that are developing allergy and asthma much more frequently. They need preventive health care. It saves money and it saves lives. 
   And to think of it a little differently, we can lower the taxes of every town, of every city, of every State in this country by having children that are healthy. By investing in the health of our children, we can lower people's taxes. This just hasn't sunk in yet. It will some day, if we fail to cover our children's health care.

   Mr. KAGEN. Let me share with you just one such story of a patient of mine; actually, her children were my patients, and Jenny was a single mom with two young asthmatic children. And they were in my office by referral from their physician, and I made a diagnosis. I wrote some prescriptions for each child. I said, ``Hey, I'll see you in a month, and they'll be doing fine. They'll be back in school. They'll get the education they need. They'll be healthy.'' 
   A month later she came back in with her children and these children were still wheezing. You know me pretty well; I'm right to the point. I said, ``Well, you know, Jenny, this medicine works pretty good if you put it in their mouths.'' And she was sitting next to me and she took up her purse and opened it up and took out the very same prescriptions I had given her a month earlier and put them on my counter. And she said, ``Well, Dr. Kagen, I don't have the money to put it in their mouths. I took your prescriptions that you gave me to the pharmacy. I stood at the counter. I could see the medicine, but I couldn't afford to put it in their mouths. What are you going to do about this? How can you help me? How can you help me?'' 
   Well, I stood up and said that's it. I've got to run for Congress. I can't change health care by becoming mayor of Appleton, Wisconsin. I can't change health care by going to be a Governor in the State House because we can't fix health care. This is a national crisis. You can't fix it State by State. Insurance companies are hiding behind State lines.  
   So I came here to work with you. As you all came here, so did I, to bring our country back to the basics. We have to get back to the basics in this country. And I'll just echo, not just what my patients have been telling me, but everybody along the parade routes, everybody I meet at the grocery store, everywhere I go, people say this: ``Hey, Kagen, I want my country back.'' They don't just mean a border that they can see. They don't just mean having a President that will obey the rule of law. They mean they want their morals back. They want their standing, their country to stand up tall and say we care about our children and we're willing to invest in their future.     
   This is Jenny's story, and I bring it to you and I share it with the Nation. We cannot turn our back. We cannot say no to Jenny. We cannot say no to Wendy and her children. They are working hard. These are hardworking people. The 47 million people that don't have health insurance today, two-thirds of them are hardworking people. They simply don't have the money to pay an insurance company for what benefits they may or may not get if they have insurance. 
   But this bill just makes sense. It's good for our Nation's health. It's good for our business. It's paid for. It's pay-as-you-go. Where do you want to spend your money if not on your children and their future?

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Chairman, in the last Congress the House approved a  water resources bill that included language to modify the navigation channel for the Fox River in Wisconsin. This provision, which was inserted by my predecessor, would have modified part of the navigational channel from 150 feet wide to 75 feet and from an authorized depth of 18 feet to 6 feet. However, the Congress adjourned and the work never was completed. 
   This year I requested that this language not be included in the water resources bill because of my concern that it might impair the navigability of the Fox River and the potential for future commerce. It is my understanding that a 9-foot authorization depth is considered the minimal depth for a navigational channel to safely handle barge traffic. 
   I would like to work with the Congress, with the chairman in conference to ensure that whatever language is included in the conference agreement, it will not adversely impact the navigability of the Fox River and will accomplish the goals of a safe cleanup of the Fox River.

   Mr. KAGEN. Well, I thank you very much for the kind introduction. And I would say the diagnosis looks good. We've got a positive change and a new direction for the country. We are headed in the right direction. 
   What have we done? We have brought back fiscal responsibility, and we are socially progressive and responsible as well. 
   Now, listening this evening back in my hometown of Appleton, Wisconsin, is my mother. I won't tell you how old she is, but I will tell you she does need affordable prescription drug coverage. 
   In Wisconsin, we had this thing called SeniorCare. It was group purchasing, where we knocked down the cost of prescription drugs tremendously, saved the Federal tax dollars, millions and millions of dollars. We had affordable prescription drug coverage that has been terminated by this administration. Now, my mother's medications were about $310 off of SeniorCare, and on it: $89. Same pharmacy, same pills, same manufacturers. It proves this point: when you negotiate, you can get a better deal. When you have a larger purchasing pool or a  larger insurance pool, you can get that better deal. 
   So I think the diagnosis tonight is, it's looking good; the future is looking fine. I am glad that my colleague from Minnesota is here tonight to lead us in that new direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (THE ACCOUNTABILITY CONGRESS: THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. I don't have to remind anyone here that if you don't have your health, you don't have anything. If you do serve in harm's way, if you are brave and honorable and serve, as many thousands and thousands have done. From my district in northeast Wisconsin, 20,034 brave Americans, men and women, served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. And when we passed the supplemental bill we voted to support our troops before, during, and, very importantly, after being in harm's way. We stood up to our responsibility. They covered our back. Now it is time we should cover theirs. 
   It is not just the veterans that need help. Our senior citizens, they can't afford their prescription drugs. I came to Congress because one time in three when I would write a prescription in my practice, my patients could not afford the medication. It wouldn't be on the list, their insurance company wouldn't cover it, and they went without. And today in America, people listening here tonight are asking this Congress, the 110th, to stand up to the drug companies and to the health insurance companies and get the job done. 
   I think if I stand back a little bit and give a bigger picture to what is going on in the 110th Congress, take a look at the class of 2006, our class, which I consider America's hope, what is the difference between what we are doing and the previous Congress? We are listening to the people and we are speaking out on their behalf. They can't be here tonight, but their voice is being heard. 
   The other difference is judgment. I believe it was poor judgment that took us into Iraq. It was poor judgment in the administration that prevents our people from having affordable prescription drugs and affordable insurance. One of the biggest comedies here in America is the 47 million people who do not have any health insurance at all. And what they haven't figured out is they are paying for everybody's health costs because they get to pay the real bill, the top-dollar bill. They don't get a discount at all. So we have to change things in America and move where we can afford the prescription drugs, where we can afford to have insurance coverage for everyone. 
   But this 110th Congress, when you talk, Congressman Ellison, about security, we also passed a bill, H.R. 327, to help prevent suicide in veterans. Now, in my district that will help 64,000 veterans in northeast Wisconsin alone. 
   We also enacted the 9/11 Commission on Homeland Security recommendations, H.R. 1. That will help 245 police and fire departments throughout my district. 
   We also passed a bill, H.R. 4, that would require the Secretary of Health to negotiate for lower prices for our seniors for their prescription drugs. In my district alone, that helps 68,000 senior citizens, if only the Senate would put that language in and if only the HHS Secretary would be so kind as to use his buying group to negotiate for lower drugs. 
   I think you can look for positive movement from the 110th Congress. We are not afraid to back down from any interest that harms those that we serve.

   Mr. KAGEN. Well, I would say, first of all, thanks to Congressman Klein for pointing the way forward about becoming an energy independent Nation. In a bipartisan statement, I will tell you Republicans can grow corn just as good as the Democrats, but we cannot grow our way out of this energy crisis. It will take technology and innovation to get off of dependence on foreign sources of oil. 
   But our families and our children are really at risk of this new economy that we have. We really have to get back to the basics in America. 
   It is really amazing that it is the Democrats that are the fiscally responsible party here when you think about it. Think about the old laborers. We are the fiscally responsible party. We do not believe in borrow and spend. So there are four deficits in America that I will point out tonight to you and have you respond to. 
   The first deficit is a savings deficit. Our families are not saving any money. For the first time since the Great Depression, 1933, we had a negative savings rate last year. 
   Second deficit we had is a budget deficit. Last year, our budget deficit was over $250 billion, and if you throw in the $175 billion that we credited from Social Security, it is over $400 billion on every citizen's head. Every working man and woman has a Federal deficit of $425,000. 
   The third deficit is our balance of trade deficit. China has an advantage on us or, shall I say, Communist China where their government will invest illegally in corporations, and that puts every manufacturer in this country at a competitive disadvantage by 30 percent right out of the box. 
   The fourth deficit we had until last November was a deficit of leadership, leadership that would stand up, put their foot down and say there is a better way of doing things. 
   I think you will find our Class of 2006 will work together with all parties to fashion a better future forward. By working together, we will build a better future and a better Nation for everyone and every man, woman and child in this country.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, whose side are we on? The Hard Working people in northeast Wisconsin want to know. 
   This measure is not difficult to understand--someone has to pay the bills, and democrats believe in paying-as-we-go, and we do want to pass off our bills to the next generation. 
   The democratic leadership of the house has promised to keep their word to the American people by remaining fiscally responsible and socially progressive. 
   All of us should play by the same rules, and that means everyone should pay their fair share, including hedge fund managers--who have managed to pass the buck to the middle class time and time again. 
   Enough is enough. Let's just tell it like it is. 
   This bill cuts taxes for the middle class: property tax relief for Wisconsin homeowners; tax deductions of $4,000 for college tuition; helps small businesses by continuing the tax credits for research and development. 
   People in northeast Wisconsin need to hear that this bill will benefit 62,000 households who would otherwise if fall into the AMT tax trap. 
   This bill delivers. It finally gives the American middle class a tax cut. 
   My friends, whose side are you on? 
   I urge you to join me by standing up for taxpayers in the middle class, not only in Wisconsin, but across America. 
   It is time we deliver tax cuts to the little guys.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, all across America and Wisconsin, people are demanding lower gas prices and affordable health care, not more debt. 
   In recent weeks, our Nation has experienced a dramatic decline in home values. And when our home values decline and disappear, so does the tax revenue in every town, in every county, in every State of the Union. 
   Our very way of life is now at risk due to this administration's continued economic policy of borrow and spend, and last weekend the administration forced us to swallow a minnow with worms by nationalizing the debt of financial institutions, guaranteeing their debts will be paid by American taxpayers. Whose side are they on? Taxpayers invested in their own homes, not in insider Wall Street deals. 
   This administration is in bed with big banks, big insurance, and Big Oil, and businesses who are shipping our jobs overseas. If this administration was on the side of taxpayers, what would they do? They would cut the price of gasoline. Wisconsin wants lower gas prices, not more debt.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, in northeast Wisconsin last Tuesday, prices for regular gasoline hit $3.13 per gallon, 37 cents higher than a month ago, and they have doubled since President Bush took office. And what is worse, the price of gasoline rose even as the price of crude oil fell. 
   Yet the Federal Trade Commission has yet to investigate or punish anyone for price gouging. This is unacceptable. The FTC has a duty to investigate unfair trade practices. 
   H.R. 1252, the Emergency Price Gouging Prevention Act, gives the FTC explicit authority to investigate and punish energy price manipulation at each and every stage along the way. It brings greater transparency to oil and gas markets and forces offenders to pay penalties to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1252. It will protect consumers from unreasonable escalations in gasoline prices. There is a better way to do things in America. Let's get started today.

   Mr. KAGEN. Mr. Speaker, health care costs in this country are impossible for everyone. For small businesses, for local, State and Federal governments, the uninsured, for working families, and most especially for our senior citizens. 
   As a physician, I see and feel this crisis every single day. Today in America the real price of a pill is whatever they can get. My patients and my constituents want to know the price of a pill before they swallow it, and they would prefer to pay less rather than more. 
   H.R. 4 will allow our government, ``We, the People,'' to negotiate more affordable prices for the necessary prescription drugs our seniors require. Our health care crisis that we all are facing blurs the lines between Republicans and Democrats. 
   Allow me, please, to share with you the comments of one of my constituents, a Republican, Dorey Hoffman from Appleton, when she says: ``When I went to receive cancer treatment, I saw this at the reception's desk at the cancer center. I thought of you being the voice for all of us and of course all the cancer patients. We all need someone to help us in our everyday lives.'' 
   Please join with me in support of H.R. 4 and help Dorey and millions of other senior citizens.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you very much, Congressman Michaud. I certainly appreciate being with you this evening, especially after an enlightening hour of finding out that really they weren't borrowing and spending money. 
   But, indeed, this is the class of 2006. We were elected to take a positive change in a new direction. We are not the party of borrow and spend and borrow and spend. Because as you all know, the first two letters of borrow and spend are B and S. We are here this evening to talk with you about our trade policies. Indeed, our foreign trade with China has become entirely a negative number. 
   In this brief slide, the 2006 trade deficit will show you that the United States is losing. We have lost $233 billion a year in 2006. In the first 2001 numbers, $83 billion deficit has mushroomed to $233 billion. 
   In 2006, China ranked as the fourth largest export market for the United States and the second largest import market. They are our trading partner. We have had the American century, and now we are moving into what will become the Chinese century. But we should be ordered in the rule of law, and unfortunately for us here in the United States, we suffer because they are not following all of the laws. 
   In a recent article in The New York Times, it reads in part that the Chinese's real advantage results from subsidies. They include government grants for modernization, low-cost loans, debt forgiveness, tax breaks for export or businesses and subsidies for suppliers of wood and pulp, something we are keenly aware of in Wisconsin, in my district, which used to be known as Paper Valley. 
   According to government data available from the Chinese government themselves, more than 70,000 illegal seizures occurred of private property, of land in 2004. In 2003, the Chinese admit that 168,000 occurrences of seizures took place.     
   Well, this is what happens in a Communist country, and it is to their advantage. 
   The subsidies: According to our own U.S. Trade Representative, ``The Chinese subsidies at issue are widely available and offer significant benefits, particularly through income and value added tax breaks. They make it harder for U.S. products to compete with Chinese products, not only in the U.S. and Chinese markets but in any market in the world. They accomplish this by providing a competitive advantage to a wide range of Chinese exports, including, for example, various steel products, wood products, such as hardwood, plywood and paper products, and by providing incentives for Chinese firms to purchase domestic products instead of those from the United States.'' 
   United States' manufacturers and exporters are suffering because there is another trade partner of ours that is not following the rules. Indeed, 15 to 20 percent of all products made in China are counterfeit materials. They need to follow the rules. 
   On this slide is a measure of their unfair trade. There are three things primarily that China is not complying with: currency manipulation, their yuan is below where market prices would bear the price; illegal subsidies; and illegal grants, grants given to companies that have no intention of paying them back. And what can we do about this? We really need balance in our trade deals. We don't need free trade; we need fair trade. 
   How do we fix an unfair trade deal? We need new leadership in the administration. We need a President and an administration that is interested in fair trade. And what must we do? We must establish fair trade and export our values, not our jobs. After all, if we don't make anything in America, we simply won't have anything.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, my name is Dr. STEVE KAGEN. I am from Appleton, Wisconsin, and during the past 30 years I have cared for thousands of military veterans as their physician. 
   The resolution under consideration today and voted on tomorrow will answer these questions: What kind of Nation are we? In which direction shall we move? During these past several days we have all benefited from listening to hundreds of points of view from our elected representatives from every region of this great country on our ongoing involvement in Iraq. 
   During these past several months, I have been listening to the people who sent me here from northeast Wisconsin, people a lot like you, fiscally responsible and socially progressive, the citizens of northeast Wisconsin. 
   People in Wisconsin, like many elsewhere, voted for a positive change and a new direction. The new congressional class of 2006 has given us hope again. We are indeed not just in name but in spirit America's hope, and I am proud to be associated with these talented individuals. 
   I rise today in support of our troops and their families and to encourage all of you to support this resolution. For it is the first step in bringing an end to our costly involvement in a senseless civil war between the Sunni and Shiite people. 
   Like every American, I strongly support our troops, but I cannot support the President's poor judgment in promoting violence instead of diplomacy. The President has been wrong in every decision he has made in Iraq. 
   Indeed, on four separate occasions, prior escalations have failed. And his current plan makes no sense even to the generals who understand it most. 
   The reality is this, it was poor judgment that took us to war in the first place. It is time to take a different course. For the path we are on now is morally unacceptable. And here are the facts: more than 650,000 Iraq civilians dead; over 3,000 American heroes gone forever; over 20,000 of our troops maimed for life, many with scars we will never see, at an economic cost that may rise above $2 trillion. 
   Make no mistake, we must do whatever it takes to defend America and keep hostilities from our shores. But what we need now is a tough and smart national defense policy. It is time now to get the smart part right. 
   This resolution has been criticized on both sides. Some say it is not enough; some say it is too tough. But I am convinced it offers us the opportunity to ask these questions again: What kind of Nation are we, when a President takes us to war based on lies and deceptions, when our energy policy is decided behind closed doors, and when in our free elections not everyone's vote is counted?  
   What kind of Nation will we be when all of our manufacturing jobs are taken overseas, when workers lose their rights to effective collective bargaining, and when our government closes its eyes to global warming? What kind of Nation are we and in which direction shall we move? Let's begin now to work together and take a different path, a path where people come first ahead of political parties, ahead of profit and loss statements, ahead of politics of fear. When we put people ahead of political calculations, we will begin to see a different world. We will see that we must begin to solve our differences by means other than going to war. After all, war is our greatest human failure. 
   This is not an idealistic sentiment, a realistic assessment of the chronicle of horrors witnessed every day in Iraq, and even our own experiences here at home, in New York City, in Virginia, in Pennsylvania, in Oklahoma City. 
   We must teach our children and our leaders alike that in the end diplomacy defeats violence. We must begin to think differently in America as we establish a new direction for hope in the world and a new beginning for our American era. By working together we will build a better future for all of us, beginning right here and right now. 
   Like the new congressional class of 2006, America's hope, I strongly support our troops, but not the President's failed policy. I encourage all of my colleagues to join the class of 2006 and vote ``yes'' on this important resolution. Join us. Be part of America's hope.

<DOCNO>Mr. KAGEN. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Chairman, I rise to engage in a colloquy with Chairman Oberstar. 
   Mr. Chairman, I wish to congratulate you on your ongoing efforts to improve the safety of our Nation's highway bridges. And I'm pleased that H.R. 3999, the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act, would provide an additional $1 billion in fiscal year 2009 for States to address their structurally-deficient national highway system bridges. I'm concerned, however, that this funding would be distributed through the current bridge program formula. 
   Traditionally, Wisconsin does not fare well under the current bridge formula, which is based on the number and percentage of structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges. While I recognize that the funding apportionment for the Highway Bridge Program is needs-based, I am concerned that the current program does not recognize the commitment States like Wisconsin make toward addressing their deficient bridges. Under the current formula, States such as Wisconsin are penalized because they commit significant resources towards addressing their bridge needs. 
   This situation is exasperated by the fact that States are permitted to transfer bridge program funds to other Federal highway programs with little or no impact under future apportionment of Highway Bridge Program funds. 
   Under this current formula, there is little or no incentive to invest in bridge maintenance. More importantly, States that achieve this objective are not rewarded. To address this problem and ensure that bridge program resources are invested in bridge maintenance, I believe that the funding formula should consider a State's level of efforts and performance in addressing its bridge needs. 
   While I recognize that this legislation does not rewrite the Federal Highway Bridge Program formula, I would greatly appreciate it if the chairman would be willing to assure me as that, as the committee begins to develop the next surface transportation authorization, we will review the formula to accommodate and recognize that States have made these efforts. 
   And I yield to the chairman.

   Mr. KAGEN. Thank you to Madam JOHNSON and subcommittee Chair FRANK PALLONE for putting together a tremendous bill. 
   Madam Chairman, as a Member who has the honor of representing one of the largest States in the country that has shoreline beyond measure in its value, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2537, the Beach Protection Act. 
   This critical piece of legislation will increase grant funding overseen by the  EPA for water quality surveys and for pollution source tracking programs, and it will also set a new standard for public notification. 
   H.R. 2537 will take important steps to address the serious threat to public health and the economic vitality of coastal vitality of coastal economies in northeast Wisconsin posed by beach water pollution and human pathogens. 
   I would be remiss, however, if I did not also recognize the exemplary job performed by the State of Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources, who has been monitoring 34 of the 35 beaches in Door County, Brown County and Kewaunee County. 
   While I am also proud to applaud the beach monitoring standards employed by the State of Wisconsin, this act will also improve upon the quality of these observations and heighten public safety. After all, clean water gets good health. 
   Moreover, it will require the EPA to commence a study, identify potential revisions in the beach-funding distribution formula, which currently weighs the beach season conservatively, more importantly, than other factors such as Wisconsin's winter season not being adequately measured. Additionally, the bill will call upon the EPA to publish a list of pathogens affecting human health. 
   In closing, I urge all of our colleagues to support H.R. 2537.

   Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, everywhere in Wisconsin and across the country, people are asking for help to reduce prices for their gasoline costs and their health care. Rural areas, like the district I represent in northeast Wisconsin, are affected most. 
   We need to work hard here in Congress to provide meaningful solutions to these problems. And our first step must be to solve our health care crisis by ending discrimination in health insurance everywhere; by saying if you are a citizen you are in; and if it is in your body, it should be covered; and by leveraging down insurance costs and creating the largest risk pool possible, and creating an open and transparent medical marketplace. 
   We must also design for the first time in this administration a meaningful national energy policy which includes three things: drilling for new oil across America with every single ounce of our oil sold only to U.S. citizens; investing in every source of renewable energy possible; and by preventing manipulation in the marketplace. 
   These efforts will get us back to the basics of becoming energy independent and a healthy Nation once again.
