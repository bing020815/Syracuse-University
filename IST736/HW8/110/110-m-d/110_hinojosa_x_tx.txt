   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act, TRIREA, of 2007, which will both extend and improve upon the current Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. 
   I am very pleased that the legislation will include domestic terrorism as a covered event. I strongly support the inclusion of group life insurance as a covered line under the new TRIA legislation, and I applaud Chairman Frank for allowing the return of farm owners multiple peril as a TRIA-covered line. 
   I want to thank Chairman Barney Frank, Chairman Paul Kanjorski, Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Congressman Michael Capuano for working so diligently on this bill and bringing it to the floor today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION & ACCESS ACT: DEMOCRATS ACT ON MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, according to the U.S. Department of Education, an estimated 200,000 academically qualified students are not able to go to college every year because they can't afford the cost. 
   This is a dangerous trend for our Nation, but it is not surprising. Under the Bush administration, prices at public colleges have increased by 40 percent after inflation. And under Republican rule, Pell Grants remained stagnant for 4 years in a row. 
   When our Democratic majority was elected, we pledged to address this growing crisis, and this week are fulfilling that pledge by sending the College Cost Reduction and Access Act to the President's desk. This important legislation provides the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill, increases the maximum Pell Grant over the next 5 years, and cuts interest rates in half on need-based student loans. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help millions of students across our Nation afford a college education without saddling themselves with thousands of dollars in debt, and it is the latest example of what the Democratic Congress is doing.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF FINANCIAL LITERACY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 273 that the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) and I introduced earlier this year. The legislation supports the ideas and goals of Financial Literacy Month, which falls in April of each year. 
   Before I proceed, I want to take this opportunity to thank my good friend and colleague, Congresswoman Watson from California, for managing time on this resolution for our side of the aisle. I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of my Democratic colleagues who cosponsored this important resolution this year. 
   Together with the tremendous number of cosponsors Congresswoman Biggert obtained, we broke our old record of 91 cosponsors and garnered the support of 118 Members of Congress for this bill. 
   I am very pleased with this development. It shows that an increasing number of Members of Congress are beginning to see the light and come on board  the financial literacy cause with me and Congresswoman Biggert. 
   It is imperative that we, in Congress, pay more attention to the financial literacy rates of our citizens from pre-kindergarten all the way to retirement. The sooner that a person begins to learn good saving habits, the better off he or she will be in the future. 
   I am especially pleased and honored to inform you that 18 cities and three counties in my congressional district have issued proclamations honoring April 22-28, 2007, as National Financial Literacy Awareness Week. 
   The cities, in alphabetical order, include the following: Beeville, Combes, Cuero, Donna, Edcouch, Edinburg, Falfurrias, Goliad, Harlingen, La Feria, La Villa, Mathis, McAllen, Mercedes, Pharr, Primera, Santa Rosa, Weslaco. It also includes three counties, which are as follows: Duval County, Jim Wells County and Karnes County.     
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to take this opportunity to thank several State legislatures for realizing the importance of financial literacy by taking action to address the diminishing understanding of basic finance by U.S. high school students. 
   A study completed in 2006 by the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy found that high school seniors know less about principles of basic personal finance than high school seniors did 7 years earlier, and the average scores in both years were failing. Our high school seniors are failing basic finance. 
   Add to that the fact that 55 percent of college students acquire their first credit card during their first year in college, and 92 percent of college students acquire at least one credit card by their second year in college, yet only 26 percent of people between the ages of 13 and 21 reported that their parents actively taught them how to manage money. Add all that together, and you have got a recipe for serious financial troubles down the road for college graduates. 
   Luckily, in recent years State legislatures around the country have increasingly recognized the importance and effectiveness of financial education. As a result, an increasing number of States now require financial education during high school. I hope my colleagues and their staff are taking note of this because the following States now require high school students to pass some form of financial education or literacy courses before they can graduate. Those States include the following: Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, my great State of Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
   I strongly recommend that my colleagues contact their State legislators and encourage them to impose similar requirements. 
   Mr. Speaker, every day consumers deal with money from balancing a checking account to shopping for a mortgage or auto loan, researching a way to pay for a college education, checking credit card statements, saving money for retirement, understanding a credit report, or simply deciding whether to pay cash or charge a purchase. The list goes on and on and on. Many consumers do not really understand their finances. 
   Now that we know that high school students are failing basic financial literacy exams, it is even more disconcerting to learn that adults are not faring much better. High bankruptcy rates, foreclosures on homes, increased credit card debt, data security breaches, and identity theft make it imperative that all of us take an active role in providing financial and economic education during all stages of one's life. 
   Every year we here in Congress discuss the future insolvency of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; and that concerns me considerably. But now that I have done some additional research into the demographics and financial standing of the baby boomers, I was shocked to learn that the personal savings as a percentage of income dropped a negative 1 percent in 2006, the lowest since the Great Depression. Even worse, the average baby boomer has only $50,000 in savings for retirement apart from equity in their homes. 
   These are very serious and disturbing facts that we and our State counterparts must address, and soon. To address these problems and others, I cofounded and currently cochair the Congressional Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus with Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT. The caucus seeks to address these issues head on by increasing public awareness of poor financial literacy rates and working to find the ways and means to improve those rates. The caucus has provided a forum for my colleagues to promote policies that advance financial literacy and economic education. 
   It is my hope that through the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus we can continue to further educate Americans about financial and economic topics ranging from the importance of saving, reducing credit card debt, obtaining a free annual credit report, avoiding payday lenders, check cashers, and especially these days predatory lenders. Hopefully the caucus can teach individuals to take care of their finances, to lead them down the path to the American Dream of homeownership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for printing in today's Record letters in support of this resolution. They include letters from JA Worldwide; National Council on Economic Education; Financial Planning Association, Independent Bankers Association of Texas; MasterCard; the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; the National Association of Mortgage Brokers; Networks Financial Institute; North American Securities Administrators Association. It includes HSBC, the Independent Community Bankers of America; Housing Assistance Council; National Association of Federal Credit Unions. It includes Capital One; as well as Visa; Charles Schwab Foundation; Financial Services Forum; Financial Services Roundtable, National Association of Realtors; Girls, Incorporated; AFSA Education Fund; Countrywide, First Nations Oweesta Corporation, Native Americans. It includes National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders; America's Community Bankers; Community Bankers Association; Consumer Mortgage Coalition; Texas Credit Union League; State Farm Insurance Company, Freddie Mac; Wells Fargo; and the National Youth Involvement Board. 
   Mr. Speaker, several of these groups will be participating in the Financial Literacy Day Fair that will take place April 24 from noon to 4 p.m. here on the Hill at the Cannon Caucus Room. It is my understanding that over 50 different groups will present their financial literacy products, their programs, and ideas during the fair. The last time we hosted the event, over 500 people attended the event not only to take advantage of the free financial literacy advice but also to enjoy a wonderful buffet. I encourage my colleagues and their staff to attend the Financial Literacy Day Fair. Again, I repeat, it will be held April 24 from noon to 4 p.m. in the Cannon Caucus Room and lunch will be served. 
   On the same day, April 24, at 3 p.m. in room 2220 of the Rayburn House Office Building, the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus is collaborating with Visa on a different financial literacy event. Visa is bringing Jean Chatzky to the Hill to provide some financial advice and respond to questions. Both Members and staff are invited to this event at 2220 Rayburn from 3:30 to 5 p.m., which I believe will be beneficial and a huge success. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, our country is suffering financially, and our constituents are not armed with the tools they need to provide for a good future. For these reasons and more, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HOMEOWNERSHIP MONTH -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Donnelly) for yielding time to me. I also want to commend him for his leadership. 
   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 477, a resolution recognizing the goals and ideals of National Homeownership Month, which falls in June of each year. I also want to commend my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller), for introducing the resolution and for working with me on its language. 
   Owning a home is a fundamental part of the American Dream and is the largest personal investment many families will ever make. Homeownership provides economic security by increasing the stake residents have in their communities, including local schools, civic organizations, community-based organizations, and churches. 
   Improving homeownership opportunities requires the commitment and cooperation of the private and public sectors, including the Federal Government and State and local governments. Our current laws encourage homeownership to a significant degree, but need to be updated and augmented so that they will continue to promote homeownership in the future. 
   We need to do everything in our power to ensure that potential home buyers and current homeowners do not become victims of predatory lenders, as has been the case in recent times. 
   To improve the affordability, availability and quality of housing in America, I co-founded and I am currently the chairman of the Congressional Rural Housing Caucus. The caucus continues to increase in number as more and more Members of Congress realize not only the importance of homeownership in urban dwellings, but those in rural America. 
   To increase homeownership, I introduced H.R. 1980, the Housing Assistance Counsel Authorization Act. It authorizes $10 million for housing assistance counsel in fiscal year 2008 and $15 million in fiscal year 2009-2014. 
   HAC, a nonprofit corporation, is the only national housing assistance group that specializes in rural areas and small towns. The House Committee on Financial Services has also held hearings on the bill and reported it favorably to the floor of the House of Representatives. A companion measure has been introduced in the Senate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also introduced H.R. 1982, the Rural Housing and Economic Development Improvement Act. The bill authorizes $30 million for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's RHED program in fiscal year 2008 and $40 million for fiscal years 2009-2013. This bill has also been reported favorably on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   I want to take this opportunity to thank Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, the ranking member; Spencer Bachus; Chairwoman Maxine Waters; and the ranking member, Judy Biggert; and all their staffs for guiding the HAC and RHED legislation through our committee. 
   I have also authored a letter to the Housing Appropriations Committee requesting the funding for several programs that the administration's budget  would either eliminate or reduce their funding. I include for today's Congressional Record a copy of that letter. 
   Again, June is National Homeownership Month. I strongly support the goals and ideals of National Homeownership Month and recognize the importance of homeownership in building strong communities and families.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressman from Kansas for yielding time to me. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1065, the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2007. Congressman Moore from Kansas has been a very effective member of the Financial Services Committee and I commend him for his leadership on reinsurance legislation. I thank the gentleman for sponsoring this much-needed legislation and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. 
   This important bill will harmonize and in some cases reduce regulation and taxation of this insurance by vesting the home State where it is headquartered with the sole authority to regulate and collect the taxes on a surplus lines transaction. Those taxes that will be collected may be distributed according to a future interstate compact. Absent such a compact, their distribution would be up to the home State. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will implement streamlined Federal standards allowing a sophisticated commercial purchaser to access surplus lines insurance. It will reduce uncertainty in this marketplace. It will also help protect contractual agreements between sophisticated parties entering into a reinsurance contract. For these reasons and more, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1051, the National STEM Scholarship Database  Act. I would like to commend the work of my good friend and colleague from New Jersey, Congressman Rush Holt, for bringing this bill forward and for all of his efforts to ensure that our Nation stays at the forefront of the STEM fields. I share his commitment to mobilizing our resources at all levels to expand the pool of opportunities in these career fields that are critical to our future security and prosperity. 
   It is no secret that we are losing our competitive edge in producing experts in science, technology, math and engineering. Of the 42 countries that granted more than 20,000 university degrees in 2002, the United States is in the bottom quartile in the ratio of STEM college degrees awarded. 
   Our pool of future STEM professionals can be found in our public schools in America. The 2007 ``Condition of Education'' reminds us that a growing percentage of these students are minorities, with a growing percentage from low-income families. These are the students that will rely on college scholarships and college financial aid to achieve the dream of a college education. 
   The National STEM Scholarship Database will be an invaluable tool to help our young people to find the resources they need to finance college education in the STEM fields. 
   As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Higher Education, I believe this legislation will also underscore that a STEM career is possible, an essential message for our young people to hear. 
   This is a real service to our young people and to our Nation. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his efforts, and urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6889, legislation to extend the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act for an additional year. 
   We are all united in our commitment to provide every assurance to students and families that there will be no disruption in the Federal student loans program regardless of what is happening in the financial markets. 
   In May, the President signed the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act. This law is providing much-needed liquidity to the student loan marketplace by authorizing the Secretary on a temporary basis to purchase student loans so that lenders have the funds to make new loans. 
   As a result of our swift action, there has been no disruption in students' and families' access to loans for the 2008-2009 academic year. 
   The Department of Education, the lenders, secondary markets, guaranty agencies, and institutions of higher education are to be commended for their efforts to get new financing systems in place and operational for the start of this academic year.     
   Their cooperation has ensured continued access to college loans. 
   Come spring, students and families will be making their plans for the next academic year. Given the ongoing turmoil in our financial markets, it is critical that we extend the authority for the Secretary to purchase student loans to avoid any uncertainty about the access to this critical source of student financial aid. It would be a tragedy for a student to decide to forego or postpone college because of a fear of not being able to get a Federal student loan. 
   This legislation has no budgetary cost. It will simply extend the Secretary's authority under the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act for an additional year. 
   Mr. Speaker, students and families will be able to rest assured that we have the mechanisms in place to make sure that there is sufficient capital for student loans even if the current credit crisis continues or worsens. 
   This Congress has taken unprecedented steps to make college more accessible and more affordable. We enacted the largest increase in student aid with the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, a $20 billion investment in human capital. In August, the President signed the Higher Education Opportunity Act into law. 
   The legislation takes significant steps to improve our student aid delivery system, ensure the integrity of our student loan programs, and provide students and families with the tools that they need to make informed choices about which college to attend and how to finance it. These are complex issues, and on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, we came together with some practical solutions. 
   Today's legislation is another example of our bipartisan commitment to college access. I would like to thank our committee chairman, GEORGE MILLER, and our senior Republicans on the full committee and the Higher Education Subcommittee, Representative BUCK MCKEON and Representative RIC KELLER from Florida, for their leadership in quickly moving this legislation forward. We stand united in our goal of ensuring continued access to student loans. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 6889.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 1372, which celebrates the University of Nebraska at Omaha's 100 years of service and partnership between the City of Omaha and its citizens. 
   Founded in 1908, Omaha, Nebraska and Bellevue citizens worked together to create a nonsectarian university where local high school residents could receive a college education. 
   Starting with only 26 students in their first class, the University of Nebraska at Omaha has blossomed into an esteemed university. Today, the University enrolls almost 14,000 students and offers a diverse range of academic courses.     
   With only 71 undergraduate majors, 45 masters degree programs, 17 graduate certificates and six doctoral programs, UNO possesses a wide array of courses for its students. The school makes a tremendous social and financial impact on its students and city. Students receive a quality college education, and the school generates $350 million per year for the community. 
   UNO's unique history speaks to its accepting and inclusive culture. UNO started off as the University of Omaha. Due to financial difficulties and the high number of students who wanted to attend, in 1929 the board of trustees voted to establish a municipal university. The newly named Municipal University of Omaha prospered and relocated to its final location on 60th and Dodge Streets in the fall of 1936. 
   Later the university regents agreed to merge with the University of Nebraska. As a result, University of Nebraska at Omaha was born. That merger created a more sustainable and affordable college education, a principle the school lives by today. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I express my full support for the University of Nebraska at Omaha. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 334. 
   Community colleges are the institutions that make things happen for our communities. They are the gateway to higher education for most of our students. They provide the opportunities that give lifelong learning real meaning. They are central to workforce development. 
   In short, they are the rapid response system, the innovators, and the engine for economic development for communities across the Nation. 
   I know first hand what a difference a community college can make. it was my great privilege to be the founding chair of South Texas College. When I was first elected to Congress in 1996, the unemployment rate in my district topped 22 percent. 
   In 1996, South Texas College was a couple of years old and just beginning to build from its initial enrollment of 800 students. Today, our unemployment rate is less than 6 percent, and South Texas College is enrolling over 18,000 students each year. That is the difference a community college can make. 
   Community colleges have also stepped up to offer new and exciting opportunities for students while they are still in high school. Community colleges are on the cutting edge of high school reform. 
   For example, in my district, Texas State Technical College in Harlingen is hosting a new Early College High School that will enroll its first class of 100 freshmen this fall. Students graduating from this new school will have a head start in college, earning a possible 60 credit hours along with their distinguished achievement high school diplomas. 
   In our rural communities community colleges are critical pieces of the economic infrastructure. 
   Consider the results of an economic impact study that found that the instruction provided by Coastal Bend College, in Beeville, Texas resulted in an accumulated contribution of $48.5 million in annual earnings to the Rural Coastal Bend Economy. That is roughly the equivalent of 2,087 jobs, which is a significant number in our rural economies. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from North Carolina, Congressman Miller, for bringing this resolution forward. 
   I wholeheartedly join him in supporting the goals and ideals of National Community College month. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res 334.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 347, and also I rise to honor a true hero who gave his life to free his country from foreign oppression. 
   Ignacio Zaragoza Seguin was born in 1829 near what is now Goliad, Texas, a community in my congressional district. 
   In 1862 French troops began a march to capture Mexico City. They met the Mexican forces led by a courageous and well-trained 33-year-old general at the city of Puebla, Mexico, in a battle that lasted the entire day of May 5, 1862. Under General Ignacio Zaragoza's leadership, the vastly outnumbered Mexican Army forced the withdrawal of Napoleon III's army, the premier army in the world.     
   French Army losses were heavy, but Mexican troop casualties were few. The costly delay in Puebla, Mexico helped shorten the French intervention. It also helped preserve the American Union as it kept the French Army too busy to directly aid the Confederacy with troops during the U.S. Civil War. 
   General Zaragoza and his troops received a hero's welcome in Mexico City. While visiting his sick troops, Ignacio contracted typhoid fever and died on September 8, 1862 at the age of 33, only a few months after the great battle against the French. 
   President Juarez declared May 5, Cinco de Mayo, a national holiday in his country. Today, we celebrate Cinco de Mayo throughout Mexico and around the world, but I hope that as we celebrate it, we remember the courage and sacrifice of this true hero.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (THIRD HIGHER EDUCATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3927, a bill to extend the Higher Education Act through April 30, 2008. This bill is very straightforward. It simply extends the current programs authorized under the Higher Education Act until April 30, 2008, giving us the time to fully consider and complete the reauthorization. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are making progress. With bipartisan support and the President's signature, we are making a historic investment in student financial aid in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. We have also laid the groundwork to reauthorize the other core higher education programs, including teacher preparation, developing and strengthening institutions, college readiness and outreach programs, international education programs, graduate education, and many others.  
   The Higher Education Act was due to be reauthorized during the 108th Congress. It was not completed. The 109th Congress also failed to reauthorize this act. Given the length of time that has elapsed between when the Higher Education Act should have been reauthorized and today, we believed that it was critical that the 110th Congress and the stakeholders in the higher education community take a fresh look at the law and the recommendations to improve it. 
   We have held a series of congressional hearings covering the core issues of access, affordability, college preparation, teacher preparation, and institutional capacity. We put out a call for recommendations and received over 85 responses from individuals and organizations from across the Nation. I am looking forward to working with all my colleagues to produce a strong reauthorization that will earn broad support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank Congressman McKeon, the ranking member of the full committee. I would like to thank Congressman Ric Keller, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Higher Education, Lifelong Learning and Competitiveness. Also, I wish to thank Chairman George Miller for working together with all of us to expedite this extension. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation, H.R. 3927. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague Ric Keller pointed out, the last reauthorization took place back in 1998. If we are able to get it done this year, it will have been almost 10 since that reauthorization. For me, having served 11 years in Congress, I have had quite a learning curve. I have learned the importance by listening to presidents and chancellors of many of the institutions of higher learning and realize the importance of us getting this job done this session. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is extremely important because we are trying to raise the number of students who will be college ready. We must have programs that are going to fill the need that we have in our country for teachers, for scientists, for mathematicians, for all of the different fields that are necessary for our country to enjoy its prosperity. 
   I am working hard with my colleague Ric Keller so that the Higher Education Act is completed on a timely basis, and one that is going to serve us for the next 6 years. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time and would like to ask the gentleman from Florida if he has some other speakers.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 720, the ``Water Quality Financing Act of 2007.'' As we all know, H.R. 720 will reauthorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and provide $14 billion in funding for the program over the next four years. The bill provides technical assistance to rural and small municipalities for the purpose of assisting them in the planning, developing, and acquisition of financing for wastewater infrastructure assistance. The bill also provides technical assistance and training for rural and small publicly owned treatment works and decentralized wastewater treatment systems to enable such treatment works and systems to protect water quality and achieve and maintain compliance with the bill's requirements. Equally important, the bill will disseminate information to rural and small municipalities and municipalities that meet the affordability criteria established under section 603(i)(2) by the State in which the municipality is located with respect to planning, design, construction, and operation of publicly owned treatment works and decentralized wastewater treatment systems. 
   With 20 percent of the country's population living in rural communities, it's critical that we address their infrastructure needs including access to clean water, working sewers, electricity, and other necessities. For more than a decade, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund has been integral to State's and localities in their effort to deal with critical clean water infrastructure needs. 
   As a community, our progress must be judged not by the status of our most fortunate members of society, but by that of our most challenged members. That is why I am committed to fighting for the resources needed to ensure a better standard of living for all Colonia residents, why I voted in favor of H.R. 720, and why I co-founded and currently am Chairman of the Congressional Rural Housing Caucus. I founded the Congressional Rural Housing Caucus to advocate for legislation and policy changes that: expand the availability of safe and affordable housing--both for purchase and for rental--in Rural America; eliminate substandard housing in Rural America; and especially to address the infrastructure needs of Rural America, including providing access to clean water, working sewers, electricity, and other necessities. This bill is an important step toward meeting the goals of the Congressional Rural Housing Caucus. 
   There are more than 350,000 people who struggle in the unacceptable living conditions of the Colonias every day. Many Colonias do not have sewer systems. Instead, residents must rely on alternative, often inadequate wastewater disposal methods. Surveys of Colonias in El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley show that 50.7 percent of the households use septic tanks, 36.4 percent use cesspools, 7.4 percent use outhouses, and 5.5 percent use other means to dispose of wastewater. Septic tank systems, which in some circumstances may provide adequate wastewater disposal, often pose problems because they are too small or improperly installed and can overflow. 
   Even if the colonias had adequate sewer systems, the border area lacks sufficient facilities to treat wastewater. According to a summary report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), wastewater treatment capacity along the U.S.-Mexico border has been inadequate for the past decade. In many places, there are no treatment facilities at all. Consequently, border communities often discharge untreated or inadequately treated wastewater into rivers, canals and arroyos (a creek or stream), which then flow into the Gulf of Mexico. In the Nuevo Laredo/Laredo area alone, 27 million gallons of untreated waste-water are discharged directly into the Rio Grande each day, contributing to ecological and aesthetic degradation, economic loss and threats to public health. Securing potable water also presents a challenge to Colonia residents. Many must buy water by the bucket or drum to meet their daily needs or use wells that may be contaminated. 
   According to The Colonias Factbook, a Texas Department of Human Services survey of living conditions in rural areas of South and West Texas border counties, 23.7 percent of the households did not have treated water in the house. Because of this, the survey found, untreated water was used by 12.8 percent of households to wash dishes, 13.1 percent to wash clothes, 12.3 percent to bathe and 4.9 percent to cook. 
   A 1995 Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) study estimates that 428 colonias with about 81,000 people are in need of potable water facilities, and 1,195 colonias with about 232,000 people need wastewater treatment facilities. The TWDB estimates it would cost more than $424 million to build the water and wastewater facilities needed in the 23 counties surveyed. 
   In my district, these issues are increased by the low-incomes and housing quality problems suffered by my constituents. According to the 2000 Census, the median income for persons living in the 15th district was $26,840. There are more than 7,500 households that lack complete plumbing facilities. Crowding is a problem as more than 15 percent of all occupied housing units are crowded (i.e., more than one person per room). 
   The battle to improve every Colonia in South Texas will require enormous resources and support from program partners, community residents, and especially the Federal Government. This is a battle we must win, and I know we will win. The problems in the Colonias are not just the Colonias' problems, but they are the State's problems they are the Nation's problems--and they are our problems. 
   Passage of today's legislation will go a long way toward improving the quality of life of residents of the Colonias and towards attaining the goals of the Congressional Rural Housing Caucus. 
   Rest assured that I will continue to fight for legislation, regulations and programs that understand the needs of Colonia and all rural residents. I will fight to fund programs that educate Colonia residents and empower them with the tools needed to live not for today, but for every day. 
   Where there is a will, there is a way. And as we say in my district and around the world--Si Se Puede!

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my friend, Chairman Norman Dicks. I want to commend him for the wonderful job he did in putting this bill together. I also want to thank him for his willingness to work with me and the other members of the House Border Caucus to address a serious need in the border region. 
   This amendment would increase funding for the U.S.-Mexico Border program to $25 million. This program was created under the NAFTA treaty to  help border communities cope with the environmental effects of the treaty. Since its inception, the fund has been used to improve wastewater and drinking water infrastructure. It has provided technical assistance to 130 communities. It has eliminated 300 million gallons per day of untreated or inadequately treated discharges, equivalent to that of 6.8 million persons. A recent audit found that for every dollar placed into the BEIF fund, $1.85 has been leveraged from other sources. Every dollar used under the fund by the U.S. is matched dollar for dollar by Mexico. 
   This funding is desperately needed to begin the planning for new water and wastewater projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. Most of the communities in my district are very small with the majority of residents living below the poverty level. They don't have the financial means to build water and wastewater infrastructure on their own. The U.S.-Mexico Border program is their only avenue to protect the health of their citizens and bring economic development projects to their community. 
   While the U.S.-Mexico Border program has had some institutional problems, which have hindered its ability to release funds to these communities, Congress has made reforms to the program and funds are finally flowing to communities. All of the funds currently in the program are allocated to projects and by the end of 2008 all of the money will have been disbursed. Without the funds in this amendment, new communities would not be able to begin the 5-year process. 
   In my district, several communities like Mercedes, Donna, Weslaco, Pharr, and others have received help from the U.S.-Mexico program to build and modernize their wastewater systems. As a result, large economic development projects are underway because the communities finally have the infrastructure to provide services to new employers. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman Dicks for offering this amendment and urge all of my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 63. The State of Texas has a proud history of military service. Thousands of Texans have fought with distinction in every conflict this country has entered. 
   Hundreds of my constituents are currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are willing to leave behind their families and friends to risk their lives in service to their country. Many will never return home. Many will come home maimed and injured. 
   I want to read the names of the young people from the 15th District of Texas who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan: Darrell Shipp, Benito Ramirez, Javier Marin, Julio Alvarez, Gary Moore, Tomas Garces, Mark Anthony Zapata, Juan Calderon, Christopher Ramirez, Dustin Sekula, Juan Garza, James Kesinger, Mitchell Mutz, John Russell, Quinton Gertson, Christopher Kilpatrick, Tina Priest, and Daniel Galvan. 
   I know how much their families and friends have grieved at their loss. I have spoken to their parents and spouses and have attended many of their funerals. We are all so very proud of their military service and know they did their very best. 
   However, as an elected Representative of the United States Government, I have a responsibility to make sure that the sacrifices of these brave men and women were not in vain.     
   I have a responsibility to see that more Americans will not be sacrificed unnecessarily. I have supported the funding to give our military the body armor, the equipment and training they need, and I will continue to see that they have whatever they need. But I will not support an administration policy that puts more troops in harm's way, with no apparent end in sight and with no clear goals on how to win the fight. 
   In 2002, I stood in this well and I spoke on that resolution giving the President permission to go to war, and I voted against going to war with Iraq because I didn't believe we had all the information we needed on Iraq's nuclear capabilities and weapons of mass destruction and its support for terrorism. I was concerned that the President had not convinced the 39 countries who had supported us in the previous war with Iraq. I was disappointed that the President did not have an exit plan after we defeated Iraq. And I was disappointed that the President would not put in the budget what we were going to spend on that war. 
   No one denies that Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator who brutally oppressed his people, and I am glad that the Iraqis are free of this tyranny. But the Bush administration did not have accurate information then, and I don't believe they have an accurate picture of the situation today. 
   Our troops are now caught in the middle of a civil war between religious groups that have hated each other for centuries. There is no defined enemy and no clear battle lines. 
   The task of imposing and growing democracy in a place where it has never been is not the job of our military. It must come from the political will of the Iraqi people. Only the Iraqis can decide whether they want to put aside centuries of discord and come together to create a stable, democratic country where the rights of every group is recognized. The Iraqi Government must take responsibility for its own future. 
   After more than 4 years, the U.S. is not safer because of our efforts in Iraq. By dividing our resources, we have allowed the Taliban to reemerge in Afghanistan and have given al Qaeda a strong foothold that it never had before in Iraq. Syria and Iran have gained influence throughout the entire region. 
   We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars at the expense of critical programs at home like education, health care and homeland security. Our military is severely strained with troops on their third and fourth tours of Iraq. Units are being deployed, either understaffed or with new personnel, that has decreased unit cohesiveness, proficiency and morale. Equipment is worn out and our readiness to deal with an additional crisis is in jeopardy. 
   Unfortunately, most of his generals disagree. The distinguished members of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group disagree, and more importantly, the American people disagree. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting H. Con. Res. 63 and opposing the President's decision to send more troops to Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1424, the Senate amendment to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. I will vote ``yes.''  
   No one wants to be voting on this legislation today because none of us want to be in the horrific economic situation in which our country finds itself. The greed and lack of regulatory oversight that got us into this mess should never have happened. However, today we have to deal with the practical economic reality. Inaction is not an option. 
   This bill is not about bailing out Wall Street. 
   It is about making sure that average Americans can continue to get credit for their basic needs like housing, students loans, and automobiles. It is about saving pensions for our retirees and making sure that the small businesses that are the engines of growth in my district can continue to get the credit they need to operate. 
   This bill is not perfect and doesn't have everything I would like. However, the changes that have been made to the original proposal by Secretary Paulson address many of the concerns of my constituents. The changes will protect taxpayers, keep people in their homes and rein in huge CEO salaries. 
   It will allow the American people to see where this money is being spent and what is being purchased. Many of the tax extenders that the Senate added are needed to keep our country competitive and bring tax relief to average Americans.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2642, and I also rise on behalf of myself, the Honorable Congressman Ortiz and the Honorable Congressman Cuellar and the more than 75 veterans who in the fall of 2005 walked in the hot sun a long, long 250 miles from Edinburg, Texas, to San Antonio to raise the level of awareness of a badly needed veterans hospital in south Texas. 
   I want to sincerely thank Chairman Edwards for your outstanding leadership and for the past support for veterans affairs. I look forward to working with you to accomplish what naysayers have said, that it will never get done. 
   And finally, I want to emphasize that our south Texas veterans and the south Texas congressional delegation have been fighting for a veterans hospital for more than 20 years. While the VA has a contract for a few hospital beds, those 10 beds are not enough to take care of the more than 75,000 veterans living in the eight county region. Once the VA releases their report next month, will the chairman work with us to address any shortfalls that are identified for inpatient care in south Texas?

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the McCrery amendment in the nature of a substitute. I support the underlying bill, H.R. 3920, which is important to our State of Texas and to our Nation. The Education and Labor Committee, on which I serve, is separately considering the reauthorization for the Workforce Investment Act. The Trade and Globalization Assistance Act is not the appropriate bill for addressing it. Rather than address the root causes of why little actual job training services are provided under WIA, the McCrery substitute gives Governors and not consumers, the American workers, greater control over critical resources. 
   Mr. Speaker, most alarming is the fact that the minority believes it can simply change the bureaucratic elements of the WIA system and ensure those who need training receive it. Actual job training has fallen 50 percent under WIA, compared to JTPA. Only 200,000 adults and dislocated workers have received training, out of 8 million unemployed individuals. The Department of Labor estimates that less than 50 percent under WIA funds are being used for core, intensive and training services. In real terms, appropriations for WIA have dropped by over $1 billion during this administration's clock in the last 6 years. Just this past year this administration has proposed a cut of $1 billion, including a rescission. Fortunately, our Appropriations Committee has restored this funding. 
   It should also be noted that WIA expired in 2003, and the minority had ample opportunity to reauthorize WIA but failed to do so. Representative McKeon only introduced the WIA reauthorization bill earlier this month, essentially with the same proposals that failed to pass the previous two Congresses. Moreover, given the length of time that has transpired from the 108th Congress when the Workforce Investment Act was due to be reauthorized,  until today, it is essential that we give this critical piece of legislation a fresh look. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a changing economy and labor force, which means that there are new challenges and new opportunities that we should consider. The Education and Labor Committee has actively begun the WIA reauthorization process. The Subcommittee on Higher Education, of which I am the chairman, held two hearings in June and July, and received recommendations from stakeholders on WIA reauthorization. The subcommittee also asked all interested parties to submit proposals to the committee, and the committee staff is reviewing those recommendations that have been submitted by over two dozen organizations and continues to meet with interested groups on WIA. Committee staff has offered to work with the minority staff as WIA proceeds through the committee. 
   Regrettably, WIA programs have suffered funding cuts over the past 7 years, largely because the administration requested the cuts and opposed congressional efforts to approve WIA funding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the substitute amendment and to vote for passage of the underlying bill.  
   Regrettably, WIA programs have suffered funding cuts over the past 7 years largely because the administration has requested the cuts and opposed congressional efforts to improve WIA funding. It is my hope that we can generate bipartisan support to reverse that trend. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject the substitute amendment and to vote for passage of the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007, introduced by Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who has worked so hard on this legislation. 
   I want to commend my good friend from California for introducing such an important piece of legislation and for helping me and the Congressional Rural Housing Coalition find ways to provide housing for all Americans, including those in rural America. She has found numerous ways to improve the availability, affordability and quality of housing; and this legislation advances that cause. 
   Madam Chairman, this legislation, H.R. 1852, will modernize and update the National Housing Act and enable the Federal Housing Administration to use risk-based pricing to more effectively reach underserved borrowers. It will also provide a safe alternative for potential home buyers with less than perfect credit, thus helping them avoid the pitfalls of certain subprime lending and, hopefully, reduce a large portion of predatory lending. 
   This legislation is very important to working families. Hundreds of thousands of American families are concerned about losing their homes as their mortgage payments increase because of subprime loans with adjustable interest rates. With strong efforts to assist them, up to the 40 percent of families with subprime loans could qualify for more affordable fixed-rate loans so they can keep their homes. 
   As co-chair and co-founder of the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus, I am particularly pleased that the legislation contains a housing counseling provision. It is a long time coming. 
   I want to express my sincere appreciation to Chairwoman Maxine Waters for introducing such important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 2008 Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill that is before us today. 
   I would like to express my admiration and gratitude to Chairman Obey and the members of the committee for bringing forward a bill that reflects our values and our commitment to investing in education. 
   As the chairman of the Higher Education Lifelong Learning and Competitiveness Subcommittee, I am pleased to see the significant increases for student financial aid, for GEAR UP and TRIO programs. These investments make a real difference, and they have not come a moment too soon. 
   Recent reports estimate that by the year 2025, just to keep pace with our international competitors, the United States would need to produce an additional 15.6 million college graduates. That translates to another 781,000 degrees per year. GEAR UP and TRIO help close the college awareness and readiness gap. 
   Pell Grants and campus-based student aid programs close the affordability gap. This legislation coupled with the recently passed budget reconciliation bill signal that we are serious about ensuring that our students have the education and the skills they need to compete. 
   As chairman of the Education Task Force for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I am particularly heartened to see the commitment in this bill to increase educational opportunities for Hispanic students. This legislation reverses the trend of the past of eliminating, cutting or at best flat-lining the key programs that provide the pillars of educational support to the Hispanic community. They include migrant education programs for English language learners, developing Hispanic-serving institutions, Even Start Family Literacy, GEAR UP, TRIO and adult education. Together, we call them the Hispanic education action plan. 
   In 2006, every single program in the Hispanic education action plan was reduced. Elections do make a difference. 
   For 2008, on top of the $1.5 billion increase to the core title I program in No Child Left Behind, we have over $212 million increases to the other programs, including a long overdue investment program for English language learners.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Speaker, I first want to express my deepest condolences to all of the families who lost loved ones in yesterday's tragedy at Virginia Tech University. This horrific event has affected Americans all over this country and we all mourn for those who were lost and pray for the swift recovery of those who were injured. 
   Tonight I join my colleagues from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in paying tribute to the thousands of Hispanic veterans who have fought and died defending this country. My Congressional district has lost many young men in this most recent conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   They are but the latest in a long line of patriots from South Texas who have given their lives in the defense of America. 
   Tonight I want to pay tribute to a young man from my district who received this Nation's highest award, the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   Alfredo Cantu Gonzalez, known to his friends and family as ``Freddy'', was born in 1946 in Edinburg, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. His mother was a waitress, who had to raise her son alone.  
   Freddy worked in the cotton fields as a teenager to help his mother. He attended Edinburg High School, where he was an outstanding football star. 
   After graduation, he enlisted in the Marine Corps. After his initial training, he was sent to Vietnam in 1966 where he served as a rifleman and squad leader. He was quickly promoted from private to lance corporal to corporal. 
   He returned to the States in 1967 where he was given the task of training recruits in guerilla warfare. Freddy told his mother and friends he did not want to return to Vietnam and would not re-enlist. 
   A few months after his return from Vietnam, he learned that an entire Marine platoon had been killed, including a group of men who had served under him during his first tour of duty. He was saddened by their loss and immediately volunteered for a second tour of duty. 
   On July 1, 1967 he was promoted to sergeant and shipped back to Vietnam. 
   On January 31, 1968, Sergeant Freddy Gonzalez and his men were assigned the task of protecting a truck convoy that was bringing relief to a major Vietnamese town. The truck convoy was attacked by the Viet Cong with mortars and machine gun fire. 
   Although Sergeant Gonzalez was wounded, he ran through heavy fire to rescue a wounded Marine who fell off the tank. 
   On February 3, Sergeant Gonzalez was wounded again but refused medical treatment until all of the other wounded Marines were treated. 
   The next day, on February 4, Sergeant Gonzalez and his Marine platoon were pinned down by the Viet Cong, who were firing at the Americans with rockets and automatic weapons from a church. 
   Sergeant Gonzalez, utilizing a number of light anti-tank assault weapons, fearlessly moved from position to position, firing numerous rounds at the heavily fortified enemy emplacements, almost single-handedly neutralizing the enemy. 
   All appeared quiet and Sergeant Gonzalez approached to make sure that the church was secure when the hidden lone enemy survivor killed him. At the age of 21, Sergeant Freddy Gonzalez had given the ultimate sacrifice for his country. 
   In 1969, his mother, Dolia Gonzalez, was escorted to the White House to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor awarded to her son posthumously because of his tremendous heroism in saving the men in his platoon. 
   He was also awarded numerous other medals including the Purple Heart, the Vietnam Presidential Unit Citation, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with 2 bronze stars and the Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm. 
   Long after his death, his courage, his patriotism and his sacrifice are still remembered. In the Rio Grande Valley there are schools, roads and parks named after him. 
   In 1996, the Navy commissioned the USS Gonzalez, a guided-missile destroyer and the first modern destroyer named for a Mexican American. Freddie was one of 13 Hispanics who were awarded the Medal of Honor for their service in Vietnam. 
   Hispanics have a proud tradition of patriotism and have always been willing to answer America's call to duty, often when they were not even citizens. Freddy Gonzalez' story is just one of the many thousands of stories that make up the heritage of our Hispanic veterans. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in thanking all of these brave men and women, as well as their families and loved ones, for their service.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2669, The College Cost Reduction Act. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the largest investment in student aid since the passage of the GI bill. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act re-affirms the fundamental federal interest in higher education--ensuring that students and families have access to the financial and other supports they need to achieve a college education. 
   The fundamental guaranty in our student aid programs is not to protect lucrative lines of business in the lending industry; it is a guaranty of college access for students. When we lose sight of this core principle, we lose our way as we have seen with the recent scandals in the student loan industry. 
   H.R. 2669 is about guaranteeing access. This legislation increases student financial aid on an order of magnitude we have not seen in more than a generation. It invests in our public servants and in our teachers. It brings the private sector and charitable organizations to the table to leverage resources so that more first generation, low-income college students can realize their full potential. 
   I am particularly proud of our work to strengthen the institutions that are the gateways of access to higher education for minority students. Through this amendment we will commit to investing one-half billion dollars over 5 years in hispanic-serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, predominantly black institutions, tribally-controlled Colleges and Universities, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian serving Institutions, and institutions that serve Asian and Pacific Islanders. This represents a doubling of the current investment in the strengthening and developing institutions programs in Titles III and V of the Higher Education Act. 
   Many on the other side will say that we are investing in institutions and not students. They will rail against new entitlement spending. These arguments reflect a fundamental lack of understanding of the communities that will fuel the growth in our workforce. Worse, they indicate an unwillingness to invest in those communities. 
   HSls, HBCUs, and other minority-serving institutions are only going to grow in their importance for ensuring that our Nation continues to have enough college graduates to fill the jobs in our knowledge-based economy. The 2007 Condition of Education reports that 42 percent of our public school children are racial or ethnic minorities--one in five is Hispanic. 
   These students face many challenges. 
   Seventy percent of black 4th graders, 73 percent of Hispanic 4th graders, and 65 percent of Native American 4th graders are eligible for free and reduced priced lunches. These students are also concentrated in our highest poverty public schools where over 75 percent of the students are from low-income families. 
   These schools are the focus of the No Child Left Behind Act. They are the feeder schools to our Title III and Title V institutions. It is in our national interest to strengthen the capacity of these institutions to serve their communities. It is a worthy investment. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2669.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF FORMER FIRST LADY, LADY BIRD JOHNSON -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 553, to pay special tribute to Lady Bird Johnson. I am proud to recognize the accomplishments of a fellow Texan and a true Renaissance woman. 
   For much of her life, Lady Bird Johnson acted as the graceful wife of a congressional secretary, U.S. Representative, Senator, Vice President and President. She devoted herself to her husband's political campaigns and lived in the public eye throughout the turbulent 1960s and Vietnam War Era. 
   But, Lady Bird Johnson was also a scholar, a writer, a politician, and an advocate for education issues. At the University of Texas in Austin she studied journalism and qualified as a public school teacher. Later in life, she wrote A White House Diary and served as a University of Texas regent. 
   Lady Bird demonstrated her remarkable talents for public speaking while on the campaign trail through Southern states, where, as a product of an East Texas town steeped in traditional southern values, she was an invaluable spokesperson for the 1960 Kennedy-Johnson Presidential ticket. 
   While her husband served as President, Lady Bird Johnson acted as honorary chairwoman of the national Head Start program. As my colleagues may note, I am a strong proponent of the Head Start program, which can make immense differences in the lives of underprivileged pre-school children by preparing them to enter elementary school on a par with their peers. Thus, I celebrate Lady Bird's contributions to this invaluable program. 
   During this time, Lady Bird Johnson has also been credited with holding luncheons spotlighting women of assorted careers. As a strong supporter of women's rights and pay equality, I believe that her efforts to applaud young women's advancements into traditionally-male-dominated careers have had a profound effect on women's equality in general. 
   Lady Bird was also an adept businesswoman who purchased a small radio station in 1942 in Austin and built a multimillion-dollar radio corporation. In today's society, young women interested in business and the telecommunications industries may look to Lady Bird Johnson as a trailblazer and a success story. 
   While Lady Bird's conservation work in our Nation's Capital is widely-known, Lady Bird's efforts to beautify our great State of Texas should also be applauded. In 1969, she founded the Texas Highway Beautification Awards, and hosted 20 annual awards ceremonies, where she presented personal checks to the winners. And, on her 70th birthday, she founded the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, to which she donated acres of her own land. 
   Lady Bird has indeed left her mark upon Texas, as the namesake of a golf course, a municipal park, a walking trail, and a street. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in support of H. Res. 553, celebrating the life of Lady Bird Johnson. She was a remarkable First Lady, businesswoman, environmental advocate, and trailblazer of women's rights. She has left a grand legacy of strength of character and service upon Texas and upon the entire nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2. 
   I am proud that 110th Congress has made giving America's lowest-paid workers a raise one of its first legislative actions. It is long overdue. 
   Many families work hard but struggle with low wages. It is unconscionable that in America we have millions of people working full time and year round and still living in poverty. At $5.15 an hour, a full-time minimum wage worker brings home $10,700 a year, nearly $6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. An average Fortune 500 CEO earns more before lunchtime than a minimum wage worker makes all year. 
   American families have seen the real income drop by almost $1,300 since 2000, while the costs of gasoline, heating fuel, and health care have soared. For families living on minimum wage, this means a greater struggle to put food on the table and pay the rent. Minimum wage families struggle with the cost of daycare and health care. They struggle to provide a sound education for their children, and for many college is a dream beyond their reach. Today, we are doing something to ease that struggle. 
   Raising the minimum wage is a first step and a clear signal that we in Congress will do something. Raising the Federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour will add $4,400 to the income of full-time year-round workers, enough for a low-income family of three to afford a year of groceries. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been 10 years since our lowest-paid workers got a raise. In intervening years we in this body have seen many pay raises. Americans in the top income brackets have seen their earnings soar. On top of that, they have been the biggest beneficiaries of generous tax cuts. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. I want to thank Chairman MILLER for yielding time and for bringing the bill to the House floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 5, the College Student Debt Relief Act of 2007. Last year, the 109th Congress cut $12 billion from the student loan programs. These savings were not reinvested in helping low- and moderate-income families send their children to college. Instead, the $12 billion from the student loan program was used to underwrite the irresponsible deficit spending generated by the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Those cuts severely hampered our Nation's ability to close the college access gap for Hispanics and other low- and moderate-income students. 
   The 110th Congress has a new set of priorities. H.R. 5 will cut in half the interest on subsidized student loans by the year 2011. This legislation will save average borrowers $4,400 over the life of the loan. 
   The student loan programs have become an important piece of the access puzzle for Hispanic families. This interest rate reduction is part of the solution. Hispanic students borrow less on average than other groups. The reluctance to assume debt that could be difficult to repay has pushed many Hispanic students into attendance patterns that jeopardize their ability to persist until graduation. Nevertheless, according to the report, ``How Latino Students Pay for College, Excelencia in Education,'' the average loan amounts exceeded the average grant amounts by more than $1,800. 
   It is of critical importance to the Hispanic community that we provide assurances to borrowers that there are protections to help them meet their student loan obligations. We are committed to addressing the other pieces of the access and affordability puzzle as well. We will move forward to ensure that academic preparation is no longer a missing piece of the puzzle. 
   The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance estimates that in 2003 more than 400,000 college-qualified low-income students did not enroll in a 4-year college and 170,000 did not enroll in any college at all because of financial barriers. 
   We here in the 110th will right a wrong and place savings from the student loan program where they belong, with our low- and middle-income students. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this down payment on college access and affordability and to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   The Armed Forces Tuition Assistance program offers active duty personnel in our Nation's Armed Forces an annual stipend to enroll in college courses during their off-duty time. 
   Unfortunately, low awareness of this program and the rigorous and inflexible schedules of our troops have prevented the full utilization of these programs. While the education of our veterans deservedly garners much of our attention, it is important for us to remember that our servicemembers' educational pursuits should not be suspended while on active duty. 
   Our modest amendment will authorize military installations to enter into partnerships with educational institutions to help provide a richer and more flexible course schedule for our men and women in the armed services. 
   I wish to thank Mr. CASTLE for joining with me in this effort and hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment.

I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation which is supported by many organizations, including the National Council of La Raza, LULAC, MALDEF, and many others. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Higher Education, I am concerned that thousands of students each year do not enroll in higher education institutions because of financial barriers. I am equally concerned about the amount of debt that students are incurring while attending institutions of higher education. 
   I have been working diligently with our Democratic leaders to make college more affordable and accessible. We are tackling that issue as well as trying to ensure that students graduate with the least amount of debt possible. 
   I am interested in the relationship between institutions of higher education and credit card companies. Many receive revenue from credit card deals. I want to know the nature of the deals, how much the credit card companies make from those deals, how they market those credit cards to students, and whether the institutions approach the credit card companies or vice versa. We need to address this issue and find out how widespread the practice is and whether it is national in scope. 
   This legislation will eliminate unfair and arbitrary interest rate increases, end unfair penalties to cardholders who pay on time, and require the fair allocation of consumer payments. Moreover, it will help college students reduce their debt. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to again thank Chairwoman Maloney for introducing the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights legislation, and I support it.

   Today, we aspire to fulfill the vision of the Great Society that President Johnson envisioned for this Nation--in his words--a place where the meaning of man's life matches the marvels of man's labor. 
   Early on in his life, President Johnson was exposed to the unacceptable inequities in our Nation's education system. As a teacher and a principal in Cotula, TX, President Johnson worked with impoverished Hispanic students for whom the dream of pursuing higher education was all but out of reach. He saw a nation failing to live up to its potential because it failed to develop the talents of its low-income and minority citizens. He vowed not to rest until America's opportunities were open and accessible to everyone. 
   It is a fitting tribute to name the Department of Education headquarters after the President who brought us the Head Start Program, the Higher Education Act and student financial aid, as well as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which today we know as the No Child Left Behind Act. 
   Under his watch, our Nation made a commitment to education so that opportunity and success would no longer be determined by family wealth or the color of one's skin. 
   President Johnson was a visionary and a patriot. For me, a member of the Education and Labor Committee, he was a hero. 
   I urge all my colleges to support H.R. 584.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3221, the New Direction For Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act.  
   This important legislation puts our Nation on a new course in energy policy--a course towards additional energy supply, energy efficiency, conservation, environmental stewardship, and a leadership role in the worldwide effort to confront global warming. 
   This legislation trains our workforce to provide the energy needs of future generations. Through the ``Green Jobs'' program, our Nation will train workers to manufacture sources of renewable energy and energy efficiency. We will also re-tool our economy and our workforce to bring about a diversified energy supply while assisting at-risk youth in developing the skills needed to join a new green economy. 
   This bill returns the United States to a leadership role in the international effort to halt climate change. As the world's leading economy and a largest emitter of greenhouse gas, our Nation must participate in negotiating new international treaties and agreements on the environment. The new Ambassador-at-Large for Global Climate Change will work to build consensus in the global community on this international problem. 
   The planet will be protected from global warming only through global cooperation and effort. This bill will task the State Department with attaining binding emissions reduction commitments from all major emitters, including China, India, and Brazil. 
   This monumental legislation is only the first step in bringing America towards a cleaner, safer, and productive future. I wish to acknowledge Chairman MILLER of the Education and Labor Committee, Chairman LANTOS of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and all the other Committee Chairs for their strong leadership in drafting this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2272, AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. I rise in strong support of the Conference Report on H.R. 2272, the America COMPETES Act. 
   There has been a steady drumbeat across the country to call the nation to action to renew its leadership in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The National Academies of Science Report, ``Rising above the Gathering Storm'' has become the rallying cry that Sputnik was a generation ago. 
   Today, with the passage of this conference report, the 110th Congress answers the call. 
   The America COMPETES Act ensures that American students, teachers, businesses, and workers are prepared to continue leading the world in innovation, research, and technology well into the future. It takes a comprehensive approach with investments in education, research and development. It moves us towards energy independence and harnesses the potential of small businesses to drive innovation. 
   The American COMPETES Act recognizes that America needs to draw on all of its talent--especially a growing population of minority students who continue to be under-represented in the STEM fields. 
   According to the U.S. Census, 39 percent of the population under the age of 18 is a racial or ethnic minority. That percentage is on a path to pass 50 percent by the year 2050, Yet, in 2000, only 4.4 percent of the science and engineering jobs were held by African Americans and only 3.4 percent by Hispanics. Women constitute over half of the postsecondary students in the nation, but represent a little more than one-quarter of our science and engineering workforce. 
   The America COMPETES Act tackles these disparities head on. Throughout the legislation, there is an emphasis on increasing the numbers of minorities and women in the STEM fields and on expanding the minority-serving institutions' participation in education, research and development. 
   The America COMPETES Act makes strategic investments in improving the STEM pipeline through education. 
   This legislation invests in 25,000 new teachers through professional development, summer training institutes, graduate education assistance, and scholarships through NSF's Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and Math and Science Partnerships Program. In exchange for their scholarship, these teachers go to our highest need schools. 
   The America COMPETES Act includes provisions modeled after the successful U-Teach program at the University of Texas where students earn degrees in the STEM fields and teaching certificates at the same time. These newly minted teachers are placed, mentored, and supported in the schools where they are needed the most. 
   This legislation expands access to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs. It also establishes P-16 councils to coordinate education and workforce goals with industry and community leaders, and to identify the challenges of recruiting and retaining students in innovative fields. 
   I am especially pleased that this legislation addresses a quiet crisis in our high need high schools--the lack of quality laboratory science opportunities. 
   The National Research Council's report on America's High School Labs found that experience in high school labs was poor for most students and practically non-existent for students in low-income or minority communities. We will never produce enough STEM professionals if we do not address this issue. 
   I am very pleased that the legislation before us today includes the provisions of my bill, H.R. 524 Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science Act. This legislation will establish a pilot program that will partner high need school districts with colleges and universities, and the private sector to improve high school laboratories. Through these pilots, we will be able to develop models and test effective practices for improving laboratory science in high need schools. We will leverage resources from the local community and the private sector, and build on our base of knowledge of what works in teaching science. 
   The America COMPETES Act is about our vision for the future of this country. It is about our belief in this nation's unlimited potential and our willingness to invest in it. 
   I would like to commend Chairman GORDON, Chairman MILLER and all of the members of the conference committee for their excellent work. 
   I urge my colleague to unanimously pass this legislation.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5524, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act. 
   I would like to thank my two good friends, Representative JOHN YARMUTH from Kentucky and Representative JUDY BIGGERT from Illinois, for their strong leadership on this important legislation to my district in south Texas and to the whole Nation. 
   An estimated 2.8 million youth under the age of 17 experience a homeless situation each year. Many more young adults under the age of 24 find themselves without a place to call home. 
   Our Nation's homeless youth are exposed to some of the harshest elements imaginable. They are exposed to the harsh elements of hot and cold weather. These homeless youth are exposed to the harsh elements of crime, of abuse and exploitation on the street. They are vulnerable to illness and physical trauma. 
   These homeless youth are deprived of the protective and nurturing elements that come with a home and a strong supportive family. They are robbed of the supports necessary for a productive adulthood. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act will reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which provides support to youth through basic centers and shelters, transitional living programs and street outreach. This is the only Federal law targeted solely to unaccompanied youth. 
   I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and would like to thank the authors for including many of the provisions to improve the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act from legislation I introduced last summer. H.R. 3409, the Place to Call Home Act, is included in this bill. 
   Homelessness among our Nation's youth will persist until all sectors of society, including the Congress, declare that a safe place to live and a connection to permanent and loving families and communities are basic needs we will ensure for all young people. This legislation is one significant step in that direction. 
   I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5524, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 361, a bill that will authorize a number of projects which will improve irrigation and water conservation throuhgout the Rio Grande Valley. I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Chairwoman Napolitano as well as my colleagues from the Texas Border Region, Congressmen Ortiz, Reyes, Rodriguez, and Cuellar for their support in bringing this vitally important legislation onto the House floor. 
   I represent a region of the country that is experiencing phenomenal population growth yet is subject to severe periodic droughts. The 2000 Census showed that the population of Hidalgo County, in my district, increased by 48 percent. On the Mexican side of the border, millions have come to work in the maquiladoras and to take advantage of the economic boom that has come from NAFTA. 
   This growth has placed an enormous strain on water delivery systems throughout the Texas-Mexico border region. Water intended for irrigating crops flows through open dirt ditches where much of the precious water supply is lost to seepage and evaporation. Municipalities also rely on the water from these inefficient and outdated irrigation delivery systems to meet the water needs of growing communities. 
   H.R. 361 will authorize 19 projects that will allow border water districts to continue upgrading and modernizing our antiquated water delivery systems through the installation of water pipes and canal linings. Similar projects were authorized in the 106th and 107th Congresses.  
   The Rio Grande Valley has already made a great deal of progress because this has been a collaborative effort. The irrigation district have provided matching funds. The Texas Water Development Board and Texas A&M University have paid for many of the engineering studies. Federal appropriators have provided more than $10 million. As a result, we are seeing water savings of almost 80 percent in the projects that have been completed. 
   Most importantly, Federal authorization has allowed us to tap into the resources of the North American Development Bank. To date, NADBank has approved almost $24 million for these projects and passage of H.R. 361 will make these new projects eligible for NADBank assistance. 
   These funds are being put to good use. Numerous projects are already underway and some are almost completed. 
   When the metering system is fully installed, irrigation districts will have a much clearer picture of water usage and water savings. This data will be vital to improving water management throughout the region. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 5830. I believe that it is a well-balanced measure that will go a long way towards turning around the housing crisis and address the issues that have resulted in a nationwide economic crisis. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am especially pleased with title II of the bill which establishes a long-needed Office of Housing Counseling within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I commend Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Waters for including it in their bill. 
   I sincerely appreciate the fact that community-based organizations with expertise in the field of housing counseling will be given a voice in the development of such policies. I am pleased that the bill provides for the building of capacity to provide housing counseling services in areas that lack sufficient services such as large parts of my district in the Rio Grande Valley and in rural America in general. 
   Moreover, I applaud Chairman Frank and Congresswoman Waters for including in the bill the authorization of $3 million for public service announcements as part of the act's national public service multimedia campaign. This campaign will help persons facing mortgage foreclosure, elderly persons, persons who face language barriers, and low-income persons. 
   I want to take this opportunity to thank them for increasing the availability, affordability, and quality of housing in rural America. And I believe this bill will do more of the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the product Chairman Frank and Congresswoman Waters have brought to the floor will result in more homeowners remaining in their homes and help stabilize the housing market. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment being offered by my colleague, Ms. Brown-Waite. 
   I want to prevent criminals and terrorists from coming into this county. I believe we should enforce our immigration laws. As a lifelong resident of the border region, I also know how interdependent border communities are on movement back and forth. Families live on both sides of the border. People cross back and forth to shop, go to school, and attend church. Endangered and unique species of birds and wildlife need access to habitat found on both sides of the border to survive. 
   A physical fence along the portion of the U.S.-Mexico border that I represent would be devastating. It would cut off livestock from access to our scarce water resources and hinder the ability of our irrigation districts to get water to our farmers. It would require the condemnation of private property. 
   It would undo everything that has been done and the millions that have been spent over the last few decades to create Federal wildlife refuges and parks to protect unique habitat. It will destroy our new multi-million dollar ecotourism industry. I ask unanimous consent to include in the RECORD an article from the Houston Press on the environmental and economic impact of the fence in the Rio Grande Valley. 
   We just learned this week that the proposed fence would divide the University of Texas Brownsville in half leaving part of the campus on the wrong side. 
   Our residents are protected from flooding by a levee system that is in disrepair and would become even less effective by the addition of fencing. Fences would inhibit the ability of our first responders and emergency coordinators to evacuate people during natural disasters. 
   A physical fence tells the people of Mexico: We don't want you. Keep the billions of dollars you would have spent in our stores and restaurants. Don't come here and help create the jobs that have finally brought my district's unemployment rate down from 23 percent to 7 percent. 
   If all of these arguments don't sway you, then maybe fiscal reality will. A physical fence is three times more expensive than a virtual fence. We will spend billions upon billions of dollars building this physical fence. My constituents don't understand why this Congress can find such huge sums to build a fence that could destroy the border economy and take away their jobs, yet we can't find $100 million to fix their levees and save millions of lives or a few million dollars to build them the veteran's hospital for which they have been begging for years. Frankly, I don't have a good answer for them. 
   We have the technology to create a virtual fence. The money saved by not constructing a physical fence could be used to hire more Border Patrol agents and law enforcement personnel who are still going to be needed even if we build a physical fence. 
   At the very least, my communities, who are going to have to live with the consequences of this fence, should be able to have their concerns heard and taken seriously before a fence is constructed. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (FINANCIAL LITERACY MONTH 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, personal financial management skills and lifelong habits begin to develop during childhood. It is essential that we begin preparing our youth as early as possible to make informed financial choices, as well as manage money, credit, debt, and risk, and become responsible workers, heads of household, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and citizens. 
   We need to begin working closely with the Department of Education in States and localities to ensure that we begin the financial literacy learning process at least by the time a child enters kindergarten, and we need to work with the States to encourage them to require some form of financial literacy as a required part of the education curriculum. 
   Policymakers of both parties at the local, State, and Federal levels recently have increased their focus on financial literacy and economic education issues because national surveys from such groups as Jump$tart, the National Council on Economic Education, and the National Federation for Credit Counseling reveal troubling gaps in students' and the public's knowledge of these subjects. 
   Economic competency and financial literacy skills are critical for individuals to make sound decisions regarding home ownership, in savings, investment, credit and borrowing, as well as retirement planning. An educated and literate populace will strengthen the national economy as individuals improve their own economic well-being. 
   Mr. Speaker, our government should lead by example. We should coordinate and communicate a unified message on financial literacy across this Nation. We should authorize and appropriate such funds as necessary to create a broad-based public awareness campaign comprised of a substantial mass market, multimedia effort in support of a national financial literacy initiative on the scale of the ``Truth'' campaign developed through the Public Education Fund to discourage smoking among young people. 
   Furthermore, I believe that the National Endowment on Financial Education and several other financial literacy nonprofits and community-based groups would agree with me. In 2004, Congress passed a bill known as the FACT Act. One of the provisions in that act required Treasury and a Financial Literacy Commission to create such a campaign. It is now 2008, and Treasury has failed. So now it's our turn to take back control of the situation. 
   We can introduce legislation authorizing funds for such a national multimedia financial literacy campaign. The National Endowment on Financial Education recently completed one that was a success. I hope that all of my colleagues will support such legislation once it has been introduced. 
   Mr. Speaker, some disturbing facts. The personal savings rate in the United States was a negative 1 percent at the end of 2006, and it was zero percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007, which puts it among the lowest level since the government began collecting  the savings rate data in 1959. Although more than 42 million people living in the U.S. participate in 401(k) plans, a Retirement Confidence Survey conducted in 2004 found that only 42 percent of workers surveyed have calculated how much money they will need to save for retirement, and only 37 percent of workers say that they are not currently saving for retirement. 
   Even more disturbing is the fact that the average baby boomer has only $50,000 in savings, apart from equity in their home, and the first wave of baby boomers have already entered their retirement years. This is unbelievable and dangerous to our economy and our way of life. 
   Something I want to discuss at length, Mr. Speaker, is the plight of what are known as the ``unbanked.'' As many as 10 million households in the United States are unbanked, without access to mainstream financial products and services. This is a very common occurrence in my congressional district. People tend to operate in a cash society along the Texas Mexico-border. If these individuals were to buy their goods and services by drawing down funds from a checking or a savings account, they would eventually be incorporated into the entire mainstream financial system. By doing so, they would establish credit. Lenders would have access to their credit reports and scores, and this would hopefully result in these previously unbanked persons attaining the American Dream of homeownership. 
   Unfortunately, even when these formally unbanked individuals finally have the ways and means to purchase a home, they quickly discover that they have to protect themselves from predatory lenders. I believe that the legislation that Chairman Frank and the Committee on Financial Services is crafting will help low-income individuals who have been duped by unscrupulous salespersons, which has resulted in the current economic crisis. Chairman Frank definitely has his finger on the pulse of this problem, and he will make sure the train stays on the track. 
   I salute Congresswoman Biggert for her work on this issue. Six years ago, to address all of these financial literacy problems, my colleague and good friend and staunch supporter of financial literacy, Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT, and I cofounded and currently cochair the Congressional Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus. The caucus seeks to address these issues head-on by increasing public awareness of poor financial literacy rates and working to find the ways and means to improve them. 
   The caucus has helped promote policies that advance financial literacy and economic education. Together, we have done so by connecting Members of Congress with Federal agencies that can help them teach financial literacy at town hall meetings, through financial literacy e-newsletters, financial literacy fairs, financial football, the stock market game, and many more activities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to commend my colleagues and friends, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and Congressman DON PAYNE, for all that they are doing to improve financial literacy. With a solid background knowledge of financial literacy, America's youth can become responsible employees, heads of household, investors, entrepreneurs, and business leaders.     
   Parents and teachers need to teach our youth to start saving young, stay insured, budget their money, not borrow what they cannot repay, and especially avoid excessive credit card debt and the credit card sharks that prey on students on every college campus across the United States. 
   Before I close, Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank Congresswoman Biggert for working with me over the years on financial literacy. It is a pleasure to work with you and to be able to accomplish so much in just a few years. 
   I also want to commend her staff, Nicole Austin and Zach Cikanek, for their dedication to the financial literacy cause. I want to also express my sincere appreciation for the assistance Denise Wilson of our Committee on Government Reform provided my staff. I applaud the staff from America's credit unions, who made presentations to young people at local schools on financial topics such as student loans, balancing a checkbook and auto loans during National Credit Union Youth Week, which was held the week of April 20 of this year. 
   I also want to commend the American Bankers Association Education Foundation for holding their annual Teach Children to Save Day. Today, April 29, just happens to be Teach Children to Save Day. It is my understanding that over 12,000 bankers from 1,100 bank branches signed up to host financial literacy events today. Furthermore, I understand that tomorrow is El Dia de los Ninos, and they too will be exposed to financial literacy education in English and in Spanish. Many American children will share financial literacy lessons with approximately 435,000 students, which is quite an endeavor, but one which they can accomplish under the direction of Kathryn Kelly.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, today I am offering an amendment to the housing counseling amendment that I passed in committee. Today's amendment will permit States to seek a waiver of the in-person pre-purchase housing counseling requirement if the person obtaining the mortgage lives in a remote area of the country, which includes the majority of rural America. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  
   Mr. Chairman, during the Financial Services Committee mark up of H.R. 1427, I offered an amendment to the Affordable Housing Fund section of H.R. 1427 that requires that homebuyers who fall below 50 percent of the median income obtain pre-purchase in-person housing counseling. The Committee adopted the amendment by voice vote. 
   My amendment recognizes the fact that we have a very unstable housing market at the moment. 
   It also acknowledges that minorities are becoming victims of predatory lending, and that the poorest of the poor, which includes a considerable percentage of my congressional district and other rural districts, need financial literacy in general--and in-person housing counseling in particular--before they enter into any kind of loan agreement. 
   The amendment that passed in committee does not require any funding from the Affordable Housing Fund. The funding for such counseling usually comes from the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the States. My amendment merely requires that existing counseling information be provided in-person for those who fall below 50 percent of the median income, which tends to be renters. 
   Today, I am offering an amendment to the housing counseling amendment that passed in committee. Today's amendment will permit states to seek a waiver of the in-person pre-purchase housing counseling requirement if the person obtaining that mortgage lives in a remote area of the country, which includes the majority of rural America. 
   The alternative forms of housing counseling may include interactive telephone counseling, on-line counseling, interactive video conferencing, or interactive home study counseling. A complete waiver of the counseling requirement under Section (g)(2)(d) may be granted only for borrowers for whom it is not possible to provide such alternative forms of counseling. Very few households meet this criteria. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe that this amendment No. 21, provides states with the appropriate waiver authority they need to take into account the difficulties of providing in-person housing counseling, Financial Literacy Education, to those living in remote areas of the United States. 
   I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 21.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act. This legislation is long overdue. I would like to commend Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon and Subcommittee Chairman Kildee and Ranking Member Castle for working together to craft bipartisan legislation that will significantly improve the Head Start Program, especially for Hispanic and migrant farm worker families. 
   It is my hope that this spirit of bipartisanship will carry the legislation all the way to the President's desk for his signature. I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1429.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act. 
   This legislation is long overdue. I would like to commend Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon and Subcommittee Chairman Kildee and Ranking Member Castle for working together to craft bipartisan legislation that will significantly improve the Head Start program--especially for Hispanic and migrant farm worker families. 
   It is my hope that this spirit of bipartisanship will carry the legislation all the way to the President's desk for his signature. 
   It is also my hope that this body will reject any attempts to allow discrimination to infect the Heat Start program--whether the discrimination is based on religion or on the language that is spoken at home. 
   The bill before us today strengthens ``Head Start'' for Hispanics and families whose primary language is not English. 
   Here are just a few of the highlights: The bill increases the base funding for Migrant and Seasonal Head Start to a minimum of 5 percent of the overall Head Start funding, which means that more farm worker children will be in preschool instead of in the fields; the bill sets standards for communications with limited English proficient (LEP) parents so that language is not a barrier to Head Start access. 
   It instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study of how Head Start programs serve LEP populations. It enhances Head Start transitions for LEP children to kindergarten. 
   It provides technical assistance resources for improving the quality of Head Start services for LEP populations, particularly in communities that have 
   experienced a rapid and large increase in Head Start eligible LEP children. 
   It improves ensures that LEP children have access to linguistically and culturally appropriate instructional services that support proficiency in the English language and gains in other domains important for school readiness, including pre-literacy and numeracy skills. 
   It addresses the shortage of qualified teachers with expertise in serving LEP children by establishing a teacher career ladder demonstration program at Hispanic-serving Institutions and tribally-controlled Colleges and Universitites. 
   Tehese are significant improvements to the Head Start Program. Again, I would like to thank the chair and ranking member for working with us to include them in the bill before us today. 
   I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1429.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1867, legislation to reauthorize the National Science Foundation, and of this amendment that will give Hispanic-serving institutions, what we refer to as HSIs, the support they need to prepare our next generation of scientists, engineers and mathematicians. 
   I would like to thank my colleagues, Congressman Jerry McNerney of California, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, and Congressman Joe Crowley of New York for bringing this amendment forward. It will make a great difference. 
   The McNerney-Giffords-Crowley amendment allows the National Science Foundation to establish a competitive, merit-based program to award grants to HSIs for science, technology, engineering and mathematics education. This program seeks to enhance the quality of undergraduate science, mathematics and engineering education and increase the retention and graduation rates for undergraduate students pursuing STEM degrees at 2-year and 4-year HSIs. The initiative will support curriculum and faculty development in STEM areas; stipends for undergraduate students participating in research; and funding for instrumentation purposes. 
   HSIs are the gateways for post-secondary education for most Hispanic students. Despite having fewer resources than other institutions, HSIs are among the top producers of our new Hispanic STEM professionals. Yet, these vital institutions are often overlooked, or at best, seen as junior partners in our national research and education enterprise. This amendment helps give HSIs the attention they deserve. 
   I applaud the leadership of Chairman Gordon, of Chairman Baird, Ranking Member Hall and Ranking Member Ehlers for their bipartisan commitment to ensuring the United States remains competitive in science, technology engineering and mathematics, better known as the STEM fields. 
   The Science and Technology Committee has acted with the sense of urgency that we should all share in order to put our Nation back on track to lead the world in the STEM fields. The National Science Foundation is central to developing our national capacity for research and innovation. 
   I am particularly pleased that this bill emphasizes our need to develop our human capital in the STEM fields. I would also like to thank my colleague and friend Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson for her work in including an amendment to require strategic planning for the education and human resources mission of the foundation so that we fully develop our STEM talent across all fields and all communities, especially those that have been historically underrepresented. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment for HSIs strengthens that education and human resources mission. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill, H.R. 1867.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act. I especially want to thank Chairman George Miller and ranking member Buck McKeon and all the others who have worked with us to be able to resolve the challenge of access and affordability to higher education to all those who wish to go to that level of education. 
   This is urgent legislation, and I thank the leadership in both the House and the Senate for ensuring its swift passage. We are all united in our commitment to provide every assurance to students and families that there will be no disruption in the Federal student loan programs, regardless of what is happening in the financial markets in our country. 
   As of today, no student has been unable to find a lender for a Federal student loan. However, we are not going to wait until students and families are denied loans before putting safeguards in place. Today is the day that many incoming freshman students must decide which college they will attend in  the fall. Financial aid is a critical consideration for that decision process. We can leave no doubt in the minds of students, families or campuses about the availability of that aid. That is why we must send this legislation to the President for his signature without delay. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will provide much-needed liquidity to the student loan marketplace by authorizing the Secretary of Education on a temporary basis to purchase student loans so that lenders have the funds to make new loans. The legislation clarifies the lender-of-last-resort option so that, if called upon, guaranty agencies will be able to fulfill their role as lender of last resort as required under the Higher Education Act. 
   The legislation will reduce the reliance on private loans to fill the gap between Federal student aid and the cost of college by increasing the amount a student can borrow in the unsubsidized loan program. 
   This contingency plan for the student loan marketplace will come at no cost to the taxpayers. In fact, any savings that may be generated will be directed to the Academic Competitiveness and SMART grants that are available to needy students who complete a rigorous program of study in high school and those students who are pursuing majors in high-need fields, such as science, engineering, technology and foreign languages.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report for HR 4137, the Higher Education Opportunity Act. 
   We are near the end of our long journey to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. I would like to personally thank all of the members of the conference committee, especially our leaders, Chairman TED KENNEDY, Chairwoman MIKULSKI, Senator Enzi, Chairman George Miller, Representative BUCK MCKEON, and Representative RIC KELLER, for their commitment to producing a bipartisan, forward-looking bill that will update our existing higher education programs and address emerging needs. 
   I thank all the committee staff members in both the majority and minority who worked with great commitment to getting the job done. They had a mindset that told me that they didn't know it couldn't be done, ``and that is why we did it.'' 
   In the Higher Education Opportunity Act, we are taking significant steps to improve our student aid delivery system, ensure the integrity of our student loan programs, and provide students and families with the tools that they need to make informed choices about which college to attend and how to finance it. These are complex issues, and on a bipartisan, bicameral basis we have come together to offer some practical solutions. We couldn't have done it if we had not worked together. 
   I am particularly proud of the provisions that will help our veterans and active duty military have full access to the education benefits that are due to them. The provision to establish veterans' centers and veteran student support teams on college campuses will help our veterans get the full benefit of the GI bill expansion that we just enacted. 
   Finally, I would like to highlight the great progress we have made in strengthening minority serving institutions. After 10 years of waiting, Hispanic serving institutions will have support for graduate programs leading to masters and doctoral degrees. We are addressing the urgent needs for teachers and college faculty with an emphasis on building the capacity of minority serving institutions to meet this need. We will leverage minority serving institutions to engage more youth in science and technology. The Higher Education Opportunity Act represents real progress for our communities. 
   In closing, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for helping us reach this point. I hope we can get this legislation, which measures over one foot, with over 1,100 pages, to the President's desk as soon as possible.

   This has been an enormous undertaking. The last reauthorization of the Higher Education act took place during my first term in Congress over 10 years ago. 
   We began this Congress with a series of hearings focused on the steps we needed to take to improve access and affordability in higher education and to position our Nation and our students too at the leading edge of the global economy. We asked the higher education community and all of our members to come forward with new ideas. This bill reflects the creativity and innovation that makes a U.S. college education sought after in all parts of the world. 
   Last fall, we enacted into law the largest increase in Federal student aid since the GI bill with the College Cost Reduction Act. 
   In the Higher Education Opportunity Act, we are taking significant steps to improve our student aid delivery system, ensure the integrity of our student loan programs, and provide students and families with the tools that they need to make informed choices about which college to attend and how to finance it.

   Finally, I would like to highlight the great progress we have made in strengthening minority-serving institutions. With over 40 percent of our public school children being racial or ethnic minorities and nearly half of all minority students attending minority-serving institutions, we are taking some very important steps in this legislation to build our capacity in this critical area. After 10 years of waiting, Hispanic-Serving Institutions will have support for graduate programs. We built on the foundation that we established in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act for Asian and Pacific Islander-serving institutions, predominantly Black Colleges and Universities, tribally-controlled colleges and universities, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We are addressing the urgent need for teachers and college faculty with an emphasis on building the capacity of minority-serving institutions to meet this need. We will leverage minority-serving institutions to engage more youth in the sciences and technology. The Higher Education Opportunity Act represents real progress for our communities

   None of us will forget that horrific day 6 years ago when, in the face of this Nation's worst tragedy, America pulled together to reaffirm our commitment to freedom and democracy. 
   We will also never forget the heroic actions of our first responders who risked and sacrificed their lives to save their fellow Americans on that day. Yet our first responders were not the only heroes that day. 
   Office workers, airplane passengers, and ordinary citizens also showed the true spirit of America by assisting their co-workers to evacuate burning buildings and preventing a hijacked plane from being used as a weapon against our country. 
   Finally, I commend the heroic service provided by our Armed Services in battling the forces of terrorism around the world. 
   Whether the mission is engaging al Qaeda and the Taliban in the mountains of Afghanistan or transporting food and shelter to victims of the tsunami near Indonesia, our military has proved again and again to be worthy of our praise and admiration. At great risk to their own personal safety, our service members have bravely acted on our behalf to protect our national security and to build goodwill throughout the world. 
   As Members of Congress, we debate the issues confronting our Nation on a daily basis. By supporting this resolution, however, I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in reaffirming our commitment to defending the people of the United States against any and all future challenges.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 362, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Act. 
   Today, this body will take up two bills that represent a bipartisan effort to implement the recommendations in the watershed report, ``Rising above the Gathering Storm.'' 
   I would like to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for their leadership in bringing these critical measures to us today. 
   H.R. 362 will address our competitiveness crisis at its foundation, our acute shortage of teachers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, commonly known as the STEM fields. 
   Low-income, rural and minority communities bear a disproportionate share of the national shortfall of highly qualified STEM teachers. We must reverse that inequity. The 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Act will help us do exactly that. 
   H.R. 362 also addresses a quiet crisis in our high-need high schools, the lack of quality laboratory science opportunities. 
   The National Research Council's report on America's high school labs found that experience in high school labs was poor for most students and practically nonexistent for students in low-income or minority communities. We will never produce enough STEM professionals if we do not address this issue and invest the correct amount of money. 
   I am very pleased that the legislation before us today includes the provisions of my bill, H.R. 524, Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science Act. This legislation will establish a pilot program that will partner high-need school districts with colleges and universities and the private sector to improve high school laboratories. 
   Through these pilot programs, we will be able to develop models and test effective practices for improving laboratory science in high-need schools. We will leverage resources from the local community and the private sector and build on our base of knowledge of what works in teaching science. 
   I would especially like to thank my friend and colleague, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), for working with me to move the PALS Act forward.

   This legislation is very important to many parts of Texas. As you know, when they redrew the lines of the Congressmen in Texas, I was given a 375-mile-long geographic area that had 90 communities. The greatest majority, 90 percent, were small rural communities who were asking when is Congress going to recognize the great need that we have for housing assistance? 
   And I want to give you just one example of the route that I mentioned, Proyecto Azteca, which is one where people build their own homes. They provide the labor to build those homes with the supervision of some professional supervisors in construction of residential homes. The only assistance that we give them is the purchasing of the materials, the building materials, which amounts to about $30,000. And I wish you could see these homes. I wish you could see the fine work that is done in these three-bedroom, one-bath homes that many have been built in our area with this type of assistance. 
   So I give this example because there are many serving in Congress who have never visited colonias like those that are in some parts of the southwestern part of the United States. 
   So I say that this type of legislation is something that is going to go a long ways in helping provide many, many more affordable homes.

For that reason, I greatly appreciate the work of Senators Schumer and Biden, as well as my colleagues Congressman Capuano and Congresswoman McCarthy, in bringing this legislation forward. 
   Several months ago, my constituents began reporting to me that they were not receiving the passports they needed for spring and summer travel from the State Department within the Department's own posted timelines. As spring has turned to summer, many Americans have been unable to travel abroad and have missed many business, educational, and vacation opportunities as a result of the State Department's failure to provide them with required travel documents. 
   This bill will help to ease the backlog of passport applications caused by the State Department's mismanagement by allowing retired workers to voluntarily return to work without jeopardizing their pension eligibility. These volunteers will provide immediate assistance to the thousands of American travelers who have requested their travel documentation in a timely manner and expect the State Department to facilitate their travel plans.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (RECOGNIZING ANN RICHARDS' EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO TEXAS AND AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 42 offered by my colleague and neighbor Congressman SOLOMON ORTIZ. Governor Ann Richards was a woman of incomparable spirit, wit, intelligence, and heart. She was a trailblazer who opened the world of public service and politics to women and minorities in her beloved home state of Texas, as well as throughout the country. 
   I remember her most for her commitment to my constituents in South Texas. In 1993, Governor Richards signed the bill to create South Texas Community College, now South Texas College. 
   Without Governor Richards' direct insight and involvement in granting us a three year waiver in not requiring a taxing district, the creation of the school simply would not have been possible. Today, the college, with 17,000 students, is responsible for contributing to our local economy through workforce and job training programs, has directly contributed to the drop in the region's unemployment rate, and extends education opportunities for so many students. She also helped to streamline the state's government and helped create programs and opportunities for Texas' economy to flourish at a time when the country's languished. 
   It is incumbent upon all of US to continue the legacy started by Ann Richards decades ago. We need to lend voice to the disadvantaged and disenfranchised; give americans a leg-up, not a hand-out; and, create opportunities for all to participate in their government. It is a legacy she was proud of, and one I will not forget. She will be missed by so many, and especially by me. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation honoring such a great lady.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (PELL GRANT EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join Chairman MILLER and Ranking Members MCKEON and KELLER in cosponsoring the Pell Grant Equity Act. I would like to thank them for their leadership in bringing this bill forward without delay. 
   Currently low-income students who attend low-cost institutions have their Pell Grants reduced because of the provision called ``tuition sensitivity'' in current law. It is contrary to common sense and our shared goals of providing access to higher education for low-income students to systematically reduce the grant aid for the neediest students who often attend low-cost institutions because they are more affordable. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, our action today will benefit 96,000 low-income students and increase their Pell grant by an average of $108. When you are a low-income student, every penny counts and this increase will make a real difference. 
   The colleges in my congressional district serve some of the lowest income students and families in the Nation. They work very hard to keep tuition low and limit increases to a minimum. This legislation will ensure that their efforts to contain costs are not undone by aid policy that reduces the Pell Grant because the institution charges low tuition. 
   The Pell Grant Equity Act will immediately lift tuition sensitivity for the upcoming academic year. As we move towards the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, we will make this repeal permanent and put all low-income students on an equal footing in the Pell grant program. 
   I look forward to continuing this spirit of bipartisanship as we consider the rest of the Higher Education Act and thank my colleagues for treating this issue with the sense of urgency it deserves. 
   I strongly encourage all my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this conference report. 
   Today, the payoff for investing in education is even greater and the stakes are higher. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act will open the doors of higher ed to a new generation of students. This is our moment to take a stand for our future competitiveness and prosperity. Investment in Pell Grants is increased significantly. 
   It supports college success for first generation, low-income students by dedicating additional resources to Upward Bound and College Access Challenge grants. It invests in our public servants and in our teachers. 
   I am particularly proud of our work to strengthen the institutions that are the gateway of access to higher ed for minority students. 
   Through this legislation, we will increase funding over several years by $510 million in HSIs, HBCUs, tribal colleges, Native Hawaiian institutions and newly designated predominantly black institutions, as well as institutions serving Asian Americans. 
   I commend Chairman Miller, Senator Kennedy and all my House colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the Education and Labor Committee for their hard work and leadership in crafting the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. It has been my privilege to work on this legislation. 
   This conference report has already been passed in the Senate, and I'm very happy about that. I urge my colleagues to support this conference report.  
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this conference report. H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, represents the largest investment in college access since the GI bill. Over the next 5 years, we will increase our federal support for higher education by $20 billion. This is a once in a generation opportunity. 
   I can still remember when, college was not even in the realm of possibility for people who came from communities like mine. That was until the GI bill opened our college campuses to our returning veterans--rich, poor, black, Hispanic--they all had a shot at the American Dream of a college education. Our nation became smarter, stronger and richer as a result of this egalitarian investment in education. 
   Today, the pay off for investing in education is even greater and the stakes are higher. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act will open the doors of higher education to a new generation of students. This is our moment to take a stand for our future competitiveness and prosperity. Investment in ``Pell Grants'' is increased significantly! The College Cost Reduction and Access Act is a strategic package of investments to expand higher education opportunities. It guarantees a minimum increase of $1090 in the maximum Pell grant over the next 5 years--reversing the last five years of stagnant funding. 
   It supports college success for first-generation, low-income students by dedicating additional resources to Upward Bound and College Access Challenge grants. It invests in our public servants and in our teachers. 
   I am particularly proud of our work to strengthen the institutions that are the gateways of access to higher education for minority students. Through this legislation, we will increase funding over several years by $510 million dollars in HSIs, HBCUs, tribal colleges; Native Hawaiian Institutions, and newly designated predominantly Black Institutions; and Institutions serving Asian Americans. 
   Some on the other side will say that we are investing in institutions at the expense of students. This argument reflects a fundamental lack of understanding of the communities that will fuel the growth in our workforce and the need to develop their capacity to provide higher education opportunities. 
   The 2007 Condition of Education reports that 42 percent of our public school children are racial or ethnic minorities--one in five is Hispanic. HSIs, HBCUs, and other minority-serving institutions are only going to grow in their importance for ensuring that our nation continues to have enough college graduates to fill the jobs in our knowledge-based economy. They are a worthy investment. 
   I commend Chairman MILLER, Senator KENNEDY and all of my House colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee for their hard work and leadership in crafting the ``College Cost Reduction and Access Act''. It has been my privilege to work on this legislation. This conference report has already passed in the Senate!  
   I urge my colleagues to support this conference report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of an issue of great importance to both the Nation and my congressional district in south Texas. 
   As a life-long resident of the southern border region, America's relationship with Mexico is of great importance to me, to my constituents, our chambers of commerce and economic development corporations. 
   For far too long, our Nation has focused its attention upon far-away lands on the other side of the world while our relationship with our closest of neighbors has languished. While current and past administrations shoulder much of the blame for our history of inattention to Mexico, Congress has been complicit in this failure. 
   When our Nation has needed to show compassion and understanding for the Mexican people, this Congress has been unable to agree on a comprehensive immigration plan befitting our American heritage. When our Nation should be celebrating our partnership and common interests with a close geographic ally, this Congress has literally built a wall between ourselves and Mexico. 
   This is no way to treat a friend and neighbor and actually our second largest trading partner. Although not a solution to all of the deficiencies in our relationship with Mexico, the Merida Initiative is a step in the right direction. Border residents are keenly aware of the violence and dangers of the drug trade and the criminal networks that span our continent. While based within Mexico, these criminal cartels are an affliction of the entire continent and must be addressed through national partnerships and cooperation. 
   We were there in Monterrey yesterday with a large delegation of Members of Congress and the Senate and we heard from and had a great dialogue with the congressmen and senators of that country. They are the ones who are fighting this battle for us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. 
   This is urgent legislation. I would like to thank our Education and Labor chairman, GEORGE MILLER, and our ranking member, HOWARD ``BUCK'' MCKEON, as well as my good friend and ranking member of the subcommittee, RIC KELLER, for working together to expedite consideration of this bill.     
   Nothing is more important than reassuring students and families that there  will be no disruption in the availability of Federal student loans, regardless of what happens in our financial markets. As of today, no student has been unable to find a lender for a Federal student loan. However, we are not going to wait until students and families are denied loans before putting safeguards in place. That is what we are doing here today. 
   Ensuring continued access to Federal student loans is of critical importance. In my congressional district, 40 percent of all student aid comes from the Federal Family Education Loan Program, and in my State of Texas 66 percent of all student aid comes through this program. The concerns that we are hearing from our constituents are real, and we need to address them. 
   Mr. Chairman, I include for the record a letter dated April 7, 2008, from Texas State Senator Judith Zaffirini, Chair of the Higher Education Subcommittee, urging Congress to take action to avert any disruption in the Federal Family Education Loan Program.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. I thank my friend and colleague, JIM MATHESON, for yielding time to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 94, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Consumer Protection Week. I introduced this resolution with my good friend, Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT, a few weeks ago. And I want to thank Majority Leader Hoyer for bringing the resolution to the floor in such a timely manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, in addition I want to take a moment to take this opportunity to thank the leadership on Energy and Commerce for moving this resolution through their committee quickly after a thorough review by committee staff, especially Consuela Washington, Pete Goodloe, and Brian McCullough. I also want to thank legislative counsel, Brady Young, and Harry Savage for facilitating passage of this important resolution.  
   Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT and I have been collaborating for years on financial literacy, and together we strive to provide consumers with the information they need to make appropriate decisions. 
   As cofounders and cochairs of the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus, we will continue to reach out to the States, the local government, private sector, nonprofits and community-based organizations to improve financial literacy rates across the United States, which has become extremely important in light of the negative savings rate in the United States. 
   I am pleased that my staff and Zach Cikanek on Congresswoman Biggert's staff have jump-started our caucus so early this year, and I look forward to continuing our longstanding partnership. I encourage all of those Members of Congress watching us today to join the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus to help your constituents help protect themselves from fraud and identity theft. 
   To join, all you need to do is contact my office or the office of Congresswoman Biggert. For the past 8 years, local, State and Federal government agencies and national consumer advocacy organizations have worked together to provide as much protection as possible to consumers during what has been deemed National Consumer Protection Week. 
   They have all recognized the important role public and private organizations play in ensuring that the American consumer is protected from unfair practices. This week we here in Congress will finally join these organizations in supporting the goals and ideals of the ninth annual National Consumer Protection Week, which falls between February 4 and February 10 of this year. 
   I am pleased to inform my colleagues that this year's theme is ``Read up, reach out and be an informed consumer.'' This week will highlight consumer education efforts in the fight against fraud in communities across our Nation. 
   By gathering and sharing information, consumers and their friends and families can be more confident, savvy and safe in the marketplace. During this week, consumer protection partner organizations will provide practical and tactical tips so consumers can learn and teach others how to make well-informed purchase decisions, avoid scams, protect their personal information, and file a complaint. 
   Consumers can research and boost their marketplace IQ by accessing data at the National Consumer Protection Week section of the www.consumer.gov Web site. Some of the organizations that will participate in this week's activities include the Better Business Bureau, the Consumer Federation of America, the FDIC, and of course the Federal Trade Commission. 
   On Thursday of this week, February 8, 2007, the Federal Trade Commission, the FDIC and several other consumer-oriented government agencies will host a consumer protection fair for Capitol Hill staff as well as Members of Congress. The fair will be held in room 1302 Longworth beginning at 9 a.m. and running until noon. 
   Again, the fair will be held in room 1302 Longworth House Office Building, February 8, from 9 a.m. until noon. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this fair, orchestrated by the FTC and Derick Rill, its congressional liaison, will provide the materials our staff needs to teach our constituents how to prevent themselves from becoming victims of fraud and identity theft and will help improve their overall financial literacy.     
   Again, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this resolution that will benefit consumers across America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the reauthorization of the State Children Health Insurance Program. In the decade since its enactment, the SCHIP block grant program has exceeded expectations by providing quality health care to millions of American children. 
   In my state of Texas, over 20 percent of all children--that's approximately 1.4 million kids--are not covered by health insurance today. This means that 1.4 million young Texans have no access to adequate medical care and are not receiving the preventive or primary care they need to lead productive lives. This is a moral travesty and an unacceptable failure of our Nation's leadership. 
   The SCHIP program invests in our children and our future. Without adequate health care, our efforts to improve our educational and child care systems are less effective. Should our children not begin their lives in good health, they will surely be hampered by increasing medical problems as they reach adulthood. 
   The President has already demonstrated his unwillingness to make this commitment to America's children once. No one should withhold healthcare from children in order to score cheap political points or to make divisive partisan attacks. I urge my colleagues in Congress and President Bush to join together in support of American families and children by voting for the reauthorization of SCHIP.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3021, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public Schools Act. 
   It is high time that we include public schools on the list of critical infrastructure that requires significant Federal investment and support. 
   I would like to commend Congressman Ben Chandler of Kentucky and Chairmen Miller and Kildee for their leadership on this vital legislation. 
   Our public schools educate roughly 90 percent of children in the United States. 
   We are counting on our public schools to prepare the leaders and workforce of tomorrow. Yet according to several estimates the need for school construction and renovation is in the hundreds of billions of dollars--as much as $322 billion according to analysis from the National Education Association. 
   Worse, the students in the areas where the need for school modernization is most acute are minority students who now represent 43 percent of the total student population. Improving school facilities is also about improving educational opportunities and equality. 
   I am especially pleased that the manager's substitute includes specific language regarding the renovation and improvement of science and engineering laboratories in our schools. 52 percent of school principals reported having no science laboratory facilities in a National Center for Education Statistics survey. Simply put, we can never succeed in our national imperative to improve our competitiveness in the STEM fields if our children do not have the opportunity to experience and practice science and engineering. I would like to thank Chairman Miller and Chairman Kildee for working with me and my colleague from Vermont, Congressman Peter Welch to include the important provision in the bill before us today. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3021.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 406, in celebration of the accomplishments of title IX, the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act. I would like to thank my friend and colleague from Hawaii, Ms. Mazie Hirono, for bringing this to the House floor this week as we commemorate the 35th anniversary of this landmark legislation. 
   Title IX has forever changed the landscape of opportunity for women and girls. Since the enactment of title IX, the number of women participating in intercollegiate athletics has increased fivefold. The number of female high school athletes has grown by almost 900 percent. In 1972, just as title  IX was enacted, women earned merely 28 percent of the bachelor's degrees in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, better known as the STEM fields.     
   Today, women earn 49 percent of the bachelor's degrees in these fields. 
   On a personal point of privilege, I am proud to say that my four daughters, who are considering STEM fields as their professional careers, are proud to see that we remember Patsy Mink. 
   Despite these successes, we still have work to do to achieve the promises of full equality and freedom from discrimination that is at the heart of title IX. There are still gaps in support for women's athletics, gaps in participation in various disciplines in the STEM fields, and disparities in career and technical education programs. More critically, there is still much to be done to ensure that our educational institutions are free from sexual harassment. 
   It was a privilege to have served on the Education Committee with Congresswoman Patsy Mink of Hawaii, the original author of title IX. I joined her on the Committee of Education and also on the House floor to defend title IX and its reauthorization, and I am pleased to say we won. 
   It is up to us to honor her legacy and maintain the integrity of title IX, which simply states: ``No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.'' 
   As the father of four daughters, I reaffirm my commitment to title IX and the legacy of Patsy Mink today with this vote. I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution, H. Res. 406.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 890, the Student Loan Sunshine Act. This is the legislation that cannot wait. Given the daily revelations of scandals, conflicts of interest and cozy relationships that undermine public confidence in our student loan programs, it is imperative that we act now to restore integrity. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon, as well as the ranking member of the subcommittee from Florida, Ric Keller, in approaching this legislation with urgency and bipartisanship. It is time to take a stand and put the interests of students and families first. This legislation is an important signal that we in Congress are committed to doing just that. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will ban the most egregious practices that have been uncovered by Attorney General Cuomo in New York. Just read the New York Times this morning and you will see all that has been uncovered. It will require lenders and institutions alike to adhere to a strict code of conduct. It will ensure that preferred lender lists are based on the best deal for students. It will ensure that students and families have accurate, unbiased information about their loan options. It will ensure that borrowers are able to exhaust their Federal loan eligibility before being steered to pricier private loan packages. 
   The crisis of confidence in our student loan programs shines a light on a larger problem. We have a crisis in college affordability for our low- and middle-income families. College costs are rising rapidly, and Federal student aid has not kept pace. According to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, paying for a 4-year public university costs our lowest-income families 87 percent of their income. We are expecting these families to come up with over $10,000 per year through work or loans to pay for college. 
   Quite simply, we have left low- and middle-income families to fend for  themselves when it comes to financing a college education. After 4 years of stagnation, the maximum Pell Grant stands at only $4,310. We have left families rudderless when it comes to navigating the explosive growth in the student loan programs. We have not looked after their interests. 
   After listening to many representatives of Federal and private college loan programs, I am convinced that we here in Congress must take this bipartisan action to restore integrity to this important program. The Student Loan Sunshine Act is a first step in restoring faith in our student aid programs and fulfilling the promise of the Higher Education Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have more work to do, but let's get this job done today. I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 890, the Student Loan Sunshine Act.

   This is an $85 billion industry, and when you take the for-profit groups that are lending money, it exceeds $100 billion. I foresee that, with this legislation, we are going to see an increase as a result of that. We should be looking at $110 billion being lent, because it will be easier and much more acceptable to be able to borrow money at a lesser cost to the families. 
   Finally, in the area that I come from, were it not for these student loans, the Pell Grants and the Perkins Act loans that are available, many minority families' children, boys and girls, would not be able to go to college.  
   So we are pleased with the leadership of these two gentlemen, and I look forward to seeing its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Higher Education, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. This legislation will complete our work on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and build on the historic investment we made last year in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. 
   We opened the 110th Congress taking a fresh look at our higher education laws. Especially, we called for ideas to close the college access and completion gaps for low-income and minority students; to improve the financial aid application and delivery system; to improve preparations so that low-income and first-generation college students are ready to succeed in college academically, financially, and socially; leverage more resource for need-based aid; and yes, to address the escalating cost of a college education. 
   This bill offers comprehensive, bipartisan solutions to all of these issues. I would like to thank Chairman Miller and the ranking members of the full committee and the subcommittee, especially to my good friend Congressman McKeon of California and Congressman Keller of Florida, for working with us to craft a bill that every Member of this Chamber should be proud to support. 
   Mr. Chairman, we must be strong and determined to pass H.R. 4137 because we are falling behind in producing college graduates. During our hearings, we learned that the United States has gone from first to fourth place in the world for college graduates in the workplace. We are only one of two industrialized nations where older workers are more likely to have a college degree than younger workers. This comes at a time when the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a shortage of 3 million college-educated workers as early as the year 2012. 
   The gaps in college access and completion is large and growing for low-income and minority students because of the high costs of a college education. According to the Education Trust, since 1994, white students have increased in college completion by 12 percent. African American students have only increased by 5.5 percent, and the Hispanic students only by 3 percent. 
   Given that over 40 percent of our public school children are racial or ethnic minorities and one in five is Hispanic, it is imperative that we act swiftly and decisively to close the gaps. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is what the College Opportunity and Affordability Act will do. 
   H.R. 4137 will close the college access and completion gaps by increasing the authorized Pell Grant maximum to $9,000 and providing access to Pell Grants and the Academic Competitiveness and SMART Grants year round. 
   The legislation recognizes the critical role that minority-serving institutions will have to play if we are to produce the college graduates our economy needs to thrive. These institutions represent less than one-third of all of the colleges and universities in our country, but they enroll more than half of all minority students in post-secondary education. 
   H.R. 4137 authorizes increased investments in building the capacity of these essential institutions and ensures that they are full partners in teacher preparation and our national competitiveness and innovation agenda. 
   Additionally, H.R. 4137 includes the minority-serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity program, which is a major step forward in ensuring that these colleges and universities can maintain a state-of-the-art educational delivery system. 
   I am particularly proud of our whole committee's work to strengthen minority access to STEM fields through a youth engagement in STEM partnerships and programs that focus on preparing teachers for these high-need fields. 
   The College Opportunity and Affordability Act also addresses gaps at the post-baccalaureate level. It has been exactly 10 years since I introduced legislation to create a graduate program for Hispanic-serving institutions, and with the passage of this long awaited legislation, we will be one step closer to enacting this long overdue program. 
   Additionally, our bill includes the Patsy Mink Fellowship program to provide support for women and minorities to complete graduate degrees and join the ranks of university faculty where they are severely underrepresented. 
   H.R. 4137 will improve early college preparation by strengthening programs that are very important to fill the pipeline such as GEAR UP, the TRIO program, the HEP and the CAMP programs and emphasizing financial literacy and early financial aid estimates. 
   I'm a strong believer of reading and writing literacy, and that's why I am so in favor of programs such as Reading is Fundamental, which is going to help us in graduating more students from high schools. 
   This bill will leverage resources through great partnerships. One example is the new Grants for Access and Persistence program which will leverage State and private resources to increase student aid so that low-income, first-generation college students are prepared to enroll and succeed in college. 
   This bill takes real steps to address college costs through public information, accountability, and incentives at the State and institutional levels to keep tuition increases low and college within reach of all students.     
   H.R. 4137 protects students and families by bringing sunshine and real consumer protection to the student loan programs both at the Federal and the private level. 
   Finally, the legislation before us today recognizes our collective obligation to the men and women returning from war and seeking to resume their lives. Our Nation owes all our veterans the support to achieve their dreams through a college education after so valiantly serving our country. 
   H.R. 4137 establishes a new scholarship program for veterans and their families. It ensures fairness for veterans in student aid; it also authorizes Centers of Excellence for veteran student success to provide a one-stop support system on college campuses to help veterans succeed in college and to graduate. 
   Mr. Chairman, this legislation is ambitious and thorough because that is what these times demand. I encourage all my colleagues in Congress to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4137. Let's get this job done. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1851, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007. 
   I want to take this opportunity to commend my good friend Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS, chairwoman of the Housing Subcommittee, for introducing this bill, navigating it through the House Committee on Financial Services and bringing this important and necessary piece of legislation to the floor today for consideration by the full House of Representatives. 
   I have the utmost respect for Chairwoman WATERS--for all that she has done and is doing to improve the housing conditions for Americans, especially the moderate- to low-income, minorities, the disabled and the elderly. She has helped me considerably in my efforts to improve housing conditions in rural America. 
   Mr. Chairman, while some form of Section 8 rental assistance has been in place since the mid-1970s, the modern program was shaped largely by the 1998 public housing reform act. Nearly 10 years later, the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program came under new scrutiny, with Public Housing Authority industry leaders, low-income housing advocates, and some Members of Congress calling for reforms. 
   Chairwoman WATERS heeded that call and has brought to the floor today a bill that will help not only the poorest of the poor with housing vouchers but also provide the public housing authorities in my district and across the nation with the tools they need to better serve our constituents. The bill includes significant improvements to the voucher program, which provides rental assistance to about 1.8 million families, the majority of whom are extremely poor. 
   Applaud the provision in the bill that permits public housing authorities to let families use housing vouchers as a down payment on a first-time home purchase, and the section authorizing 20,000 sorely needed incremental vouchers in each of the next 5 years, for a total of 100,000 new vouchers. 
   For these reasons and more, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1851, the ``Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007.''

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act, H.R. 2956, and for the safe redeployment of our combat troops out of Iraq. 
   I thank our Chairman Lantos of the Foreign Affairs Committee for yielding time to me and want to reiterate that for 4 years now our administration has sacrificed its many soldiers for an Iraqi Government that has failed to take responsibility for its own security. While many of these soldiers have made great sacrifices on our Nation's behalf, the President has failed to support them with a viable strategy to succeed in Iraq and then to end combat operations. 
   This bill would force the President to be accountable to this Congress and to the American people. Yes, the American people deserve to know how this war is conducted and how it will end. 
   This bill would force the Iraqi Government to realize that America's commitment to their nation is not open-ended and that they must be accountable to their people for security and stability. 
   This bill would allow our military to safely redeploy from combat in Iraq to better confront emerging security threats around the world. 
   This bill would end the drain upon our Nation's resources that could better be used on our priorities at home such as improving our homeland security, strengthening our economy, and for providing for our citizens. 
   I strongly support this important legislation and request the President heed the call of this Congress to support our troops by redeploying them out of Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2857, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education or ``GIVE'' Act. 
   This legislation reauthorizes and strengthens our national service programs. I would like to thank my good friend CAROLYN MCCARTHY, chairwoman of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee and Congressman TODD PLATTS, the ranking member, for their excellent, bipartisan work on this legislation. 
   The spirit of service runs strong in America. Many Americans--young and old, rich and poor--look for ways to give back to their communities and the Nation. Our national service programs nurture this spirit and ensure that all American have opportunities to serve. 
   The GIVE Act will increase the number of Americorps volunteers to 100,000. In my congressional district Americorps volunteers are promoting community development, improving education, and enhancing the quality of life for many of our residents. They bring a great deal of energy and contribute to a strong sense of community in our area. 
   The GIVE Act fosters an ethic of civic engagement in young people through a summer of service program that will enable students in middle and high school to volunteer and earn an education award for college. 
   The GIVE Act promotes service in areas of national need for global competitiveness, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 
   The GIVE Act will ensure that we can effectively and efficiently mobilize volunteers in times of national disaster. 
   The GIVE Act strengthens opportunities for our seniors by providing flexibility to the senior corps programs. In my congressional district, we have very strong programs that engage our seniors in service and provide them companionship and support. Our seniors continue to make tremendous contributions to our communities. We cannot afford to let their talent or energy go to waste. 
   My home State of Texas is a big believer in national service. We have 48,000 senior corps members. Since 1994, 24,000 Texans have earned education awards by serving as Americorps volunteers; 48,000 students have participated in Learn and Serve America, linking service with academic achievement. 
   The GIVE act will make this great tradition of service even stronger. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

<DOCNO>Mr. HINOJOSA. (ANTHONY DeJUAN BOATWRIGHT ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1473, the Anthony DeJuan Boatwright Act. It is named in honor of Anthony DeJuan Boatwright who suffered a terrible tragedy at a licensed child care facility in Georgia. 
   In the wake of her son's accident, Anthony's mother, Jackie, has become a child care advocate who has worked tirelessly to help provide better information to parents navigating the child care system. 
   This important legislation is modeled after laws in the States of Georgia and Virginia. H.R. 1473 amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program in order to help parents receive more information about potential child care providers. The Child Care and Development Block Grant is a very important Federal program providing almost $5 billion to States to help low-income families afford child care. 
   Almost 2 million children receive child care subsidies through this child care program, and it has enabled millions of families to enter or remain in the workforce. H.R. 1473 strengthens the Child Care and Development Block Grant by adding a safety standard. H.R. 1473 requires licensed child care providers to give written notice to parents about whether or not they have liability insurance and requires child care providers to post publicly whether or not they have liability insurance. 
   H.R. 1473 also requires States to recommend to licensed child care providers that they carry liability insurance. 
   Child care quality can influence whether a child arrives at kindergarten ready to succeed. Providing parents with additional information about the child care providers in their communities will help parents make the right choice for their children and for their families. 
   I would like to thank my friend and colleague the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Barrow) for bringing this legislation forward. In moving this bill forward, we can help other families avoid the terrible loss suffered by Anthony DeJuan Boatwright's family. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1473.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the designation of October 2007 as ``Country Music Month'' and to celebrate the long heritage of patriotism in country music. 
   The Country Music Association celebrated its first National Country Music Month in 1964, and October 2007 marks its 43rd annual observance. I would like to thank my fellow Texan, Congressman TED POE, for bringing this bill forward today. 
   The themes invoked in country music resonate with important American values such as responsibility, determination and hard work. Country songs foster an appreciation of the many important sacrifices made by our men and women serving in the Armed Forces. Songs like ``Only in America'' by Brooks and Dunn and ``Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly'' by Aaron Tippen encourage patriotism and the pursuit of the American Dream. 
   In addition to powerful patriotic lyrics, the country music industry has also directly supported the cause of our Armed Forces. Portions of the proceeds from some patriotic compilations have gone to support the USO's active duty troops and families of fallen soldiers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I express my support for Country Music Month and congratulate the genre on its many contributions to American society. I urge my colleagues to pass the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, country songs foster an appreciation of the many important sacrifices made by soldiers serving in the Armed Forces. 
   I want to share with our Members of the House that tomorrow, Tuesday, I will be accompanying Sergeant Daniel Pena from my congressional district, a young man 28 years old serving his third tour in Iraq. While on patrol, their Humvee stepped on a land mine that exploded. One of his colleagues riding in that Humvee was killed, and he lost his right arm and his right leg. 
   He came back to the United States where he has stayed in Walter Reed the last 2 months and received an artificial arm and leg and has now been released by Walter Reed Hospital. I'm going to accompany him and his father and mother to Weslaco, Texas, where he is going to receive a hero's welcome. 
   I'm pleased to tell you that I requested that country songs like ``Only in America'' by Brooks and Dunn and ``Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly'' by Aaron Tippin be played as part of the patriotic music that we're going to have at that celebration of a hero's welcome. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3221. The assistance provided to homeowners in this housing package is desperately needed by troubled borrowers, nationwide and in my district. 
   This housing rescue package is a win-win for the homeowners and the community in which they live, which will not deteriorate because of boarded-up homes left empty because of foreclosures. It's also a win for the investors, who will get paid because the homeowners will be making payments they can afford. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes a provision for rural areas. I want to thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Frank for working with me and the rural housing groups to include this language in the bill. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this much-needed bill.  
   The assistance provided to homeowners in this housing package is desperately needed by troubled borrowers nationwide and in my district, particularly Hidalgo County, which is one of the poorest counties in the United States. 
   Where there are large concentrations of foreclosures, both families who have lost homes and their neighbors who remain behind, are suffering. Renters too may be in danger of losing their homes if their landlords go into foreclosure. 
   This housing rescue package is a win-win for the homeowner--who may be able to stay in their home, and the community in which they live--which will not deteriorate because of boarded-up homes left empty because of foreclosures. 
   It is also a win for the investors--who might not get paid what was originally expected, but who will get paid because the homeowner, with a restructured mortgage, will be making payments they can afford. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes a provision for rural areas, which will clarify that the low-income housing-tax-credit may be used with the USDA's rental housing program for farm workers. I want to thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Frank for working with me and the rural housing groups to include this language in the bill. 
   The bill also includes the reform of governance of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. These reforms and the new regulatory powers will help ensure that the GSEs continue to play a vital role in the overall mortgage market. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this much-needed bill.
