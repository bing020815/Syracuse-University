<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. I thank the gentleman. I have no voice, but I have a lot of joy. This is a great day. 
   This is the first time that a package of this kind has included so many poor people and so many folks in the middle class, but I especially want to thank the leadership on both sides for including the Territories. This is the first time in the history of this country that the people who live in the Territories are treated as equal, as Americans as they are, living under the American flag. 
   And where will they spend the money? At the same retail stores that we will be spending our money here in this country. It's the same economy; but for the first time, this Congress in a bipartisan way has accepted the fact that it is one economy and the Territories are as much a part of this Nation as any other part, and I thank you for that.

<DOCNO>Mr. SERRANO. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. This is, indeed, a very solemn occasion; and anyone watching this debate, either on television or in the gallery, should understand that we take very seriously what we say here today. We may disagree on what the final outcome should be, but we do take it very seriously. 
   And I take it seriously as I recall a funeral I attended, it seems a long time ago, for a member of the Armed Forces, Luis Moreno, who was killed in Iraq. I remember that rainy morning, leaving the church on the way to the cemetery, the pain and the sadness that took place in the whole community, the pain and the sadness that engulfed a family and everyone who was there. 
   We took seriously the loss of that life, and we honor every day the fact that he was sent to that battlefield and he gave his life for that particular cause, which we discuss today. 
   We are here in his honor to say that we have to make sure that we no longer continue to escalate this war which was presented to us, it seems again, a long time ago based on, at the minimum, false information, and at most, sadly, lies presented to this Congress.     
   We have to make sure that no further loss of life takes place. So much has been said today about supporting our troops. Well, I know of no greater support than to bring them home tomorrow morning. 
   I know a lot of people will say, if you bring them home, Iraq will become a mess. Well, has anyone noticed that Iraq is a mess? 
   Well, if you bring them home now, Iraq will become a country in a civil war. Has anyone noticed that Iraq is involved in a civil war? 
   The question is, will we wait for more Americans to lose their lives and more to be wounded? 
   When I say that we were given bad information or possibly lied to, we were told at that time, I remember, how the weapons of mass destruction were stored in Iraq and that we had to get them before they got us, and how there was a link between al Qaeda and September 11 and Saddam Hussein. And now, even the administration and its ardent supporters agree that there was no link between Saddam Hussein and September 11, there was no link between al Qaeda, there was no link between any of that that we were told; and we still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction. It was simply a desire to take us to where we shouldn't be. And in the process, we really blew it. 
   I was in New York City on September 11; I was not with my colleagues here. It was election day in New York, primary day, and I was there in New York on that day for some local elections. I lived through that moment, and I know how painful that was. But beginning with September 12, the world was with us. Every country was supportive of what we were going through. It always amazed me that countries that live with terrorism on a daily basis thought that, for some reason, the attack on us was in many ways even bigger than the attacks on their own country, and they supported us. We could have taken that goodwill and used it for positive things throughout the world. What did we do? We totally lost the goodwill by going and invading a country that had nothing to do with September 11. And so now, the same people who supported us no longer support us. 
   What we are doing here today is exerting a constitutional right. This is not a political exercise, this is not a legislative exercise, this is Members of Congress saying that it is our right to oversee the President and to stop him whenever we can when we know that any President, any administration is making a mistake. 
   Now, how has this administration been able to keep us supportive in some ways up to now? By doing something which is really sad, by questioning our patriotism. And so tonight and tomorrow and for the next couple of days more will question our patriotism. But I ask you, isn't a true patriot he or she who is not holding back to question the actions of his country even during wartime? Isn't that the true patriot who is willing to say, even during wartime, stop it now, stop the madness before it goes any further and before we lose more of our young people? 
   And so we gather here after 3,109 losses, after 23,000 wounded soldiers saying we have to stop it now, and we have to vote for this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SERRANO. (AMERICA'S BEAUTIFUL NATIONAL PARKS QUARTER DOLLAR COIN ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to try something innovative. I want to discuss the bill before us and not this other discussion we had on drilling. While I understand the importance of it, we were discussing a bill, for those Americans who were watching who might have forgotten by now, on putting national parks on the backs of quarters. And I want to congratulate both Mr. Castle and Mrs. Maloney and the committee for including the Territories. As the gentleman from Delaware stated, he alluded to the Speaker and the fact that I have great concern about the involvement of the Territories and the recognition. 
   When the original quarters program came about, I was dismayed at the fact that the territories and the District of Columbia were not included. Last year in an appropriations bill, we expanded the program to include D.C. and the Territories. 
   What you have done today is you have picked up on that and now have started a new era, I believe, where the Territories and the District of Columbia will become part of every discussion we have here from postage stamps to coins to, in many other areas, fairness across the board. 
   When that first quarter comes out, both the one for the national parks and the one for the regular quarters program with Puerto Rico on it, since Puerto Rico is of great concern to me, having been born there before moving to New York, many people throughout the country will actually ask, Why is Puerto Rico on the back of a quarter in the United States? And that will start a proper discussion as to the fact that we not only include in the American family the 50 States, but we include the District of Columbia and the Territories. That in the Territories are American citizens, American citizens who served this country at wartime and peacetime, and who, in fact, at any moment can participate in all parts of American society but are always forgotten. 
   So something as symbolic and perhaps to some people as unimportant as making sure that when these quarters come out with national parks, they include Puerto Rico and the Territories, is very important.

<DOCNO>Mr. SERRANO. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is amazing. If folks on the other side keep saying tax increase, they are actually going to believe that there is a tax increase. 
   What I notice is that they very rarely mention deficit because when they do, they leave themselves open for discussion on the deficit. Yes, there is a deficit and the American people are quickly finding that out. The deficit was not created in the last less than 6 months that Democrats have had control of this House. The deficit was created by taking us into a war that we shouldn't have been involved in where close to $600 billion has been spent, not to mention the loss of life, not to mention the fact that when our troops come home over the next 10, 15, 20 years, we will be paying in deficit spending to make up for medical care and all the needs that I certainly will be supporting for them.     
   Now, it's interesting, Mr. Chairman, how the other side mentions that this bill spends money. Well, in a way that's redundant because that's what the Constitution says the Appropriations Committee is supposed to do. It is supposed to come to the Congress every year and spend dollars. How much we spend, that's a discussion. 
   But if there was ever a place where you can justify a modest increase, it would be when you deal with the energy issues in our country. There are dollars here, no one is mentioning, for research. There are dollars here to deal with the energy issue. 
   Now, every American knows that probably at the center of issues in this country is the high cost of fuel in this country, whether for driving or heating our homes. So when you take some of those tax dollars and you spend them, a very modest amount, on research to see if there is a way that in the future we can cut out our dependency on foreign oil, that is a great investment. That is no different than investing in a college or education for the children. It is the same kind. But again, we are not going to hear that. What we are going to hear is this repetition about how money is being spent, and that there is a tax increase. 
   I don't remember a tax increase in the 6 months that we have been here as Democrats. What I do remember that caused a deficit was, one, the war; and two, that we did have a tax decrease in this country, a tax cut, we did. But it wasn't for anybody that we know, certainly no one I know. It was for millionaires and zillionaires, including some of them who told us that they didn't even want a tax cut. Those are the people. 
   So if indeed those tax cuts reach their sunset and die, I guess you could play with words and say that taxes will go up. Yeah, for somebody who has $100 million, he or she might pay more taxes later on. But the working class, the people who are getting help for their education, the folks that are getting a better deal on energy propositions in the future, those are the facts, the people that we are looking for. Now, you want to cut the deficit down? You want to create a situation where we will spend less money in this country? Stop the war now. Stop spending another dollar on the war in Iraq. 
   But it has been forgotten. It's all about tax-and-spend Democrats. My God, when you hear this, Mr. Chairman, you would think we were in control for the last 14 years. No, it's 12, 14 years against less than 6 months. And in those 6 months we have spoken to parents about their kids' education. In those 6 months we've made attempts to bring down the cost of gasoline. In those 6 months, yes, we gave a minimum wage increase to the lowest earners in this country. That's what we've done. And we will be proud of that. You want to cut the deficit that you created over 12 years? Stop the war now. That's the best way to do it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SERRANO. (FRANK SINATRA DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. I thank the gentlewoman from California. 
   I want to thank both the chairmen and the ranking members of both the subcommittee and the committee for bringing this resolution in such a timely fashion to the floor. 
   Last week, on May 13, I joined Alan Kessler, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service, Nancy Sinatra, Frank Sinatra, Jr., and A.J. Lambert, Frank Sinatra's granddaughter, at a formal ceremony in New York City's Gotham Hall, where the Postal Service issued the Frank Sinatra commemorative stamp. Immediately thereafter, 120 million stamps honoring this great icon in American culture, who was both an entertainer and a humanitarian, went on sale nationwide.  
   I am pleased that today the House of Representatives, through its recognition of that special day of the stamp issuance as Frank Sinatra Day, is giving another well-deserved honor to this man who contributed so much to our Nation and our culture. It has been 10 years since the death of Frank Sinatra, talented singer, actor and caring person, and Sinatra's music continues to speak to each of us today in a way that is both personal and emotional. 
   My colleagues, of course, know of my personal love for Mr. Sinatra's music. At this age, I carry close to 2,000 songs on my iPod from Sinatra alone. I was introduced to the English language by listening to Frank Sinatra records when my father came back from World War II. At that time, I remember my father saying something profound. He said, ``You know, the English language takes a bad rap. People say that it is not a romantic language.'' He said this to me in Spanish. ``But,'' he said, ``if you listen to the way this man sings the English language, you will recognize that it is indeed a romantic language if sung properly.''     
   Through the years, I used those records at the beginning of my time in New York City to learn to enunciate and to imitate the way he used the English language, because when he sang it was perfect. In fact, in Germany, in Japan, and other countries, businessmen use Frank Sinatra records to learn how to pronounce the English language. Maybe that is the reason why I am the only New Yorker who says ``Tuesday'' instead of ``Toosday,'' because Mr. Sinatra would have never tolerated ``Toosday.'' 
   Personally, for me as a fan, I know the big difference between those songs that everybody recognizes from Mr. Sinatra like ``New York, New York'' and ``My Way,'' and those other bittersweet melodies that he made famous that you only listen to sometimes at 3 o'clock in the morning. That was Sinatra the singer. 
   Then there was another side very briefly to Mr. Sinatra. At a time when certain entertainers were not allowed to stay in certain hotels in this country, it was Mr. Sinatra who said, If they can play, I want them in my band. I don't care what they look like, I don't care what their religion is, I don't know what their color is, I don't care. If they can play and they have talent, I want them in my band. It was because of that that Las Vegas began to integrate for the first time due to that work. This was the other side of Frank Sinatra. 
   And lastly, the one you will see on TV this month, Sinatra, the actor, the one that could either give you the happy-go-lucky Pal Joey, or the very daring Man With a Golden Arm, talking about drug addiction at a time when that was not a subject. 
   This was the whole of Frank Sinatra, and we as Americans honor him this week with a commemorative stamp. I commend all of us to buy that stamp, and just think of this as I close. Our gossip notes, our water bills, and, yes, our love letters will carry the smile of Frank Sinatra for a time to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. SERRANO. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, last night and most of yesterday we saw a very unfortunate situation take place on the House floor: discussions, anger, tempers, and very little on the substance or the bill or the work of the committee. 
   I rise today to remind us of the work this committee has done in a bipartisan fashion before we came to the floor. I have been a member of the Homeland Security Committee since it was formed. So has Mr. Price, Mr. Edwards, and Ms. Roybal-Allard. I know for certain that on the other side the former chairman and ranking member, Mr. Rogers, has been a member since the creation of the committee. From day one, the committee has taken its work very seriously. 
   This year, under new leadership, the committee continued to take its work seriously. We held 20 hearings plus a couple of field hearings, over 50 hours of public hearings. Decisions, information was not gathered in private. These were public hearings. Over 70 witnesses came before us both from government and those who have the knowledge to advise us on these issues. 
   During those hearings, every member was treated fairly. In fact, one of the highlights, I think, was the way in which Mr. Price worked with Mr. Rogers and the way that Mr. Rogers continued to play such an important role in these hearings in presenting his views, his knowledge and his expertise. 
   That kind of bipartisanship, that kind of presentation, that kind of work led to the bill that we have before us. It is one of the few bills in this House where those of us who are part of the committee know well how serious the issue is and how much we have to do to try to assign the proper dollars. 
   When the bill left committee, there were, of course, a few disagreements. But there was a bipartisan belief that we were doing that which we were challenged to do, that we were asked to do, which was to put forth a bill that secured the homeland, that protected the homeland. 
   Yet, what we saw yesterday did not speak to that at all. What we saw yesterday was personal attacks. It was discussions about issues that were not involved in this bill. Interestingly enough, the number one decision yesterday was to attack earmarks. Yet Mr. Rogers set a precedent, which was followed by Mr. Price, that if there is a bill that does not deal with earmarks, it is this bill. 
   Now, that needs to be repeated. Of all the bills to pick on to deal with the issue of earmarks, this is the wrong bill. This was something instituted by Chairman Rogers and continued by Chairman Price on a bipartisan level. This is so serious, this issue at hand, and these dollars are so serious and so dedicated in the way they are appropriated that the earmarking process perhaps should not play a role at all. And it hasn't, up to now, I assure you. Otherwise I would have gone to Chairman Rogers and gotten something in the last few years. I didn't because it just did not exist. 
   So now we find ourselves with a decision to make today: Will we continue to behave on the floor as if we were discussing the reelection for Congress in 2008, or do we really want to send to the President's desk a bill that speaks to the needs of our community in securing our homeland? 
   I represent the Bronx, New York City. I was in New York City on September 11. I was not here with my colleagues. As I have said often, my son was running for the New York City Council on that day, and the election was cut off at 11 o'clock in the morning because of the terrorist attack. That is something no one writes about, that the terrorists were able to stop our electoral process in the biggest city in the Nation around 11 a.m. The elections were run 2 weeks later. So I was there helping my son on election day. I remember the pain and the horror that you all know about of seeing my city attacked. 
   I take this bill personally very seriously. I take the bill as a Member of Congress personally very seriously. This committee has taken this bill very seriously. This committee, on a bipartisan basis, takes protection and the safety of the homeland very seriously. 
   Let's make sure that all Members take it seriously. Let's pass the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I was doing some math, and I am sure my colleagues are aware of this. If you are not, you might be shocked. We spent 10 hours on a debate to cut $8 million from the general counsel. Now, you talk about waste. This place runs, the electricity runs, the people are on salary, and that side made us spend 10 hours just to cut $ 8 million, with eight motions to rise to stop the work. 
   Now, nowhere does anyone get up and discuss the issues in this bill. The bill continues to be a good bill. No matter how much you attack it, no matter how much you avoid dealing with the true issue, the center issue, it continues to be a good bill. I think what is happening here is, as time goes on and different folks and different Members pay attention, we have to continue to repeat some of the things that we have said before, because you put us in that situation. 
   So, with that in mind, let me remind you that this is the Homeland Security bill. This is the bill and this is the issue that, according to a lot of folks on talk radio, the Republican Party is supposed to be very strong on. Democrats are supposed to be strong on some issues and Republicans are supposed to be strong on some issues, but according to what you tell the world, you are stronger on this. 
   Mr. Chairman, they claim to be stronger than anyone else in the universe on homeland security, yet you have spent all night, all night, trying to destroy this Homeland Security bill which protects the homeland.     
   As I said before, I represent New York City. I was in New York on the day of September 11 and we personally, as the rest of the Nation well knows, suffered the pain of having a terrorist attack. Immediately thereafter, we came to the House floor and we created the Department of Homeland Security. That's what this bill is. This is not a bill that talks about earmarks. 
   Let's try it again. 
   Now, as you know, I speak two languages, but out of respect to the stenographer, I won't use Spanish, so I will remind you in English, there are no earmarks in this bill. I would say it in Spanish, but I don't know how to say ``earmarks'' in Spanish. As soon as I do, I'll find a way to say it. 
   But I'll say it in English again: There are no earmarks in this bill. There's only security for the homeland. There's port security. There is work for border agents. There is strengthening of cargo shipments, of our airlines, of finding ways to protect ourselves from the possible next terrorist attack. That's what this bill does. 
   And you spend hour after hour after hour with procedural motions to adjourn to go home, to stop working and telling us that there are somehow earmarks in here that have to come to the light of day and telling us that a new process and a new system has been invented. Yes, a new one is in place. It's one that is going to tell us who, which Member of Congress, asked for money to go to a certain program in his or her district and throughout the Nation. 
   And let me tell you something. I don't have a problem with that. I don't think that the administration or the bureaucrats are the only people who know how to spend money. I think I know how to spend some dollars in my district. And all an earmark is, is that we tell the agency, spend so much money, usually a very small amount in that particular group, to help that particular group of students, or that particular environmental issue, or to clean up that particular toxic waste. There's not a problem with that. 
   But when you stand here and tell us that this is what this bill does and that somehow there is a system that has been set up that is horrible, you're kidding yourselves. And so I must do something that I didn't want to do, and I'm not going to mention names because that's not proper. But do you know, my fellow Republicans, that 65 of you have written letters to me, chairman of a subcommittee, asking for 137 projects totaling close to $350 million? 
   Now, I didn't get a chance to ask my chairman, Mr. Obey, but the committee that I chair, Financial Services and General Government, is not one of the larger budgets. I shouldn't admit that in public, but it isn't one of the  largest budgets, and it doesn't have that many areas where you can earmark even if you wanted to. But 65 of you have asked for 137 programs for $340 million. Some of you have spoken on the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have been down this road before in this discussion, and it's easily something that the other party wants to do in spite of the fact that their local governments tell them they don't want this done. I think the public and all Members really need to understand what this is about. This is about the fact that there are people in this country who are undocumented. That's a fact. How do you remove them out of the country is another issue. 
   What happens while they're living in this country is the issue at hand. Now, throughout the discussion on immigration, we've had questions like, if a person is here, undocumented, and they have a child, do you say to that child, you can't go to a public school because your parents are here undocumented? 
   Well, if you think they're leaving tomorrow or next year, that might work. But if you think that eventually whatever plan we come up with allows X number of children to stay in the country, then you can't deny them education because you're just creating a generation of Americans who won't get education. 
   Then you move on to step two. At times, we have said that if a person is here undocumented, they should not get any kind of emergency medical care. Well, besides the humaneness of that, that we should never deny medical care to anyone, there is the issue of, so do you want the person working at a local hamburger place serving you food while they are ill and not able to treat their disease and the germs they may spread around. That is an issue. 
   This one is really a classic one. This is where you say to your local police department, we want you to enforce immigration law. And just about a unanimous cry throughout the Nation has been from police departments saying, Don't give us that responsibility. We don't want it. We don't need it. 
   The reason they don't want it and they don't need it is for a very proper crime-fighting purpose. A local police department, a local law enforcement department, makes contacts in the community, finds out who's committing crime in the community by talking to folks. Traditionally, undocumented folks have known and have felt secure in that they can tell a police officer that a crime has been committed and point a finger at the person who's committed the crime, knowing very well that their conversation is about crime and not about documentation or about their status as a citizen or a noncitizen, an illegal or undocumented person within the country. 
   That is the reason why just about every police department in the Nation, sheriff's, whatever they are called in different communities, have said, don't give us that responsibility; we don't want it because we want to keep this relationship going with this community, knowing well that we can get information out of them. 
   And they are not dealing with us on an immigration law issue. That's why we have ICE. That's why we have all other people in the country that enforce immigration law. 
   But now we bring it, since September 11, to a new point, and that is, what if in the gathering of information that could lead to the prevention of a terrorist attack, you can't get information from some folks because they're afraid that while speaking to you, their immigration issue comes to light rather than their information on the fact that there could be a terrorist plot being planned somewhere. 
   This is a classic case of the old line throwing the baby out with the bath  water. Yes, there is an immigration issue, and we are trying to deal with it, all of us. And, yes, I know that there are some people that are very upset about the fact that there are people here who are not legally in the country.     
   But now to go and say that you're the party for law and order, Mr. Chairman, and at the same time say, but we want to tie the hands of our local law enforcement in gathering information, is a terrible mistake. 
   You will continue to do what you want. Eventually more and more police departments will tell you that they don't want this job; they don't want this responsibility. And somehow we will continue to get it wrong. Don't tie the hands of our law enforcement folks. Let them continue to gather the information they need.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill and would like to commend Chairman Price, Ranking Member Rogers, and their wonderful staff for their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor. 
   The bill provides adequate funding for programs that are crucial to the Nation's security, many of which the President chose to underfund or eliminate in his request. 
   Although we have not suffered a terrorist attack since the morning of 9/11, the threat remains real. Therefore, it is crucial that we provide sufficient resources to support those who represent our first line of defense. 
   I am pleased that the bill acknowledges this reality and restores proposed cuts to grant programs such as the Metropolitan Medical Response System and the SAFER program, which helps our struggling local fire departments fulfill ever-increasing homeland security missions.     
   I know that my own City of New York is making good use of all of these grants, including those provided to the Urban Areas Security Initiative grant program. 
   Beyond helping our States and municipalities, I would also like to express my support for the way the committee handles the balance between the different demands in the different departments and their ongoing missions. These critical missions, such as stopping the flow of illegal drugs and approving visas, have not gone away since 9/11. This bill properly recognizes this reality and provides support. 
   Finally, I am pleased that the chairman and ranking member chose to address issues related to the treatment and deportation of immigrants. As we work to secure our borders, it is important that we never lose touch with America's enduring spirit as a nation that stands ready to welcome all who come in search of a better life. 
   Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, I believe the bill does a good job of providing adequate funds for programs crucial to the security of the homeland and strengthens the partnership between the Federal, State and local governments and all the local communities. I truly believe it includes all the ingredients necessary for success. 
   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I would ask for their vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I join Chairman Price in his comments. I think that we come to the floor with two kinds of amendments, one that really tries to do something, that we believe in, and another just for grandstanding and for publicity. 
   The gentleman speaks about a deficit and speaks about his side wanting to reduce the deficit. Let me just do a few seconds of history. 
   When the last President left, we didn't have a deficit. We have a deficit now. Why? Because we were involved in a war and we were sent off to war when we should not be at all, and so we spend billions and billions and billions of dollars every week on a war that was built on lies and bad information, and now we try to get out of that war. And instead of getting out of it, we keep spending more, billions and billions and billions. 
   And if you think this war deficit is a problem, wait till the boys and girls come home and we have to provide them the medical services that some people will want to cut. The deficit would only grow. 
   Secondly, to be brief, the gentleman speaks about giving somebody a 17 percent pay raise. Yet it was that side that refused to give some people a couple of pennies' increase in a minimum wage. So all of the sudden that side is very concerned about raising people's salaries to keep up with the needed expenses of surviving in this society, but they were not for giving some folks a minimum wage increase. 
   So let's get it clear. Yes, there is a deficit, but this bill doesn't cause a deficit. The war is causing the deficit. The war on terror is causing the deficit. That's what this is about. This bill, in a very smart way, deals with some issues that we have to deal with. 
   And, lastly, it is always easy to attack the bureaucrats. Everybody wants services, everybody wants something done, but nobody wants anybody in charge of providing those services. Somehow we expect a computer to run the agency and not have people actually doing the work. 
   Let's be fair. Let's be honest when we come to the House floor. If we have an amendment that really has a message, present it. If we're just grandstanding, then we should have a disclaimer that says, and by the way, this is the reason that I'm on the House floor today.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   You know, I tried listening to this debate and coming to a conclusion that we were discussing something important. But here's my feelings: If I was a highly paid Republican consultant, although that's redundant, but if that's what I was, I would say to you guys you are making a terrible mistake; somebody misinformed you on what bill this is. This is not the Labor-H bill, where you would go after labor unions, which you always do, where you would not care about funding programs for education, which you always do, where you would leave children behind for a long, long time. 
   I could understand if you did it there. If this was the VA-HUD bill, I could understand all these desires to cut because, what the heck, you send people to war, and then you don't want to fund the Veterans Hospital Administration. I understand that. You don't want to do housing. I understand that. If this was any other bill, I would understand the strategy. But this is the bill that every right-winged radio talk show host says you're the best on, homeland security, protecting the homeland, making sure that there is never another terrorist attack. And this gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) gives you a well-thought-out bill that takes care of the needs for protecting the homeland, and you spend the last X amount of hours trying to tear it apart because we are  spending too much time, and it is driving up the deficit. 
   Now, I don't know how many people were around when I spoke the last time, and I reminded you that there is a deficit; a deficit created by going into a war that was built on lies and bad information; a deficit created by refusing to bring the troops home now, or soon, like we had suggested, but keeping this war going and spending a lot more money; a deficit created by reducing the taxes of the richest people in the country, while squabbling over giving the little guy a minimum-wage increase. 
   So, all I want to tell you today, as a friendly person and kind, gentle-hearted person that I am, is that someone has given you some bad information. This is not any of those other bills that you are known for bashing. This is not the one that will leave children behind. This is the one that is supposed to be the hallmark of your existence as a party. This is national security. This is protecting the homeland. How could you cut this bill? 
   But you know something? Mr. Price is right. If you are not going to protect your administration's programs, then we are certainly not going to waste a lot of time over here trying to debate you on it. So, go ahead and destroy protecting the Homeland Security Department. Go ahead and turn your back on securing the motherland. Go ahead and do it all. We will just stand here and wait it out. It may take days, but there's where you're heading.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule that would allow the Norton bill and in strong opposition to the amendment that treats the District of Columbia as a colony. 
   I have said many times that Congress needs to stop imposing its will on the residents of the District of Columbia. As chairman of the subcommittee that overseas the District, I have made noninterference in District affairs a priority of my oversight. D.C. does not need a second mayor and does not need a second city council, although there are Members here today who seem interested in serving for both. 
   The amendment to Delegate Norton's bill is particularly offensive. Under the cover of forcing D.C. to comply with the Supreme Court ruling, it instead guts D.C.'s ability to protect its citizens from unnecessary violence. 
   I sincerely believe that supporters of this amendment are seeking to impose on D.C. that which they would never impose on their own communities simply because D.C. is under their control and they're not accountable to D.C. residents. What the heck, it's the District of Columbia; use it as a testing ground for anything you can't do back home. 
   One of the most unpleasant features of our current democracy is the fact that many millions of U.S. citizens in the District, Puerto Rico, and other territories do not have fair and equal representation here in Congress but instead are left to the subject of the whims of a Congress elected by citizens. 
   D.C. is a jurisdiction that does not need constant congressional meddling in local affairs. Their gun laws are no exception. They know best how to keep their citizens and residents like us safe from the threat of deadly gun violence. 
   The Supreme Court asked them to modify their laws to comply with the Constitution. The District is doing so  in a responsible manner. In fact, today they are meeting to consider amendments to bring their firearm laws in compliance with the Supreme Court ruling. The underlying Norton bill would ensure that they continue to do so. 
   Unfortunately, this amendment would tie the hands of city officials to impose even the most basic reasonable safety measures and goes far beyond what the Supreme Court has required. It would, for instance, prohibit gun registration, prohibit any ban on purchasing in another State and bringing the gun to D.C., remove a clip limit--now, are you ready for this one--prohibit the D.C. Government from discouraging gun purchase and ownership. 
   In other words, you can tell people not to drink and drive; you can tell them to practice safe sex; you can tell them not to drop out of school; but you can't tell them that it's not a good idea to buy a gun. 
   This is, my friends, congressional colonialism at its worst. Our rule is not to override and interfere with local compliance with Supreme Court rulings. The citizens and residents of D.C. deserve our respect. This amendment fails that basic test.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today in support of this bill, probably the most difficult decision I have made in my 33 year political career. But I do it because I want this war to end. I did not support this war. I did not vote for it. I still believe that we were lied to, that we were given at the minimum bad information, but I believe we were lied to, the link to al Qaeda, the weapons of mass destruction. We have been over that, but it can't be forgotten. We were not told the truth. 
   But here we are now, and most of us want the war to end now. What does ``now'' mean? There is no real now. Even if there was a vote ``called out now,'' it would mean for 6, 7, 9, 10 months the military would, in a properly and orderly way, get the troops out. But there would be no end date, so ``now'' could be extended. 
   This bill, however, does speak to ``now,'' because it sets a timetable so that ``now'' becomes the desire to end the war and ``now'' becomes the mechanism in process to end the war. 
   In the next few minutes, the e-mails will start to come in from some friends on my left, who think they are on my left, who tell me that I sold out. Well, you know something? Not to end the war is to sell out. To get dramatic and emotional about something without the reality of ending the war might be to sell out. 
   I will take this vote tomorrow fully understanding that my vote was a vote to end the war; fully understanding that I didn't pull the rug from under the troops, but I told them that I didn't want them there any longer; fully understanding that when there was a vote that spoke about immediate withdrawal, we all remember how the Republicans took Mr. Murtha's desire to end the war and turned it into a resolution that said get out immediately. Interestingly enough, a lot of people who want to end the war now didn't vote for that. I was one of only three that voted to get out immediately. 
   So I have been there, and I have done that. This is the best vehicle for ending the war. That is why I support it. That is why we have to vote for it.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   It's clear, it should be clear to Members what this amendment does and what this program does. This, in fact, has local law enforcement enforcing immigration law. 
   This is the most unpopular and rejected program within law enforcement in this country when it comes to these types of programs. Department after department, police department after police department, sheriff's department after sheriff's department has said we don't want this responsibility, we don't want this job. 
   In fact, that is the reason why the number of communities that have participated in this program is not anywhere where the proponents would want it to be, because the mainstay, the strength of local law enforcement is the ability to fight crime, to protect the community, and, yes, even to flush out possible terrorist acts by getting information from the community. 
   Granted, there is an immigration issue. But the police departments, the local law enforcement do not want to play the role of immigration officers because they want the ability to be able to speak to members of the community and get information. 
   Now, that information may be who did you see near that car that is now missing from that corner. But that information can also be, where did you see and who did you see going into that building where we later found equipment to make bombs that could in fact be involved in a terrorist attack. 
   Local law enforcement have told us, in big cities and in small cities throughout this country and the rural communities, that they want the ability to work with their communities, and they don't want to be hampered by being asked to enforce immigration law. 
   And how it works is very simply this. There are people who are in this country without proper documentation. You call them illegal aliens; some of us call them undocumented. But they still live in the community. They still have information and law enforcement needs to work with them. 
   If they now know that the local police officer, if they now know that the local sheriff's deputy is going to be dealing with them in terms of an immigration situation, they will not open up to that person and give them any information. And in the long run, we will suffer as a Nation. 
   That's why I think that this is a bad program. I'm sorry it has even a penny assigned to it. But to add more money to it would be a total waste of time.

   Mr. SERRANO. It may be voluntary, but what happens is that local elected officials who sound like some of us here begin to put pressure on the police department to get into the program when, indeed, just about every law enforcement agency, local law enforcement in the Nation has gone public to say we don't want it. And in this case, we don't even want people to ask us to join it.

   Mr. SERRANO. Reclaiming my time, it's just, with all due respect to my brother, Mr. Rogers, it's just bad policy. It is not the way to get at an issue. 
   We are now dealing with the Senate, and we will be dealing in the House with an immigration reform bill. We will eventually deal with that issue. In the meantime, we have other business to take care of in this country, other protections to offer to our citizens. 
   To have the local police officer, on top of the fact that they're busy already, now you're going to give them another assignment. But to have them enforce immigration law, I can't tell you how much all the people I speak to say they don't want that. They want the freedom to get information at all levels of the community and not be seen as an immigration officer. 
   There used to be a bad joke about somebody would come into a restaurant and yell out ``immigration'' and a lot of people would leave and jump out the window. And that's funny, and it's sad at the same time. 
   But if you adjust that to a police department in a neighborhood looking for information and having people run away from them because they see them as immigration enforcement agents, then we lose the opportunity to really protect our communities.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I think you said it well. The problem here is that we have in place documentation that is acceptable for these kinds of crossings. Yes, as we go forward, we have to make sure that we secure our borders. But to undo that which has been working for a while and that which is accepted by our State Department is just to take a step backwards. And rather than doing that, we should accept what we have now and build on it. And what you are proposing is really to take a step that would only hurt us. 
   Throughout the years, the State Department has worked, in the case of the Mexican Government, to bring about a proper crossing of the border for work purposes and family visits and so on. That has been in place for years. That has worked. That is not the issue that we deal with when we talk about undocumented immigration into the country. That is not the issue we deal with when we talk about terrorist acts. This is the crossing of the border in a proper and safe and legal manner, and that is what we have in place, and we shouldn't be reinventing the wheel at this stage.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, this may be one of those classic moments where we are dealing with something that really isn't broken. The fact of life is that everybody at every local government and in every locality throughout this country knows what the law is and knows how to react to that law. People are not withholding information from the Federal Government. 
   What happens, however, on many occasions, is that local communities will make a statement, and basically it is a statement in many cases, in most cases, saying that that area is a sanctuary, meaning that they look at the immigration issue differently than you may in other parts of the country. But it doesn't mean that they flaunt the law, that they laugh at the law, that they will not participate. 
   I assure you that in the case of New York City, where the scene of the crime took place on September 11, no one in that city government, no one in that State government, is interested in doing anything else but complying with every law that will help us secure our borders and protect our city.     
   But we in that city look at immigration different than other people in other parts of the country, perhaps. We don't see immigrants as a problem to society that we have to somehow create a problem for them. 
   So sanctuary movements, which incidentally are growing throughout churches of all denominations throughout the country in very conservative and in very liberal areas, those movements are simply statements by communities saying we see the immigration issue from a humane point of view. We see it differently than other people. We don't think these people are problems for the country. Let's work to resolve the problem in a proper way. 
   This, again, is a classic case of coming to the House floor and saying, one, we are going to tell local governments what to do, something that side does not usually like to do, and in this case freedom of speech. Simply a statement by many communities that they see immigration in a different way and we should not be badgering them and creating issues where issues do not exist. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this may go down as the meanest and most misguided amendment of the evening. TPS has been known and worked as a proper legal statement by the U.S. government to give protection to people who are in situations where they cannot go back home. These people did not come into the country illegally. In fact, in many cases, our actions being involved in those countries invited them to come here, and this is why we offer that protection. 
   The countries that would be affected are countries where we either have had a standing tradition of being involved in trying to resolve some difficulties in those countries and participated militarily and otherwise in those countries and, as a result, gave them this protection. And secondly, there are also a set of countries which are going through very difficult situations. 
   I'm thinking, as I hear the gentleman speak, if Mr. Frank Wolf was here now he would be up on our side talking to you about the Sudan and talking to you about other places where we should continue to give the temporary protection status.  
   But here's the main point which I've already mentioned and needs to be mentioned again. This is a situation where these folks should not be looked at as people who are here illegally. They're here legally. They're here because this Congress, this administration and other administrations, have seen fit to give them this protection. They're here because they can't go back home. 
   And again, we may disagree on this, and frankly, there might be people on this side that disagree with me, but in some of those countries our policies have played a role in creating a situation where they can't go back home. So to lump them in with the undocumented immigrant situation of the country is totally unfair because it's two different issues. This one is sanctioned. 
   Interestingly enough, I notice that there's always a little bit of politics involved in this because the gentleman doesn't suggest that all Cubans go back to Cuba and that they should not get special treatment as they do under the Cuban Adjustment Act. We never touch that one. We touch this one. 
   Well, that's sad. It shouldn't be, and we should continue to protect these folks and try to make situations back home bearable for them. In the meantime, we should not be throwing them out of the country. 
   And lastly, we're not talking about 12 million people. We're not talking about 15 or 20 million people. We're talking about a much smaller number of people who need our protection. 
   There's a lady in the harbor to the city where I live and where I've grown up. That lady, known as the Statue of Liberty, tells us to bring to these shores the people that are hurting. 
   This is a fine example of America at its best. Don't lump it in with any other problem. That's not fair and that's not right. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment. And under different circumstances, I would simply say I accept it and that would be the end of it, but that is not going to be the end of it. 
   I rise in support because I think there are a couple of things we have to know and we have to remember. First of all, there is a law in place since 2000, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, which allowed agricultural products to be sold to Cuba. 
   Now, here is where the irony comes in. In 2005 the Treasury Department issued regulations requiring that the payments for exports to Cuba must be either received by the U.S. exporter or by a third-country bank prior to the goods leaving the port in the United States rather than upon arrival in Cuba. Now, that is the only country we do that with. 
   Now, what is the irony here? The part of the argument that has always been made is that we should work in this Congress to help or to force Cuba into a political change, a political change which would mirror our democratic system, our electoral process, and also, I am sure, our capitalist system. Well, the irony of this is that it is capitalism at its best to allow credit to take place between two nations. It is anti-capitalism to suggest that the only way that we can sell products to you is if you pay ahead of time prior to looking at the product. I mean, we wouldn't do that. Picture going into a store and their saying you can't look at the product, you can't test the product, you can't do anything: you have to pay ahead of time.     
   So there is a contradiction here that doesn't make sense. What the gentleman wants to do is simply put Cuba on par with every other country. 
   Now, if we were here for the first time, as we were in 2000, creating a new way to trade with Cuba, then all these arguments, I think, would be in place, whether we want to do that or not, what kind of government they have. But we already have that in place. We already have that in place. And we should note that the reason we have this in place is not because anti-embargo people like me ruled the day in 2000, it's because farmers in this country and business people in this country, but especially the farming community, felt that it was important for American business to be able to sell some products to Cuba. That has not changed our political stance on Cuba. Cuba still has an embargo imposed by the U.S. We still do not have relations with Cuba. Nothing has really changed since 2000 except the ability to sell products. 
   Now the gentleman wants to put Cuba on an even keel with the rest of the world. I think it's a proper way to go. I think it's good for our business community. I think it's good for trade with Cuba. And I support the gentleman's amendment. 
   I will be asking Members on this side and on both sides to vote for his amendment if it comes to a vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman starts off as we suspected by assuming that Members of Congress have no ability and no understanding and no knowledge, enough certainly to make an appropriation called an earmark. That assumes that only Federal agencies and the folks who work in those agencies know what a good program is. 
   I think every so often we have to remind ourselves what a so-called earmark is. An earmark is when a Member of Congress determines that in his or her district there is a program worthy of Federal support. But on so many occasions, as certainly has been the occasion in my district in the Bronx, those Federal agencies, for one reason or another, don't pay the attention they should, so a Member gets involved in directing some dollars. And it is some dollars compared to the total budget.  
   In this particular case, we're talking about an organization in the Youngstown area that was originally set up to deal with the fact that in the southwestern Pennsylvania region, there has been a mass exodus of people between 25 and 30 years of age. Furthermore, with the demise of the steel and coal industry, the region has seen very high levels of unemployment. New and small businesses are necessary to the economic well-being of the citizens of this area. 
   Now, JARI's efforts have directly led to an increase in small businesses formed in the region and jobs created and retained in the region. There has been an increase in longevity and sustainable efforts for small businesses. Business folks have been given the ability to grow. And yes, while the gentleman seems to think that it is a bad thing to have Federal dollars go in and then assist in reaching other dollars, well, that just shows that they know how to work the system and work it properly. There is nothing wrong with that. But the whole notion that only people and Federal agencies know how to direct dollars, and that only they know what a good program is is really a misconception. 
   Now, the gentleman from Arizona will be here for quite a while, we see he's setting up his presentation. And it will be a good, strong presentation, but it is only based on the belief that Members of Congress are not intelligent enough to know a good program, to know a good use of Federal dollars. 
   Interestingly enough, the same folks who will get up today and attack earmarks will not attack the fact that there are large number of earmarks that come directly out of the White House directing Congress to spend money on something; and that most have voted for the largest earmark of them all, the war in Iraq, which has earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars with very little, incidentally, accountability in many, many cases. 
   So, I stand in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. He knows that he and I have a friendship, a personal friendship and respect. But on this one, as last time, he is totally wrong. I stand in opposition to his amendment and in support of this particular earmark. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. I would like to direct my comments more on the sponsor than on the project, although I will speak about the project.     
   The gentleman is one of the most distinguished Members of the House, certainly a Member who knows the appropriations process, knows the pitfalls of this process called earmarks, and would not knowingly put forth a foolish or unworthy member-item before the House. So I take that very seriously. He is not a rookie who is trying to find his way around the House, as many do every day, but he is one who knows what is acceptable and what is proper and what is dignified, and that is what he is doing. 
   Secondly, and very important to note, we all have so-called earmarks for our district. This is for the Nation's Capital. This is not something he is bringing back to his district to score points with his constituents, which is proper. There is nothing wrong with that, letting your constituents know you are working in Washington on their behalf. But here he takes time, and, if I may say, dollars that he probably could have asked for his own district, to make sure that something in the Nation's Capital happens and happens properly. 
   I take that very seriously, because, as I said last night, Mr. Regula and I are committed in this committee to making life and conditions in D.C. much better than they are. 
   So I commend the gentleman from California for thinking of a place outside his own district, and I am here in opposition. 
   I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, as we already know, I conceded that point of order so that issue is not before us. But I think it is important, nevertheless, to speak somewhat to the issue so that people fully understand what it was that this subcommittee was attempting to do. 
   The whole notion of having private debt collectors collecting taxes throughout this country does not sit well with a lot of people. It is not one  of the most popular programs. In fact, it is a very unpopular program. 
   No one traditionally has liked the idea of somebody knocking on your door to collect your taxes in a dispute with the government. But at least historically we have had a situation where we knew that the person knocking at our door or on the phone was a member of the government, an employee of the government, who had been trained in how to deal with the public and who fully understood what was within the law allowed in that conversation and in that approach. 
   We now, in this wild desire to turn our backs on Federal employees and outsource, go out and get private employees to handle much of government's work, we decided to go and set up a system which is really very sad. We now say to a private debt collector, go and collect those taxes; and for doing that, we will give you 24 cents on the dollar. 
   The American people need to know that. They need to know that for every dollar that is owed to the government, the government is now saying we will hire an outside agency that will go after you, and we will let them keep 24 cents on the dollar. What a waste of government money. What a waste of the taxpayers' money. 
   It is interesting that we hear folks here get up and tell us we are wasting taxpayer dollars. In fact, in a few minutes the gentleman from Arizona will go back to that issue, although he was not involved in this other one and I don't want to bring him into it. But you talk about a waste of money. Rather than use government employees to go find these dollars, you are going to give away 24 cents on every dollar. 
   The point of order was based on a belief that this would lose revenue for the government because we would not hire these folks to go find the money, to go collect the money. The whole purpose of our bill was to go back to the day when the employees of the Federal Government would collect the dollars. Nowhere in this bill did it say that by not allowing outsourcing of these jobs, by not allowing private debt collectors, we are giving up on our hope to collect the dollars. That was not the purpose. 
   So, technically, the point of order was correct, and that is why we conceded it. But when you really analyze this, it would have been and it was a bad decision, because that was not the intent. 
   Lastly, the very famous hit show ``The Sopranos'' ended a couple of weeks ago. But had they known that this program was going to continue, they could have had another episode, because I predict that years from now we are going to be back here telling you horror stories about how private debt collectors are collecting those debts. They don't have to answer to the public or to the government, the way we have to, the way Federal employees have to. What they are going to start doing is using all kinds of tactics that we will live to regret. So there might yet be another Sopranos episode. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. Since 1959, the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, SPUR, has been one of California's preeminent public policy think tanks providing research, analysis and public education related to planning and good government. 
   It was originally formed to revitalize downtown San Francisco by channeling growth away from suburban sprawl and back into the urban core. SPUR provides a neutral educational forum to promote civic engagement, particularly among disadvantaged citizens, businesses operating in areas of high employment, and firms operated by low-income individuals. 
   SPUR is a widely sought-out resource for small businesses, concerned individuals, local government agencies and other nonprofits, offering educational programs, publishing a monthly journal with the latest information on urban planning and best practices, and convening 20 active policy committees where small business people and community members can become involved in local and regional public policy. 
   The funds included in the Financial Services appropriations bill are for construction costs associated with the new urban center. The center will allow SPUR to expand its educational  and research programs related to key issues impacting urban businesses and communities. 
   You know, as I listen to the gentleman, I always know where he is going with his argument because his argument continues to be that only people in agencies know how to spend Federal dollars and that we, Members of Congress, do not. Obviously a program that has been around since 1959 in the City of San Francisco that has played a role in revitalizing the city and its growth, a city we are all proud of, is one that merits our support. 
   As I am reading what I have in front of me, I am thinking how in private industry we always hold up private industry and corporate America as the ones that do it on their own, and we don't want to do anything for community groups that may be trying to get some government help. But, you know, we have all kind of tax breaks and tax subsidies that we give corporate America to grow and invest. They have their think tanks, except we are talking about billions of dollars, so their think tanks are composed of people they deal with on a daily business. 
   Local folks, local small business people every so often need government to step in and give them a helping hand, not to carry them on their shoulders, but to help them grow. I think this is a fine example of a program that merits our support. For that reason, not only do I support it, but I respectfully rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

But you know something, as chairman of the committee that carries the earmarks, I respect the fact that every Member has a right to put them forth, and we looked at all of them, as did Mr. Regula, and the earmarks that are here are earmarks that we feel are proper.

   Mr. SERRANO. I suggest to my colleagues that they pay close attention to their TV sets because I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment and in support of the gentleman's program. Now, I'm going to do that and try to remain serious, because I'm supporting an earmark by the gentleman who spent over 3 days beating the heck out of all the earmarks on the House floor and telling us that he had never seen an earmark that he liked. I obviously saw an earmark that I like, his earmark, and he saw an earmark that he liked. 
   Granted that it's got a pretty bad title because people think it's a Christmas tree and Christmas tree opens up a discussion for loading up and all kinds of other things, but we actually looked at it and it's a worthy project. 
   My point in diplomatically somewhat embarrassing him is the point that I can see in him an ability and a desire to help his community, and he could not see in us for 3 1/2 torturous days our desire to help our community. And so I am rising as chairman of the committee asking both sides to go against Mr. Flake and support the gentleman's earmark because it indeed is one that helps his community and that's what it's all about. 
   But in the process of doing that, we also have to be careful what we say. The gentleman from Texas said that he supported Mr. Flake but opposed your amendment but thanked you for making this process possible. I have a surprise for you. Even if you had said nothing against earmarks, Mr. Flake was going to say something about earmarks for as long as he could because he's known for that. 
   So this is a very convoluted situation that I find myself in. But I support your earmark, I want you to take full credit for it, I want you to put a press release out and if you don't, I will put a press release out naming your program because I think it's a wonderful program and you should be proud of it. 
   I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.

   Mr. SERRANO. I'm in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. And the gentleman continues to stay with the theme that these programs can operate without government assistance. Yet, the gentleman, on many occasions, votes, as we all do, for programs where corporate America and other parts of our economic community, of our corporate community, gets help from government in order to put forth their product, in order to put forth their growth. 
   What my colleague, our freshman colleague is doing, and I compliment him on that, on the fact that as a freshman Member of this House, he already has, obviously, a sense of what his community needs. And this earmark, this modest earmark that he has put in this bill is one to take back to his community and continue to help to build the kind of small business education and information centers that we need. 
   And so I not only rise in support of it, but I commend the fact that already, at such a short time tenure in this House, he has that full understanding, willing, incidentally, to stand up and defend an earmark, knowing that some people will criticize him for it. But he knows his community better than we do. 
   And that's my whole point, that there seems to be a prevailing theme that only bureaucrats and Federal agencies, who I support, know how to spend taxpayers' dollars. 
   Well, no, this is a fine example of a new Member of the House who has a full understanding of his district, who is willing to stand up and defend what is a good earmark. And that's what we should respect, the fact that when we look at the global situation, these Member-driven items are a small amount of dollars, Mr. Chairman, compared to the overall budget. 
   I mean, I don't want to continue to harp on it, but the kind of money we spend in Iraq, billions, hundreds of billions, of dollars, a lot of that, as we know, unaccounted for, special contracts that went out that we never knew a thing about. Who got rich, who didn't get rich? That's never an issue on the House floor. That's never an issue. A couple hundred thousand dollars to a good community group in North Carolina, that's an issue. Yes, it is an issue. It's a good issue. It's a positive issue. It's the way dollars should be spent. 
   I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I support the gentleman's initiative. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Very briefly, Mr. Chairman, part of the argument that the gentleman from Arizona has been making in addition to the ones he has made before is how do we choose this particular program. 
   Well, that is where the wisdom of the local Member comes in. The Member is asked, is faced with these decisions, and that is how we make them. And, again, it seems to suggest that when grants are handed out at the Federal level, I mean, how many people apply for Federal grants? Hundreds of thousands? Millions? And only a handful get them. We don't question how those grants are handed out. We don't say necessarily that the Federal Government and that agency handed out the wrong grant. It was their decision to hand out that grant. No different, the wisdom used by the Member in his local community, her local community, to understand the needs and ask for a grant, ask for an earmark, and that is what the gentleman from West Virginia has done. 
   Mr. Chairman, with that in mind, I would like to yield to my colleague and classmate from New York, classmate in the State Assembly (Mr. Hinchey).

   Mr. Chairman, very briefly, this is a very interesting and important issue that the gentleman has brought up. I am just thinking, as I had prepared this bill, and sent it over to the executive for a signature, maybe I should declare myself as part of the executive for that period of time and get all the Secret Service protection and all that goes with it. If we start doing that, we could get to a big problem. He brings up an interesting point. It has to be dealt with. The Vice President has to decide if he is part of the Senate or is he a part of the executive branch. We can deal with it later once he tells us what he wants to do.

What this says is that they are not above the Constitution. No one is. The Vice President certainly is not.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is using a very interesting approach. He was part of a group that spent time questioning how we presented earmarks. At that time, we had already, under the leadership of Mr. Obey, come forth with a proper plan where transparency was the order of the day, where vetting each program, each request, was the order of the day. But that was not enough for the gentleman. It was not enough for the group that stood here day after day badgering us about earmarks. 
   Now the approach is to say that notwithstanding the fact that the earmarks are part of a very open process, that not withstanding the fact that there is a new day in how we handle earmarks, that notwithstanding the fact that we have cut earmarks by 50 percent, notwithstanding any of that, no earmark is good and all earmarks should disappear. 
   What is sad about that is that is not what we were originally presented with. We were not presented with that. We were presented with a belief that we had to do things differently. Notwithstanding the fact that the chairman, Mr. Obey, already had proposed a plan that was totally different from the past. They felt that it should be better or different or colored different, or whatever. 
   Now they want no earmarks. Well, people should be reminded that Member projects have been vetted through each Member's office. I have said over and over again that Members know the needs of their districts and Members know how to present an earmark through the committee staff to committee leadership. 
   Second, every item has been reviewed by the Appropriations Committee. The staff has taken long hours on both sides working in a bipartisan fashion to look at all requests and come up with the final list. We looked at your requests and you looked at our requests. We both looked at all of them. That is how we came to this. So we are pretty sure that everybody's concerns are taken into account here. 
   Members who sponsor these projects believe that they are worthy and that the taxpayers' money is being well spent. Again, whenever an agency spends money on giving out a grant to a community group, we don't have a discussion on the House floor, we don't have discussions on talk shows on TV or radio discussing those grants. 
   Billions of dollars are given out every year by the Federal Government to local groups and local projects, everything from building highways to supporting local initiatives. There is no discussion of that.     
   There is no oversight of that as such. But here, when a Member decides that he or she knows what is good for their district, we have to attack it. But again, the important point to note here as far as making an argument is that the argument was made that the process was not right, notwithstanding Mr. Obey having changed the system. Now we are being told that no matter what we do, the earmark is just not good. 
   I wonder if the gentleman is going to be supported by all other Members of his party who asked this chairman in writing for earmarks and were granted those earmarks. I wonder how they feel about this, and if they agree with you that all earmarks are bad. 
   Overall we have a diversity of projects in this bill. They touch urban and rural America, all regions of the country, women and minorities, as well as both sides of the aisle. We have technical assistance for start-up businesses, technology training, business attraction programs, small business incubators and job skills development. Members of this House have been able to identify many commendable projects. 
   The projects that the amendment's proponent is targeting are important projects to those Members and those communities. 
   I would say to the gentleman to really rethink this approach. If this approach is, with all due respect to him, a message for the 6:00 news, fine, I can't argue with that. You have done well, you have won on that issue. 
   This is really about saying that each individual colleague that surrounds you on your side and on this side does not know what is best for their district and that the process that we used to come to this point is a process that does not take into account everything that we could be worried about. Also, that it is not a process that has allowed Members to put forth their vision and at the same time have committee staff and other Members check to make sure. This may come as a shock to some Members, but there were projects where we felt either the vision or in some cases even the title had to be dealt with because we didn't want to do the wrong thing and we certainly didn't want to embarrass anyone. We did not accept every single project.

   Mr. SERRANO. I thank the gentlelady from Ohio for her comments and for raising these important consumer protection issues. I totally agree with her that this Congress must place a new emphasis on consumers and ensuring that defective and dangerous products, particularly from overseas, are kept from the marketplace. I commend the gentlelady for raising these issues. I look forward to working with you. 
   I may say that if you were to look at our bill and read through the language in the bill, the one thing you will see is a desire by this chairman and the subcommittee to begin anew to look at a whole new way of how consumers should be protected. I think that for too long in this country, we kind of pushed away consumerism as a true issue. We're coming back to that. This bill speaks strongly to that. I commend you for bringing up these issues.

   Mr. SERRANO. It's somewhat a hesitant approach to being against it for the simple reason that we're not sure on this side if his amendment accomplishes anything. The way the amendment is written, some would argue that what the gentleman does is remove In God We Trust from the coin. But it doesn't say that it places it anywhere else. And I know that's not his intent, that surely would not be my intent, and that would be a terrible talk show topic.

   Mr. SERRANO. Reclaiming my time, the way the statute is written, it would not allow that to happen. And in this case, we're actually trying to help you. We're suggesting that what you are doing will in some if not all cases remove In God We Trust and does not make provisions to place it anywhere else. That's our interpretation. That's why I said reluctant opposition because otherwise I would not oppose it. 
   Secondly, your bill speaks to an item put forth by the mint. Nowhere in this bill does the Mint come up. We don't deal with that. And so that also is an issue. But it's a kind of thing where opposing it will be misunderstood as badly as what you're proposing is totally misunderstood on this side. Your effect may be that you will go down in history as the gentleman who took In God We Trust off the coins and didn't put it on anywhere else.

   Mr. SERRANO. I am informed that the original law was sort of set aside when the law was passed for these particular sets of coins. In other words, these coins speak to In God We Trust on their own in that law, as I understand it. If you now remove that language here, then nothing kicks in from the previous law and you end up with the possibility of no In God We Trust on the coin. Please understand, we're not arguing against putting In God We Trust on the coin. We support it.

   Mr. SERRANO. First of all, if this is not a political stunt for the public and for those talk shows to carry in support, then why are we debating for 40 minutes an amendment that I accepted at the beginning and almost interrupted the gentleman in accepting it? 
   Another thing that's very interesting, if you don't believe that you have great support in the electronic media right now, if you don't believe that those stations have gone out of their way to give the conservative point of view and leave out those of us who may be considered liberals and who consider themselves liberals, then why are you so afraid of something called the fairness doctrine? If there's nothing to get fixed because there's nothing broken, what's the concern? 
   Well, obviously, you must know that there's something that you may stand to lose, otherwise you wouldn't make a big fuss about it. 
   Now, let me tell you something. Probably any so-called liberal you would get on radio, if one was hired by any of those stations, would probably be a moderate. You have nothing to worry about. Mr. Kucinich and I are not leaving Congress. We will not have a radio or TV show any time soon, and therefore, it won't be what you think it is. It'll be pretty moderate. 
   But, again, what is the problem with going against an issue where you claim that there's a problem and, in fact, we know no issue exists. Now, that seems to be a prevailing behavior here today. You have seen amendments and you will see more coming later that speak to something that's not an issue. It's not a problem. And this one, I'm actually accepting it. I'm saying let Rush and the other guys, you know, continue to be fair and balanced in their approach. That's fine with me. And here you want more and more and more of the same. 
   But, again, not to be flippant in any way, I assure you that neither in Spanish or in English have I been offered a radio show that would make your skin crawl moving it to the left where the debate should be at times. Have no fear, I'm staying in Congress for as long as I can be in Congress, and you have nothing to fear but your fears itself. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. SERRANO. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I was beginning to feel left out. We were moving along with this bill, and I had not seen the usual cast of very intelligent and proper folks come to the floor to attack the bill and to try to cut it. And I have to tell you, I'm a very sensitive guy, I was beginning to feel left out. But now I realize you care. Except that you care to an extreme. You want to cut this bill by 8.9 percent. And I noticed that you didn't say what you usually say, which is, that this is a small cut because you know that this is a devastating cut. 
   It is part of a mantra that's been taking place every day, where a group of you come and say that these bills are way over budget and they have to be cut. Now, I've been on the Appropriations Committee many years now. And during the 12, 14 years that the Republican Party was in control, just about every single year that I can remember every appropriations bill went up by a certain amount. And it was easy to see Republicans would have President Bush come in with a certain amount, and they would add more to it. And that's before it got to the Republican Senate. I'm not allowed to talk about the Senate, but you know what happens over there. But now, all of a sudden, these bills are way over budget, and you folks are so concerned. 
   Still, not a single one of you will vote for the real budget breaker, or against it, which is the war in Iraq. Yes, we have a deficit. But you know the truth, whether you like to admit it or not, when President Clinton left office, we had a surplus. That's not my comment, that's a fact. We had a surplus. We squandered that surplus. How? By going into a war built on lies and bad information, and now we're caught up to here in that war in many ways. The tragedy of lost life. But we're paying half a trillion dollars for it. No one on that side gets up to say that budget has to be cut. The budget that has to be cut is for the employees at the Treasury Department. It's for the FCC. It's for the Small Business Administration. It's for the agencies that help people in this country. 
   Now, interestingly enough, I thought that you were going to spare me, and I don't want to contradict myself that I felt left out, but that you were going to spare me because we came in below the President's request. Let's make that clear. Your President, my President, but your party's President, came in at $243 million above what we have in this bill. In other words, had I done exactly what President Bush wanted, this bill would be $243 million more. I came in at $243 million below, and you still want to cut it. 
   But you're not cutting it half a percent as some will do, or 1 percent, which is bad enough, but 8.9 percent. So what is this? Most of the funding in this bill, more than 80 percent, is for the administrative operations of about 25 Federal agencies. A cut of this magnitude called for in this amendment would devastate the Treasury Department, the judicial branch, and the Small Business Administration. Yes, the judicial branch. Our courts would be hurt.     
   We are in a war against terror. Part of what the Treasury Department does is to follow the money to see where terrorists could be moving money around in this country and overseas, money that could hurt us. 
   You are trying to cut this by 8.9 percent. Then what you will do is you will say, well, this is one cut. But then if you add all the amendments on cuts today, it will be close to 15 percent if we were to approve all of them. Just like if you add all the cuts on all the bills, we would just have to close up the government and go home. That may be a good idea for some of you. But right now, the Yankees are not winning as much as I want them to, so I may not want to go home for a while. 
   But understand something. I may at times make light of some of this. It is not a desire to say that this is not important. It is a full understanding that what you are doing is just to score political points. Because you can't, on one hand, vote to continue to approve half a trillion for the war in Iraq and at the same time say that you want to cut money from the Treasury Department, the Small Business Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
   On the other hand, you can't continue to support tax cuts that went to the richest people in the country and at the same time say that you want to cut this. It doesn't make any sense. Just the same way that you support tax cuts for the rich, but resisted until we had to drag you, kicking and screaming, to approve a minimum wage increase of a couple of bucks for people who haven't had one in 40 years. 
   So let's be honest. Let's be honest. You want to be serious? Let's be serious. Come to the floor and present some things that are serious in nature. You are devastating this bill. We are not going to stand for it. That is why we urge everyone to reject this amendment.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I truly do apologize if the gentlewoman thought that the word ``cast'' was improper. I will speak to our Hollywood friends and ask them if it's improper to have a cast of individuals. It could be a cast of bad characters, or a cast of good characters. I am sure it is a cast of very dedicated folks who have a point to make and are trying to make it.     
   As far as whether or not we live away from our districts, any time that anyone on that side wants to compare backgrounds to how I grew up and how I got here and why I thank the good Lord that I am here every day, we can debate which public housing any member of the Republican Party grew up in, as I did, where they were born and how they grew up. So I take great pride in the fact that I managed to keep in touch, because it is very hard to lose your roots once you get to a certain place. 
   Now, the other thing we hear all the time is that whenever we say that we are wasting money in Iraq, that somehow is an insult on the troops. The greatest support we can give our troops is to bring them home tomorrow morning. That is the true support. 
   I want to see folks, 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now, when we have to pick up the tab and, rightfully so, deal with the wounded who come back from Iraq, if we are going to be standing here also trying to cut budgets the way we are now. But I suspect that it will be the same way that it happened after the Gulf War, where the folks who were all hot and bothered about sending folks off to war then didn't want to put any money into the Veterans' Administration or for services for our troops. 
   So using a phrase that my chairman would use, Mr. Obey, don't lecture me, don't lecture any of us, on who cares for the troops. We all care for the troops. I would never question whether you care for the troops. It is just that we differ. You think that you care for the troops by keeping them there for as long as they have to be there, which may be 10 more years. I care for the troops by bringing them home tomorrow morning. 
   Lastly, it was my city that saw the largest part of the terrorist attack on September 11. The gentlewoman said we are in Iraq because we were attacked. 
   No. We are in Afghanistan, which I voted for us going there, because we  were attacked. We are in Iraq because we were lied to and half the Congress believed it. And now no one, not even the administration, admits in any way, shape or form that Saddam Hussein or anything that happened in Iraq had anything to do with September 11th. 
   The American people know that. They may think that we have to stay there a little longer. They may have whatever opinion they have. But the American people know that there is no relationship between Iraq and September 11th, and that is a fact. So we can continue to talk about how we have to keep spending this money. Not true. 
   This cut is a devastating cut to this bill. This bill is a responsible bill. This bill did what you claim you wanted to do. It came in below the President's request. I haven't heard one person get up and say, ``My God, the President wanted more than SERRANO. SERRANO gave less than the President wanted, so he did pretty good, because boy, that President is a big spender.'' 
   No. He continues to be the fiscal conservative, and somehow we are the big spenders. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume in closing. 
   Mr. Chairman, much was said by the gentleman who spoke before about the earmarks once again. Well, he will have an opportunity, and so will all of us. There is an amendment by Mr. Campbell pending striking all the earmarks from the bill. I certainly will be voting against that amendment, but I will be watching with much anticipation how folks on that side vote on that amendment, because that will get rid of every single earmark from the bill. 
   Secondly, it is a devastating cut. All of these are devastating cuts. Whether we like it or not, we will continue to remind you that the great amount of money that has been squandered here was the major tax cut that went to the wealthiest, the richest people in this country, and that you continue to support, and, secondly, the fact that you will not join us in getting out of Iraq so we can save that money that we are spending over there. That is a fact. 
   To bring that fight home on this bill, which came in below the President's request, is really a totally improper way to attack it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I hope every Member votes against this amendment.

   Mr. Chairman, I will take a couple of minutes, and then what I want to do is reserve the balance of my time with the right to close, so there probably won't be a need to ask me if I have any more speakers for a while, or at all. 
   But this is, again, the same thing. It is yet another cut, another desire to say we should have gone deeper in our cuts. When I think of this, I wonder, if we should have come to where the President wanted. The President wanted $243 million more. We decided in a proper way to come below the request of President Bush. Maybe we should have come at President Bush's level, and then you would be cutting his request more and more, rather than what I bring you today. 
   But, again, this is a devastating cut. There is no other word for it. You are going after a bill that is a bare-bones bill. There is no fat in here. Mr. Regula, who worked on this with us, knows there is no fat in here. The cuts just pile up, and I understand what you are doing. 
   With that, I just hope that everybody will vote against this amendment.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, you know, I have been in this House 17 years. During those years, I have done what comes natural to me, which is to be a gentleman. In addition, I have tried very hard whenever I know that you may lose your temper a little bit to be a diplomat. But I think when people try to twist people's words it is pretty sad. 
   The gentlewoman spoke about being out of touch. I said that when you grow up in a public housing project you stay in touch. She quickly did that right-wing thing about growing up on welfare. My parents worked hard. My father had 2 years of schooling. My mother was the highly educated one. She had 6. Both of them died before their 65th birthday. 
   They raised two kids. One has been with the Commerce Department, way before I got into Congress by the way, for many years; and this one is not doing too bad being a Member of Congress. 
   That wasn't welfare. It was a form of housing. To insult people who live in subsidized housing for the poor as some sort of welfare cheats is to demean the nature of the debate in this House. 
   I will always be proud of the years I spent in the Millbrook Projects in the South Bronx. I will be proud of my years in public school. I will be proud of the fact that I came to the United States not speaking English and that I learned to speak whatever it is that I speak now, whether it is good or bad English. I am proud of that. 
   But to suggest somehow that what we are doing here today in promoting expenditures in Iraq that are a waste of money, not in how we use them for the troops but how we got into that war, or suggesting that because in 2010 people making millions of dollars in this country may have a sunset provision which was set up by the Republican Party on their major tax break when it comes to an end so that they, the ones who make 20, 50, 100, 200 million a year, a billion, may have to pay a little more so that someone else can get a little health care, if that is what this debate is about, then we have reached a very, very low point. 
   Now, I probably will sit down after I speak and regret having said what I said because I don't like to engage on a personal basis, but if you ever want to know what public housing is like, it is not a vacation. It is not a cabin in the Catskill Mountains or on the Outer Banks of anywhere. It is a very difficult life, but a wonderful life because it teaches you a lot. I am the man I am today because I grew up in public housing. It was not welfare. It was not a gift. It was just the way it was. I resent personally anyone who tries to cheap-shot this situation by hiding behind any comments that I might have made. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. I just want to follow up on what Chairman Obey has said because that's the first thing that came to mind when I heard my friend, Mr. Kingston, make the comments that he made. One of the in-house publications said, and I'm trying to remember the headline, after reading our bill, said ``Democrats move towards more consumerism,'' or ``to protect consumers.'' 
   You know, Mr. Chairman, if we do nothing else in this subcommittee for the next 20 years and all we have,  Chairman Obey, as that headline says, that this subcommittee moved to protect the consumer, we did the right thing. 
   Under Chairman Obey's leadership, we were asked to hold a series of thematic hearings. Those hearings were to see how government can come closer to the people and the people closer to the government. Those hearings were set out to find out the best way over a 5, 10-year span of time to see how we can begin to gear government to service the people. 
   So what did we do? Yes, we increased dollars for the agencies to protect the consumer. Agencies that have been devastated for the last few years. Devastated. And now we simply are saying that those agencies will now begin to pay more attention to the consumer. That is a good thing. 
   You've heard people on this House floor talk about issues having to do with products that come in from other countries that are not safe, everything from food items to toys to clothing. This is a good thing. And I tell you one thing. If you pay attention to what we do this year, if you pay attention to what we will try to do in conference, if you pay attention to next year's bill and the year after that, there will be a prevailing theme in language and in dollars, but mostly in language, directing the agencies to pay attention to the protection of the consumer. 
   We also did something else that goes hand in hand with that. We looked at the agencies and said, you know, there are things you can do to help the average American understand government and be serviced by government. So some people may take it lightly that we've asked all agencies to see how much time they can spend in the classroom, in schools, visiting schools, participating with the men and women of the future. They may say, ``Well, that's not a function of government.'' It is. These agencies can go and participate in the schools. 
   We asked the Election Assistance Commission, for instance, to encourage schools at every level to use the same voting equipment that is used in local elections. Why do we do that? Because it's not improper to have a child in the eighth grade or in high school using the same equipment that he or she will be asked to use when they turn 18 and they're eligible to vote. These are not bad suggestions. These are pro-consumer suggestions. And so we stand proud behind them and we think it's a proper thing to do. 
   These cuts attack all of that. These cuts attack our vision for bringing government closer to the people. That's why I oppose this amendment, and I would hope all other Members do the same thing. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. I will be brief, but I think part of what you hear from the other side is an innovative way of using the English language. So they speak about cuts and increases and tax increases and in a way which doesn't necessarily speak to reality. So let me try the same thing then. I might as well. 
   The President wanted $243 million more than this bill that comes to you today. 
   Therefore, I would say, I cut the President. But I haven't seen one of you get up to say that was a good thing. 
   The President wanted $243 million more in our bill than what we are presenting to you. Therefore, the President took a cut. Mr. Chairman, I know I am not supposed to speak to them, I want to see them do the same thing when the President proposes more money for Iraq and for that war that was based on lies and bad information, and see if you are willing to cut that. 
   Secondly, you keep saying that this bill is 8, 9, 10 percent above last year. Again, a play on the English language, because this bill did not exist last year. 
   This is a new subcommittee. This committee is composed of different agencies that were put together for this committee. 
   Therefore, technically speaking, this is the first budget we give you. Next year, you can either say that I cut it or I increased it, but not this year, because this bill did not involve anything from last year. 
   Now, you could say, now he is getting picky. But if you listen to their proposals for the last couple of weeks, that's what they have been doing. They have been discussing these issues that have nothing to do with anything. 
   Again, you are going after a bill that came in very tight, a bill that came in below the President's request, a bill that funds basic services, a bill that has 80 percent of its funding for administrative operations in 25 different agencies. There is no fat here; there is no waste of money here. 
   Do you want to discuss waste of money? Later on we can discuss the war in Iraq, and we can discuss the tax cuts for millionaires that we have in place. That is the real waste of money, but we won't touch that. We will continue to bash this poor little bill that came in under the President's request. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I just want to, first of all, comment that I must have hit a nerve in telling the truth, because the gentleman from Georgia got so excited that he made some noise that I'm trying to figure out later what it means. Something, hee-haw or haw-hee or  something. I'll try to figure it out later. 
   But anyway, the point is that no one is lecturing anyone. The ones who've been doing lecturing, Mr. Chairman, have been people saying that these bills have to be cut. These bills are bare-bone bills. This one in particular came in under the President's request, cut the President's request by $245 million. 
   We set out to help agencies to help people. We demand, we encourage them, actually, to come closer to the people. We do a lot to allow the District of Columbia to deal with some of its issues, something that Mr. Regula and I believe in strongly. That's what this bill does. 
   But we still can't get away from the fact that when we deal with cuts, you could present it any way you want. There's only one cut where the American people will actually feel something happening, and that is if you cut this continued ability to allow only the richest people in the country, the millionaires and the zillionaires to get incredible tax cuts where they take home 160,000 more dollars than they took last year, or 220,000 more dollars than they took home last year; or if you ever get the courage to say to President Bush, this is your war, you started this war, we have to end the pain of the war, but in the process, we have to end the continuing waste. And I say waste, because it shouldn't have been there in the first place, of half a trillion dollars. That's a lot of money. 
   Cutting the Consumer Product Safety Commission, cutting the FCC, cutting the SEC, cutting the Small Business Administration, that's not going to make a difference, and you know it. 
   Let's have the courage to tell the President to get out of Iraq and save half a trillion dollars that he will now spend if we stay there, and then we're talking real dollars. 
   I hope that everybody will oppose this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

And I guess for all intents and purposes, I have to do that, except that when I read the amendment, I realized that, with all due respect to the gentleman, it doesn't change anything because it speaks to something that doesn't exist. There's nothing in this bill that says that anything can be done that he doesn't want done. 
   I know that's confusing. I showed it to Chairman Obey because I wanted to make sure. He agrees with me. I showed it to staff and, to my amazement, I was right with everybody. This amendment speaks to an issue that is not an issue; therefore, he's asking to undo something that is not done. Nothing's broken that needs to be fixed.

   Madam Speaker, I would like to point out to the Members of the House that adoption of the motion to recommit offered by the gentleman from California will kill the bill. The motion instructs the committee to report the bill back promptly rather than forthwith. 
   Madam Speaker, section 1002(b) of the House manual states, ``Unlike the case of the motion to recommit with instructions to report back forthwith, the adoption of which occasions an immediate report on the floor, the adoption of a motion to recommit with instructions to report back promptly sends the bill to committee, whose eventual report, if any, would not be immediately before the House.'' 
   Madam Speaker, a vote for this motion to recommit kills the bill. A vote against the motion will allow the bill to go forward to final passage. 
   I urge prompt defeat of the motion to recommit.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, this is the kind of amendment that shows up every so often. It plays to our patriotic feelings and to our feelings of wanting to be good Americans. So what you tell Americans is that if a language other than English is used anywhere in the country for any purpose, somehow, as the gentleman says, it attacks our democracy and threatens our democracy. 
   We are not saying that we want people to stay away from learning to speak English, and I think it is important to note that when people come into this country and what some folks go through to come into this country, that is a statement about how much they want to be in this country. Is it true that Mom and Dad may take a little longer to speak English? Absolutely. But the young man that comes in or the young woman that comes in at the age of 8, 9, 10, 12, whatever, I assure you that 10 months after they are here, they are acting very American and a year or two later they are speaking English. That's a fact of life.  
   In fact, I know this for a fact as one who spoke Spanish before he spoke English. When Hispanics sit around the dinner table and the issue of language comes up, it has never been a plot against the English language. It is usually the lament by the grandmother that the grandchildren no longer speak Spanish. That is the reality of America. That is how it has been from day one. That is how it is always going to be. 
   Now, what is it that we provide here? We are saying that if you still have not reached that point where you feel comfortable enough in English to deal with government services, you can go to a Web site, listen to this, and say, Where is my tax refund? That in itself makes a statement. It says you are working in this country, that you are paying taxes in the country, that you have a refund coming, and you want to know where your refund is. So to make it easier for you to communicate and get that service, the IRS has seen fit to put together that kind of a service. 
   Now, folks who deal with the IRS on a regular basis like the IRS National Taxpayers Advocate, in the annual report earlier this year, commended the IRS for the efforts to establish a Spanish-language version of Where's My Refund? 
   So if you don't like the fact that this service is provided, say that. That's fine. But don't make it sound like this is a threat to our democracy. This country is strong for what it is and who we are, not because we have a website that allows people, who speak Spanish and feel a little more comfortable as they transition into English, get this kind of information. 
   What is ironic is that we come to the House floor and make all these comments about government agencies offering Spanish as a language, but, Mr. Chairman, none of our colleagues from the other side ever get up and criticize their friends in corporate America who on a daily basis advertise in Spanish. 
   Do you know that there is an ESPN in Spanish, there is an ESPN Deportes in Spanish? There's a Fox, yes, a Fox News in Spanish. There's a Fox Sports, I said Fox, in Spanish. There's a People magazine in Spanish. 
   Now, is that government doing that or is that corporate America, who at times hangs out more with that side than this side, doing what they know is correct to sell their products? All these folks are saying is to give a service to the people, we will do it in Spanish too. Trust me, this does not threaten the democracy at all. 
   I am, on a personal level, kind of a little shocked at my friend, the only man who ever passed a ball to me in a congressional basketball game because he knows of my lack of talent, and he knows he's my friend, but you would think he comes from another State. He comes from Florida. 
   I don't know how you are going to explain this back home. I am trying to help you here. Maybe you want to withdraw this amendment so you can save a lot of headaches back home.

You don't go through all of that to decide later that you don't want to be part of this society and not speak English. That is a fallacy. That is not true. And I can tell you firsthand it doesn't happen. 
   I can tell you that I go to community meetings now in my district where there is no need any longer to say a word in Spanish other than to sound cute at the beginning by saying, Hola. Como esta, Ustedes? 
   This is not a problem. And I am trying to save you, once again, from all this wrath you're going to get back in  Florida for proposing this. So I still give you a chance to withdraw this. I hope everybody will vote against this amendment.

   My other point, because I don't want to take up your time, is, it's interesting to note how the language changes. Now you're saying they're getting money back from the government, they should be happy to do that in English. Just a few minutes ago, for 3 days, for 3 weeks we heard how the government only holds the money from the taxpayer. So only this group is getting money back from the government, the rest of the Nation is just having the government hold their money.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my support for the final passage of H.J. Res. 20, a joint funding resolution to provide continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2007. Let me be clear, although we have been able to take care of some of the most significant shortfalls, this is not a perfect funding resolution. This is also not the process that we would have preferred, because, as we all know, the funding for fiscal year 2007 should have been completed during the 109th session of Congress under the Republican majority. 
   With respect to the agencies included within the jurisdiction of the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, a bi-partisan attempt was made to address the most pressing needs. For example: 
   SBA disaster loans will receive $114 million for administrative costs.

   Mr. SERRANO. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, this has to be one of the worst ideas ever put forth. Just think of it: Instead of getting the IRS to collect the tax dollars, we go and tell someone else that they can collect 24 cents on the dollar, instead of hiring more folks to collect what they have been doing for so many years. So we lose 24 cents on every dollar, rather than have someone take care of this. 
   Now, the IRS has spent $71 million in money we have given them on this program and have collected in return somewhere between $20 and $25 million. The IRS Taxpayer Advocate, as was mentioned by the gentleman, calculated that if this money had been spent by the IRS to collect, they would have collected $1.4 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have also heard here about the harassment tactics. Now, we can deny it as much as we would like, but when you give me an incentive of 24 cents on the dollar to collect from taxpayers, things can get out of hand. That is why senior citizens have been called 150 times in a month's time, looking for their son. My friends, these kind of tactics would make a great comeback episode for ``The Sopranos,'' and I think one might be in the works. 
   Mr. Speaker, the IRS can do this work. We tried to do this, as you know, in our committee, and it was defeated, basically with the minority party saying on a point of order they would pull it out of the bill. But it was our intent to do that in our bill. In addition, we put in $400 million in fiscal year 2008. With this funding, the IRS should be able to start working on these cases themselves, without outsourcing. 
   I know, as Mr. Rothman has said, that there is a madness in this House about taking everything that American workers do and sending it somewhere else, overseas usually, and then what government employees do, they send it to another agency or to somebody else. I can't wait for the day when you decide that the whole Congress should be outsourced overseas and we should have people doing our work. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a bad idea. We should pass this bill and stop this program immediately.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to take a moment to highlight some of the provisions that were included in the Financial Services and General Government section of the omnibus appropriations legislation that we are considering this evening. 
   Despite a limited allocation, and multiple cuts subsequent to the House passed bill, the Financial Services and General Government portion reflects the commitment that I made when I became chairman to work on behalf of our consumers and to bring the priorities of the agencies that this bill funds closer to the needs of our citizens, especially the most disadvantaged. 
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission will receive a more than 27 percent increase over 2007 to help keep dangerous products out of the hands of our children. This is especially poignant this holiday season as we shop for safe gifts for our children. Funding for the Federal Trade Commission is increased by 15 percent over 2007 so that we can better address the problems of identity theft and deceptive lending practices, which impact more and more consumers. 
   We have an obligation to assist our States as they struggle to make sure that our 2008 elections are accurate and reliable. There was included $125 million for grants to help States comply with the Help America Vote Act, including upgrading voting machines and voter registration databases. All citizens want to be sure that their vote will count. This important funding moves us closer to that goal. 
   I am especially proud that we were able to fund the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund at $94 million, a 72-percent increase over 2007. This fund expands economic development and affordable financial services for underserved communities through housing loans, micro-business loans, and community development banks and credit unions. 
   It is my firm belief that the Federal Government should not dictate to the District of Columbia how it should manage its own affairs or spend its own money. In this section we took some important steps in this direction by allowing the District of Columbia to use its own local funds for needle exchange programs to help fight the spread of HIV/AIDS. This also removes longstanding restrictions on the use of local funds by District leaders in support of voting representation in the United States Congress. In addition, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the territories will, with the passage of this omnibus, have quarters with  designs they help select issued in 2009 to honor them and raise awareness of the diverse places that fly the American flag. 
   The consumers of today and tomorrow must have financial education programs that help them to better understand the complicated financial world in which we operate. The current subprime lending crisis is just one example of how important this funding is in our society today. The Office of Financial Education at the Department of the Treasury will receive $1.1 million, with $200,000 targeted at our future consumers currently in our elementary and high schools, and $200,000 aimed at efforts to protect all consumers against predatory lending. There is also an increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget specifically for investor education and protection. 
   As our tax forms and obligations become more complicated, we as a government should provide additional taxpayer assistance. In order to address this need, $31.2 million is included above the President's request to increase IRS outreach and education services for taxpayers and small businesses, and tax return preparation services at Taxpayer Assistance Centers. There is an additional $6.7 million above the President's request to improve the services of the Taxpayer Advocate Service and its oversight of the IRS. Eight million is included for a new pilot grant program for Community Volunteer Income Assistance sites and $1 million over the President's request for Low-Income Taxpayer Clinics. 
   Recognizing the importance of our small businesses, there is an 11 percent increase over 2007 for Small Business Development Centers. The Microloan program is funded at $17 million, which includes the $15 million for technical assistance that had been eliminated in the President's request. 
   Our Federal workforce will be receiving a 3.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment. In addition, there are provisions to make sure that Federal workers whose jobs are threatened by privatization will have protections to ensure that the competitions against contractors are fair and unbiased. This bill also includes an important provision to improve congressional oversight of the practice of service contracting in Federal agencies. With contracting government-wide having grown to over $400 billion, Congress needs to ensure that it has necessary information on the size and scope of contracting in each agency. The bill will establish a pilot program that will require the Office of Management and Budget, OMB to track the cost and size of service contracts in three Cabinet-level departments. The program will give particular attention to contracts that have been performed poorly by a contractor because of excessive costs or inferior quality. It is also our intent that agencies other than the Department of Defense participate in this program, since the Department of Defense will already be subject to contract inventory requirements included in section 807 of the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, for fiscal year 2008. 
   I also want to clarify our intent with respect to section 739(b) of the Financial Services bill, regarding the use of public-private competition to evaluate the benefits of converting work from contract performance to performance by Federal employees. The NDAA includes section 324 relating to insourcing new and contracted out functions, and the Department of Defense should follow the provisions included in section 324 of its authorization. 
   There are also important provisions to address real national security needs. Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence receives $56.8 million to help coordinate with the rest of the U.S. intelligence community and with other countries to combat terrorist financing. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network receives $85.8 million to increase the number of financial transaction analysts coordinating with intelligence agencies and law enforcement, and the number of staff working to ensure Bank Secrecy Act compliance by financial institutions. Funding is included for additional Treasury staff to improve the review process of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. 
   I am also proud that this section of the bill recognizes, through real dollars, how we value and want to protect our national heritage. Operating expenses for the National Archives are funded at $315 million in order to restore the research hours that had been reduced and to expand the workforce of professional archivists. The Archives' grant program will receive $9.5 million to assist in the preservation of the historic documents of States, local governments, universities, local historical societies, and others. 
   Our Financial Services portion will benefit Americans by bringing Government in the agencies funded in this section closer to the people and make it better able to fit its services to their needs. The American people expect and deserve the best services their Government can offer and this is reflected in this pro-consumer section. 
   Let me conclude by thanking my friend, ranking member, and partner, Congressman REGULA, for his hard work and collaboration throughout this process. We might not agree on everything, but we worked together to try and fashion the best possible financial services section. I also want to express my appreciation and thanks for the hard work of our staff, both the majority and the minority. They are dedicated and devoted countless hours to the final product that we are considering today. 
   I will vote in favor of this omnibus legislation tonight as we move this process forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. I thank the gentleman. You are right. Perhaps it is that example that I present to you that shows why the system is broken. Because my parents chose to move in 1950 to New York, I am able to be a Member of Congress with full voting rights. 
   Had I stayed in Puerto Rico, I could only aspire to be a Resident Commissioner, which is fine enough, but without full voting rights. So, question: Since when does residency overpower and overtake citizenship? The 4 million people who live in Puerto Rico, the citizens, American citizens who live in all of the territories, have no way to represent themselves in Congress, have no way to vote for the President of the United States. 
   At this very moment, dozens of Puerto Ricans are mourned as they have died in the war in Iraq. Yet, their colleagues who will come back will not be able to express themselves in Congress, or express themselves through a Presidential vote in terms of how they feel about that war or about that service. 
   And so the issue today is simply this: Do you believe that American citizens, American citizens, that has to be repeated, American citizens, who live in territories, not States, have certain rights? I believe they have full rights. If it was up to me they would have full voting representation. 
   All we are saying today is that those Delegates, these representatives, will have a right to participate on the House floor.     
   We don't even go far enough to say that if the vote makes a difference, it stays put; there is a revote. 
   So what are we really giving them? An opportunity to participate in democracy. How can we be trying to spread democracy throughout the world when we are not willing to spread it right here at home? 
   Four million citizens live in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Those 4 million could have six or seven Members of Congress if they were a State. The gentleman, rightfully so, says, well, if they want to be a State, they should be a State. There is only one problem with that: The group holding the colony, the American Government, has to initiate that progress, that system, to bring people into the Union.  You can't hold a colony for 108 years, in the case of Puerto Rico, and expect them to tell you at what time they want to be whatever they want to be, because for 108 years you have divided them into three different movements: independence, Commonwealth, statehood. 
   If we are holding the territory of Puerto Rico, it is our responsibility to say, we are ready to invite you to come in.

   Mr. SERRANO. I want to thank the gentlemen, both the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee and the ranking member of the full committee, for this very important legislation. 
   My reason for speaking is simply to inform you of what you may already know has taken place on the bill that we voted on the other night. The commission had a budget of $62 million. The President's request was $63 million. During our hearing process, our subcommittee oversees the agency, we were shocked to hear from them that they didn't need any more money. In the middle of such a crisis, they were the only agency in the Federal Government saying, ``Don't give us any more money.'' 
   Well, understanding the need and within the limited resources, we went from this year's $62 million to a full $80 million, and I wish it could have been $280 million. The purpose of my comments is to remind both sides that since we increased the dollars by $18  million, it was a message that we were all sending that we understand the need to take care of these issues and to react in a very positive way. And so it falls on us now to be very vigilant to make sure that they do the work that they are supposed to do. 
   There is nothing more important in my opinion at this present moment than to ensure the American people that products that are coming into this country and products that are being produced in this country are safe and proper for their children, for their families. We can do it through this bill. We can do it through the appropriations that we had the other night. I thank all of you again for being very vigilant in this kind of work.

   Mr. SERRANO. Reclaiming my time, the gentleman has made important observations regarding the necessity of keeping Congress' commitment to repay this long-term debt to the Postal Service. I agree with my colleague that failure to meet this commitment would adversely affect the future financial stability of the Postal Service and eventually force it to take actions that would increase cost for postal consumers. I want to assure the gentleman that I will work hard to reach an agreement with the Senate that produces a conference report that provides the $29 million payment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would also like to take this opportunity to call on the administration to resume including these funds in its budget requests. The revenue forgone appropriation has not been part of the President's budget request since fiscal year 2004.  
   As I have previously stated, this bill's budget allocation is $243 million below the President's request, so we are placed in a very difficult position when we have to find money for critically important items that have been left out of the President's budget. 
   I strongly urge the administration to recognize the importance of the revenue foregone appropriation and include it in future budgets.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. Decreasing funding to the Selective Service by $10 million would effectively shut down the agency, and we need to understand that. Regardless of how you feel about this issue, the effect would be to shut down the agency. 
   Now, everyone know that I'm no fan of this war. With my votes that's been made clear. But we must recognize the value of the Selective Service as an inexpensive insurance plan to back up our Active Duty and Reserve Armed Forces. We have a war going on, and we have to have in place many institutions, if you will, and programs that will, at any moment's notice, respond to a congressional call for a draft or any other involvement. 
   Now, there's also something that we need to understand here. The gentleman wants to take $10 million and give it to the Small Business Administration. I think it's important to note first that prior to full committee markup, we had already increased the Small Business Administration by $40 million. That was above the President's request. In full markup we added another $80 million to the Small Business Administration.     
   So right now they are at $120 million above the President's request and additional dollars that were brought to light during this whole procedure. 
   So to send it over to small business is not only an interesting statement because it is a way to get support for something that may be unpopular like a draft, but the fact of life is that there probably could have been another 20 agencies that one could have selected to send money to if that was the point. 
   So I think that, number one, the Small Business Administration has been taken care of very well in this bill. Number two, there is no need and there should be no desire to cripple the Selective Service Administration, and for that reason, I would hope that our colleagues would vote against this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SERRANO. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, the provisions of this bill ensure that when Federal employees compete with private contractors, it will be done on a level playing field. 
   The administration's push to contract out Federal employees' jobs is part of a massive push towards private contracting by this administration. Federal contracts rose from 207 billion in 2000 to roughly 400 billion in 2006. 
   The New York Times reported in February that the increase in contracting is driven by a philosophy that encourages outsourcing almost everything government does. I may add that the day is not far off when they will try to outsource the Congress. 
   The administration claims that it wants a smaller government, yet it has promoted a hidden workforce of private-sector contractors and grantees who get rich off the government, but are not accountable. The number of contractors increased by 2.5 million since 2002, which is 98 percent higher than the slight increase in the Civil Service workforce. 
   Congress has raised serious questions regarding the cost-effectiveness in this level of contracting and of outsourcing many Federal employees' functions. In many cases we see government employees working side by side with contractors with the same responsibilities, yet their compensation, benefits, protections and accountability are much different. These are serious issues. 
   This amendment would strike the modest improvements in the competitive sourcing language that has been carried on appropriations bills for several years. These improvements would help protect the rights of Federal employees. 
   And let me just comment on the fact that this amendment not only takes out the language that was included in  this bill, but, in fact, takes a full step backward and undoes that which we have done in past bills, even during the time that the Republicans were in control of the House. 
   What we do here is ensure that a contractor does not receive a cost advantage by not offering a health plan, or offering an inferior health plan or retirement plan to its employees, assuring appeals rights for Federal employees in cases of privatization decisions that adversely affect them just as contractors currently have appeal rights, and ensuring that OMB doesn't direct or request agencies to conduct competitions if they otherwise would choose not to. 
   This is really just an unnecessary amendment. It is directed at destroying the last bit of opportunity the Federal employees have for full protection. That has to be made clear. There is no need for this amendment other than to try to outsource everything and destroy the Federal workforce. 
   We all have great respect for our Federal employees. Throughout the history of this Congress and in recent years, we've worked in a bipartisan fashion to reduce spending here and there, but this just goes at the heart of this assault that this administration has on Federal employees. And for that reason, and so many others, I urge a strong ``no'' vote on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I have the utmost respect for the gentleman. He knows how much I respect his desire to improve every bit of the educational programs in D.C., but there are a couple of things we need to know. 
   First of all, this program is funded at $35.1 million. Interestingly enough, when we approached the D.C. government about this program, we asked what amount they wanted, and this was exactly the amount which was the President's request. They told us that they did not want or need any more. So it is funded at the President's request. 
   The big problem with this, and what I want to speak about, is the message that this cut sends to the public and to those folks who like to spend a lot of time attacking Members of Congress on both sides. The Special Counsel's Office is involved at this very moment in some very sensitive and high-profile investigations having to do with whistle-blower issues, having to do with the Hatch Act and having to do with so many other issues that we have read about and talked about for a while. 
   If you are talking about a bipartisan way of inviting attacks on Congress and criticism of Congress, this is probably the best way to accomplish that. Because for $1 million to a program that is funded at the full presidential  request, a program where the District of Columbia has said they didn't want any more money, for that $1 million, to give the impression they were somehow trying to put a damper on the investigations taking place is just the wrong message. For that alone, we should oppose it on both sides of the aisle. 
   In fact, I would hope, after listening to what I know the gentleman has maybe already paid attention to in the past in putting together this amendment, that he would actually consider withdrawing the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I am suggesting this is the wrong time and the wrong place to do it, because they are involved in very serious investigations, and the last thing we need is for the public and the talk show hosts to say that Congress, because they won't say you or I, that party or this party, that Congress is trying to put a chill on these investigations. 
   During the hearings, for the record, we asked the D.C. Government if they wanted more dollars. We gave them the opportunity to tell us if they wanted more than the President's request, and they said no.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, this is one of those amendments that leaves you scratching your head. This really is an issue that has been visited for so many years and well understood by the medical profession and activists and citizens throughout this country. We are not promoting the use of drugs. In fact, every needle exchange program that I am familiar with, including the one that exists in my congressional district, encourages people to seek treatment, demands in many cases that you seek treatment. But all it says is that while you are a drug addict, while you are trying to get off that addiction, that you not spread the HIV virus by sharing needles. 
   This is a very sensible medical approach to a very serious social issue and a medical issue. When you have folks who are addicted, the impression that some people get is that this is some sort of a party that people go to and they get drugs by getting needles. What you get is a medical procedure that says you're addicted, we want to help you, we want you to submit yourself to treatment, but in the meantime we will ask you to use this needle rather than one that you can share with someone else and either get the HIV virus or pass it on to someone else. 
   Washington, DC, is number one in the Nation in AIDS cases right now. All this language says is that the local government will be able to use its local funds to put forth a needle exchange program. My God. To what extent will we continue in this House as we have in the past to take every social issue that we can't win in our local districts and bring it and put it on the people of the District of Columbia and say this is how we want you to behave, because this is what I believe in and back home I can't do this, so I'm going to do it on you and I'm going to do it to you.     
   The mayor, city council, the leadership, has asked over and over again, give us the opportunity to deal with this issue on our own, in our own way, and in our own terms. 
   We are not, if I had my way, I would have said that Federal funds could be used for a needle exchange program. That's who I am. But that's not what this says. This simply says that those dollars that are raised locally by the people in the District of Columbia, that they can use it for a program that can save lives, that can stop the spread of AIDS, that can deal with an issue in the most proper and humane way. 
   This is one of those issues where you have to go deep into your soul, into your heart and not deal with the rhetoric of what sounds right in a 30-second sound bite, but what is proper for public safety, for public health, and for the human dignity of a person that already has a major problem. 
   I have dealt with a lot of people who are addicted for a long time in my district. I know the pain they go through. At the expense of perhaps making light of it, when they show up at a needle exchange program, they are not dressed in tuxedos with martinis in their hands having a ball. They are people who are hurting, hurting and trying to survive somehow. This may just give them a chance not to get sick, but perhaps just as important, or most importantly, not to make someone else sick. 
   I would hope that the gentleman fully understands what this is. One, it's local control over the destiny of the District of Columbia; and, secondly, it is a proper medical way for this society to deal with an issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, just one comment. First of all, the committee received a letter in support of removing the prohibition signed by 29 leaders of medical, public health and social service organizations. 
   In addition, while drug use is illegal, users should not have to pay with their lives. Studies conducted by the CDC, NIH, National Academies of Science and the GAO, which demonstrate that needle exchange programs reduce the incidence of HIV. I mean, this is an array of serious government agencies saying that this, in fact, reduces HIV. 
   So, on the one hand we spent a lot of money in this country, both here at home and overseas. To the President's credit, he has picked up the ball lately on that issue, and has responded better than in the past on the idea of fighting this disease throughout the world. 
   Well, right here at home, right here in the Nation's Capital, where the largest number of people infected exist now, the largest ratio, we could deal with this by simply allowing them to do what they must do.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, in anticipation of the possibility that we would allow them to use their local dollars, the District of Columbia already has put together a plan, a very comprehensive plan to deal with this issue.     
   That is the plan presented to the committee by Dr. Greg Payne, the Director of the Department of Health. In it, they speak about the dollars they want to spend and the agencies they want to deal with at the local level. They are very serious about the fact that they want this done, and we should be supportive of it. 
   I did not, in my comments, intend, nor do I now, to question the gentleman's commitment to his belief that this is not a good program. I respect that. I disagree with you, but that was never my intent, if that's what you got out of it. 
   But I know that you would not be able to present this kind of an approach anywhere else except when it comes to dealing with the District of Columbia because it is, for all intents and purposes, a territory or a colony. And I take that very seriously because I was born there, an America colony. And I'll be darned if I'm going to be the Governor, now in charge by the Congress of a colony. I don't want to do to D.C. what I feel has been done to my birthplace for 109 years. I fight every day to make that a better situation. 
   And I think what's happened is somewhere along the way we discovered in Congress, and at times it's been done by everybody, we discovered in Congress that there was a playground, there was a place where we could put forth issues that we thought were important issues. And so if you look at the provisions that prohibit local and/or Federal funds from being used in D.C., you see everything from the abortion issue to the gay issue, to the domestic partners issue, to the needle exchange issue; just about every issue that we have ever decided is important in this country, we've used D.C. as the example. And why? Because they can't fight back because they're powerless because they are, indeed, a colony. 
   Well, I don't know how long I'm going to be chairman of this committee, but as long as I'm chairman of this committee, I will work hard on many issues, and one of them is to alleviate the burden of the District of Columbia to have to be treated like a colony of the U.S. Congress. 
   Let us do this locally. Let us all decide that if you really believe in something like this, do it locally. 
   Let me read to you something that Mayor Fenty wrote to us. And I always mention the fact, and I don't want to put my ranking member in a difficult situation, although, you know, he's tough enough to handle it, but he and I are big fans of this Mayor. We're big fans of the vision he presents. We're big fans of giving the District every opportunity to succeed. He says it more than I do. In every opening statement, at every committee hearing, he brings up D.C. as something, a group of people he wants to help. 
   The Mayor says, statistics in 2005 show that D.C. has the highest rate of AIDS cases in the country, a rate that is over six times the national average. An estimated 1 in 20 D.C. residents is infected with HIV. Nearly 1 in 50 has full-blown AIDS. 
   My God, if this is true, and it is, then why wouldn't we let them at least use their local funds to deal with this issue? 
   You know, I don't know 50 years from now how we're going to be judged, but I think that an issue that may not get the importance it gets now, like this one, will be one of the ones that will judge all of us as to what we did when we had an opportunity to do something.

   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm pleased to present, Mr. Chairman, and my colleagues, the first Financial Services and general government appropriations bill to the House. This is my first time as chairman, and it has been an honor and a privilege. 
   The subcommittee held multiple hearings this spring to explore the issues facing agencies funded through this bill. As the hearings progressed, a common theme emerged in my mind for improving these agencies. It became clear that the subcommittee needed to work to bring government closer to the people, to better fit its services to their needs. 
   The American people expect and deserve the best services their governments can offer. For example, with respect to the Internal Revenue Service, we, as a subcommittee, addressed the fact that the IRS needs to be fair and evenhanded in whom it audits. We also ensure that the IRS works to provide real assistance to the taxpayer who cannot afford the services of an expensive accountant. 
   We want the Election Assistance Commission to help promote the use of voting machines in student and school elections as an educational tool. Because these are our future voters, we must do this. We felt that government must do more to protect our consumers, and so we have directed the Federal Trade Commission to examine identity theft with an eye toward ending this hurtful crime. 
   We directed the Consumer Product Safety Commission to strengthen its consumer product monitoring capabilities. We have also increased funding for the community development financial institutions to help expand the availability of credit, capital and financial services to underserved communities throughout the Nation. 
   I feel that through funding initiatives and congressional guidance contained in this bill, government will be more responsive and more proactive on behalf of the American people whom it serves. 
   The total funding recommended by the bill is $21.4 billion. This funding level is tight. While the bill is $1.9 billion above the fiscal year 2007, it is $243 million below the President's budget request. 
   It was a challenge to reduce funding from the requested level for two reasons. First, most of this bill, over 80 percent, funds basic administrative accounts, such as the salaries of the Treasury employees who are managing the Nation's finances. These accounts cannot be reduced without reducing the most basic government services. 
   Second, there were a number of holes in the President's budget that needed to be filled. This bill increases funding for programs where we believe money will be well spent and will benefit, for example, disadvantaged communities or small businesses. These are important priorities that needed to be addressed. 
   To summarize, this bill includes $12.3 billion for the Department of the Treasury. Within this amount, $11.1 billion is for the IRS, a $550 million increase above fiscal year 2007, and $52 million above the President's request. This increase includes more money than requested for taxpayer services and the IRS Taxpayers Advocate Office. 
   The bill also includes $100 million for the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund's program to increase economic development and financial opportunities for folks living in disadvantaged communities. 
   The bill includes $722 million for the Executive Office of the President, of which $460 million is directed to the Office of National Drug Control Policy and its programs. This includes increases for the Drug Free Communities grants program, and the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, which are critical efforts in the war on drugs. 
   This bill, however, rejects the 31 percent increase to the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign requested in the President's budget. Recent studies have called in question the effectiveness of the campaign, and it does not make any sense to give this program the substantial increase requested in light of these questions. The recommendation reduces funding for the campaign by $6 million from last year to $93 million this year. 
   The judicial branch will receive $6.3 billion, which is $278 million above 2007, but $254 million below the request. While this is a reduction to the requested level, we believe that the amount in the bill will be sufficient to fund all necessary operations and staffing levels for the judiciary. 
   Programs related to the District of Columbia will receive $648 million, including $309 million for the District of Columbia court system. Within this figure, the bill assumes an increase in the reimbursement for attorneys who defend indigent clients so that their compensation rate is closer to the rate for defense attorneys practicing before Federal courts.     
   This will help ensure fair and just representation for these defendants. The bill also includes funding for the D.C. public schools, the Tuition Assistance Grant program, the Water and Sewer Authority, construction of a forensic lab, and other critical items requested by the D.C. Government. 
   General provisions for the District of Columbia are fewer in number and have been changed based on our discussions with the D.C. government. 
   My basic principle is that the Federal Government should not dictate to the city how to manage its own affairs or spend its own money. Therefore, you will find that we have removed or changed riders that have been in past bills that closely prescribed to the city what it should or should not do. In some cases, I would actually like to go further than this bill goes. But I consider the changes we made to be first steps toward eliminating some of the restrictions Congress has placed on the District. 
   Let me take this opportunity, as an aside, to mention that my ranking member, Mr. Regula, has been excellent also on this issue. He, like I, believe that since the District of Columbia has a new mayor and an exciting  new leadership, we want to do everything we can to allow them to grow within their own boundaries, make their own decisions and develop their own vision. 
   The bill includes funding for numerous important independent agencies. Some, such as the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management, support all government agencies in their day-to-day operations. Other agencies are smaller but equally vital. For example, the Election Assistance Commission deals with issues that are extraordinarily important to the Nation and its ability to have reliable, secure and accessible elections. This bill includes, Mr. Chairman, $300 million for payments to States to help them meet the requirements of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. 
   The bill also includes money for essential regulatory agencies, namely the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. We have provided a total of $78 million in increases over 2007 for these agencies. We are recommending funding to ensure that they have the ability to oversee, investigate, and take necessary actions relating to their respective missions. For example, the Federal Trade Commission would receive $36 million above this year's level and $7 million above the request to enhance consumer protection activities, including investigations of subprime lending and identity theft and to keep the marketplace free from anticompetitive business practices. 
   Another important agency in this bill is the Small Business Administration. The bill includes $582 million for the SBA, including $100 million for Small Business Development Centers, which is $12 million above the current year. The bill also funds a 7(a) loan guarantee program by providing an $80 million subsidy to make loans more affordable for small businesses. 
   We also include $17 million for a Microloan program, including $2.5 million for the subsidy cost of these loans, as well as funding for SBA programs that target businesses in disadvantaged or low-income communities. These include the HUBZone program, the PRIME program and the 7(j) program, which provides assistance relating to accounting practices or bidding on Federal contracts. 
   This bill also has numerous general provisions that apply to funds in the Act or governmentwide. The mark includes some changes in these provisions from previous bills. It includes, for example, some changes to the provision on public-private competitions, known to some as A-76, or outsourcing, that will strengthen protections for Federal employees. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill will not make everyone happy. It is not even doing all that I want it to do. We have had to make compromises in order to ensure that this bill will make it through the process and to the President's desk. However, the bill is a good step towards making some important changes to funding and policies. I encourage everyone to recognize that this bill is part of a process that will take time to complete. We will not be able to do everything in our first year. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like at this time to thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Regula, for his work and collaboration. We may not always agree on everything in this bill, but we worked together where we could to develop the best possible bill. I truly appreciate his leadership and support. 
   I also want to express my appreciation and thanks for the dedication and hard work of our subcommittee staff, both the majority and minority, especially today when they will be here past 1, 2 o'clock in the morning. 
   Dale Oak, Bob Bonner, Karyn Kendall, Frank Carillo, Deb Bilek, and Jim Curry with the majority staff; John Martens and Alice Hogans with the minority staff; and Rick Limardo with Congressman Regula's personal staff have devoted countless hours. That is why this bill is before you today. I would like to recognize their many contributions. I would like also like to acknowledge and thank my personal staff under the leadership of Nadine Berg. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SERRANO. (PERMISSION TO RESOLVE INTO SECRET SESSION -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. The least important thing I can think of, the least important, is that the American public doesn't think too well of Congress right now, and going into a secret session is not going to help that. But that is the least important thing. 
   It almost sounds like we need a secret session prior to the secret session to tell the membership what we are allowed to do and say after the secret session. Some of us who oppose many of the things that have happened since September 11 have already drawn conclusions as to what we think is happening or not happening. I am not privy to all the intelligence and I don't think anyone is, and there are some folks in our government and some agencies historically that I don't trust. So I will never really know what the truth is. But I have a sense of what the truth may be and what the danger is of what we are doing in this country at this point. 
   So my concern is, at what point does what I feel and know become part of what is discussed at this session, and therefore if I keep discussing it in public I have now violated the secret session that I wasn't supposed to violate? I heard before that some things will be discussed at the secret session that are not classified. So if I discuss them later, am I in violation of House rules? 
   In other words, what I am suggesting, Mr. Leader, is that to tell the membership that we are having a secret session and have someone like me who has been here 18 years say what is that, without preparation for this extreme type of behavior, is to put the membership at risk. At risk. 
   We don't want to walk into this blindly, and I am walking into it blindly if I decide to attend. I don't know what I am allowed to say and do, and I say a lot of things about our behavior. 
   So I would hope if we are going to do this, we actually, and this is not a very popular notion, take some extra time in private to tell us. I know what happens when a general comes to me and tells me something that is going on in Iraq. I know I can't say that, because it was a classified meeting. I know that. But this is going to be debate. How is that debate going to be different from some things we say tomorrow in open debate? And if I forget, and I am not trying to be funny here, and mention some of that debate in this debate, what violation am I in? 
   My last point: With all due respect, if the gentleman has secret information  that speaks to the safety of my beloved country, our country, why didn't the gentleman take that information to the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, where it belongs? Why bring it to the whole House and put us all in that situation, when indeed we have an Intelligence Committee, we have a ranking member, we have a full committee? 
   I as a Member would be totally comfortable with the gentleman bringing that information. I assure you that if I ever learn anything that I believe can hurt our country, I will bring it to the Intelligence Committee right away. I will not call for a secret session that puts us at risk, that makes the American people think that we don't want to discuss in public some things, and that may in fact strike fear into Members to vote for a bill that we probably should not vote for. 
   Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SERRANO. (TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN LATIN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an issue that troubles me quite a bit and I think should trouble a lot of the American people. Certainly it should concern Members of Congress. 
   A resolution was passed this afternoon by voice vote dealing with the alleged involvement and behavior of the President of Iran, therefore, the Government of Iran, in Latin America and supporting, according to this resolution, terrorist activities in Latin America. 
   Let me briefly read the opening statement of this resolution, the title, if you will: expressing concern relating to the threatening behavior of the Iranian regime and the activities of terrorist organizations sponsored by that regime in Latin America. 
   Well, just to deal with language itself, we know that when our government calls another government a regime, it is not saying anything positive about it. It is, in fact, confronting it in some way. But I think that as unnoticed as this went by, as I said it was passed on a voice vote, as unnoticed that this went by, this puts us in a situation, the Congress, the American people, our Nation, on a road, on a path to a very dangerous situation in the future, perhaps in the near future. 
   We all know how concerned the administration is and how concerned some Members of Congress are about the possibility that Iran could be involved in activities that would be hurtful to us. I want to correct that. I think all Members of Congress are concerned about that possibility. 
   But I think we are also concerned about the fact, many of us, that there seems to be a drumbeat towards war with Iran, a drumbeat that says, basically, some of the same things that were said when we were taken off to war against Iraq. Just about everything that was told to us at that time happened not to be true. History will tell whether, in fact, we were lied to, or whether the information was so bad that the administration had no choice but to pass that on to us thinking that it was correct. 
   But there are many who feel that we were lied to. Again, history will have to deal with that. 
   My concern is that this resolution today moves away from just a concern about the behavior of the Government in Iran and begins to suggest that there are neighbors of ours, and, yes, I say neighbors, because that's what the Latin American people are, neighbors of ours, that could be involved in this behavior, behavior which would be dangerous to the United States, behavior which we all should be concerned about, behavior that, perhaps, would lead us to get involved in Latin America in a way that we haven't been involved for a long, long time. 
   But I think in order to understand where we are with this issue, we also have to have, I think, an understanding of how history repeats itself, how some things that we are hearing now we have heard before. For close to 50 years now, we have had a very strong lobbying effort in this country against a Cuban Government. The so-called anti-Castro lobby has been very strong, and that lobby has been very influential in getting many Members of Congress and Presidents, present and past, to feel that the only path towards changes in Cuba is to continuously attack and confront the Cuban Government. To the dismay of many people, I am sure, and with all due respect to many people, it is no secret that for the most part that lobby, this effort, has come out of anti-Castro groups who, for the most part, live in the State of Florida. 
   Well, something very interesting has happened in the last few years. As Latin America has elected leftist-leaning leaders, people who propose to put forth a modern-day socialism, as they call it, 21st-century socialism, but people who have been elected and reelected as they have emerged, they have decided that it would not be improper for them as leaders of those countries to have a relationship with the Cuban Government. 
   Well, that upsets the same people who have been upset with the Cuban Government. The fact that some new governments in Latin America would now be friendly to the Government in Cuba would upset these folks. 
   Our policy towards Cuba has been heavily influenced by this anti-Castro movement. I can't tell you how many times in the 17 years that I have been in Congress and have tried to change that policy. I have been told by Members of Congress on both sides, Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, I have been told by them, I agree with you, you are right with this policy having to change. 
   But I think we have to continue it, and most of them will tell you, because the lobbying effort, out of a couple of communities in this country is so strong, that I really don't want to face that. Right on the House floor they have told me, I don't want to face that, I will just go along with this policy, as outdated as this may be, as inefficient as that may be, because it hasn't changed anything in Cuba, not that we should necessarily be changing things in another country. But now we find that those same folks have now picked new targets. 
   Chief among those targets, top of the list, is the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, who has over and over again shown his friendship to President Castro of Cuba, and that irritates the folks who support ending Mr. Castro's stay in Cuba. Those folks then have started to say the same things that they have said for years about Mr. Castro. 
   Now, the fact of life is that the Cuban Government, the system in Cuba, and the system in Venezuela, for instance, are totally different, totally different. But not to those folks who simply would want to get rid of one. They now feel that they have a target which is the President of Venezuela. 
   That target then, I think, leads us to situations like today, where a resolution presented here speaks of putting together all these groups who have one thing in common. They speak out against our government, they say things we don't like, and who happen to have been visited or received telephone calls or offers of help from Iran. 
   Now, Communist China, and I use that title, that phrase, that word, so we understand what we are talking about, are involved in the economy of every country in Latin America; but you don't see a resolution on the House floor condemning Communist China for being involved in Latin America.     
   Why? Because they're a big trading partner of ours. And secondly, let's be  honest, because there is no Chinese American lobby in this country influencing how we behave in Congress. And so we could deal with China every day and they could do whatever they want in their country, and we will never say more than maybe say every so often, behave yourself. 
   And there are countries in the Middle East who treat their folks in ways that you could spend every day in Congress condemning them, but we won't do that because we have a relationship with them. 
   But nothing, and I say this with great admiration, nothing is as strong as the anti-Castro lobby, which has made it clear that the leadership in Latin America that is friendly to Mr. Castro must pay a price, and one of the prices you pay is to lump them together as this hate group that is now going to be involved in terrorist activities in Latin America. 
   We have democratically elected leaders in Latin America that have these friendly relations with the Cuban Government. That doesn't matter to us that these folks were elected and re-elected. As long as they are friendly to Cuba, Miami hates them. And as long as Miami hates them, then Congress must hate them too. 
   So when you hear comments about Chavez, when you hear comments about Evo Morales, the President of Bolivia, when you hear comments about President Correa in Ecuador, understand, when you hear these comments, or about any one of the other left-leaning presidents in Latin America, that you're basically hearing from the same playbook, the comments that you heard about Cuba for all these years. 
   But please understand something, that you are not hearing direct attacks on those governments; you're still hearing an attack on the Cuban Government. It is just being played out in this new scenario called the other countries in Latin America. 
   Now, it is true that we have, or they have elected leaders in Latin America that are not happy with the U.S. Government and that words have been strong at times towards us. But some of this rhetoric has a history behind it. 
   While our country paid a great deal of attention to Asia, Europe and the Middle East, we neglected Latin America. That is a fact. That is not Congressman Serrano from the Bronx, New York, just making those comments to sound nice at this time of night. That's a fact. We neglected Latin America, and they suffered, and still do, through some very difficult periods. 
   And during the Cold War, it was really interesting. We would go to Latin America and we would say, General So-and-So, Senor, do you support communism in the Soviet Union or do you support our style of government? And those generals would say, oh, no; we support your style. We would say, great, you're our friend. We'll see you in a couple of years. And meanwhile, they mistreated their folks; they ransacked the country. But it didn't matter to us because they were not for communism. They were not to the left of the political spectrum. They were not for socialism. 
   During that time, however, we would say something very positive. Every so often we would kind of knock them on the shoulder and say democracy is the most important thing. Nothing is as important as democracy. 
   Well, you know something? They've tried it all in Latin America. They tried military dictatorships. The people didn't try it. They were the victims of it, and it didn't work. Then they tried regular dictatorships, if there's such a thing different from a military dictatorship. But it didn't work either. The people suffered, but the ones who tried it didn't work. Then they tried something new for Latin America in many cases, new to some countries, new to many countries. They tried democracy. They elected folks. But they elected folks who were very much tied to international corporate interests, who got elected, many in questionable elections, and then neglected the people, neglected the people. And the people found out that they had elected people, they had done everything they were asked to do, and they were getting poorer and poorer every day. So what have they done in the last couple of years? They've elected left-of-center candidates in Chile, in Argentina, in Ecuador, in Bolivia, in Venezuela. And these folks have been, and are, revolutionaries. They, themselves, claim to be revolutionaries, and that, again, we hear that word, that upsets us. We forget that this great system we have here was created through a revolution against the British. But we were the last ones to use that word in a way that we liked it. Now anybody who calls himself a revolutionary we get upset about. But these people are revolutionaries. They're trying something new in Latin America. Embarrassing as it may seem, it is new to many countries in Latin America, this whole notion that the person at the bottom, the person who's been suffering for years, the indigenous people, the darker skinned people, that they would now have an opportunity to have something better. 
   Now, and this is important what I just mentioned about the fact that in Latin America, the darker skinned folks are beginning to feel that they have a stake in their system. 
   When Secretary of State Colin Powell, one of the greatest Americans, left the administration at the last, the end of the last term, he came before our Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and I was the ranking member at that time. And he said to us something very important when he was talking about Latin America. He said, the big change in Latin America, and what we Americans need to understand, now he didn't say it was good. He didn't say it was bad. He didn't say it was a problem for us. He just said it was something that was happening in Latin America, that we as Americans have to pay attention to. He said, those folks are beginning to elect people who look like themselves. Now, that's a heck of a statement by a very intelligent man who has a good understanding of the world. I don't know if that upsets some of us, but I think it does upset some folks in this country and throughout the hemisphere, that countries that are composed primarily mostly of indigenous people and people of color have now decided to elect people who look like themself, people who come from them. And when they decide to make changes that are very dramatic and, yes, very revolutionary, we get upset because it doesn't serve the corporate interests of a lot of American corporations. 
   So Hugo Chavez in Venezuela decides that he's going to revolutionize the way Venezuela behaves. He came to the Bronx. He visited the Bronx. He spoke to us and he said something very interesting. He told us who he was. And you never hear about this in this country. He told us he was a kid, very poor, who didn't have shoes until he was a teenager, walked barefoot, who wanted only one dream in life, to become a major league baseball pitcher. And he was pretty good. But from where he lived, to be seen by major league scouts, he had to go to Caracas. And he was told that the only way to get to Caracas was to join the Army. So he joined the Army. He jokes that it was the worst mistake his country ever made, letting him join the Army, because when he began to travel with the Army he noticed something very interesting of Venezuela. He noticed that people who looked like him were very poor, and other folks who didn't look like him were living in a country with a lot of oil and a lot of 
   money. He also noticed that not all neighborhoods were like his. He thought all of Venezuela was like his neighborhood, and it wasn't. It had serious pockets of serious money. So he began to grow a conscience about that; became a military leader, eventually led him into politics. He got elected. And when he got elected he immediately set out to change the way Venezuela behaves. And the opposition to him knows that. That's why they all admit that he's so popular within his country, by the folks who are at the bottom. 
   But, you know, I get to watch Spanish television from Latin America on my cable system in the Bronx, and you know, as tough as we are in American politics, some of the stuff you hear about President Chavez from the owners of these stations who open up their morning programming by reminding people that their President has curly hair and is dark skinned, as if that was a sin, but it's such a revolutionary thing that has happened in Latin America that some people still can't get over it. So he's an idiot. He's crazy. He's corrupt.  
   But even the opposition, at times, in attempting to say something against him, really says dumb things. I wish I had the name of the person, although I wouldn't use it on the House floor, but during the last elections in Venezuela when the polls indicated that President Chavez was at 62 percent of the vote, one of the New York Times reporters, I think it was, asked this leader of the opposition, Why do you think he's so popular? And the gentleman said, and this has to be the dumbest statement ever made by a politician in the history of the world, the gentleman said, You would be popular too if you were always building schools and hospitals for the poor. Well, to that I say, what American teenagers taught us to say, duh. I mean, isn't that the reason why you elect people to take care of those in the society who need help amongst others? Because you don't play class warfare. So they're saying that because he's building hospitals and because he's building schools, he's very popular. Well, yeah, Mr. Opposition. Why didn't you try that when you were in power for the last couple of hundred years to do some of that? 
   Now, these leaders in Latin America that we attack, it's important to know how they got to that point of being the leaders of these countries. For instance, in this resolution, it says, whereas in January of 2007, the President of Iran made his second visit to Central and South America in 5 months to meet with Hugo Chavez, President of Venezuela, to visit Daniel Ortega, President of Nicaragua, and to attend the inauguration of Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador. 
   Well, if we're going to be technical about this, the fact is he went there for the President's inauguration, something we all did. I mean, every country in the world sent a representative. I imagine our Ambassador was there. If he wasn't, he should have been there because this was an elected President of Ecuador. 
   When you make those visits, as our President does, and I commend him for it, you go and you take the time that you're in that country and you visit neighboring countries if you don't get a chance to meet with everybody. That's something you do. 
   But we attack these people in this resolution that we passed today, this, in my opinion, dangerous resolution, and that's why we're here today. We're here today because Congress passed a resolution today condemning Iran's involvement in Latin America and suggesting that these progressive leftist semi, if you want to call them, socialists in Latin America have a bond going with the President of Iran to create havoc for us and to fund terrorist organizations. 
   But there's something we forget. Let's look at Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. He was elected in a free and fair election, recognized by world organizations. As part of the Central American peace plan, Ortega's Sandinista government agreed to internationally monitored democratic elections in 1990. 
   Now, this guy we don't like submitted himself to elections in 1990 and he lost, and peacefully, after having won a revolution, peacefully turned his government over to Violetta Chamorro, who was the victor, with our support, heavily with our support, because all the arguments in those days about how much money we sent into her campaign.     
   Now, can you imagine if somebody from another country sent money to one of our Presidential campaigns, another government, what we would do with that candidate in this country? But we do that. 
   Ortega ran for President in 1996 and lost, ran for democratically provided elections in 2001 and lost. Because he came in second place both times, however, Nicaraguan law gave him a seat in the national assembly where he has served as an opposition leader. Then he ran for President again in 2006 and won. Now, shouldn't that alone make us want to go to Nicaragua or call him up and say, We asked you, we asked everybody in Latin America, to get elected. You ran four times and finally you got elected. Let's at least talk. No? We are on his case. In fact, we are linking him to terrorist organizations in this resolution. 
   Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador, elected in free and fair elections January 15 of this year. He is a U.S.-trained economist. What does that mean? That he learned what he knows about what he wants to put in practice in Ecuador in American schools. So shouldn't we be applauding that? Shouldn't we be applauding the fact that he got elected democratically? He is Ecuador's eighth President in 10 years. The instability has been horrible. Maybe there could be stability now. We should be supportive of that. He defeated Alvaro Noboa, a wealthy banana magnate, in a run-off election held in 2006. Contrary to our predictions, he got 57 percent of the vote. 
   Now, the one that we attack the most, of course, is President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. Well, let's review this for a second. President Chavez has won elections in 1998, in 2000, and in 2006. In other words, he got elected in 1998. He then went out and had his coalition elect delegates to a constitutional convention. Those delegates wrote a new constitution that, and listen to this revolutionary idea, gave power to the poor and to the indigenous people. They changed the constitution to do that, and they put it before the people. The constitution was passed by the people. So I'd say that that is another referendum on Chavez. Then the new constitution said that he had to cut his 6-year term short and run right away. So he ran in 1998; then he had to run again in 2000. 
   Then in 2006 in between the opposition again with support from outside forces, a lot of them based right in the State of Florida, they held a referendum. He submitted himself to that referendum to be recalled as the President. He wins in 1998. He doesn't finish his full term. He goes again in 2000. But by 2004 they were ready to kick him out, the opposition. They hold a referendum. And he wins it big. The recall, he wins it big. In 1999, as I said, he won a referendum for a new constitution. And in 2005 his coalition of parties won election for the Parliament, for the Congress. 
   Now, here's the question I have: Didn't we tell Latin American countries to use the democratic process? Isn't that what we always said was the bottom line? Everything else could be negotiable, we said at times. But democracy was the bottom line. Even when we didn't practice it, as I said before, we did say this is what you must do. Now I just read you three examples of people who have used the democratic system to reach their positions. So why are we attacking them continuously on the House floor? Once a month we get a resolution here attacking somebody in Latin America instead of getting close. 
   Now, what we don't understand is that this whole situation with Latin America's electing people who are left of center is because the people are tired of the poverty, tired of the pain, and they now have leaders who at least in what they have attempted to do up to now indicates that they want to balance off the wealth of those countries. Balance off. 
   We don't celebrate the fact that Hugo Chavez comes from poverty, reaches the presidency, and has been elected three times himself and his government another five times totaling eight elections since 1998. We don't celebrate the fact that in over close to 500 years, the people of Bolivia, a country mostly made up of indigenous people, what we call Indians, elected for the first time an Indian, Evo Morales. We don't celebrate that. 
   I felt so good when I saw this man take the oath of the presidency dressed in the native dress of his people. I thought it was a great day. Our comments right away were, what is he going to do with the gas industry? Well, he did what we expected. He told some of the gas companies this is a very poor country. We have a lot of natural resources here. We are going to start sharing some of those profits with the people. Oh, he's a communist. We have got to get rid of him. He's a problem. So now in this resolution we lump him together with the President of Iran. When you do that, you immediately make enemies of the American people and those people. 
   But you also make a very serious mistake, and this is perhaps the most important thing that we have to pay attention to. When you reject the electoral victories of these folks; when you don't celebrate the fact that people from the lower class, economic class,  that people of darker skin of indigenous people are being elected; when you as the American Government, the greatest and largest government in the world, don't celebrate that and, in fact, spend a lot of time trying to bring them down; when you don't do that, it is natural that you drive them to places where you don't want them to be. 
   Now, when you are a Member of Congress and you stand up in front of the House and people may watch you on TV, you are supposed to speak as exactly that. My problem, or my strength, is that I so often remind people that I grew up in a public housing project. And in the projects you have certain rules of behavior. And one is that if somebody is trying to do you in and that person is stronger and bigger than you, you go find someone who can help you confront that person. That's a fact of life for survival. Most Members of Congress, most American elected officials don't talk about the rule of the projects because they didn't grow in the projects. I am not saying that makes them worse than me, just different. 
   So I use that as a point of understanding. Again, I grew up in the South Bronx in a public housing project. If you came after me, if you came after my mother, my sister, my cousin, you were my enemy. 
   Well, when President Chavez came to the U.N., our country was outraged. And I was not happy with what he said. He called President Bush the devil, and that was enough for us to go to war. But let's talk about a little history now. There was a coup attempt on President Chavez by members of the military and members of the elite. All of Latin America, most of Europe, some folks in the Middle East all got up and said you can't do that. You can't do that. That man was elected. He's got to serve his term. What did the United States say? Well, at the White House some folks said publicly he brought it on himself. No, you can't say that, he brought it on himself. You don't bring on a coup against your government. 
   In Latin America they said that our fingerprints were all over that attempted coup; that if we actually did not participate in it, we gave aid to it through our comments and said it was okay. Now, when I met President Chavez when he came to visit the Bronx, he spoke to us for a couple of hours. He's famous for speaking a couple of hours. He told us about all the things I have mentioned here. But he said when they took him out of the presidential palace, the ``White House,'' if you will, took him up to the mountains, he knew he was going to die. He knew he was going to get killed. And you can imagine what is going through his head because he doesn't know what is happening in Washington. He found out later that what was happening to him and when he thought he was going to get killed, he thought the whole world was outraged. 
   He found out later that Washington was basically saying we'll figure it out. And we didn't say anything when the guy who took over for him momentarily suspended the Congress, suspended the constitution, and that's when the people reacted to it. Of course, Chavez came back because two things happened. One was the folks from the mountain side, the poor folks, the dark-skin folks, the indigenous people found out and they started running to the city and demanding to have their President back. The people won, the power didn't. But we didn't say anything. 
   And he tells us that when he goes there, a young soldier, he's sitting in a room and opens the door and he hears the rifle load up and he thinks he's going to get shot right there, and the soldier says, If our President is killed, we will all be killed here. And that did a turnaround where the young soldiers told the older soldiers, We're not going back to those days. This man was elected and he has to serve his term. 
   Now, let's go back a second to my focal point of growing up in the projects. They tried to kill the man and he came back into power. He thinks a few people were involved in it. He calls our President the devil as a representative of the country that didn't help him during that time. We don't appreciate having our President called the devil. We don't encourage that and we all denounced it. But in the projects if you try to bump me off, the least I am going to call you is the devil. In fact, the ramifications may be even more dangerous. So I think it was really a light comment compared to what he felt was happening to him. 
   Now, there is another issue here that has been discussed a lot. We all heard about how recently President Chavez closed a TV station in Venezuela, and we were outraged. Nobody likes to do that. But what we were not told here is the history behind that. I'm not suggesting it was a good move. If I had been his adviser, I would have said leave it alone. But do you know who was on in the middle of the attempted coup against President Chavez in the Venezuela equivalent of the White House? The owner of the TV station that lost its license a few months ago. He was there as part of the coup to overthrow this government. 
   Now, listen to me. I don't support most of the policies of President Bush. But if I heard that CBS, ABC, CNN, anyone tomorrow was involved in a coup against President Bush, I would ask that their license not be renewed because that is not freedom of speech. That is violence against the government.     
   And you can't treat them any differently than you would treat someone. I would say we have to seriously consider not allowing them to continue in that role because they just attempted to overthrow a government by force. 
   Also, they refused to televise the coup. And when they did televise, they only televised the opposition; they never televised the people. The country never knew that Chavez was gone because they didn't want the people to know. And when he came back, they didn't know that either, although they had televised part in the middle of the coup because they were supposedly playing cartoons and movies on TV because they didn't want to support the government in any way. That is the truth behind that licensing situation. 
   Now, what is the danger in what we've done today? Today, we committed the mistake of allowing our emotions on the issue of Cuba to blind us into attacks on Latin American countries, blanket attacks on many countries. And in this resolution we make claims on issues that in no way can be proven. 
   We're suggesting that Iran is going to fund terrorist organizations in Latin America. These are some of the same folks that told us there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. How many of us have forgotten those words, ``weapons of mass destruction''? They also told us that Iraq was tied to al Qaeda. They also told us that Iraq helped al Qaeda in the 9/11 attacks. Even the White House has now admitted that most of that, if not all, was not true. So, I can't understand this desire to lump this together with Iran, present bad information, if not outright lies, and begin to move us towards a confrontation with Latin America at the same time we have confrontation with Iran. 
   But look at some of the silly things that the resolution says. It says, Whereas, at the Iranian Conference on Latin America, Iran announced that it would reopen embassies in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay, and send a representative to Bolivia. And what is wrong with that? Don't we want people to talk to each other? Don't we have relations with most of the countries of the world? But when Iran does it, just to reopen relations they had before, re-establish, we get upset. Well, that's an acceptable action for a sovereign state. 
   Now, I spoke about the various leaders, and I neglected to remind us that the President of Bolivia was elected on December 18, 2005, with a record 85 percent of the Bolivian people voting in the elections. They were deemed by world organizations to be free and fair. He won a convincing victory, getting 54 percent of the vote, compared to 29 percent for his opposition. Although a lot of people were predicting that he would win, no one thought that he could win this big. 
   Now, here's another part of the resolution. And I leave it to the people watching or listening to this to try to figure out what this means, because I don't know what the crime is here. It says, Whereas, routine civilian airline flights have been established from Tehran, Iran directly into Caracas,  Venezuela, and the Government of Venezuela has been found to be indiscriminate in the issuance of Venezuelan passports and other identifying documents to people coming on those flights. So, they're allowing people to fly directly to them, and they are allowing Iran to fly direct flights. Well, we have direct flights all over the world. What is the issue? 
   Now, here is the most dangerous one: Whereas, Iran and Hezbollah were involved in the two deadliest terrorist attacks in Argentina, and we all know that this is true, now they claim that Hezbollah is setting up in Latin America with the support of Iran. Well, my God, if that is true, why are we waiting until this particular resolution, which passed in what one could call the quickness of the afternoon without a vote, to bring up such a serious situation? If it's true that Hezbollah is involved in Latin America setting up bases, recruiting people, shouldn't we be outraged and really consider how to address that rather than just as a throw-away line in a resolution? This is so much more of this attempt to link Iran to Latin America. 
   And let me reach the last few minutes here by telling you why I think this is extremely dangerous. 
   It is pretty clear around here that we are beating the drum towards war with Iran. That's no longer an alarmed behavior. I'm not trying to alarm people into feeling nervous, but I think most American people are hearing a lot of what they heard before we went to Iraq. And you know that Iraq has been a very, very difficult situation for us, and we don't know when we will be able to get out of Iraq. And now there is this drumbeat, both inside and outside the Congress, throughout the country, but coming from the government, from the White House, coming out of the President's office, coming out of the Vice President's office, that we have to somehow confront Iran. That's a problem all by itself. And it's a horrible problem that we could be discussing here for hours. 
   But my concern, and my reason for speaking on a resolution today, a resolution which was introduced primarily by Democrats, and I know this is not something we usually do, speak against members of our own party, but we can all be nervous about a situation because on both sides of the aisle people are marching forward to war with Iran. 
   So, now we link these other countries. What does that mean? Does that mean that we now have an excuse to go and try military action against Bolivia? against Argentina? against Ecuador? against Venezuela? Is it because, indeed, they've earned the right, if you will, of having us react that way, or is it because we're using Iran as an excuse to deal with other things we wanted to deal with in the first place, which is getting at these folks. 
   And so, I go back to my initial statement, that the same lobby group that has been directing our policy towards Cuba and preventing us from making changes in that policy, that same group has been intelligent enough, enabled enough to now direct our attention towards Latin American leftist leaders because they're friendly to Cuba, and what best way to get at them? To link them to Iran, the ugly country for us right now. 
   And I'm not suggesting, by the way, that we should not have some concerns, if not serious concerns, about the behavior of Iran. That's not the issue here. I don't want people tomorrow saying, oh, he was defending Iran. No. I'm defending no one. What I'm defending is the right of the Latin American people to make their own democratic choices, if you will, and that we will respect that. But by linking them, I have to ask the question, if we go after Iran, and we just finished saying this afternoon that these Latin American countries are tied into Iran's behavior, aren't we also giving ourselves the opportunity, the reason, the power to go after these countries, too? That's my concern. 
   Let me conclude by speaking to a subject that I know well. You don't have to live in Latin America to know how Latin Americans feel about the United States or about American people. This may sound like a joke, it may even sound sarcastic, but it is honestly true. All you have to live is in southern Maryland, in northern Virginia, in D.C., in New York, in LA, in Houston, in Dallas, in any city, any suburb in this country that has the growing number of immigrants from Latin America, whether 
   documented or not, they're here for a reason. And if we were discussing immigration, I would tell you that they're here because they like this country. They want to work. They want to feed their families. But that is no different than how people in Latin America feel about us. To link them with a group of folks in the Middle East who have openly said, not all of them, but some, who have openly said that they don't like us, to link them to that is to make two horrible mistakes. One is to have bad information again put forth about a people who actually like us, and also, the worst mistake of all, to drive them into the arms of people we don't like. Because as I told you before, when you pick on someone and you're the toughest guy on the block, that person is going to have to find someone to help them out. 
   So, instead of reaching out to Latin America, we say to them, you're as bad as the other guy. And we hate the other guy, and we're going to eventually take action against the other guy, so you know what you can expect. And even if that's not our intent, it will only make them think that that is our intent, and they will have to try to drum up new relationships. Because they're not going to give into us, they're not going to leave office and say we'll go back to the days when the general ran the country. 
   Latin Americans, my friends, can be found in any city, any suburb, any neighborhood. And so many of them have such a close relationship to the people back home that they want to do nothing in this country to jeopardize the ability to continue to deal with their family back home. And their family back home will never allow any behavior in those countries that can hurt us. They need us and we need them. 
   And so, when you speak to Latin Americans in our communities, you never hear hatred of the United States as you do in some other countries. They are materially poor, yes, suspicious of America's intentions in their hemisphere, yes, but interested in making common cause with Hezbollah and other foreign movements to target American interests? Never. Let me repeat that. They would never team up with a terrorist organization against the United States. They don't have anything against us of that nature. They just don't like our rhetoric and our indifference to them, but they're not going to team up with anybody to hurt us, because most of those countries have so many of their people living here that it would be like attacking another part of your neighborhood. Because to hurt the American interests would almost certainly hurt their own. Money that flows from here to there would be cut off from relatives. Those family ties of people living and working in the United States would be gone. 
   A broad cultural admiration for the U.S. have knit together places like Caracas, Quito, and New York. One of the ironies of the current immigration debate is how folks often evoke how immigration from Latin America is changing this country. What they forget is how that same phenomenon is changing Latin America, which, despite its general political rejection of this administration, is growing ever closer in its embrace of a Pan-American culture and a Pan-American economy.     
   For many thousands of people in Venezuela, Ecuador and Nicaragua, Americans are their cousins, their siblings and their children. They can be our greatest allies in the world if we don't continue to push them into the embrace of hostile regimes with foolish resolutions like this one. 
   Mr. Speaker, it wasn't easy for me to decide to speak on this today. As I said, this resolution was presented by many Democrats, well-intentioned folks. I just see us going down a dangerous road here, a very dangerous road. If we have a problem with Iran, deal with that problem. Don't link the poor people of Latin America who have nothing against us. 
   We have tried to export democracy to Latin America, and I think finally it is working. But we don't like the results. We have tried to export capitalism, and in many ways what they do with each other by trading oil for doctors and oil for technology is capitalism at its best. I often joke, but profoundly so, I think,  that we exported baseball to Latin America. I don't have to tell you how well that is doing in Latin America and doing right here. I am a Yankee fan. But just ask the Boston Red Sox how they feel about Latin American ballplayers and Latin American baseball. 
   So these folks don't dislike us. But they are going to be troubled tomorrow morning when they find out what we did here in Congress today. They are going to be troubled that we are linking them with people we hate and they don't want to be hated by us. 
   So I hope we can spend some time reviewing this, thinking about it, and perhaps understanding that in our desire to do what is right for us and to protect our great country, this country I love, this country in whose Army I served proudly, this country whose Congress I serve proudly, this country that I would give my life for, that as you love your country, you don't love it different from a child. When that child is not doing the right thing, you have to correct that child. And our country is wrong right now in its desire to treat Latin America with hate and disdain and to make of it something that it is not. They are our neighbors and our friends. We should treat them as such. We should extend our hand to them and tell them, you are our neighbor, you are our friends, you are, in fact, members of this family in more ways than one, and we are members of yours. Let's work together. Let's not show a lack of respect for each other.
