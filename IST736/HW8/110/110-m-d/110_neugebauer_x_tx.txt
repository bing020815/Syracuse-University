<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I have some reservations about the effectiveness of this economic stimulus package and its impact on our Federal deficit; however, I am going to support it. One of the reasons I am going to support this package is it takes an important step toward providing more options for homeowners and homebuyers in America. By temporarily increasing the size of mortgages for our GSEs and FHAs, they will be able to purchase mortgages in high-cost areas across the country where some of those people  have been locked out of those particular markets. 
   By bringing additional buyers into this marketplace and rather than leaving them on the sidelines, we are going to help reduce housing inventories that, as you know, have been increasing all across the country. Increasing these conforming loan limits for these particular entities adds additional liquidity to a marketplace that is in dire need of additional liquidity and will help provide additional mortgages around the country. 
   However, their taking this action is not nearly enough. Congress has completed important legislation that reforms FHA, and we must complete this legislation. We have passed legislation that brings reform to our GSEs. It's time for Congress to sign that legislation as well. We need to do this without siphoning important resources from these entities at a time where we are going to be relying on them to help provide additional mortgages and liquidity in the marketplace. 
   In order to increase the loan limits to have its full desired effects, we need to also make sure that we increase the portfolio caps of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Congresswoman Bean and I have introduced legislation to increase these caps, and I urge the administration and Congress to act on these immediately. This marketplace is in need of liquidity, and by raising the loan portfolio limits and the caps, it will allow Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and FHA to come into the market and help bring back additional robustness in those markets.  
   In hindsight, we see that borrowers, lenders and investors made poor decisions. In Congress' attempt to help stabilize this downturn we must avoid more poor decisions. 
   Congress must ensure that we cause no further harm as we facilitate bringing more liquidity to the marketplace.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, for nearly 35 years prior to coming to the United States Congress, I was involved in the housing business in one form or the other. I've built housing for sale, I've built housing for rent. And one of the things that you learn very quickly and housing and how to make sure that the American people have safe, affordable housing, whether it's to own that housing or to rent that housing is you have jobs and opportunity because when people, the American people have jobs and opportunity, they don't have trouble making their payments or making their rental payments. 
   And so I would think that the 110 million people that are paying their rent or making their house payments today are wondering why this Congress is not down on the floor today debating an energy policy that lowers the cost of gasoline, that lowers the cost of electricity so that American families can have more money, so that they can have more money to pay on their rent or pay on their mortgage payment. 
   But more importantly, they will wonder why we're not down on this floor talking about how we have a tax code in this country that promotes jobs and opportunity that allows small businesses to thrive and to create jobs. Small businesses are our number-one job creators. You know what? When people have jobs, they're able to make their mortgage payments. When people have jobs, they're able to make their rental payments. 
   So it's frustrating to me and others to see we have a process today, as other Members have pointed out, that lock us out of the process. We swore in two new Members of Congress in the last 24 hours. Unfortunately, neither one of those gentlemen will be able to participate in this debate because they've been locked out of thoughtful consideration of this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, we need to be down on this floor doing policy that will impact the American people. Fifty-one million Americans have a mortgage in this country, 94 percent of them are making their mortgage payments. The 110 million people that are scraping and making sure that they are a step up and make their payments, are wondering why we're down on the floor asking them to make the payments for those who can't.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, as we did today, 234 years ago Congress heard its first prayer as they opened their Congress. And I wanted to read that prayer this morning because I think it's a prayer for America and this Congress today: 
   Be Thou present; O God of Wisdom, and direct the councils of this Honorable Assembly. Enable them to settle all things on the best and surest foundations; that the scene of blood may be speedily closed; that Order, Harmony, and Peace may be effectually restored, and Truth, and Justice, Religion, and Piety prevail and flourish among the people. Preserve the health of their bodies and the vigor of their minds. Shower down on them, and the millions they here represent, such temporal blessings as Thou seest expedient for them in this world, and crown them with everlasting Glory in the world to come. All this we ask in the name and through the merits of Jesus Christ Thy son and Our Savior. Amen. 
   Mr. Speaker, may prayer always be a part of this body, and may prayer always be a part of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission. This commission is a perfect example of Ronald Reagan's belief that the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this Earth is a government program. 
   Established more than 40 years ago, this commission has evolved into an inequitable and duplicative Federal program, yet it receives $35 million in next year's budget. 
   Although most of ARC funding is spent building State roads, the agency also spends tax dollars on water programs, housing projects, business development, and health care. 
   However, this funding is only available to 13 States. In other words, this is a bracketed bill. The ARC is a redundant layer of bureaucracy. Several other Federal agencies have similar missions as the ARC. For example, an Appalachian community applying for an economic development grant would be eligible to use 20 other programs across five other agencies and receive funding for the exact same purposes. For every ARC program, it is duplicated by another Federal program. 
   According to the Department of Agriculture's Web site, USDA's Rural Development Agency supports such essential public facilities and services as water and sewer systems, housing,  health clinics and promotes economic development. In other words, under the current Department of Agriculture programs, these communities could apply for these grants instead of having a separate bracketed amount of money. 
   At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, there is a rural housing and economic development program within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
   Departments of Transportation and Commerce, for example, and even the Department of Defense, have programs whose mission is to help rural communities. 
   Therefore, if we were to eliminate the ARC, applicants could still apply for countless other grants from other agencies that are already providing funding for rural communities. 
   I represent a rural community, and so I understand the unique challenges facing rural America today. However, as we work to help communities overcome their challenges, we should do it in such a way that we are not wasting taxpayer dollars. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I was going to point out exactly the point that the gentleman made about the earmarks. There is $300,000 for central Pennsylvania's largest kitchen, $20,000 to renovate an abandoned hospital for a possible visual arts center, $7,000 to place 16 poster-size vignettes in culturally significant areas in Connellsville, Pennsylvania. 
   Mr. Chairman, economic development is important to all America. It is important to rural America; but what is also important to America is fiscal responsibility, keeping taxes lower. 
   If we keep spending money the way we are spending money now, we are going to have to raise taxes. In fact, the Democratic budget passed what is going to be the largest tax increase in American history. The government doesn't have an income problem; the government has a spending problem. When you look at the revenues over the last few years because we lowered taxes and let the American people keep their money and let the American people invest and let small businesses create jobs all across America, what happened? Well, the economy got better. What happened to tax revenues? Tax revenues are increasing at a fairly substantial rate. 
   What we have to do is cut spending so spending is growing at a slower rate than the revenues. That is the only way we are ever going to be able to balance our budget. I urge support of my amendment.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I would just echo what my colleague from South Carolina said. Where is the plan? 
   If the Democrats do not have a plan to lower energy costs for the American people, please bring some of the Republican proposals that we have already designed and which will begin to bring immediate relief. 
   The other night I had a teletown hall meeting and I was listening to the people in the 19th Congressional District of Texas. One person said, Congressman, I have to drive 100 miles every day to go to my job. She said, my gasoline has gone up, but my paycheck has not. 
   The most disturbing news was the gentleman who said, Congressman, I have to get dialysis three times a week. I have to drive 70 miles each way. He said, now I am down to trying to decide whether I am going to be able to buy food, gasoline, or the treatment for my diabetes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Democratic majority, who promised the American people a plan, to bring that plan to this House floor, instead of important legislation like we voted on yesterday, supporting the goals and ideals of the International Year of Sanitation. I know the American people are going to be very comforted that this body took up that legislation, and not energy legislation that would have brought relief for high energy costs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, you're going to hear a lot of perspectives today, but I wanted to give you a perspective from my friend James Clark. James wrote me this letter about stem cell research. 
   ``In October 2004, I was involved in a car crash which has left me paralyzed from the waist down ..... Given the current technology and my condition, there is no hope of full recovery.'' 
   James goes on to say, ``I fully support ethical forms of stem cell research. I believe, based on news accounts, that stem cells could be the key to a full recovery for me. To walk again and regain complete independence,'' would be, ``a joyous day for me and my family. I can only imagine how many American people would also benefit. 
   ``But, Congressman, I believe there is a very dark side to stem cell research. There are those who believe stem cells should be taken from living embryos. In my opinion, the killing of an embryo for the harvest of stem cells is exactly the same as killing another human being. Under no circumstances do I wish to benefit from the stem cells that result from the harming or killing of a human embryo. No thanks, I'll stay in this wheelchair.'' 
   Clearly, James has a lot to gain from scientific breakthroughs in stem cell research. Let's spend our money where we can get breakthroughs. Let's continue adult stem cells.  
   So let's focus taxpayer dollars on research that has shown promise. 
   Adult stem cell research, and other research that doesn't lead to the destruction of human life, have produced more than 70 treatments. 
   On the other hand, stem cell research on embryos has produced ZERO treatments or cures that could help James walk again. 
   I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill so that we can focus our resources on ethical and promising adult stem cell research that could help my good friend James get rid of his wheelchair. 
   Vote ``no'' on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I hope today, as we take this vote, that people will understand really what is at stake here. 
   I have heard a lot of discussion today, and some Members are going to go back home and say, well, I voted for this bill and against the troops because I brought home some things for the people in my district. 
   But today this vote is not about bringing home bacon for the people in your district. It is about American security. 
   My family was in New York on 9/11, and my daughter-in-law and her mother were supposed to be at the World Trade Center on 9/11. So when I take this vote this afternoon or at noon, whenever we have this, let me tell you the reason why RANDY NEUGEBAUER is going to be voting ``no.'' Because I am looking forward, not at what we are doing today and what is going to, who is going to be able to take what projects home, but I am looking forward to the security of America. I am looking into the eyes of my grandsons Nathan and Noah and saying, Nathan and Noah, I didn't leave America safe and secure for you. 
   This is about security. 9/11 is a real event. America was attacked. We have been attacked before. We know this enemy is going to come back and attack us again. 
   This bill, this vote, is about keeping America safe. So when Members go home and brag about their vote on this, I hope that they go home and brag about the fact that they cast a vote that will ensure a safe and secure America because, you see, if you take all of these projects home, and there is no security in America, there is no America. 
   I urge my colleagues not to vote for this bill.  
   I rise today in strong support of our troops and their mission in Iraq. 
   Ten days ago, I returned from my third trip to Iraq. From the generals to the privates, the message I heard from our troops in Iraq was ``let us do our job so we can win.'' And that is precisely what we should be doing here today. 
   Today, we should be working to provide our military with the tools and resources needed to attain victory ..... 
   Today, we should be showing our troops that we are behind them 100 percent ..... And today, we should be showing the world that America has the resolve to stand up to terrorist threats even when the going gets tough. 
   Instead, this ill-advised legislation does just the opposite. By putting restrictions on our military commanders and the President ..... and setting a firm timeline and final date for withdrawal, this bill undermines the war effort, sends the wrong message to our troops, and telegraphs our war strategy to the enemy. 
   Our Constitution is clear in that it places the responsibility for conducting the war in the hands of a single Commander-in-Chief, not Congress. Our Founding Fathers wisely understood that having 535 politicians in Washington attempt to micromanage a war is a recipe for disaster. 
   I am further disappointed that the majority has jeopardized the success of the drought relief package for farmers and ranchers. 
   I strongly support drought relief and have been calling for federal assistance since last summer. However, as much as I know producers in my district support disaster assistance, I cannot in good conscience support this supplemental because of the flawed military strategy that the majority is pursuing in this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2643, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the American taxpayers in opposition to this rule. 
   A couple of weeks ago we had a lot of debate on this floor about earmarks. At the end of this agreement we were able to have a process that's more open and transparent for the earmark process, and so that was a victory for the American taxpayer. However, it's worth noting that when you look at the spending, for example in 2005, earmark spending was less than 1 percent. So even though the battle was won on earmarks, the war is still on against overspending of the American taxpayers' money. 
   There are many causes for overspending in this country today, and one of those is the entitlement programs. Those are programs, unfortunately, that this body doesn't even get to vote on. And the fact that the new majority's budget now has an additional discretionary spending of $20 billion does not help the spending problem at all. 
   I would argue that Congress is failing at another very important issue as well. According to a CQ Weekly article recently, $100 billion in appropriations this year that we will make aren't authorized. Now, the American people know what ``authorized'' means. If you go down and open up a checking account, people want to know if you're authorized to sign on that account. If you get a credit card, certain people are authorized to use the credit card. I wish we were using a checking account for the American taxpayers, but unfortunately we're using a credit card. 
   What we're going to have in this bill today, the Interior EPA appropriations bill, is $7.29 billion that's not authorized. What does that mean? That means that the committees of jurisdiction have chosen either not to authorize this spending or to reauthorize this spending, yet the appropriation process is going to go ahead and spend $7.29 billion of the American taxpayers' money. Let me tell you where some of that unauthorized money is going to be distributed; $160 million to the National Endowment of the Arts was last authorized and it expired in 1993. The authorization for this expired in 1993. $1.8 billion of discretionary programs for the Bureau of Land Management. That authorization expired in 2002. $10.5 million for EPA State and Tribal Grants to Alaskan Native Villages. Authorization for this spending expired in 1979. These projects aren't on autopilot. In fact, there is not even a pilot in the cockpit. These are programs that no one has chosen to reauthorize in a number of years. 
   As Members of Congress, we're entrusted to spend the taxpayers' money wisely. Congress is supposed to continually review these policies and programs to determine, one, are they working; secondly, do they need to be improved; or, third, should they be eliminated altogether. 
   Get this: House rules require appropriations to go through the authorization program, yet each year the Rules Committee chooses to waive points of order authorizing spending. In other words, that means we have rules in this House to protect the American taxpayer by saying we're not going to fund projects that aren't authorized. But what is the first action that we take? We waive the rules. This is a practice  both Republican and Democratic Congresses are guilty of. However, I think it's important to point out this shortcoming as we go into this very important legislative process. 
   Now, some might argue, well, Congress is just too busy, doesn't have enough time to review all of these program. Well, quite honestly, if these programs aren't important enough for Congress to take the time to review them to determine whether they should be continued to be funded or if they're relevant today, we probably shouldn't be sending billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money for those programs. And to the argument, well, we're too busy, well, we haven't been too busy in the first 6 months of this Congress. In the first 6 months of this Congress we've authorized $828 billion in new programs. So if we have time to authorize $828 billion in new programs, it looks like to me we have time to go through these programs that are going to be funded today in this bill that are unauthorized. 
   Clearly, Congress needs to do a better job. The first thing Congress needs to do is follow the rules. These were rules that were put in place to put checks and balances on how we spend the American taxpayers' money. And so I would encourage our Members today to vote against this rule and for Congress to follow its own rules, and that is, to make sure that we do not fund unauthorized projects.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Biggert of the subcommittee for yielding. 
   And I also want to rise and thank Chairwoman Waters, the subcommittee chairman of Housing, for having the hearings down in New Orleans and over in Mississippi. I see a number of Members in the Chamber that went on that trip. That was a very positive trip. But I think what we learned while we were down there is we share some common feelings about the recovery. And I think that was the frustration that we shared while we were down there where we saw very little progress in one area and a lot of progress in the other. In fact, I have said to my colleagues back home that this is a tale of two recoveries: the recovery or lack of recovery in New Orleans in Louisiana and the recovery that is going on in Mississippi. 
   I want to associate myself with some of the words the ranking member just made on the floor awhile ago about the model that needs to take place in New Orleans when we are talking about going back and building new housing. Some of the proposals that some of the people put forward while we were in New Orleans would not meet criteria  for a new federally subsidized housing project today. We don't do that anymore. We don't create these huge pockets where we have impoverished people where we see high crime, and we now go to mixed projects that provide communities that give diversity to those.     
   New Orleans faced a great devastation from the fact that they had a catastrophic hurricane. But now they have a great opportunity to rebuild, really starting in many places with a clean piece of paper. Can this be done without some disruption? No, it cannot, because the disruption has already taken place. And there are people who do want to return to New Orleans and to Louisiana, and there are people who may not return. 
   But what we do owe the American people, and I appreciate the fact that Ranking Member Biggert laid out a very clear outline of what this Congress has done to step up to meet the needs of the people that were affected by this hurricane, and the list is long, and the money is great, what we owe the American people is to make sure that we take that money now that we have put in place for Katrina and make sure it gets spent appropriately and that it benefits the people for which it is intended. 
   One of the things that concerns me about this bill is that every time we stand up and get into a discussion about Katrina, we have to authorize more money. In fact, this bill authorizes $1.3 billion in new money. But money is really not the issue in Louisiana and New Orleans. 
   Now, I will admit and agree with the chairman, Chairman Frank, that there are some things in this bill that clean up some administrative issues that probably need to take place. But let me tell you, the reason there is not recovery in New Orleans today is not because the United States Congress hasn't passed this bill. What they need in New Orleans and in Louisiana is probably leadership more than they need more money. But this bill does address some of that. 
   There are some amendments that were offered in our committee, in our markup, and I want to say this to Chairman Frank, that we had a very good markup. He ran that meeting well and allowed a lot of amendments, and we had good debate and conversations about that, and I appreciate that. But there are amendments that are in this bill that make it more fiscally responsible and make it less micromanaging. 
   One of the things I get concerned about is we have got a Congress right now that wants to run the war in Iraq, and now we have a Congress that wants to run the recovery in New Orleans. What we do know is that we have to set out some parameters for that. 
   What the people need in New Orleans is to get started. Hopefully they will begin to do that. We saw some signs they were moving in that direction. But what I would say to my colleagues is that what we have to do is at some point in time say, you know, this is all of the money and resources that we are going to give to this cause until we see some tangible results. Unfortunately, when you look at what is going on in Louisiana right now, there are not tangible results. It would not be something that you would want to put more money into until you see some better stewardship of the dollars that have already been authorized. In fact, many of the dollars that we have already authorized have not been spent. 
   So what I want our colleagues to do today as they listen to this debate is make sure that we accomplish the goal of what was the original intent of H.R. 1227, and that was to fix some slight glitches in the process, but not to become more fiscally irresponsible. 
   In closing, I would just say there is an opportunity in New Orleans. But I will tell you, the American people that are watching this debate today, and I hear it when I go back home, they are saying, Congressman, how much more money are we going to have to put into this process until we begin to see some results? 
   As I was riding in with a cabdriver going to the hearing that the chairwoman had in New Orleans, I asked the cabdriver, what is going on in New Orleans? He said, nothing. I said, what is the problem? He said, we have no plan, we have no leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank the gentlewoman very much. 
   Mr. Chairman, one of the things that we saw down there was we saw some housing units and some of the public housing that had been refurbished and was ready to rent. But what we did see in those housing projects was a lot of vacant units. So one of the things that is going on right now, the dynamics as we are talking about earlier about getting something going there, is a couple of organizations have come in, and they have some master--planned communities to go back and replace some of this housing. 
   You almost cannot describe on this House floor, we really need pictures to be able to articulate the condition of some of this housing. It is throwing good money after bad to go back and bring very many of these units back because, one, they have been sitting for 18 months just the way they were the night that the folks that left those units left them. They have been under water. They have been vandalized. 
   So one of the things that we need to do is we need to provide a certain amount of housing that meets the current demand, see how many people actually want to come back to New Orleans, come back to those neighborhoods. I would submit to you that if you want folks to come back, and I think that is the goal of the people of New Orleans, they want people to come back to the community, if you want them to come back, don't ask them to come back to those units that were in terrible condition before the hurricane and would cost a lot of money to restore. We should take those new dollars and provide a new opportunity for the people in New Orleans, and not mandate things that would cause the resources to be diverted to spending a lot of money. 
   And I would tell you, in some cases, as the gentlewoman Ms. Waters mentioned, I have been a home builder and a land developer, I know what the cost of restoration is, and many times the cost of restoration of units exceeds the cost of creating those new units. 
   But putting those arguments aside, just going back and recreating what was already a bad thing, as Ranking Member Bachus said before, in some of these where we had a high concentration of poor people is not good policy. 
   So the Biggert amendment makes sense. Let's let the demand drive it. As there is demand to fix up these units. If the new units are not ready, there are ways to meet those market demands.     
   But if you go back and ask them to come up with a number, and let's say that is two or 3,000 units or whatever that number is, and those units sit vacant because people don't want to go back to those neighborhoods, we have defeated the purpose and, unfortunately, not been good stewards of the American taxpayers' money. So I would urge Members to support the Biggert amendment.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I just want to clarify about using the multi-stories. Most of the housing that we saw, and I am not going to say all of it, we didn't see all of the housing, but most of the housing is one- and two-story. There may have been some three-story. And some of those are walkups; in other words, the second story is a part of the first part of the unit; in other words, it is a two-story unit. So the argument that you are dealing with a high rise where there is floor 3 up to 10 is usable, in these particular housing units that we saw there was not multistory housing.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think we are all working in the same direction here. We are all trying to figure out what is the best avenue to restore life for the people that were affected by this hurricane, and I think what we are bringing to this floor today in a meaningful debate is what is the best way to do that. 
   Some have talked about different methodologies about being able to restore these communities in the best way. But one of the things we have to have in our country in almost every life is structure.  
   April 15 is upon us, and that is the day our income tax is due. It is a deadline. What we have to say to the people that were affected by this is that the temporary disaster piece of this program is coming to an end. It is time now to make some permanent decisions, and we have been talking about what some of those permanent options are. 
   There is housing available in New Orleans, but there is housing available in some of the communities that these people are residing in. What we do is we keep pushing forward, keep pushing forward, families finally having to decide where do we go from here? It is time for many of those families to move on, and, unfortunately, we keep using Katrina as a way to increase programs that ought to be debated in other committees and at other times. More vouchers, more vouchers. What we need to do is set a date certain. 
   Now, as the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee mentioned, the President of the United States has, in fact, extended these benefits. But what we also heard is in those circumstances where we didn't extend some of the programs, that there was life after that. 
   Sometimes the toughest love that you can do for someone to get them moving on, to help them to move on from a traumatic situation is actually force them to move on and go to the next step. What I think the gentleman's amendment does is it does not cause the process to have a stopping point for the temporary disaster and where we begin to talk about it more permanent. 
   I agree with the gentleman that FEMA is not the agency to do housing. HUD is set up to do housing. We have been talking about there are things in this bill that will help HUD, help the housing authority to get the permanent housing piece moving forward. But the longer we prolong this disaster and call it a temporary relief, I believe the longer we do the families that we are really trying to help a disservice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit I offer today is straightforward and simple. 
   If adopted, it would require the President's annual report to the Congress on CFIUS operations to analyze the factors that promote the healthy investment climate and scrutinize the aspects of our regulatory environment that discourages such investment. I hope that all Members can agree that supporting foreign investment in the United States, with appropriate exceptions to protect our national security, benefits all Americans. 
   I also hope that all Members recognize that just as important to welcome direct investment in the United States, it is also important to identify and address the barriers that have been erected in this country that chill such investment. Open markets and national security support one another.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I was listening to my friend from Texas's analogy about the sporting events, since that is on everybody's mind right now. I was thinking about two things. One, the proposal that is being put before this Congress, possibly this week, is to say, you know what, let's let the fans do the coaching. We hired us a head coach, but you know what, we have decided the fans know more about how to win this basketball championship, and so we are going to let the fans do that. 
   But the most compelling thing that I heard, and I want to talk a little bit about this trip, and the gentlemen both know, I just returned 10 days ago from being in Iraq for the third time. I was in Fallujah, was in Ramadi, and talked to General Petraeus, a four-star general who we have tasked to finish and win the war in Iraq, all of the way down to the privates. And one of the privates said to me, Congressman, it is like this. In sporting events, we have home games and we have away games. We lost one of our home games; let's win this away game. 
   He was referring to the attack on Ð9/11. That wasn't the first attack on home soil. So we have lost a couple of home games, we want to win the away games. 
   Also, the gentleman from Texas is exactly right. What we saw in Fallujah and Ramadi is that the sheiks are not only telling us where the bad guys are, but in one case, one of the sheiks from his particular tribe sent 400 or 500 of his young people from his tribe to enlist in the police force in the Iraqi Army, saying not only do we want to tell you where they are, but we want to help you take these people out of our neighborhoods. 
   I believe one of the turning points that is going on in Iraq today is the fact that the Iraqi people are tired of what these terrorists are doing to their own country. They are tired of the killing. And I notice the gentleman has a picture of a street scene. I know what that father and mother are thinking: Will my children ever be safe to walk the streets of the neighborhood they were raised in? 
   The good news is the answer to that is going to be yes. 
   Now, is it still dangerous over there? Absolutely. But we are at war. I think some people are under the misconception that one day we are going to wake up and we are going to have some utopic situation in Iraq. The Israeli people have been waiting for that utopic situation for many, many years. There is still going to be violence. 
   We have violence in our own country. We have violence in our own cities. But one of the things I felt was most compelling when I was over there, and I was visiting with all of the way from General Petraeus down to privates to boots on the ground, and each one of our stops in Fallujah, in Ramadi, in Baghdad, we had lunch or dinner with the troops. Those are the people that really will tell you how things are going. 
   What they said is what the gentlemen both have been saying: Things are getting better. We are able to go into these neighborhoods, and we have a different tactic. We used to have a post and we would go in with a convoy and we would tour that area, and at the end of the day we would go back out. Now we are putting security posts inside the communities. I call it kind of like community policing. Now we have a presence there. 
   And one of the things that people don't realize, for example, in Baghdad, that presence looks like this. There are three Iraqi security force officers, whether they be police or army, to every one American. So what is happening, those people are coming up to those people that are in their neighborhood and saying, Down the block two ways is a bad person. And you know what? On a number of occasions we have gone down to where the people say they were, and not only did we find some high-value targets, we also found huge caches of weapons and IED-making things.     
   So now I think the hearts of the Iraqi people are in this. I know that the hearts of our troops were because, as I shared with the conference, I believe, 2 weeks ago, those soldiers looked me right in the eye, and they said, Congressman, nobody has more invested in this war than we do. 
   One young man, this is his third tour. He said, sir, I have been in harm's way  three times for this country and for my country, and he said, nobody has more invested than I do. He said, Congressman, please go back and tell your colleagues, let us finish this job. This is a fight we can win. 
   And anybody that voted to send those troops over there just to go over there and play Army for a while and then come home with defeat made the wrong vote. When we send our young men and women in harm's way, we need to be sending them to win, not to place. We need to win those away games so that we do not have to fight any more home games. 
   I also shared with the conference, I believe, this week the story about a gentleman that joined me in the State of the Union for this year. His name is Roy Vallez, and Roy was sitting right back over here in this corner in a seat that my wife gave her ticket to Roy, and why Roy is so special is Roy has the distinction, unfortunately, of being the only father in America that has lost two sons in Iraq. 
   While Roy was here, he was going around telling everybody about how important it is for us to finish this war so that his sacrifice, his extreme sacrifice, that he made and his sons made was not all for naught. He had an opportunity to talk to the President of the United States who called him on his cell phone, and he and the President had a wonderful conversation. That is the message he said to the President. Now, if there is anybody that has a right to question whether we ought to pull out right now or quit or come home, I believe Roy Vallez probably gets a place at the top of the list.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I want to make the point, but I think that is one of the things that concerns me most is that this global war on terrorism is a real war. So when we talk about bleeding out or getting out or whatever you want to call it of Iraq, the thing that the other side has not brought to us is what they are going to do next, what is next on the agenda, what are they going to do if they pull out of Iraq, then how are we going to continue to keep these bad people from following us back to the U.S.? 
   I think that is a real concern, and I think that the fact that the gentleman, I did the see the copy of the press conference, and it is disconcerting that those folks that are the folks that have the next plan.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Doesn't the gentleman find it ironic, both of you, that in order to get support for this flawed plan where we are basically saying to our troops, we don't think you can get the job done, we are going to cut and run, we are going to slow-bleed this, that they have got to go out and start buying votes from their Members by offering up these projects, some of these pet projects from some of these Members in order to get support. Something as important as our national security is being bartered in the halls of the United States Congress. 
   I don't believe the American people think that's the way we ought to be doing business here. I don't think they think when we are making policy about keeping America safe, keeping America secure, making sure that when we send our troops somewhere, we support them 100 percent so that we can bring home the victory we send them to. 
   Now we are bartering for that progress with these projects. As the gentleman said, many of these things are worthwhile initiatives, but this is not the time nor the place nor the forum for those to be talked about.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. We are talking about this civil war. One of the interesting things in Fallujah is we sat down, and at the table, across the table, was the police chief of Fallujah. Sitting next to him was a colonel in the Iraqi Army. The interesting thing about that meeting, one is Sunni, the other is Shiite. Yet they are working side by side to make sure that Fallujah, the streets of Fallujah, are again a place where families can walk and commerce can take place. 
   One of the interesting things that I saw on this trip, each trip I have seen progress. On this particular trip, I saw a lot more people out in the farmlands. What a lot of people don't know about Iraq is that at one time they were an exporter of agricultural products. This is a region of the world that is rich in a lot of natural resources. One of those is water. 
   But more people were engaged in the streets. We flew at night. We flew from Ramadi into Baghdad, flying over the city, a lot more lights, a lot more electricity on, not just in the city but out in the countryside. These are the kinds of things that are going to build that Nation. 
   To pull the plug after we have invested all of the lives and the resources into this initiative at this particular point in time is really unconscionable for our country even to consider that. I am concerned that a lot of people don't realize, as you said, what is really at stake here.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. The gentleman is exactly right. I think the point was made, this is a young government. This is a young government that is basically about 8 months old. Basically they are learning how to govern because they have been an oppressed people for so long. 
   I think about our Nation, we are going to celebrate over 230 years of history of this country, this Republic. We are still learning how to govern in many ways. I think talking about drop-dead dates, wouldn't it be nice if we had a drop-dead date to go to a balanced budget in this Congress? 
   The gentleman talked about the splitting of oil reserves, and I think some of the positive things are there has been a tentative agreement reached within some of the Iraqi leadership, and they are going to hopefully bring that to a vote here fairly quickly. Prime Minister Maliki is making it very clear that there is no one that is a sacred cow in this war. If there are bad people out there, no matter what their affiliation is, that they have permission to go and do that.     
   And the list goes on and on of the positives. Yes, we still have fatalities; yes, we still have people being killed in that country. But we have never, I don't know of a war we have fought that there weren't those costs.

We want to spend time with our families. We want to go back to our communities. But, Congressman, we have a lot invested in this war, probably more than anyone else, and let us finish this job.'' 
   And so I urge my colleagues to listen to these young brave men and women that are doing phenomenal things for our country and for the people in Iraq. Listen to the soldiers: Let's finish this job.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, this is a pretty simple and straightforward amendment. It just simply just strikes section 306 from this bill. 
   What we do in this legislation already is we extend many of the vouchers for the disaster voucher program. But what we are trying to do in this bill is not only just say we want to extend them, but that we want to make them permanent. 
   Actually, this is not the place to debate whether we need to add additional vouchers to the voucher section 8 program. One of the concerns I have about this is that the scoring on this is an additional authorization of $735 million, nearly three-quarters of $1 billion. We are not opposed to debating whether we need to add additional vouchers or change the formula in the future, but this is not the place to do that. 
   What I said yesterday and continue to say is we are using these disaster programs to push forward things that other people have been working on in other agendas and trying to do this on the backs of the people that have suffered a great disaster. 
   One of the things I want to go back to is the fact that we stated yesterday that it's not like this Congress has not responded to the people in Louisiana and Mississippi; $110 billion has been authorized by this Congress for the disaster relief, and $116.7 billion in CDBG money has been provided to give flexibility for the housing needs of the people in this area. 
   When we go back to the city of New Orleans itself prior to the hurricane, we had 7,000 public housing units in New Orleans, and 2,000 of those were already scheduled to be torn down, and 5,100 were online, and not all of those occupied. Now approximately 2,000 units already have been repaired, 1,200 have been returned. 
   Ten billion dollars has been allocated to the Road Home Program in Louisiana. Let me repeat that, $10.5 billion authorized, $300 million spent, a full 3 months after the hurricane. 
   The problem making these vouchers permanent is we are giving preference to folks that are living in communities where other people have been in line. One of the things that I think there is a misconception on is we have talked the last few days about what is going on in New Orleans and what the future is. In 2019 or thereabouts, New Orleans will celebrate its 300th anniversary. For 300 years, that community has been building to what it was pre-Katrina. 
   There is some misconception in the next 6 months by extending some of these programs and moving forward that all of a sudden everything is going to be back to normal in New Orleans. That is not going to be the truth. 
   What we need to do is begin to build the housing back, letting that go forward. I know that yesterday, the distinguished chairman said, well, the reason we have to go back and get the units back in order is so that is not keeping them from building new units. In fact, it is. The fact is, we can't tear down some of those units. That is the very land that we are talking about going back and reusing. It doesn't make sense to me to go back and rebuild all of these units or remodel them, only to come back eventually and have to tear them down so that we can do the new planned communities. 
   We should go back to the basic tenets of this bill. The basic tenets of this bill was to hopefully get off high center those few glitches that, quote, the leadership in New Orleans and Louisiana say is keeping them from moving their reconstruction forward. It hasn't stopped the people in Mississippi, but for whatever reason, it has stopped the people in Louisiana and moved forward. 
   Mr. Chairman, we should not extend permanently these vouchers. This is not the form for that. It's not appropriate, it's not fiscally responsible for us to do that. We have extended those vouchers to meet the current needs of some of the folks. We really don't even know how much people will think about returning. But one of the things about making these vouchers permanent, I believe you will ensure that some of these people don't return because many of them have moved on to other places. 
   Now, we are saying we are going to make your vouchers permanent. We are going to put you in front of people that have been in those communities for a number of years and have been waiting in line to be eligible for this very assistance. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, just to clarify a couple of things. What I think the question is here is not the fact that this Congress has reached out. We have reached out. I think we have all acknowledged that these families and folks in this area have suffered a tremendous disaster. 
   The problem is, the question today, is how long is the disaster relief going to be extended to these people. I mean, when is the disaster over? And the problem I have with this bill is it says we are going to do it permanently. 
   Now, the gentleman from Massachusetts stated that they disappear. Well, the scoring that the CBO did on this did an 8 percent attrition rate, saying that 8 percent of these are going to begin to roll off over a 10-year period, and that is how they came up with the scoring of $735 million. So that attrition has taken place in there. 
   What I would submit to you is we temporarily extended these. We may need to extend a piece or a portion of them in the future. But what we are saying with this bill is we are going to make disaster assistance permanent by making these vouchers permanent. 
   At this time I would like to yield to the distinguished ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee on Financial Services, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert).

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri for his eloquent comments about the poor and the elderly. First of all, I want to make a couple of points. One, I understand when he speaks about that, he shared his family's story with me, it is a great story. It is an American success story, and I know that he knows a lot about public housing. 
   One of the things I want to say about my amendment, my amendment does not show a lack of support for 202 housing or any other housing. I believe in and have supported housing proposals that this Congress has put forward. We have a number of wonderful, affordable housing programs that are administered through HUD, and we need to continue those. In fact, we are trying to get those programs off high center down in New Orleans in the hurricane area, because that is, long term, a better housing solution for many of the victims of the hurricane. 
   The other thing that I think needs to be clarified, and I know the gentleman didn't intend to misrepresent this, this bill does not take away any benefits from any poor or elderly people. This bill extends that. My amendment does not take that away. What my amendment says is it is probably not good policy just to permanently extend this disaster program. 
   What we do in the bill is already extend this program to many of our senior citizens. In fact, prior to the hurricane, there were 8,500 people on section 8 vouchers. Today there are about 12,000 people using these emergency vouchers. 
   So what we are really trying to do with this bill, if we go back again, sometimes we get off track, what is the purpose of this bill? The purpose of this bill is to get permanent housing back in New Orleans and Mississippi for all income groups; poor, elderly, the families that were residing there. We have allocated a substantial amount of resources to do this. But what we are saying with this amendment is we should not make disaster assistance permanent. We were extending it in this bill, and that makes sense, because, unfortunately, the folks in New Orleans are way behind schedule. They need to get off high center and get back on schedule. 
   This amendment does not, and people listening to this debate today need to be clear, this amendment does not take away vouchers from anybody. What it doesn't do is just write a continuing blank check. 
   In many of the cities and places where people that were displaced from this disaster are living, there are housing units available to them. It may be that they decide to make a permanent decision to reside in those communities that they have gone to. Many of them have gone back to cities closer to maybe their children or their families. We need to give them the opportunity. But what we don't need to do is create a whole new voucher program with this disaster. 
   As the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Housing said, we are setting precedent every time we get up with one of these disasters and we try to outdo the last disaster. I think the American people have said, why don't you all come up with a plan and stick with it? We came up with a plan. We executed that plan. We sent the resources down to those areas. From a Federal perspective, I don't know how much more money we can throw at that initiative to get it off high center. 
   One of the things we need to be clear on about this amendment, it doesn't take anything away from elderly people, it doesn't take anything away from poor people, it doesn't make a statement that we shouldn't have a permanent housing solution. A permanent housing solution is a better solution. But when you extend and make permanent some of these other side programs, you keep taking away resources that could go to the permanent housing. 
   As I made the statement yesterday when we talked about going back and building maybe some housing for elderly and other folks down there, we don't need to go back and do it where they were before, because I have seen those units, and I know why a lot of people haven't gone back, because the thought of having to go back to those units, and I don't care how much money you spend on them, it wasn't a good situation before, it won't be a good situation today. 
   You need to support this amendment because it is fiscally responsible. It meets the needs of the people. But it does say before we begin to create a whole new level of voucher programs, we need to have that debate in another forum, not on the backs of the resources needed for the people to rebuild after Katrina. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado's remarks. I think what you hear from both of us is frustration that things haven't moved along faster. 
   What I would point out to the gentleman and to the folks on the other side of the aisle is the point that we have been making that we believe that this keeps people in limbo, causes them not to begin to make some kind of a permanent housing decision. I use the example that in New Orleans today there are about 2,000 units of public housing that are available today, but they have about 400 or 500 vacancies that people are not applying for. 
   Secondly, they have had to go back on a number of occasions because those units have been vacant so long, they had to go back and make them ready again. In that climate, when a unit sits vacant for a short period of time or an extended period of time, the unit gets stale and they have to go back and do some mold mitigation and some other things because there is not someone occupying it. 
   The point here is we have extended the benefits. The benefits are in this bill for all of the people that have been talked about here this morning. But what we are saying is two things: One, we are trying to permanently increase the amount of section 8 vouchers available in a bill that is about disaster. Secondly, we are talking about extending things where people do not have to come to some kind of a decision about what they want to do. 
   We want them to go back to New Orleans. I think the people of New Orleans want the people to come back, they want to have the community and the sense of community that they had prior to the storm. But I will tell you that I think we are being the enemy here by not bringing some deadlines and definition to this disaster program. At some point in time the disaster piece is over and the recovery piece has to begin. 
   We have made an allowance for the transition to do that, but when you make something permanent, even when you say, well, it disappears, what we know about Federal programs is they don't have a history of disappearing. Once we put them on the books, they generally stay with us. 
   We have the ability down the road, this Congress will, if in fact there needs to be another extension, and in fact the administration has some flexibility. But when you put the word ``permanent'' on anything, it is permanent. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts' point. One, I don't see anywhere in here where there is any expression on my part or have I made the point that I am against section 8 vouchers. What I am for, and as the gentleman mentioned, if we have an opportunity and a place and a forum to debate the section 8 program, many of us believe that there can be some things done to the section 8 program to actually make it a more effective program. 
   The other piece of the deal is that we are not taking away any section 8 vouchers with my amendment. In fact, as I mentioned a while ago, there were 8,500 section 8 vouchers in New Orleans prior to the storm. Anybody that is living in Houston or Oklahoma, anywhere else right now, that wants to come back to New Orleans, there is a section 8 voucher, if they qualify, available for them today. 
   I don't understand this. I think the other side is trying to somehow argue against my amendment because they know what making something permanent means. It means permanent. They want to try to say that we are somehow depriving people of the ability to have vouchers. If people qualify for vouchers in Houston, they can qualify for them in Houston. If they want to come back to New Orleans, they can come back to New Orleans. There are vouchers available for them there. We made sure, and I thought it was the right policy, and the gentlewoman from California made this point, I believe, in the hearing, that we need to make sure that we keep New Orleans' hold on the programs that they had available. I believe this bill takes steps to do this. 
   Really what we are talking about, we need to get back to what this amendment does. It just says, you know what, it doesn't make sense in this bill to make this disaster relief permanent when it goes to section 8 vouchers. It doesn't take vouchers away from anybody. It doesn't say anything about 202 housing. It doesn't say anything about rebuilding the affordable housing projects in New Orleans. It just says it is not appropriate policy to start using disaster bills to make other programs permanent.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Well, I just want to reiterate what this bill does and what it does not. We have heard a lot of things about what people think it does, but I think we need to go back and review what the bill does. Reviewing what the bill does, it strictly strikes section 306. What the bill doesn't do is it doesn't take away benefits to elderly and benefits to the poor. In fact, we have a number of people who are on these emergency vouchers who actually don't qualify for section 8. 
   It doesn't say to people that we don't care. But what it does say is that this is not the appropriate form. As the gentleman from Louisiana stated, there is a waiting list. For all kinds of housing in many cities all across the country today, there are waiting lists for section 8 vouchers and there are waiting lists for housing for the elderly. All across this country there are those opportunities. 
   Our job here is not to fix preexisting conditions. Our job here is to help with disaster relief, bringing that community back to some semblance of what it was prior to the hurricane and not to try to fix problems that were existing in that community before. 
   There are opportunities within this relief to fix some of the issues that were going on. We had housing projects that were massive, that had a huge accumulation of poor people and a lot crime and a lot of things going on in those that we don't find acceptable in our country. 
   With this disaster recovery money we have appropriated, we have an opportunity to go back and make those communities better. But we should not be trying to fix preexisting conditions with this legislation. And by making these vouchers permanent, we are trying to say we had a problem before and we want to fix that. 
   What we want to do, and I think what I heard from the testimony from the mayor and from the Governor and from the community leaders down there, we are trying to rebuild our community. 
   But when you make these disaster vouchers permanent, people can stay in Houston and they can stay other places, and they don't have to come back to this community. As we stated, there are housing units available here. There are vouchers available here. To the point we can, we need to focus our money and our resources on bringing people back and giving them the ability to come back. 
   I urge Members to support a fiscally responsible bill that is compassionate in that it doesn't take away anything, but it just says this is not the appropriate forum to be adding vouchers to the section 8 program. It is not appropriate to use a disaster bill to have the dialogue about whether we should increase the amount of section 8 vouchers. 
   I know that the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Financial Services is going to have a hearing on that, and I welcome that discussion as we talk about it, and it shouldn't be just about section 8. When we sit down and talk about housing for our poor and our elderly, we ought to talk about a comprehensive look at it. Is section 8 the best way to do that, or are more permanent housing projects better? 
   But that is not the debate here on this bill, nor should we be trying to have that debate and to make that policy within this bill. 
   I urge Members to vote for my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   One of the things that we have to understand that we're talking about today on this floor, we're talking about a lot of different kinds of security. We're talking about energy security. We're also talking about economic security. But really the bottom line we're talking about is jobs in America. 
   No doubt that energy is a major issue in our country. Our energy dependence becomes a problem, is continuing to be a problem, but what we have to do is go about this in a way that makes sense. 
   And when we look at, yes, we need to look at additional research in certain areas and additional expenditures in other areas and nuclear, and the gentleman from Florida brought that point forward, the gentleman brings forward the fact that we're increasing things like that by 20 percent. That would be really good if we were spending surpluses, but in fact we're not spending from surpluses, and what we're talking about is deficit spending and what we're talking about is an economic future for our young men and women. 
   Because you see what we're on the floor here today trying to do. My colleagues and I are trying to save the American taxpayers some money, because we have a leadership on the other side of the aisle that's on a spending spree. They think they have surpluses that they're spending, and in fact we're not. 
   In fact, we've got a $23 billion increase. We have got these ``funny money'' accounts where we're going to come up with the money from someplace. We all know where that money is coming from. That money is going to come from the American taxpayers because they've already gone on record to say that we're going to pass the largest tax increase in American history. And the way they're going to do that is they're going to tax the rich people. 
   Well, let's talk about the tax structure in this country today. For example, who are the rich people? We've got 1 percent of the top wage earners in this country already paying 33 percent of the taxes. Now, the next level up, the top 5 percent, they get to pay 54 percent of the taxes, and the top 10 percent get to pay 68 percent of the taxes. 
   Recently, the Tax Foundation brought forth a point that I think most of us knew, and that is, that three out of every five, that's 60 percent, of America's highest income-bracket payers are small business people. Let me repeat that. Three out of every five of the people who are in the upper bracket, which is the bracket that they want to tax, are small business people. 
   And what do small business people do? Well, they just do something that's extraordinarily great for America. They create jobs. In fact, they're the largest creator of jobs in this country. And what we did is back in 2003 we said, you know what, we want small businesses to create more jobs, make more economic security for our young people, and so we lowered the taxes. 
   And what happened? Well, something wonderful. We created 7.8 million new jobs in America. And you know what creating 7.8 million new jobs in America did for us? Well, number one, we have the highest home ownership rate in the history of this country.     
   More people own a home today than any other time in the history of this Nation. Guess what, more people are employed than any other time in the history of our Nation. 
   What we have to do, the Speaker of this House stood up on the day that she was sworn in and said, we listened to the people. I don't think they were listening. If they thought the American people were saying we want more spending and more taxes, I think they misunderstood. 
   If the American people said anything, it is they want a government that's less, that takes less of their money, spends less of their money, lives, spends their money like government spends their money like the American people have to, they have to spend within their limits. 
   Yes, I will like a 2 percent increase in this and a 2 percent increase in that, but the truth of the matter is, we can't afford it. If we continue on this trend of higher taxes, bigger spending, we are going to see these job numbers begin to talk. 
   So when you talk about we want more energy-efficient cars, let me tell you, if we don't have anybody that can afford cars in America because they don't have jobs, then what do we need energy-efficient cars for? 
   Let's be sensible about our policy here. We are making a sufficient amount of commitments to many of these initiatives, but we have to do it in a commonsense way. We have to do it in a way that says, you know what, a 2 percent increase or 3 percent, maybe this program should be eliminated, because this program is not providing any dividends for the American taxpayers. 
   We measure, around here, what we are doing about our problem by how much money we spend on it. Quite honestly, that's how we got in the situation of these large deficits is because we keep throwing money at problems instead of standing up here on the floor of this House and debating these issues and talking about what is in the best interest of the taxpayers. 
   I commend the gentleman from Minnesota on his amendment and urge passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, just a little over 5 years ago, on June 5, 2003, I stepped on the floor of this House to take the oath of office to be only the fourth Member of Congress from the 19th Congressional District, the 236th Texan, to ever serve in the United States Congress. 
   But what I really want to talk about, Mr. Speaker, is the hour before I stepped on the floor of this House and took that oath. I met in the Speaker's office. And while we were standing around waiting for the floor to open, the House to open up its daily prayer and Pledge, one of the Speaker's staff members came over to my wife and I and said, ``Congressman, would you like a few minutes alone, some quiet time before you're sworn in? We said, well, that would be great. I brought my own personal Bible with me. And so that lady led me around to a room that I don't know that a lot of people know that is in this Capitol, and that's our chapel, that's just around from the Speaker's lobby. And I didn't know exactly where she was taking us, but she opened the door, and to my wife's surprise, and myself, we saw that we were in a chapel in our Nation's Capitol. She closed that door behind us, and we walked over and knelt at the front of that chapel. And we just sat down as a couple and we began to pray because we realized what an awesome responsibility that the people in the 19th Congressional District of Texas had given us. And so we knelt there, and we began to pray. And we just said, Lord, we are about to embark on a journey that you have brought us here. We ask for Your guidance, we ask for Your direction, we ask for Your wisdom, and Father, all of those things that we're going to need to know in order to serve the American people. 
   And as we prayed there as a couple, it was a very special moment. And as I was sitting there and we were praying, I began to think about 232 years ago this July 4th, we thought about those men that got up and had this Declaration of Independence that started this great country called America. And I always recall the way they ended that declaration because they said, ``We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.'' You see, Mr. Speaker, they signed their death warrant for Dana and I to be able to sit there and kneel in the Nation's Capitol and exercise our right to pray to our Lord and Savior. 
   And I thought about the men and women over the 232 years that have served this Nation, that have given their lives and their service to protect the right for us to do that. I think about just a few hundred feet from where we are tonight, Mr. Speaker, I think about the church services that used to be held right in our Nation's Capitol and what a privilege and honor that must have been to come over to the Nation's Capitol and not only to see the center of freedom and democracy known around the world, but to worship your Lord and Savior. 
   And so, Father, tonight--Mr. Speaker, tonight--and really I guess that we're talking to our Heavenly Father tonight, and we're talking to you, too, Mr. Speaker--we've been talking about an important part of America, an important part of the foundation and the values of these men that started this great Nation, the foundation of the men and women that have kept this great freedom and democracy alive over these years and how important that is, and what a shame it is going to be if we don't protect that for future generations. Unfortunately, we've seen some Federal judges try to take away what these gentlemen pledged their lives to do. I hope we never let that happen. 
   And so just 2 weeks ago I reflected back on that very special day that right here in our Capitol there was an opportunity to get down on our knees and pray. But what's more important is that weekly this Congressional Prayer Caucus, these men and women from both sides of the aisle, believe in America and believe in the founding principles. 
   More importantly they understand that Who is the ultimate leader of this universe. 
   And so Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this time to talk tonight about a very important part of America, and that is the ability to praise our Lord and Savior.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I was listening with interest this evening about all of the things that are going, supposedly, not well in Iraq. So I hope to spend the next hour with some of my colleagues talking about the things that are going well. I thought it was interesting as the other side was talking about how they support our troops, and are thankful for the wonderful job they are doing, yet they have made them wait 107 days for much-needed resources to do the job that we have asked them to do. 
   We are going to talk about that later on this evening, of all of the things that our young men and women have  had to wait for as we have been playing a political game, or the other side, I would say, has been playing the political game, and our young men and women have been doing and continue to do the professional job that they have been doing for so many times. 
   I have been to Iraq three times myself, and tonight I am joined by some of my colleagues that have also been over there. We are going to talk about this war, because it's a real war. I think some people try to minimize what is going on in this global war on terrorism, but, in fact, it is a real war. We will talk about where this war is being fought. It's not just being fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are also going to talk about the fact that Iraq is a central front for the war on terrorism. 
   Finally, we are also going to talk a lot about the progress that's being made over there. General Pace was in Congress today briefing Members on what's going on in Iraq and brought forth a very positive report in many ways. 
   I look forward to this time. I am certainly glad that some of my friends on the other side weren't around when we fought the Revolutionary War, because it might have been too expensive, or we might have lost too many lives. What we do know is freedom and democracy has never come cheap. It comes with a price. 
   We enjoy the freedoms. In fact, we enjoy the freedom to be on the floor tonight with our colleagues because of price that many have paid that have gone before us. I am very proud of them. Every time that I have had the opportunity to travel and be with our soldiers, it makes me proud to be an American. 
   I would like to recognize my good friend from New Mexico, my neighbor Mr. Pearce. Mr. Pearce has also been to Iraq on three different occasions. He has seen many of the things that I have been alluding to. I would ask him to talk about his perspective of what is going on in the global war on terrorism.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank the gentleman from New Mexico. He brought a lot of insight to this discussion tonight. There is nothing better than, if you want to see what's going on, to go to the battlefield yourself. 
   What I was wondering with some of my colleagues this evening is the Democrats have made our troops sit and wait for 107 days to see if, in fact, they are going to fund the very resources that they need. And I have got to wonder how demoralizing that has to be when you get up every morning and you are putting yourself in harm's way for this great Nation of America, keeping America safe, and also helping liberate and begin to bring peace and democracy to another country, and how that must feel to know that your own home country is sitting over here and playing political games while you are doing the heavy lifting. 
   So I have to say to the young men and women that are in harm's way tonight that I am hopeful that this Democratic leadership will finally step up and do what they should do. 
   Before I yield to the next gentleman, I wanted to let the American people know what our young men and women have been waiting on. In this bill that we hopefully can pass this week is $8 billion for body armor, armored vehicles, and base security surveillance. In other words, these are the things that would help to keep them safe. Yet we have to wait 108 days for the Democrats to decide that they want to keep our troops safe. That just isn't right; $2.4 billion to help use some new technology and some things that we are learning about IEDs, which is one of the things over there that has caused so much damage and death and destruction in that country and harmed and injured, severely, many of our young men and women. And yet they have had to wait 108 days for these resources, for this Democratic Congress, this Democratic leadership, to give them the resources that they need. 
   Another important piece of this supplemental is the fact that $2.7 billion is allocated for updating our security and our surveillance and our intelligence. Let me tell you, today in Iraq and Afghanistan and all around the world, knowing where the bad guys are is a very important piece of how we defend this country and we prosecute the war on terrorism. Yet we have had to wait 108 days and counting for this leadership to do the right thing by our young men and women. 
   It is my honor and privilege now to recognize a fellow Texan, a former judge, a good friend, Congressman Carter from Texas, who has also been to Iraq. I believe the gentleman has been three times, if I am correct.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Well, I thank the gentleman. And you alluded to something that I want to point out, and several of our previous speakers have talked about this chart. And basically, people say, well, what's going on in Iraq? And I think what we hear is the news media portrays, well, there's a lot of fighting going on. But really what's been going on in Iraq at the same time is some nation building. And what you see on this chart is over 14,000 projects that have either been completed or are underway, and as the gentleman referred to, as some of these provinces for the first time have water. Some of them, for the first time in a long time, have electricity. 
   But let's get down to really talking about what's making a difference in the lives of the Iraqi people. And for the first time, young men and women are back in school again, and commerce is going on in these communities, and people are being able to live a life that's less fearful of this tyranny that Saddam Hussein would reign over his people. And so 14,000 projects, either completed or underway. And all of those green dots, and I know that it doesn't show up on the C-SPAN that well, but this map is dotted with projects. 
   The other thing that the gentleman brought up, and I think you're going to hear from some of the other speakers tonight, is that most of the time when we go to Iraq, we spend some time with the troops. I have meals, almost with every chance we always say to the military, we want to eat with the troops. We want to hear from the young men and women that are out there with boots on the ground what's going on. 
   And my most recent trip to Iraq, I was sitting with a young man, and it was one of the last, I think we were in Baghdad, and he looked over at me, and he looked me right in the eye and he said, Congressman, this is my third trip to Iraq. He said, nobody has more invested in this effort than me. Would I like to be home with my family? Absolutely. But, Congressman, go back and tell your colleagues, please let us finish this job. We are winning. We are making a difference. And it would be a true shame for us to leave this job undone and to let the 
   Iraqi people down. 
   The other thing, and the gentleman alluded to, was the fact that now we've been hearing that tens of thousands of calls are coming in now to the security forces of people in the neighborhoods saying, there's some bad folks roaming in our neighborhood. They're trying to do bad things; they're trying to harm us. And so they're turning in the bad people. So the Iraqi people are buying into the fact that this is their country. They have a responsibility. They're standing up the troops. 
   One of the interesting things the gentleman talked about the fact that we're standing up an Iraqi Army. Every once in a while, and we know it's unfortunately, but our suicide bombers will bomb a recruitment area. And the next day, what shows up at that same  site but more recruits because they went their country back. 
   They've had a number of elections, and so the fact that now that the sheiks, and not just the sheiks but the people in the communities are getting engaged in this process, and what we're hearing is that now these leads are turning into being able to not only get the bad guys, but get their weapons. And hundreds of thousands of pounds of ammunition has been seized because of these tips that we're not getting from our soldiers, but from the people in Iraq. 
   I believe the gentleman from New Mexico wanted to make a comment about that.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. And the gentleman's correct. In fact, the money that was taken out to fund the studying of global warming and intelligence was taken out of some of our more crucial intelligence areas, the intelligence that's used to help our young men and women in the battlefield know where the bad guys are before the bad guys know where they are. So that just doesn't make sense. 
   We're joined by some additional colleagues this evening, and certainly my good friend from Georgia, Congressman Gingrey, he's another Member that's been to Iraq three times. That seems to be the theme tonight. And I'm pleased to yield to the gentleman from Georgia.

   And he brings a point that many of us have had to experience, and that is to make that call of condolence to a mom or a dad or to a wife. 
   And I thought it was interesting, one of the previous speakers talked about being in the majority means you lead. And, in fact, we have gone 107 days without the much-needed resources for our young men and women, and it took the Republicans having to write to the Speaker of the House and saying it is going to be hard for us to go back home and talk about memorializing the sacrifice our young men and women have made in the past when we aren't even funding the troops of today. So we said we are not willing to go back on a recess for Memorial Day without taking care of the business of supporting our troops. 
   And I am hopeful that tomorrow, and certainly before we adjourn, that the Democrats do begin to deliver to our young men and women the resources they need so that when we do go home for this Memorial Day, we can celebrate the sacrifices of the many that have gone before, that we can do it with our heads held high that we have taken care of our part of the business. 
   I am pleased to be joined by a new Member of Congress from Michigan, someone who has a number of military bases in his district, who also has taken a keen interest in the Walter Reed issue and making sure that when our young men and women get injured that they get 21st century care. So I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Michigan, Congressman Walberg.

And I think about one time I went and I was there with a soldier that had gotten a new prosthesis. He had lost part of his leg. And he said he was so proud of it. He said, Congressman, this is state-of-the-art, and I'm going to be able to walk again, and do you know what I want to do? I said, what do you want to do? He said, I want to go back and be with my buddies and finish the job that I went to do. 
   Those are the kind of men and women that I'm going to be celebrating during this Memorial Day weekend. 
   I am proud to see that a great Member of Congress from Iowa, the gentleman from Iowa Mr. King, who I know has been to Iraq on a number of occasions, and I am pleased that he has joined us this evening and would yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's amendment. You know, I think sometimes we get a little crass around here and we think, oh, it's just $1 million, it's just $1.2 million. But the people back in the 19th District of Texas still think that $1.2 million is a lot of money. In fact, it's their hard-earned money that we're debating on the floor of this House tonight. I think sometimes we forget that. 
   One of the things that I am very proud of is the fact that our economy has been growing at a very strong rate for the last few years. We found a novel idea about leaving more of the American taxpayers' money in their pocket, and what happened? The economy started getting better, more jobs. 
   More people today, Mr. Chairman, own a home than any other time in the history of this country. More people working today than any other time in the history of this country. And why is that? Because we're creating jobs. And who are creating those jobs? Businessmen all over this country. 
   And one of the things that concerns me about this budget process that we've gone down, and it's been alluded to tonight, is really what we're talking about tonight is tax increases, because we know that this budget is going to be financed with more taxes.     
   And, quite honestly, the people in the 19th District of Texas believe they are paying enough taxes. In fact, they believe that Congress doesn't have an income problem. It has a spending problem. And it is one that they are looking to our leadership to begin to solve. As was alluded to a while ago, you cannot spend your way out of a deficit. 
   One of the things that concerns me most about this budget process is, we are also going to be asked to vote on things we can't see right now, but we are going to trust somebody. In other words, what we are going to do is, we are going to be asked to vote on these appropriation bills, and then in August the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is going to tell us what we voted on. 
   You know what? The people in the 19th District of Texas voted to send Randy Neugebauer to the United States Congress to review legislation, review appropriations, determine whether they think that that is in their best interest, and vote on it. And they kind of think that it would be a good idea, before I voted on something, that I knew what was in that piece of legislation. But yet we are going to have appropriation bills where we are going to vote on those, and then earmarks are going to be airdropped into those bills and mysteriously are going to be revealed to all of us. 
   Can you imagine being in your home district and the paper calls you up and says, ``I see what you voted on.'' And you say, ``I'm sorry. I haven't read the paper this morning. I haven't seen what I have voted on,'' because the earmarks were not disclosed in the bills that we are considering. Now, I don't know about in your home district, but in my home district that doesn't make a lot of sense. 
   What we need is transparency here. We have a lot of very smart people in Congress, and while the chairman may believe he is a very smart person, and he may be, I don't know, but I believe that I know more about the 19th District and some of the priorities in that community than the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. And the people in the 19th District are relying on Randy Neugebauer to make sure that that interest is represented here. 
   Now, one of the things that we have to begin to do is to do what we said we were going to do. And this group, when they got the leadership, they ran on a platform of we are going to be more transparent, that people are going to get to see all of the spending bill at one time, that they are not going to be in pieces and parts, and there are not going to be deals cut in conference; that when these spending bills are brought to the floor of the House of Representatives, we are going to know what is in those bills. And that should be the way it is. 
   But now, as we get into this process, we find out that, no, that is not the way it is going to be; that we have a new rule, and the new rule is that we will let you know when it is time for you to know. 
   Well, you know what? The people in America think that the time for a United States Congressman to know what is in a bill is not after he has  voted or she has voted on that bill, but while and before they voted on that bill. 
   We said we were going to come down and bring these bills onto the floor. We were going to look at them, peruse them, that we were going to have time to look at them. And we have not kept that promise, and that is a shame. It is a shame that the American taxpayers are getting rooked with this appropriation process.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AS AN INDEPENDENT MILITARY SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my sincerest birthday wishes to an American institution that has helped provide freedom and liberty for all of us that we enjoy today, and that is the Department of Air Force. 
   It was 60 years ago, following the passage of the National Security Act of 1947, that W. Stuart Symington was sworn in as the Nation's first Secretary of the Air Force, chosen to lead an organization finally given its rightful place in the brand new Department of Defense. The Air Force has gone on to become one of the steadfast defenders on high, enabling us to live in relative peace and tranquility knowing that they are always there literally keeping a watchful eye on our Nation. 
   Since its inception, the Department of the Air Force has been a global leader in perfecting and applying cutting-edge research and development. Whether it was the transition from the propeller to jet engines to the use of computer-aided weaponry incorporating satellite technology to today's use of unmanned aerial vehicles taking soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen off the battlefield, the Air Force has always been the leader in the ``Revolution in Military Affairs.'' 
   Whether it's patrolling the desert skies during Operation Northern Watch or deterring looming Iraqi aggression during Operation Vigilant Warrior, both in the 1990s, the men and women of the Air Force are constantly reminded that peace is not always peaceful. 
   Providing a multitude of services to their fellow warriors on the ground, along with dominating the skies against our enemies, they have played a critical role in not only defending America's interests abroad but being ambassadors of goodwill. 
   Just ask the airmen who sit on constant alert in the Central Command ready to deliver relief aid, as they did last summer during the conflict between Lebanon and Israel, delivering more than 10 tons of food and supplies to the region. Foreign citizens and Americans alike were once again blessed by the humanitarian spirit of the Air Force. 
   Today I rise not just as a proud American but as a Member of Congress who is blessed with the good fortune of representing the brave men and women of the 7th Bomb Wing and the mighty C-130 Hercules of the 317th Airlift Group at Dyess Air Force Base. Just last week I met with several of them before they deployed overseas, and I was swept away by their overwhelming courage and resounding spirit. Americans know that when airmen put on their flight suits, they are not just putting it on for themselves but for all Americans. They do it for others and they continue to do it so we can all live freely. 
   In the relatively short time the Air Force has been in existence, its contributions to America's security have been historic. America owes the United States Air Force a debt of gratitude for all that they have given us and will continue to give us, without fear or hesitation. They are always the backbone of our projected forces. 
   I wish them a very happy 60th birthday and best wishes for another successful 60 years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank the chairman. 
   My friend from Arizona and I agree many times on many issues, but this is one on which I must disagree. 
   There has been a lot of discussion about reform in the farm bill. I think before I go down and list some of the reform that is being considered in this current farm bill, I think we have to step back and look at what has transpired with the 2002 farm bill. 
   The 2002 farm bill actually cost $25 billion less than what it was originally projected to cost. Let me repeat that. This is a Federal program that actually came in $25 billion less than what it was budgeted. I would ask my friend from Arizona; name me another mandatory program in the last 5 years that has come in under what was originally projected. 
   Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office projection for what farm policy will cost has imposed for the baseline going forward a $60 billion reduction over what was originally planned in 2002. The reason that that reduction is in place and the reason that this bill came in $25 billion less than what it was projected is because it was working the way it was supposed to.     
   And it was designed when commodity prices were low for there to be a safety net so that we could preserve that farm infrastructure. When the commodity prices are high, then the safety net was not available because there was no need for that safety bill. So when you look at the reform, $60 billion sounds like a lot of reform to me. Now I don't know about out in Arizona, but $60 billion in Texas is a lot of money. 
   Additionally, one of the things, and I think the chairman alluded to this, is that both in the House and the Senate bill, the three-entity rule has been eliminated bringing some transparency; in other words, being able to boil it down, who is actually farming, and making sure that the farm safety net is actually available to those people that are involved, actively engaged in farming. 
   The other thing that is going on here is that with the elimination of that three-entity rule, it is estimated that some 50 percent reduction will be affected, some of the operations that are  currently under this bill. So that is a fairly good reduction when you look at 50 percent for some of those operations. 
   Compared to the House and the Senate version, quite honestly, a $10,000 reduction has been on the table over the original House version. As the chairman mentioned, these discussions are still under way and we don't know what that final number is going to be. 
   The other thing, and the chairman also alluded to this, because there has been a lot of discussion about are these payments going to millionaire farmers. And so one of the things that we have taken is steps to materially reduce the adjusted gross income figure, some 70 percent reduction. 
   Now I think the point that the chairman was trying to make, and it is a very important point, 30, 40, years ago farmers across America could farm a small piece of land and make a good living. Today, in a global economy where they are competing with producers all over the world, what they are faced with is, how do they get to a size that makes sense with today's cost of production and with today's cost of tractors and all the equipment necessary. And the days of a small farm being able to support a family are gone. So today, many farmers in my district, for example, are farming 3,000 and 4,000 and 5,000 acres, and this is still a family farm. This is not a company that has a lot of employees; this is a family farm. And so when you look at those numbers, it takes a lot of money, it takes a lot of capital and investment for them to produce this many acres. 
   Farmers are taking a big risk today. Yes, the commodity prices are up, and that is a good thing for farmers and producers. The bad news for them, though, is that their costs are up as well. Looking across fuel and fertilizer and all of those, in just the last few years production costs for commodities is up almost 25 percent. 
   One of the things that, as we look at this farm bill, I think we have to step back and look at it and I think sometimes I get kind of amused. As we talk about this farm bill, only about 12 percent, Mr. Speaker, 12 percent of this farm bill actually has anything to do with production of agriculture. A good portion of this farm bill has to do with food stamps and nutrition programs and conservation programs. While those may be worthy, I am not here to debate those, when we look at the production of the agriculture part, the part that actually allows American agriculture to produce food and fiber for Americans, we are talking about 12 percent of this bill having anything to do with that. 
   So when you step back, why is that important to America? Why should America be concerned about having a good, strong agricultural industry in this country? Well, I will tell you why, Mr. Speaker. Right now, we are watching with amazement as we look at people, Americans across America having to pay $3.50 a gallon for gasoline. We have seen tremendous increases. This country today is energy dependent. That means that we wake up every morning looking for some other country to furnish the energy that it takes to run our country's economy. It is, quite honestly, a security risk to our country as well as an economic security risk to our country. And so how did we get in that situation is because we let America's infrastructure for producing energy fall to the wayside. We did not make it a priority. 
   My greatest fear here today is that, as we move forward, if we begin to undermine American agriculture, who will then feed and clothe Americans in the future? Do the American people want to wake up every morning and wonder where we are going to get our next meal? What country is going to feed us?

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Because we let American agriculture infrastructure fall to the wayside. Our producers are competing on an unlevel playing field. I wish the playing field was level. If the playing field was level, we wouldn't need any of these programs, because American producers can compete with anybody in the world on a level playing field. 
   Unfortunately, the WTO discussions that we have been involved in have not yielded much fruit. Many countries that our producers are competing with all across the world are competing against other countries that provide subsidies at a much greater level than we are providing under this underlying bill. 
   So while I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona's concern about being fiscally responsible, I understand that he would like to see some reforms. I am here tonight to tell him that there are a lot of reforms in this bill. But at the same time, it is important to have a balanced bill to make sure that we have a strong agricultural economy in this country from this point forward so that when Americans wake up every morning, they are not going to worry about who is going to feed or clothe them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of ethical, moral, and effective stem cell research. This debate is not whether embryonic stem cell research is permitted. It already is. This debate is not about whether the Federal Government should fund embryonic stem cell research. It already does. What I do believe is that embryonic stem cell research crosses ethical boundaries, and that is the bigger question today. But given the track record of stem cell research, where should we focus taxpayers' dollars today? 
   Now, this is bowl season in America, championship season. So we go to the scoreboard to see where we are with stem cell research in this country today, and the score is very clear. Adult stem cell research, there are 72 clinical applications currently available today and more being developed. Where are we with embryonic stem cell research today? We are at zero. So the score today is 72-0. 
   So you can talk about the ethical and the moral issues, and certainly I stand on the side of life. But when we start talking about one of the other stewardships that this body has, it is what is our responsibility to the taxpayers with the limited amount of dollars that we have for research in this country today. Certainly one of the things that we should be looking at is results, a novel thing for Congress sometimes to look at. 
   I come from the private sector recently to Congress. We didn't invest our money in things that were losers. One of the things we know today is that currently embryonic stem cell research is not yielding any clinical applications that we can use in an effective way. 
   So doesn't it make sense that as we sit down and allocate our resources, look at our research patterns as we move forward, we ought to be investing our money where we are getting results? Certainly there are a lot of people who will get up and talk and make emotional appeals. I am not insensitive to that. 
   There are a lot of people that have huge issues going on today in their lives. One of the things we want to do is make sure that we are applying Federal resources in a way that we can actually benefit from them and not talk about the politics. 
   So if you want to vote for effective stem cell research in this country today, you are going to want to vote against H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I've spent nearly three decades in the housing business. And over those three decades the housing market has gone up and the housing market has had its soft moments, and one of the soft moments we're experiencing today. I liken it to the fact that the housing market has a cold. And when you go to the doctor and you talk to the doctor about a cold, what does he usually tell you? He says, you know, you're going to have to let it run its course. And quite honestly, over the years as these housing downturns have happened, that exactly what we've had to do is let these markets run their course. And what we do know is that when they run their course, that they come back a lot stronger. 
   We have just come off an unprecedented run in housing where the rise in home ownership has risen to record levels. And how did we do that? Well, we did it with the marketplace. 
   One of the things about this bill that bothers me is that we leave people with the understanding that if their house goes down, the government will come in and make up the difference. We can't do that. People buy stocks, people buy bonds, people buy other assets. They go up, they go down. But it's not the role of the Federal Government to create a profit opportunity for people. 
   One of the things that we know is that, as the ranking member, I think, pointed out, is that we have 110 million people that are already meeting their own housing needs. Some of them are having problems, yes, they are, and we're sorry about that. We know about 51 million people in America have mortgages. And a lot of those folks are taking second jobs and doing things to make sure that they meet their rental payments and meet their housing payments. And you look at the fact that 94, 95 percent of those people are making those payments, not only are they making them in full, but they're making them on time. 
   What we can't let the Federal Government be is the piggy bank when things don't go exactly the way we planned. I would like to go back over my 30 years in the real estate business and wish the Federal Government could have been my piggy bank when I bought property that didn't go in the right direction. Some of it went down, some of it went up. But what I do know is that it is important that the Federal Government not get into the business of trying to manipulate markets. 
   Markets are very efficient. In fact, they're a lot more powerful than the Federal Government. I know everybody here feels like they may be a powerful person and part of a powerful government, but quite honestly, these free markets are much more powerful than the Federal Government and they're much more efficient and they're much better able to deliver a housing market that the American people can sustain and count on. 
   And so that's one of the reasons that I rise in opposition to this bill today is, as I look across America--and I wish you could have been at a town hall meeting with me the other day where people weren't asking about mortgages, Mr. Speaker, they were asking when is this Congress going to finally do something about getting a comprehensive energy strategy for America? When are we going to open up the ability to drill in these other areas? And when are we going to be able to come up with more nuclear power plants? 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people don't want to make their neighbor's payment when they're having a hard time making their own.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. I  think we have had a good discussion here today. Unfortunately, it was a discussion only and there was not opportunity for our side, or really any other Members to participate in this process of offering amendments that could have most likely made this a better piece of legislation. 
   There are several reasons I oppose this bill. Number one is the flawed process. In my tenure in Congress, I have never had a major piece of legislation like this where I am not even going to get an opportunity to cast my vote. I know people who are watching this process are wondering, you mean we have been talking all day about this important piece of legislation that the other side says is very important to the American people, yet their Member of Congress is not going to get a vote on this process. It is a flawed process. 
   We brought an energy bill over, stripped all of the energy provisions out of it, and we are putting housing into an energy bill. I still don't understand the mechanics of that, and maybe someone later on can explain that to me. 
   This is also about not saddling the American people who are already struggling to make their own house payments, to make their own rental payments, to pay the highest gasoline prices in the history of this country, and the highest electricity costs and natural gas costs, it is about saddling them now with the payments for their neighbor. 
   What the 110 million people who are doing the best they can and want the United States Congress to do is to leave them alone and really start addressing the major issues that are important to the American people.     
   It's about not rewarding bad behavior. We have some lenders, and we have some borrowers that went out and bet that the housing market was going to go up. It didn't go up, and, in fact, unfortunately, in some places, it went down. And now people are faced with a negative equity or a smaller equity in their home. And we are sympathetic to that. 
   As I said earlier, I've been in the real estate business for a very long time. I've seen the markets go up. I've seen the markets go down. And sometimes it causes a situation where people don't have as much equity. 
   But what you have to understand is a lot of people went into this process with no equity. And now this bill says, you know what? We've got a deal for you, because now we're going to help create equity in your house by putting your neighbors at risk. 
   This is a bad bill. I encourage Members to vote against this bill. I'm sorry. We can't vote against it. Vote against the amendments.

   I've been to the gentleman from Louisiana's and to the gentleman from Mississippi's district. I have seen the recovery efforts down there, obviously a lot of devastation in those States, and a rebuilding program is going on. Quite honestly, I have to compliment the gentleman from Mississippi. They are doing a much better job of moving forward with their rebuilding program. 
   But one of the things that we need to understand is these natural disasters affect all Americans, and that when we begin to ask this Congress to pass out resources to help people in America rebuild their lives, that we don't do it along State lines. 
   And I agree with the gentleman, and I encourage everyone to support the gentleman's amendment. I think it is a very fair amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, this is a pretty simple amendment. We have had a lot of debate this evening about whether to have a housing fund or not to have a housing fund, and the votes are in and we are going to have a housing fund. 
   One of the things that I feel very strongly about is this is a substantial amount of money to any entity. While these are large entities, $520 million, over $3 billion over a 5-year period, is a lot of money. If we are going to ask these entities to make this kind of commitment, I think we owe them some certainty here. 
   Now, the current formula is that we will take 1.2 basis points times the portfolio. But what I believe is fair is to set a ceiling on what that amount can be. Now, the current scoring by is that at 1.2 on the total portfolio that we would have about $520 million. What I am saying is let's cap it at $520 million. 
   When you start looking at an entity, you don't want them making a decision on whether to make additional loans available for people in America that need loans, affordable loans, of saying if we increase our portfolio, we are going to have to pay more money into the housing fund. So what I believe is a fair balance is saying that as they bring their portfolio up and down to meet the market demands and adjust to the market conditions that we just give them a number that they know that is not going to exceed so what when they are budgeting, making sure that they are going to have a safe and sound entity, that they know what the number is. 
   I am a small businessman, Mr. Chairman, and when I was sitting down every year, I made a budget for my business. And one of the things that we tried to do was to fix a lot of our costs so that we would know what our costs would be because variable costs many times are causing you not to be able to control those or they are counter to being profitable in many cases. These are entities that have provided housing opportunities for Americans for many, many years. And I was in the real estate business and the home building business in the 1980s, and I will tell you if it was not for Fannie Mae and Mae and the Federal Home Loan Bank board buying mortgages in America, many people would not have been able to buy a house during that time because a lot of the players got out of the market. 
   So, number one, the original purpose of this legislation was safety and soundness. That is how this debate got started. So if we are really concerned about the safety and soundness of it we have come up with a number here, and it is a big number. This is a lot of money. When I came to Washington, I was a little surprised. People use a billion around here like it is not a lot of money. But everybody in this room should understand what $1 billion is. If you and I started a business the day that Jesus Christ was born and that business lost $1 million not every week, not every year, but that business lost $1 million every day since the birth of Christ, we wouldn't have yet lost $1 billion. So we are talking about a large sum of money. That may not be large to people in Washington, but let me tell you to people in West Texas it is a lot of money. 
   So if we are going to ask a company to make that kind of contribution to a housing fund, I think we owe them some certainty. And I believe that $520 million a year is a certain number. It is a big number. It a accomplishes a lot of the things that the other side, I think, wants to do with this fund. So whether you agree with the fund or not agree with the fund, I don't see how you can disagree with the opportunity to come up with a fair compromise for these entities to say that we are going to cap this contribution requirement at this level. 
   As I mentioned, and it was somewhat turned around in our committee meeting when I offered this, when I sit down and make a commitment to a charity, they say to me sometimes we want you to make a multi-year commitment. Now, I don't always make that multi-year commitment based on whether I am going to make money that year or lose money that year. I make a commitment and I stick to it. But I always make a commitment that I think I can live up to. 
   So it is important for several reasons: That, number one, that we give some certainty; and, number two, that we make sure that when these contributions are asked for that the regulator is given some ability to be able to say we think in this particular year, because of the market conditions, because of the profitability of this company, that that may be less. 
   So I encourage Members on both sides let's give some certainty.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank the gentleman, and I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the Housing Committee. I enjoy serving with her. 
   You know, I think one of the points I would make here is my bill does not try to kill the Housing Fund. My bill tries to say that, you know what? We're asking these entities to step up and make a big contribution, and we want to make sure that they do it in a safe and sound manner. 
   You know, I will tell you, the problem here is that if these entities, if we do something that jeopardizes the health of these entities by taking money out of their capital structure, these entities will not be able to perform the functions that they have been performing in the marketplace. And so what this is, I believe, is a realistic approach at looking at how we begin to go down this road. 
   Now, even the majority has put a sunset in this bill, a 5-year sunset I believe, if I am correct. What that allows us to do is we are going to see, you know, $520 million roughly over a 5-year period, we are going to see what happens to how does that Housing Fund perform, how does that impact the entity that is paying these monies? If we want to come back at the end of 5 years and you want to raise the cap, let's look at the cap. But let's also let the regulator look at the cap during that process and make sure that we're not doing something that is causing harm. 
   The worst thing we can do for the housing market in this country is to disrupt one of the envies of the world, and that is our financial structure, how we finance housing in this country. 
   When I was in the home building industry, I was on the National Board of Directors of Home Builders, people from all over the world wanted to come and say how is it that America has such a high ownership rate and such a robust financial market for housing. They wanted to know how to copy ours. So we need to preserve that and not sit around and figure out ways to necessarily harm it. 
   So I encourage Members to support this. This is a fair proposition. This is not killing anything. This is a fair proposition. It's saying that we believe that how we got to the ownership rate that we have in America today is by protecting the companies and the entities and the financial structure that allowed us to get here, and not by trying to somehow cause it harm. 
   In closing, I want to say this to Chairman Frank and to the ranking member, this has been a very deliberative process. And Mr. Frank, in our full committee, allowed us the opportunity to offer as many amendments as we would like to. We had a lot of dialogue there. We've had a lot of dialogue here tonight, and maybe some of it has been duplicative. But I think the good thing about it is that we have aired all of the concerns that people have about this. Because this is a very important piece of legislation. It has a tremendous amount of impact on the future of the financial markets in America. And so if it takes 1 day or it takes 2 days, and if it takes 20 amendments or 100 amendments to get to the right place, then I think that is a good process. But I want to thank the chairman for allowing us to get to this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight to make a clarifying amendment on this bill. One of the things that this bill does is it clarifies the amendment to ensure that the portfolio standard be based solely on the safety and soundness to the enterprises and not any of the broader systemic concerns. 
   We have the financial housing industry financing model of the world. Because of the model we have in place today, America enjoys one of the highest home ownership rates in the history of this country. More people own a home today than at any time in the history of this country. Primarily a lot of that housing affordability and the ability for Americans has been because of our tremendous secondary market, the ability to provide home mortgages for Americans all over this country.  
   This legislation clarifies that when the regulator looks at regulating this entity, that he looks at the safety and soundness of that entity and not external factors. Just like when we regulate banks, we set certain standards for their capital, for their loan ratios and all of those other factors, and we should not look at this entity any different than we look at other entities. So really this is a clarifying amendment. It just says we are going to look at the safety and soundness of how this company is running their business. 
   We shouldn't put things out there that the regulator is not able to, quite honestly, articulate, because what is a systemic risk? That becomes a point of order that sometimes the regulator cannot explain what exactly the systemic risk is they believe it is. It is a way to limit their portfolios. 
   I want to thank Ms. Bean of Illinois and Mr. Moore of Kansas and Mr. Miller of California for joining me in clarifying the importance of making sure that as we put together a first class world regulator for these very important entities to the American home ownership, that we do not put in place things that would inhibit the ability of these entities to be able to deliver the quality mortgage products that they have delivered to the country over these years. 
   So I think this is a very clear amendment. It clarifies the language and makes sure we don't have any question about what the intent of the regulator is and what the duty of the regulator is. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3067, the Small Public Housing Authority Act. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I represent a rural district where most of the public housing authorities operate in small communities. In fact, many of the PHAs in my district administer fewer than 200 housing units and some even have part-time directors or directors who split their time between public housing authorities. For many of those small public housing authorities, excessive paperwork requirements and outdated regulatory burdens continue to create an unnecessary distraction from their important work of providing affordable housing for underprivileged families. 
   For example, the 1992 Public Housing Reform Act requires PHAs to submit both a 5-year and an annual plan to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. While the annual plans were designed to address changes to the 5-year plan, small PHAs are already required by law to submit any policy changes, as the gentleman from Massachusetts said, to HUD for review and approval. This yearly report of unchanged plans and policy amounts to an unnecessary Federal mandate. While HUD has taken regulatory steps to streamline this annual reporting for small PHAs that are performing well, a recent example of one of the streamlined plans was 47 pages with attachments. So small public housing authorities just do not have the time and the staff and the resources to complete these annual plans by themselves and in many cases have to use outside vendors or contractors, expensive consultants to do the work that they don't have the computer software to do themselves to complete these annual plans. 
   For this reason, I have introduced H.R. 3067, the Small Public Housing Act. This legislation would bring long-needed regulatory relief to our small PHAs by exempting those that are 250 fewer units and section 8 vouchers from continuing the requirement of an annual plan if there is no material change in the operations during that year. So if they have some material change they still have to do it, but if it is just business as usual, then they do not have to make that submission. They still have to submit their 5-year plan, as is required by law. 
   H.R. 3067 only addresses, as I said, the annual plans. This legislation will provide an opportunity where they don't have to spend their much-needed resources and time away from doing what they need to be doing, and that is helping to provide affordable housing for our most needy folks. 
   I would just want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his interest in public housing. This bill passed overwhelmingly in the previous Congress. Unfortunately, the time ran out, and we did not get that done from the other body. As a matter of fact, it passed 387-2; so I think there is broad support for this. I appreciate Chairwoman Waters' Housing Subcommittee as well as Ranking Member Biggert and, of course, Ranking Member Bachus for their support for this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I do not oppose this amendment. I think some of us had a concern early on that converting any of these monies to operating monies was a precedent we didn't want to move down. I think the purpose of the bill is to build housing. Although I believe this does help some of our very low income families, we would hope that they would not have to use any of that allocation for that. But this amendment does give them the flexibility to do that, and so we will support this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I was really tempted here to let the chairman be my designee on this, with the hopes that I would have the same success on my amendment as he had on those that he was acting as designee on, but since I'm here, I'll act in my own behalf. 
   Mr. Chairman, one of the things we've heard a lot today about is that there is a need for making sure that we are taking care of our most neediest Americans when it comes to their housing needs. What we've also learned, though, is that there are a lot of programs out there, 70 something housing programs, 30 some odd that may be addressed as some form of housing for our low-income citizens. 
   One of the things that I think the American people are kind of concerned about is they keep hearing that government solution to all of the problems. If we're not doing a good job with the programs we have, let's add another program, and I think they're getting kind of tired of that. So one of the things that my amendment does is it makes an existing program, it incorporates many of the good ideas, and may I say, Mr. Chairman, there are some good ideas that have come in this particular piece of legislation, updating it. And what I'm talking about is the HOME program. The HOME program currently does a lot of the functions. In fact, when you look at the HOME program in this bill, many of those overlap. And yet we're now going to separate into two different funds an affordable housing fund and a HOME program. Instead of using the combined resources of those two programs to help further the housing situation, we're going to have two different.  
   When we talk about the fact that we're already spending over $28 billion for affordable housing, low-income housing, and then we're going to take money out of one pocket and put it over to an area separate from that, quite honestly, Congress will not have the opportunity to really sit down and assess, hey, where are the American people, where are the people that are the recipients of low-income money, the people who are benefiting from this housing, where are we getting the best bang for our buck? But instead, we are separating those programs. I don't think that is good policy. 
   The other issue here is that many communities, almost every State in the Union, and I think like 350 or 360, maybe it's a larger number, I don't have it in front of me, communities are already participating in the HOME program, they already have some familiarity with that program. And so now we're going to take the ramp-up time of having to learn a new program, to write the rules for it, to do all of the things that it takes to get a new program off the ground. We're going to have to form a new branch of government within the Department of Housing to be able to ramp up and have the employees that it needs to do this, another inefficiency of adding additional programs to something that maybe we're not satisfied with. And I would agree, there may be some things that need to happen in the HOME program that would make it more relevant today. But, quite honestly, adding a new program I don't think is in the best interest of the American people. It's not a good, wise use of their taxpayer dollars. And I believe we can create a more efficient delivery system using an existing program. 
   What my amendment also does is says, look, GAO, go in and analyze what's going on, work with the various housing partnerships, let's determine some of the things that we need to do to the HOME program. Let's make those changes, and then let's make the HOME program a better program incorporating many of the good ideas, even that we've seen in some of the amendments here. 
   Mr. Chairman, we had, I believe, seven amendments from the Democratic side, unfortunately, and I appreciate the Rules Committee making mine in order, but I think we had some other good ideas from some of my colleagues on my side of the aisle that we could have incorporated into this legislation. 
   So that's the reason I'm down on the floor today offering this amendment. I'm encouraging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you're really serious about two or three things, and let's talk about those things; one, are you interested in making sure that we have the most efficient delivery system to our low-income families to make sure that they have housing? If you're interested in that. Secondly, if you want to do that in a way that's a good steward of the American taxpayer's dollars, that's another reason to vote for this amendment. And thirdly, if you believe that we ought to be able to prioritize our spending and not separate into a different fund, separate and aside from what we're already doing for a lot of our low-income housing families, then the Neugebauer amendment is the amendment that you should vote on. It will actually move us more quickly in a direction of being able to implement a lot of the things that I think people on both sides of the aisle want to do, and that is, make sure that we get the money out to these families that need our assistance and help. 
   And with that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I just want to close by saying that 50 States, 585 local communities, are already using the HOME program as a model for building and developing low-income housing in their communities. It just makes sense that we take an existing program, make the revisions that have really made, there are some good ideas that have come through this legislation, let's incorporate those ideas into the HOME program. Let's take an existing vehicle. Let's ask the United States Congress to prioritize where they think that we are getting the most bang for our bucks as we deliver low-income housing programs for the American people and for the people that need them so badly. Let's do it right. The right way to do it is to take this existing program and fold into it many of the good ideas that have come from that.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, this is a very straightforward amendment. Two important issues are going on in our country right now. One of those we are talking about on the floor of the House today, and that is Americans' safety in the air, making sure when our American citizens travel across the country they are doing it in a safe way. 
   The other issue that is important to the United States Congress and to the American people is energy. One of the things that we know today is wind energy, a renewable source of energy, is  becoming a predominant piece of the solution for the future. 
   Several months ago I convened in Abilene, Texas, at Dyess Air Force Base, members of Department of Defense, Department of Energy, FAA and other agencies talking about how in the future, as we develop more renewable sources, particularly wind energy, how we make sure that there is a compatibility between air safety and providing energy for the American people. 
   What we decided was that there needs to be a repository, a place where data is maintained on the effects of certain kinds of wind turbines on radar, where the proper placement is so they can continue to be a vital part of our energy supply, while at the same time making sure the American people are safe. 
   This amendment provides for a study to study all of the components that need to go into that database and that repository to make sure that we have all of the bases covered. This is kind of a proactive step. What we are intending to do here, as people are planning these kinds of projects, there is a place where people can go where they can get the information up front rather than in hindsight after that project has moved along. 
   There is a lot of support for this amendment from the Department of Energy, Department of Defense and other agencies thinking this is the right step.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Virginia for not only the time, but for his leadership, as well as the chairman, Mr. Peterson, on this important farm bill. 
   I heard some of my colleagues say this is not a good farm bill. But, do you know what? Seventy-five percent of our colleagues here in the House thought this was a good farm bill. Eighty-five percent of the Members in the Senate thought this was a good farm bill. And do you know why they thought it was a good farm bill? It is because they understand how important American agriculture is to our country.  
   One of the things that we were listening to today, oil prices again set another record price today. Why? Because there is not enough oil to meet the demand for our country. There is a mentality going around here that maybe if we just don't produce things, things will just show up. But if we are going to eat feed and clothe America, we have to produce something. If you are going to get something, you have to produce something. 
   So what this farm bill does is it allows American agriculture to continue to do what it has been doing for hundreds of years, and that is produce the highest quality, the most affordable food and fiber in the world. It is the reason today demand for a lot of American agricultural products are at an all-time high. With the cheap dollar, you can buy the best for a lot less. 
   What is important here is that we have a future for American agriculture, because we don't want to be in the same shape we are today. We had to wake up today and figure out who is going to supply energy for America. The American people don't want us to have to wake up tomorrow and say who will feed us, who will clothe us, because we have let American agriculture die in America. 
   So this bill, the reason I support it and why I encourage my colleagues to override this presidential veto, is because it is a good bill. Yes, it is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill. A lot of bipartisan work and bicameral work was done to bring this product to the floor, and that is the reason it is important now that we do what American agriculture has been waiting several months for us to do, is finally put in place permanent policy for American agriculture. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1676, the Native American Home Ownership Opportunity Act of 2007, introduced by Congressman Boren and Congressman Renzi. 
   This important legislation authorizes section 184 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, which established a loan guarantee program for Native American families, Indian Housing Authorities and federally recognized Native American tribes. 
   Under current law this program is authorized through 2007. This bill will reauthorize the program through 2012. 
   Congress established this program to provide access to private mortgage financing for Native American families, Indian Housing Authorities and federally recognized Native American tribes that could not otherwise acquire housing financing because of the unique legal status of Native American lands. 
   This loan guarantee under this program is used to construct, acquire, refinance or rehabilitate single-family housing located on trust land or land located in an Indian or an Alaska native area. 
   Section 184 of the program guarantees single family, one- to four-family units, residential loans for homes located in these Indian and Alaska native areas where land may be tribal trust, allotted individual trust or fee simple. HUD offers 100 percent guarantee on the outstanding principal and interest and payment of necessary and allowable expenses. 
   The flexible underwriting, low down payment, higher loan limits, low guarantee fee and the absence of income limits make this the most affordable loan program available in tribal areas. 
   In 2007, about $6 million was appropriated for the loan guarantee program. Consequently, CBO has estimated that H.R. 1675 will cost about $30 million over the 2008-2012 period if appropriators continue the funding at the level similar to previous years. Enacting this bill does not affect direct spending or revenues. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation was approved by the Committee on Financial Services by voice vote, and I urge the passage of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1675, the Preservation Approval Process Improvement Act of 2007, introduced by Representative MELISSA BEAN, Financial Institution Subcommittee Ranking Member Paul Gillmor, and Full Committee Chairman BARNEY FRANK.  
   1675 addresses problems with HUD's processing of previous participation certificate or HUD's form 2530 under HUD's automated partners performances system. 
   Specifically, this legislation suspends the electronic filing requirement for the previous participation certificates and the filing requirements of these certificates for certain low-income housing investors. Form 2530 has been used for many years to ascertain the prior record of participants in certain HUD programs. This enabled HUD to refuse to do business with participants who have not previously carried out their obligations. However, passive investor disclosure requirements have created problems for private individuals and groups who wish to participate in the construction and preservation of affordable housing through the low-income housing tax credit program. 
   The 2530 process is designed to review principals, including any limited partner, with a 25 percent or greater interest in property. These rules were developed long before low-income housing tax credit programs were actually created. Low-income housing tax credit deals with the typical investors or institutions, that is, publicly traded and regulated national and multi-national financial institutions, including government sponsored enterprises whose reputation is well established. 
   Under the 2530 process, officers, directors, and stockholders with 10 percent or greater holdings are required to submit their names, Social Security numbers, as well as their individual and prior record with HUD. Industry groups have objected to these disclosure requirements as they are passive investor partners and are not involved in the construction, maintenance, and operation of the property. They claim that these reporting requirements are costly, time intensive, and deter investment in affordable housing. Investors developers, syndicators, and others have contacted HUD to ask that passive investors be exempted from filing with HUD. 
   In December 2005, former Chairman Oxley requested that HUD extend the opportunity for paper filing, and asked HUD to explain why passive investors should be required to file. HUD allowed the paper filing until June 30, 2006. In December 2006, after repeated inquiries from the Financial Services Committee and requests from interested parties to provide relief, HUD sent the committee a proposal that, according to the industry, made filing more burdensome in many respects. 
   On December 21, 2006, noting that HUD's applications for 2530 filing requirements have become broad and overreaching and, in some cases, unnecessarily delayed or even prevented HUD transactions that were beneficial to people in need of housing, Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, Chairman Waters, and Chairman Oxley asked HUD to discuss the matter further with interested parties before taking any action on the proposed rule. Since then, however, HUD has not taken any overt action to amend the proposal. 
   H.R. 1675, the Preservation Approval Process Improvement Act of 2007, requires that HUD take action to alleviate the concerns mentioned above in order to encourage private sector participation in affordable housing programs. 
   HUD's current 2530 previous participation review process is intended as a risk assessment tool, but in many ways has been a barrier with housing preservation because the current regulations in the accompanying electronic system that process 2530 submissions do not reflect the complexity of today's real estate transactions. The reporting requirements are unduly burdensome and offer no additional benefit to HUD. 
   To this end, H.R. 1675 requires that HUD suspend mandatory previous participation filings through the APPS computer program, and that it allow paper filing until HUD submits to Congress a revised draft that would eliminate unnecessary filing burdens. 
   In addition, this legislation eliminates the requirement to file a 2530 form for passive investors who expect to own entities that are allowed or expected to be allowed in low-income housing tax credits. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, this week the House will once again take up an Iraq emergency funding bill which is seriously flawed and should be rejected. 
   Having 535 politicians attempt to micromanage the war on terror from atop Capitol Hill is a recipe for disaster. This Congress should not be telegraphing our war strategy to the enemy and setting arbitrary timetables for withdrawal, nor should we be tying the hands of our Commander in Chief and military leaders on the ground. 
   Iraq has become a central battlefield on the war on terror, not because we say so, but because the terrorists themselves have declared Iraq to be the central front for their global jihad. Therefore, it is vital that we win the war and achieve success in Iraq. To do so, this Congress must reject efforts to micromanage the war and give the Iraqi new strategy opportunity to succeed.

   As a conferee, I participated in many hours of bipartisan and bicameral negotiations at which point we reached a bill that will be good for American agriculture, and it will be good for the American consumer. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is important that we have a strong agricultural industry in this country today. We've already seen the implications of having other countries furnish our energy needs on a daily basis, and the last thing in the world that we need to happen is to rely on other countries to feed and clothe the American people. 
   That's the reason, Mr. Speaker, it is so important that we get this important piece of legislation passed, sooner rather than later. Many producers all across America, farmers and ranchers, have already planted crops, and they do not have any policy to operate under. 
   And so I urge my colleagues, when this bill comes to the floor this week, to vote positively for American agriculture and the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Well, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and just like him, I haven't been in the State legislature. I have been a small businessman all of my life. 
   What we know about small businesses is that they are the number one job creator in America. As we heard the gentleman say awhile ago, over nearly 7 million new jobs have been created in this country in the last 3 1/2 years. Quite honestly, most of that has been from small businesses all across this country. 
   One of the things that a lot of people don't know that have not had their own business is that small businesses are also big taxpayers. What they do not also realize is that in some cases we ask our small businesses to pay more taxes than we do other folks. That is because our small business people, in addition to income tax, have to pay self-employment tax. 
   The way you build a business in America is that you do it by taking money that you are making and reinvesting it in your business, and that is the way you grow your business. It is these growing businesses in America that have been growing America. 
   When I first got in the home building business, I had a young man who was a plumbing contractor, and he too was starting his new business. And he was starting it with basically one truck  and a helper. So when we started together, I had a small building business and he had a small plumbing company. What I watched my friend Bobby do over the years is build his business one truck at a time. He would work hard and pretty soon he had built up his business and he had to go buy another truck. You know what happens when a plumbing company buys another truck? They have to hire what? More people. And pretty soon he worked hard and he had to buy another truck. And you know what happened when he bought another truck? He had to hire more people. 
   But Bobby couldn't have bought those trucks if he hadn't been building his business, having money and capital in his business to be able to go to his banker and say, you know, I am building a business here and I have equity in my business. But what happens is the American Government says, oh, Mr. Small Businessman, you are making money, so we are going to reach in there and in some cases take half of that small business's money. So that causes the business to grow at half the rate as it could if it wasn't paying exorbitant taxes. 
   I would say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, as you know, it is not just Big Government taxing, but it is the regulation that also our small businesses all across the country are worried about. When you add onto small businesses not only the carrying of a tax burden, but all of the burdens of regulation that we put on these small businesses, and on top of that you put a lawsuit environment in this country that on any given day a small businessman can lose his business, I say to my friend that small businesses are about to be entered onto the Endangered Species List.     
   Because, quite honestly, we have policy in this country that is not friendly to small businesses, the very businesses, the very people that have built this great Nation. And so when I hear folks on the other side of the aisle talk about we have a plan, well, I hope that plan is not to continue the trend that they have done in the past, and that is taxing small businesses out of existence. And you get a little nervous when they change the rules in this House that, as the gentleman said a while ago, that instead of taking three-fifths of this body, it only takes a simple majority to increase taxes. 
   Now, I do applaud our friends, the Blue Dogs, for one of the things that they said tonight, and that is that we do need to do something about deficit spending in this country. And I am ready to join across the aisle with my friends and say, let's do that by addressing spending. 
   If you really want to do good things for America in the future, you don't do it by taxing our small businesses out of existence. You do it by making America a more fiscally sound country. You ask the American Government to do the same thing that these small businesses do. They are not able to, whenever they need more money, to go get it from somebody else by just reaching in. You don't go to a customer after you finish the job and say, ``you know, what, I told you it was going to be one price, but I am going to charge you another price.'' You don't keep your business very long. So I want to join our friends to do that. But I do not want to join our friends on a path of taxing because I would tell you, in 2003, the unemployment rate in America was 6.1 percent. Today it is 4.5 percent. More people are employed today in America than any other time in the history of this Nation. More people own homes today than any other time in the history of this Nation. This is a prosperous time. And we got here by leaving the decision on how people spend their money to the people who make the money and not big government. Big government doesn't grow America. Americans grow America. 
   I thank the gentleman for having this time tonight, and I look forward to continued dialogue with my colleagues as we really talk about making sure that our American businesses don't end up on the endangered species list.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (TAX INCREASES -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is correct. I think one of the concerns I have about the death tax is, in many cases, it has the potential to rob some of the smaller communities in America from some of the mainstays in their community. I think about the farmer who worked for 20, 30, 40 years putting together pieces of land, making his operation a little bit larger so that he can compete today in a global economy and wants his son, our sons to be a part of that business in the future. But as the gentleman, my good friend Mr. Conaway, my neighbor to the south, said: Depending on what day he dies, he may not have any land to leave his sons, or they may have a new partner. 
   I do a number of town hall meetings as I travel through out my district. I have a very large district, 29,000 square miles, 27 counties. And one evening I was talking to a group of citizens in a little small community, and after that was over, I had a young woman come up to me and say, ``You know, Congressman, we have had this ranch in our family for nearly 100 years, and recently my father passed away, and we are faced with the fact that we may have to sell a part of this ranch to keep some of it.'' And I think about a small auto dealership that the founder of that built up over the years, worked hard, paid taxes already. 
   I think the egregious thing about this death tax is we have been talking about the taxes that have been imposed on these small businesses over the years, and they work hard and in spite of paying all those taxes, property taxes, income taxes, employment taxes, then at the end, we say, ``You did such a great job of building that business, we are going to tax it one more time.'' And in many cases, it has the potential to put those businesses out of business and take away in some cases a fairly major employer in that community. 
   So I think one of the things that we have been kind of saying tonight, and my colleagues, is that we are at a crossroads here, and we have some very important decisions to make on behalf of the American people here for the next few years, and I am concerned, as many of you are, that some of these businesses, if we don't act in a way to be friendlier to small business, keeping many of these tax cuts permanent, and if we don't look at permanently eliminating the death tax, that again we could really penalize these small businesses.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. The gentleman makes a great point. Not only does, in many cases, it affect the families that own that property, but in many cases, let's say you have got a heating and air conditioning business here that employs 50, 60 people. And all of a sudden the founder passes away, and the next day the family has to come and say to these employees, ``I don't know whether we are going to be able to continue this business or not because we are going to have to borrow a bunch of money to pay the taxes.'' And in many cases, putting a bunch of debt on a new business or even an existing business requires servicing that debt and has an impact. And so then it is a ripple effect because that tax base that has been in that community for a number of years is in jeopardy, and the commitment and the contribution that that small business has made to that community sometimes disappears. 
   I think the fact that we said earlier, and I think all of us said, that America was built by these small businesses, small ranchers, doctors, entrepreneurs all across this country, we built this country that way, but we have the danger of tearing it down with a poor taxing policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to this legislation, not because of the spirit of compromise and bipartisanship that was used to come to this conclusion, but because of a philosophical difference. I believe that when markets have their ups and downs that it is better for the Federal Government not to try to intervene in those market cycles, so I think it is better to have better information than to have regulation when it comes to the issue of subprime mortgages. 
   I have a little bit of experience in the mortgage business in that I was a mortgage originator. I was a homebuilder. I have sold and bought loans in the secondary market and I have owned a home and borrowed money on many mortgages. What I know is the system has worked, and we have record homeownership here in America today because we have had one of the most efficient mortgage markets in the world. 
   But what I do know is an important part of that transaction is that everybody in the transaction understands what the nature of the transaction is. 
   That is the reason I worked in a bipartisan way with the chairman and ranking member, along with my colleagues Mr. Green and Mr. McHenry, to make sure that we had a better disclosure piece of information for borrowers to look at, a universal box, if you would, that would allow borrowers to understand all of the terms and conditions of this mortgage and to be able to compare that out in the marketplace. Because what we do know is there is a lot of opportunities for people to get mortgages in this country today, or have been up to this point. What we want to make sure, Mr. Chairman, is in the future that they have that. But when they do take out that mortgage, they have the ability to look at the loan terms, the prepayment penalty, does this loan rate vary, and, if it does, what are the implications to that borrower. Because I believe, as one of my colleagues said earlier, the American people have the ability to make good choices when they are given good information. 
   So, I am pleased that in this particular piece of legislation there is a disclosure box that will help our consumers do a better job of making that decision in the future. 
   What I am disappointed in, Mr. Chairman, is the fact that we are going to, I think, put some very restrictive regulation on a market that may limit the ability for people to actually use that disclosure information in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, before I came to Congress, I had an opportunity to serve my constituents in a different way. I was a home builder, a land developer, and even a mortgage lender. I know firsthand some of the problems that the real estate industry and the housing industry is facing today. 
   Ninety-four percent of the American homeowners are paying their mortgage  payments on time and in full. Are some people having a hard time making these mortgage payments? Of course they are. Can the government help? Yes, in some cases. But I urge my colleagues to be very careful here. We do not need for the Federal Government to be the piggy bank for folks that made poor decisions or to bail out the lenders that made loans to people that really didn't have the capacity to pay it back. It is not fair to penalize those folks that made good decisions and played by the rules by taking their tax money and rewarding those who didn't. 
   For many of my constituents, they are having a hard time just making their own mortgage payment. What we shouldn't be doing is taking their tax money to pay their neighbor's payment. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage folks to be very cautious about these bail-out programs.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2829, FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. And I was listening to the distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee talking about people not following the rules, people that are avoiding their income taxes. Quite honestly, I want to bring a point up tonight that is about not obeying the rules. So I rise in opposition to this rule. 
   We spent a lot of time a few weeks ago talking about earmarks. Fortunately, we were successful in eliminating the secret slush funds of earmarks being reined in. So this is one of the ways we worked on controlling spending in an environment right now where the Democrats have already passed legislation that would increase spending by $50 billion this year, $20 billion in this current appropriations cycle. 
   But when we were talking about earmark reform, we really were only talking about 1 percent of our spending. If we are going to win the battle on spending, we have to focus on more than just earmarks. 
   One of the things that is very important is that we have a process in Congress. We say we are going to authorize programs, and then we say we are going to take time out and then fund them in the appropriations process. Tonight we are going to take up this bill, and it is called an appropriations bill. That is how we spend the money. 
   But one of the things we said in the House rules is a project or program has to be authorized before it can be appropriated. But you know what the very first thing that we do is? We say, oh, Congress is not going to play by the rules during this appropriations process. We are going to fund projects that aren't even authorized. 
   The American people understand the term ``authorization.'' Many of you have a credit card or a checking account. On your checking account, you have authorized signatures. On your credit card, you have authorized users. Unfortunately for the American people tonight, we are talking about using a credit card, because we are spending more money than we have. 
   One of the things that is an alarming number to me is it was recently reported that Congress is going to appropriate over $100 billion of unauthorized expenses. I don't think the people back in America, the people certainly back in the 19th District of Texas, think Congress ought to be spending $100 billion on programs that aren't even authorized. 
   Here are just a few examples of those. Tonight in this bill, for example, there is $23 billion worth of spending that is, what? Not authorized. Some of those projects are $100 million for a Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. That program was last authorized in 1998.     
   There is $315 million for the Election Assistance Commission. That authorization expired in 2005. 
   A lot of people say Congress may be just too busy to authorize these new programs. Well, you know what, if we are too busy to look at whether these current programs are relevant, whether they are efficient, or whether we should be doing them, then we are probably too busy. But by the way, we haven't been too busy to authorize just in 6 months over $600 billion in new programs. 
   So what we are spending money tonight on is projects that we didn't take the time to evaluate whether these projects are worthwhile and worthy of spending the American taxpayers' money on. And in the meantime, we have been very busy passing brand new programs to the tune of $228 billion, which is why this Democratic leadership is going to hand the American people a gift of the largest tax increase in American history. 
   If we are serious about leaving more money in the American taxpayers' pockets so that those families can pay for health care and gasoline and other things that are essential to those families, we are going to have to leave more money in their pockets, and we certainly can't do that by runaway spending. Spending money on projects that we haven't reviewed to determine whether those programs are worthwhile, relevant today, and whether some efficiencies could accrue in some of those programs and could be combined, and that we could do it better and spend less money. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of letting the American people have more of their money and against a rule that is going to appropriate money that we haven't even authorized.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Well, I thank the gentleman from Michigan. I also want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma, because he makes a very good point. And when he says we are importing thousands of dollars, actually it is billions of dollars. Every day America gets up and writes a check for $1 billion-plus to buy enough energy to run this country for 1 day. 
   What does that mean? That means that it takes $365 billion currently for America to buy enough energy just to run our country on an annual basis, $1 billion every day. And do you know what? Unfortunately, some of that money is going to some folks that aren't all that friendly to the American people. One of those people is Hugo Chavez. 
   I want to read you what Hugo Chavez thinks about America. He said, ``What we do regarding the imperialist power of the United States, we have no choice but to unite. We use oil in our war against neo-liberalism.'' He also said, ``We have invaded the United States, but with our oil.'' 
   So every day as the American people go to the pumps all across America, what I want them to visualize is that every day we write Hugo Chavez, who calls us imperialists, a $170 million check. That is $62 billion a year. What would happen if we could invest $1 billion a day in America developing America's energy resources, creating jobs for Americans? Think about it. Instead of writing Hugo Chavez a check for $172 million, that we write America a check for $172 million? 
   I think of the people I know in the 19th Congressional District of Texas, which is a big district, 29,000 square miles, 27 counties, teachers having to drive 60, 70 miles a day to go and teach our young people, that now are looking at doubling the cost of making that commute across the district. 
   I think about the man last night that I was talking to in my district. He said, ``Congressman,'' he said, ``I have to drive three times a week 30 miles each way to get dialysis so that I can be treated for diabetes.'' He said, ``Congressman, I am down to the point now of having to choose whether I can afford dialysis, afford gasoline, or afford food.'' 
   Madam Speaker, it is time to say yes. We have heard you say no; no to new drilling, no to building additional power plants in this country; no to new refineries. America is wanting you to say yes, because America is tired of writing checks to Hugo Chavez for $160 million every day. 
   I thank my friend from Michigan tonight for hosting this hour. I hope that somehow the American people realize that there is a willingness on behalf of many Members of Congress to say yes and to move forward and to do something proactive, instead of doing something that is called nothing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. 
   There have been a lot of figures and a lot of terms thrown around in this room today about payment limits and adjusted gross income, but let's really talk about what this bill is about, and what this bill is about is feeding and clothing the American people, to making sure that they continue to have access to the safest, highest quality products in the world. By the way, they are also the most affordable. 
   Now, one of the things that some people talk about is all of these rich farmers. Now, I will tell you it's very interesting. If it is as lucrative as everyone says, why is the number of farmers in America dropping? Go to a Farm Bureau meeting some evening in west Texas and see how many young farmers are dying to get into the farming business, or even have the capacity to get into the farming business. 
   I think it's also interesting, when we look at this bill, that about 70 percent of this bill has to do with providing an opportunity for those people that need a little extra helping hand to make sure that they do have a quality meal during the day, and that is in some of our food stamp and nutrition programs. Yet only 12 percent of this bill has anything to do with growing something. 
   Now, let me tell you that if you are going to feed and clothe people, I want everybody to know that those things just don't show up at the department store and the grocery store. Somebody actually has to produce it. We have hardworking farm families all over America that are fulfilling that commitment. 
   Let me tell you, it's difficult, the prices that some people have been talking about, well, the prices of these commodities are up. Yes, they are up, but let me tell you, look back 2 or 3 years ago when a lot of people wouldn't plant certain commodities because they couldn't make any money doing it. 
   The other question about this bill is, yes, it's about making sure Americans have quality agricultural products, but it's also about who is going to provide it.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (PUBLIC HOUSING DISASTER RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6276, the Public Housing Disaster Relief Act. This legislation will repeal section 9(k) in the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act, and clears the way for public housing authorities in need of repair following a disaster to be eligible for FEMA section 406 funds under the Stafford Act. 
   Today, there are two programs that are designed to assist public facilities and private nonprofit facilities in times of disasters. Section 9(k) within HUD was set up to provide natural disaster grants to public housing authorities. Section 406 of the Stafford Act permits the use of FEMA funds for repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement of public facilities and private nonprofit facilities, as well as associated expenses. 
   Since the 2000 appropriations, Congress has repealed section 9(k) and separately appropriated a set-aside amount within the Public Housing Capital Fund for emergencies and natural disasters. Congress has reduced this fund over the past 8 years. The funding has gone from a high of $75 million from 2000 through 2002 to a low of $16.8 million last year. 
   In 2004, four hurricanes struck Florida, completely depleting the $39.7 million available in funding for that year. In 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the gulf coast, and that year's funding of $29.8 million was not adequate to restore public housing that was damaged or destroyed.     
   In 2006, Hurricane Wilma came ashore in Florida during the first month of the fiscal year, using much of the $16.8 million funding for 2006. 
   Despite the lack of funding available under the section 9(k) emergency reserve account, public housing developments have remained ineligible for FEMA funds under section 406. 
   While current law is intended to prevent duplication by both HUD and FEMA for public housing facilities, it has put public housing facilities at a distinct disadvantage relative to other types of housing in disaster areas. 
   In testimony before a joint subcommittee hearing on June 4, 2008, with the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity and the Emergency Communications, Preparedness and Response Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee, HUD testified that it did not believe that Congress intended to limit the ability of public housing authorities to access Stafford Act funding by providing funding under section 9(k). 
   Specifically, HUD's testimony, stated this: ``In recent years the President has proposed eliminating both the portion of section 9(k) that provides the disaster grant funding and the set-aside for disaster grants in an attempt to alleviate the confusion about disaster assistance and make it possible for housing authorities to have access to section 406 Stafford Act funding.'' 
   HUD went on to suggest several ways to resolve this current situation: ``One potential solution to disaster funding shortfalls for public housing authorities would be the permanent repeal or amendment of section 9(k).'' 
   H.R. 6276, the Public Housing Disaster Relief Act, clearly paves the way for public housing authorities in need of repair following a disaster to be eligible for FEMA section 406 funds under the Stafford Act. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, we're today talking about making sure that, in the event of a disaster, that we have the funds and we don't have to go through a lot of red tape to make sure that we can restore this housing, when it's repairable, in a feasible way, and to make sure that we continue to provide the shelter for some of our very needy Americans. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, there aren't bills on the floor today. There should be bills on the floor, and there should be a bipartisan bill that works on another disaster that is impacting a lot of needy Americans today, and that's the fact of the rising electric costs, utility costs for many of the people that live in these housing authorities. The mass transit that they use to go to and fro work is going up. They're having to raise their fares. Even gasoline for them to go to their work and back. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill which certainly we support, I support. I would hope that we would bring some other bipartisan bills to the floor that would address probably one of the most looming disasters for many of these families, as well as families all across the country. 
   I get to thinking about the fact that today America had to write a check for about a billion dollars to provide energy supplement for the energy that we already produce in this country. I think about the fact that $170 million of that went to Hugo Chavez. I think about what we could do together if we were to begin to have an energy policy in this country today where we were investing $170 million in America every day rather than investing $170 million in a dictator from Venezuela, that we can create jobs, and that maybe many of the folks that are in the housing authorities around America today, with those jobs, that they could move into conventional for-rental housing, or even experience the American dream of owning their own home. 
   So while I support this bill, I would hope that we could take this same bipartisan spirit, working in the future, to solve America's energy needs instead of solving the financial needs of many folks or countries around the world that don't really care whether our folks in public housing have a nice, clean, safe place to live or not. 
   But we care, and we need to show the American people that we care about them, not just the people that are in public housing, but the families all across America today that are struggling with double the price of a tank of gasoline. 
   Just the other night I was on the phone with some constituents back in Texas, and this gentleman was on the phone. He said, ``Congressman, I have to go get dialysis three times a week. I have to drive over 100 miles to do that. And now I'm down to making a decision whether I'm going to be able to afford gasoline, groceries, or the rent.'' 
   That's not a decision we want people in America making. And so certainly, in the future, I hope that we will be able to not only address some of these important housing issues, as we've done in the Financial Services Committee, but I hope, also, that we would remember that part of the American dream is also having the ability to have a nice place to live, but also to be able to have an economy where we can grow and prosper and make, hopefully, some of our subsidized housing a temporary spot for American people and not a permanent spot. But with these rising costs of utilities and gasoline, I'm afraid we may be locking them into a scenario from which they would like to get out. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Chairman, I woke up on Monday this week very excited about the opportunity to bring this farm bill to this floor, but as you can imagine, my disappointment tonight because of the culmination of 2 years worth of hearings all across America, subcommittee hearings, 31 hours of markup in full committee working on a bill that is going to be good for America, good for American agriculture, working in a bipartisan way to make sure that all of agriculture has a bright future for this country, making sure that America will have a good source of food and fiber for the years to come and that it will not become dependent on importing food as we have become in importing energy in this country. 
   And you can imagine my disappointment because we've worked in a very bipartisan way with the chairman, working on the safety net for American producers when the commodity prices were low and then working on a safety net when we have drought conditions, weather conditions, to provide an additional safety net for them. 
   But unfortunately, we were duped, I guess is the best way I can say it. As we were working along with the leadership, they kept saying we are going to find some additional offsets so that they can expand these nutrition programs while at the same time asking American producers to take cuts in payments, but with the understanding that we weren't going to have any new taxes. Unfortunately, Madam Chairman, that isn't the way this farm bill was written up. 
   Today, without any debate, without any discussion, the American people's farm bill was put in jeopardy. It now faces a Presidential veto. It now faces opposition from Members of this body that would have voted for this farm bill, but now they are not going to vote for this farm bill because it raises taxes. 
   And what we've known and what we've tried to say to the American people over the last few months is we knew this was coming because this new leadership has started off on the old way they used to do business under the promise of doing business in a new way, by taxing and spending, taxing and spending. And it's unfortunate that we would bring that kind of politics to the American farm policy.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 26, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chairman, I rise tonight in strong opposition to the Kind amendment. The Kind amendment may be kind to someone, but it is not to American farm families. 
   You see, what is happening in America today is that we have already asked American farm families to make a reduction. Mr. Kind wants to reduce farm payments 40 percent. Well, that is on top of the 50 percent that they have already been reduced. 
   For America to be competitive in the global marketplace, farmers and ranchers all across America have had to get larger. To be competing in this global economy, the efficiencies of running $150,000 farm machinery across small acreages is no longer feasible. And yet what Mr. Kind and his friends want to do is to make American agriculture not competitive. 
   You see, to be competitive in this world, you have to find economic efficiencies, and these efficiencies have meant that many producers have had to get larger. And as they are trying to compete in a global marketplace where in many cases they are locked out because of trade restraints in these other countries, now we want to say to the American ranchers and farmers: Don't be efficient. Don't be competitive in this global marketplace. We want to take away the ability for you to be sustained in a global marketplace. 
   That is not good policy for any business. We don't do that in any other area of our government today. We don't say to American companies, why don't you all get small and inefficient? We don't tell them to do that. We say, get strong and efficient. And yet the Kind amendment wants to say to American farmers don't be efficient. 
   I urge members not to support the Kind amendment.  
   Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Kind amendment. This amendment will reduce the safety net for U.S. farmers and result in a less secure and more expensive food supply for Americans. 
   There has been a lot of discussion about the need for ``reform'' in farm programs. I suggest the so-called reformers out there get better acquainted with the facts: 
   First, the portion of spending in the 2007 Farm Bill that goes to farm commodity programs has declined by half, to 14 percent of the spending in the bill. In the 2002 Farm Bill, the share of spending for commodities was 28 percent. 
   Second, in 2002, commodity programs were projected to cost $94 billion over 5 years. As the 2002 Farm Bill comes to a close, actual spending will come in $21 billion less. 
   Finally, because spending has been lower and is projected to stay low, the cost projection for the next 10 years for farm commodity programs is down nearly $60 billion compared to 2002. 
   Farm programs have worked as intended, providing support when prices are low and pulling back when prices are high, as most currently are. Maintaining the farm safety net has a reasonable cost. 
   Farm programs are the only area in H.R. 2419 in which spending is down. On top of these reductions, the Ag Committee took the additional step of reforming farm program payment policies and crop Insurance. 
   The Kind amendment doesn't save any money. It simply puts what it cuts from farm programs into expanding other spending. 
   A final reason for not cutting these programs off: maintaining U.S. leverage in trade negotiations. 
   U.S. farmers' and ranchers' exports are currently shut out of markets around the world. Without a significant market access agreement in the WTO Doha round negotiations, U.S. producers will continue to be at a disadvantage. The only leverage our negotiators have to gain new market access is to offer to change farm programs. 
   If Congress unilaterally reduces farm programs through the Kind amendment, our negotiators' efforts to gain market access are completely undercut and will be ineffective. 
   Support U.S. farmers and consumers and oppose the Kind amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I believe there is a concept that I strongly support, and one that I think a lot of Members of this body support, that when government is too prescriptive, then good ideas and innovation get suppressed. This is the reason I brought forward this amendment, because in H.R. 3524, it requires that all housing units demolished under the HOPE VI grant program be replaced on a one-for-one basis. What we know is that this is a new provision in the HOPE VI program. One of the things that concerns me most about this is in many cases it is not necessarily feasible for us to go back on a one-for-one basis, nor may it be a need in that particular community. 
   Chairman Waters and I had a chance to travel down to New Orleans and see some of the activities going on down there, and what we saw is some units that were brought back on a one-for-one basis that were vacant, were unoccupied, which indicated there may be some resistance to coming back to that particular neighborhood. 
   What we also know with the HOPE VI program is that this program was designed to replace some very terrible housing conditions, an old, failed system of putting all of these low-income systems in a very concentrated area, and we found out very quickly that that was not a successful program. So now with this particular legislation we are going to go back and say we didn't learn our lesson the first time; we are going to go back with these kinds of concentrations in these neighborhoods, which have already shown to fail. 
   The other thing that I think needs to be brought out is in some cases there may be land constraints that make this not feasible to go back for one-for-one. The second piece of it is that housing and demographics have changed since a lot of these units have been built. 
   What we are learning now is that we can do these mixed-use projects where we bring moderate and low-income families together and not putting all of these low-income families in one place. We have also learned a lot about the density, the environment, where we have open spaces for children to play, and we are not forcing them to play in the streets. 
   So there's a lot of things that we do better now, but we are trying to limit using some of those new techniques and new innovations in housing by going back to the old model. 
   One of the things that I think has been brought out in this debate is that this is not a debate about whether HOPE VI is a good program or not. I want to be clear about that, that when I stand before this body today and say we shouldn't be too prescriptive, I am not talking about not funding this HOPE VI program or reauthorizing it. I think we did some things that actually did make this better, but being too prescriptive begins to deny the ability of communities to sit down and decide what is the best footprint to provide good quality housing for our low-income residents, and they deserve that. For us to stand up and say this body of 435 here and 100 on the other side, that we know more about what the housing needs are in these communities around America, I think is a little ludicrous. 
   We need to empower the local governments and the housing authorities to be able to sit down and say, look, we have got these old and dilapidated units, people don't want to live in them, some are vacant, some are occupied, and some of them probably shouldn't be occupied, but for the United States Congress to say we know more about your housing needs in your community, I think is poor policy. 
   That is the reason I am going to be encouraging my colleagues today to vote for the Neugebauer amendment that takes out the provision of being too prescriptive, allowing American cities and communities and housing authorities to make the right decisions for our low-income folks. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (SEASONED CUSTOMER CTR EXEMPTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 323, the Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act. 
   I appreciate the work of Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus to introduce this legislation and get it on the floor quickly in this Congress. 
   The last Congress succeeded in passing some much-needed and long overdue regulatory relief for some of our financial institutions. Unfortunately, the provisions that originally were passed in this body as related to the CTR exemption were not included in that very important legislation. 
   In passing H.R. 323 today, the House is saying once more that we believe financial institutions, their customers and national security will be better served by exempting institutions from filing CTRs for their very qualified and seasoned customers. 
   Banks in my district have been telling me for the past few years that this legislation is needed. They tell us about the countless staff hours that it takes to file reports for customers that they have had relationships with for 20, 30 and 40 years just to be in compliance with the current regulation. 
   Under H.R. 323, instead of filing a form every time one of their long-standing seasoned customers comes in with a transaction over $10,000, they will file a one-time exemption for that customer to be recognized as a seasoned and qualified customer. I think that makes more sense for the American people. I think it makes more sense to use common sense. 
   Someone told me recently that the District of Columbia geographically is a 10-square-mile area, some have said it is a 10-square-mile logic-free environment. Well, we have an opportunity to overcome that feeling today by bringing some logic to the way we handle these cash transactions. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 323. Let's bring some common sense and logic back into the way government handles national security and recognize that banks and their seasoned customers, those relationships are long-standing and that time would be better served in looking at other opportunities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, it's not working. The policy of ``no'' to producing America's resources is not working for the American people. Today, America will write a check for $1 billion to buy enough energy to run our economy for one day. Let me repeat that. Today, America will write a check for $1 billion to run our economy for one day. That means for the year, it takes $365 billion to export to other countries that have said ``yes'' to developing their resources. 
   Think about what we could do with $1 billion if we invested that in developing American resources; the jobs that it would create, the fact it would make America more independent and less dependent on those other countries. 
   The policy of ``no'' is not working. We need to say ``yes'' to producing more of America's resources; ``yes'' to drilling in areas where we have found abundant resources; ``yes'' to using a 250-year supply of coal; ``yes'' to building new nuclear power plants; ``yes'' to developing America's resources, reinvesting in America. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask you to bring legislation to the floor that will help America build a stronger energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I also rise in strong opposition to the Udall amendment. This amendment singles out one commodity for reduction in order to increase an unrelated program. 
   This bill already increases funding to enroll nearly 1 million new acres in the Grassland Reserve Program. That is a significant amount of land. 
   Some might think this is a small change in direct payment. It doesn't seem like much; however, this bill does not make changes in any of the current direct payments, and this would single out only one commodity, that being cotton, for reduction in direct payments. 
   The House Agriculture Committee has already made significant changes to cotton. The bill reduces cotton target prices and eliminates cotton loan storage credits. In addition, payment limit changes are more likely to affect cotton farmers than any other commodity. 
   If you want to increase the grasslands program, the offsets should not come from one commodity that is already taking a fairly major change in this bill. Let's treat all commodities the same and oppose the Udall amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in strong opposition to this resolution and in strong support of our troops in the mission as they fight the global war on terror. 
   I am really disappointed in the hollow resolution that does not match the seriousness of this issue that we are debating. It appears politics, not the safety of our Nation, is leading the way. 
   Not long ago, several of my Democratic colleagues were arguing we need additional troops in Iraq. But now the President and the Iraqi Study Group say, send more troops, and now the Democrats are against it. 
   So when they say, now that they have the ability to and the responsibility to govern, the majority has no plan for success. In fact, the only plan is to cut funding for our troops on the ground in Iraq. 
   Statement after statement from Members on the other side of the aisle paint a very clear picture. This week's debate is merely paving the way for future cuts in funding for Iraq. The realities of the current global conflict demand a more responsible approach from this body. 
   We know that terrorist enemies are patient. They are calculating, and they intend on attacking us again. They have stated that Iraq is the central front for the global jihad, yet expelling America from Iraq is merely the first step in their strategy. 
   We also know that leaders of the terrorist organizations have ordered their followers to extend their jihad throughout the region and the world. So it is clear that the attacks on our country and the citizens will not stop if the troops pack up their bags and return from Iraq. The terrorists will follow us back to our America. 
   A long list of terror attacks took place long before 9/11 and long before we entered Iraq and overthrew Saddam Hussein. 
   I, like everyone else, want our troops to come home as soon as possible. However, with shortsighted political calculations made in this body that may cause us to lose that war, terrorist groups will only be encouraged to expand their efforts. 
   In addition to the terrorist groups who are watching this debate and our actions in Iraq, we also know that Iran will see that America is buckling to our political reactions to this issue. Not only does Iran stand to benefit from increased instability in the region, but seeing America retreat in the face of military obstacles will only embolden that rogue regime to question America's resolve. 
   While we can disagree on whether to send reinforcements, we must all agree that the consequences of losing the battle on the global war on terrorism is catastrophic and far-reaching. 
   America must not be a Nation where our school buses, our malls, our neighborhoods, become the battlefields for the war on terrorism. Therefore, we should be saying we will not retreat, we will not back down from this fight. We should stand 100 percent behind our troops and give them the tools and support necessary to get the job done. Our security depends on it. 
   Unfortunately, this resolution fails on each front. This resolution does not put forth a successful strategy for victory, and the resolution does not show our troops that they have our full support. 
   In fact, for the last 2 or 3 days, you have not heard one solution offered by the other side. You have not heard one solution offered of what happens if the President is right. This is too important of an issue for us to be backing down from and to be having silly political debates. 
   To the contrary, this resolution only serves to score political points and embarrass the Commander in Chief during a time of war. It does so while, at the same time, weakening the morale of our troops. Fighting and winning the war is serious business. It requires our President, our military leaders, our elected officials to make important decisions, tough decisions. Yet making tough decisions is what the American people expect their Representatives to do. 
   Therefore, I call on my colleagues to reject this resolution, end the political stunts, take seriously our responsibility to govern and to ensure the safety and the security of the American people. 
   This has been a rock fight. This is not a place for a rock fight. This is a place for serious deliberation to make sure that we keep America safe, both today and in the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, later today the House will consider legislation that will negatively impact our Nation's housing and financial markets, not to mention the taxpayers, for years to come. 
   The majority has combined some reforms that are long overdue. One of those is to make Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have a stronger regulator and to modernize FHA to make it relevant and more effective for borrowers across our country. Unfortunately, this bill also includes provisions that would put the taxpayers on the hook for people that may have borrowed money that they shouldn't have borrowed and for lenders that made loans that shouldn't have been made. It also diverts billions of dollars from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae at a time when we're saying that they may not be adequately capitalized. 
   Madam Speaker, at a time when Americans are having a hard time making their mortgage payments and dealing with high food prices, they do not want to be saddled with their neighbor's house payment. 
   I urge my colleagues to defeat this legislation.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank the ranking member. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3221. Every Member of this House cares about our Nation's economy and the difficult financial situations that many Americans face. 
   What the majority has done in response is to load up a housing package under the guise of attempting to stabilize the housing and financial markets. This bill will only make matters worse, particularly for the taxpayers. 
   The majority has combined reforms that we all agree are long overdue, such as a stronger regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernization of FHA. But these, some of these other provisions propose a significant risk to the taxpayers and our economy. 
   At a time when the housing market is relying on GSEs to fulfill their mission in ensuring a continued mortgage liquidity, Congress should not divert $5.8 billion to a housing trust fund. 
   At a time when taxpayers are being asked to loan more money to GSEs to provide some kind of a backstop, Congress should not be siphoning income out of this company and out of the capital of these entities. 
   At a time when many Americans are working hard to pay for their mortgages, they are struggling with high energy costs, high food costs, they shouldn't have to struggle making their own mortgage payment and their neighbors as well. And that is what this bill would do. 
   Those on the other side say that the CBO estimates the chances of the probability of 50 percent that no authority for Treasury to support the GSEs would be needed. 
   Well, let's go to the doctor, and the doctor says to you, well, there is a 50 percent chance that you are healthy, and there is a 50 percent chance that you are not. That would not be very reassuring to the patient, and it certainly should not be very reassuring to the American taxpayers, particularly when CBO also says it is not clear what criteria Treasury would use to provide this assistance to GSEs. 
   As Congress is wrestling to address our current economic situation, we must remember that markets are not always kind, but they are very efficient. The sooner the Federal Government really indicates that the market is the best place to settle a lot of these issues, the sooner the capital will start to return to these markets. 
   Quite honestly, Mr. Speaker, right now the markets are sitting on the sideline to wait to see what other goodies that the Congress is going to do to sweeten the pie. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to defeat this bill. We need to come back and do the reforms that make sense for the American people. But we do not need to load up this bill with extraneous stuff that is bad and not in the best interest of the American taxpayers.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON H.R. 3121, FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Section 106 of the Senate flood insurance bill would reform the National Flood Insurance Program in a significant way by phasing out taxpayer subsidies and requiring that rates are based on an actual risk of flooding basis. 
   The Senate bill achieves this goal more quickly and fairly than the House bill, which does not begin phasing out premium subsidies for nonresidential properties and nonprimary residences until 2011. 
   We owe it to the American people whose lives get turned upside down in the aftermath of flood disaster to encourage an efficient, effective program, with adequate resources to be there for them when they need it. 
   Risk-based pricing will reassure taxpayers that they are not subsidizing those who choose to live in high-risk areas near coastal lowlands or flood plains where many property owners have repetitive losses. 
   Section 106 of the Senate version of the flood bill would also eliminate subsidies within 90 days of enactment for prospective policyholders of nonresidential structures, nonprimary residences, and severe repetitive loss properties. 
   It would also eliminate subsidies within 90 days for properties that undergo improvements or renovations that exceed 30 percent of the fair market value of the property, and any property that sustains damage exceeding 50 percent of the fair market value after the enactment of this bill. 
   In addition, Section 106 includes a provision that would prohibit subsidies and require risk-based pricing for prospective policyholders if the property was not insured within 90 days of enactment or if the policy lapses as a result of deliberate choice by the policyholder. 
   Risk-based pricing would also be required if the prospective policyholder refused to accept an offer for mitigation assistance or relocation following a major disaster. 
   These are prudent measures to strengthen flood programs, phase out taxpayer subsidies, and encourage a premium pricing structure that is based on the actual risk of the property to flooding. 
   While not part of this motion, I also believe it would be ill-advised to force the National Flood Insurance Program to take on new risk of wind coverage, as it would expose taxpayers to further losses and could unnecessarily interfere with the functioning of private wind insurance markets. 
   The Republican minority believes that the chief objective of Congress should be to reform the existing National Flood Insurance Program, including the removal of subsidies over time to improve the long-term solvency of the program. Adding new coverage to the program that has already lost $18 billion is a move in the right direction. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to stop and reiterate that the program, the reason this is so important is that we continue to subsidize this program and the deficits keep going up. Now, some people say, Well, the program pays for itself. But the truth of the matter is, Madam Speaker, this Congress is going to have to write off billions of dollars because the system is currently insolvent now, and now others want to increase and expand the coverage and postpone putting risk-based premiums in place. 
   The American people already are dealing with a lot of other issues. They don't need to be dealing with having to subsidize the National Flood Insurance Program any longer. 
   As the conferees work on this final flood insurance bill, we ask that they produce a bill that is fiscally responsible and does not saddle future taxpayers with more losses. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON H.R. 3121, FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. In addition to rising to offer this motion to instruct on H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2008, I believe it's also critical that we talk about another issue that is very important to the American taxpayers, and that is a sound and reliable energy policy for our country. 
   I am repeatedly frustrated and I know the American people are repeatedly frustrated that this Congress has done nothing this summer, this year, to produce one additional barrel of oil to help reduce the dependency problem that this country has on foreign oil. This is not only an economic security issue for our country, it is a national security issue for our country. 
   We know that we have seen in the last few days that the Iranian Government is flexing their muscle and they are saying that they want everybody to know that they are a world power and that if people make them mad, or if they decide to do something, that they could close the Strait of Hormuz, where I think someone said almost 40 percent of the world's oil passes through that port. That just says to us  that this is a national security issue as well. 
   There's a very simple solution to America's energy problem. It's not complicated, it's not complex. It's a simple, three-letter word. It's yes. It's saying yes to drilling for oil within the borders of the United States of America. It's saying yes to drilling in Alaska and off the Outer Continental Shelf. It's saying yes to continuing to develop and use the 250-year coal supply that America has. As someone said a while ago, we are the Saudi Arabia of coal.     
   There are new technologies out there converting coal and liquefying it to use as a very clean and efficient energy source. 
   It is saying yes to building more nuclear power plants in this country. We haven't built a new nuclear power plant in I think over 30 years. It is a very safe, reliable source of energy and does not create a lot of greenhouse gases. 
   It is saying yes to building new refineries in our country. Not only, Madam Speaker, are we importing 70 percent of our oil, but because we haven't built a new refinery in this country in over 30 years, we are importing from 10 to 15 percent of our gasoline. 
   It is saying yes to renewable and alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar and biofuels. 
   Madam Speaker, what we need to do is have a balanced energy program, looking at renewables, looking at new technologies, but also producing American resources. 
   This growing energy crisis is affecting every facet of Americans' daily lives. As they try to drive to work, I had recently a telephone call with a constituent, and he said, Congressman, I have to drive three times a week to get medical treatment, and it is over 100 miles to and from to get that treatment. He said, I am down to the decision now whether I can afford to be able to go and get my treatment or buy groceries or make my rent payment. I need some help. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people are looking to this Congress to do something. And we can do something. We can say yes; yes to new technologies, yes to producing American resources, instead of exporting billions of dollars to foreign countries and letting them develop their resources. 
   I believe last month, June, the average import, this is daily import, Madam Speaker, was 13 million barrels a day, 13 million barrels a day. That is $1.8 billion dollars every day that America gets up and writes a check to send somewhere else. Not to invest in America. We write a check for $1.8 billion every day to send to some foreign countries. 
   Madam Speaker, unfortunately, some of those countries that we send that check to aren't all that friendly to the American people. Our friend, Mr. Hugo Chavez from Venezuela, we write him a check every day for $170 million. I am sure the American people are pretty excited that $170 million of investment that could be building America's resources and creating jobs in America is going down to South America, to Venezuela, to one of the people that have said we are imperialists and that they have invaded America not with armies, but with their oil. 
   So, Madam Speaker, what we have to do is we have to begin to look at why we are not doing anything in this Congress. 
   One of the things I have noticed that we worked on this summer, and I know the American people will be extremely excited to know, is that we have protected foreign cats, foreign dogs, monkeys, and today we will spend about 3 or 4 hours naming a scenic route. Now, I think that really goes a long way to assuring the American people that we are in fact working on energy solutions that will bring lower energy prices for the American people. 
   Madam Speaker, we have to begin to say yes, not only to these high energy prices affecting Americans' ability to go to and from work. Teachers, for example, in rural areas, driving 50, 75 miles, their cost of transportation is almost doubling, but their salaries are not going up. Those teacher contracts are out right now and they are saying, should I accept that teaching contract in that little rural community, where it is going to almost take a pay cut to do that because of the cost of gasoline? 
   It is affecting food prices. One of the things we know about energy, Madam Speaker, is it is interwoven in every aspect of our life. In the production of food, farmers are paying record prices for fertilizer and for diesel. So that is just the production side. The chemicals have gone up. Several chemical companies in the last few weeks have announced double digit increases in the cost of their commodities. 
   Now that we have produced those products, now we have to get those products to the processors and to the market. The cost of processing that food has gone up. Once we produce that food and we process it, then we have to deliver it to the distribution systems, and from the distribution systems to the grocery stores, and then the American people have to go to the grocery store. All along the way, these high energy prices are causing huge inflation for our country, and, Madam Speaker, we have to do something about it. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, just in response to the gentleman, what can we do, we can increase the supply. And as the other previous speaker from Florida said, we are not talking about geothermal or switch grass, Madam Speaker. We are talking about proven technology. We know we that can use oil. We know that we can use nuclear. We know that we can use coal. And the only way you are ever going to lower the price is increase supply, yet my colleagues on the other side are saying ``no.'' The American people are saying ``yes.'' 
   I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) who has been trying to bring this point to the forefront in this Congress.

   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Speaker, one of the things I want to say is we are more than willing to work in a bipartisan way if the majority leader has a plan to supplant the fact that we import 13 million barrels a day. If he's got some plan to do that, the Republicans will stay here till December to pass that legislation. 
   I just want to also let the gentleman know that the largest wind farm in the world is in my congressional district, and there's more wind power in my congressional district than in the whole State of California. We were able to accomplish that in just 5 years. 
   Madam Speaker, what the American people that are here today, they want to know is, is this Congress, is this majority, going to do something about energy. Either yes or no.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEUGEBAUER. (PESTICIDE REGISTRATION IMPROVEMENT RENEWAL ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1983, the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act, and encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   In 2003, with the collaboration of agriculture, pesticide manufacturers and public interest organizations, Congress established a new fee schedule and registration process timeline for the Environmental Protection Agency, This Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA) was designed to improve pesticide registration and review, and PRIA has been extremely successful for all parties involved. 
   As the Ranking Member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture, which has jurisdiction over pesticide issues, I am pleased the stakeholders have again worked with Congress and the EPA This bill today continues and builds upon the successful pesticide registration process over the next five years. 
   Before PRIA, applicants for pesticide registration had no certainty on how long the review process at EPA would take or how much they would need to pay in fees. The EPA was under pressure from the public interest community to reassess tolerances for pesticides already registered as required under the Food Quality Protection, Act. As a result, consumers who depend on effective and safe pesticide products were not always able to take advantage of new products. Delays impacted farmers' ability to access improved plant protection and pest products. 
   PRIA worked because it set a firm fee schedule for pesticide registration applicants, giving the EPA resources needed to do reviews. In return, the EPA was held to specific timelines in its reviews and approvals. PRIA also enabled the EPA to complete tolerance reassessments for products approved in the past through product maintenance fees from manufacturers. 
   By continuing the fees and increasing registration funding, S. 1983 provides the EPA with the resources needed to maintain this successful system. Additionally, the bill continues the periodic review of registered products, requiring the EPA to reassess each product every 15 years. 
   The pesticide registration and review process must be based on sound science. Success also requires confidence in the regulatory system. This reauthorization and enhancement of PRIA helps ensure that the EPA is using the best science to review applicants. Timelines for reviews bring more transparency to the process, and this transparency gives confidence to pesticide users such as agriculture, manufacturers and the public interest community. 
   I urge my colleagues to support continuation of this successful regulatory process that has brought effective and safe products to market not only for agriculture but for all consumers.
