<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives will vote on H.R. 5501 the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   As the Chairman of the Congressional Ethiopia and Ethiopian American Caucus, I strongly support this critical reauthorization of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Although PEPFAR supports a global effort, no one can argue against the fact that the African continent has borne the brunt of the HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria epidemics. The litany of grim statistics documenting the ravages of HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria on dozens of African countries and millions of people is familiar to all of us committed to a morally righteous global war on poverty and disease. I have traveled to Ethiopia and witnessed first-hand the courage of a people nurturing a fledgling democracy in the face of terrible obstacles. 
   For me, what those statistics come down to is the human cost of disease, countless orphans, hollow-eyed children raising children in villages, cities, and countries devastated economically and spiritually by death and fear. I have seen the resiliency and courage of people who, with access to medicine and food, have raised themselves out of abject poverty. As the wealthiest country in the world we have an obligation to invest in the global community, and I support the passage of this bill.  
   Mr. BERMAN: I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (HONORING EDWARD DAY COHOTA, JOSEPH L. PIERCE, AND OTHER VETERANS OF ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER DESCENT WHO FOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES CIVIL WAR -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues from Indiana and from Virginia for their wonderful support and recognition. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 415, a resolution I introduced which recognizes and honors Asian Pacific Islander American soldiers who fought during the United States Civil War.  
   Recent historical research has uncovered evidence of over 250 soldiers of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who served in the Union and Confederate forces during the United States Civil War. 
   I have introduced H. Res. 415 to recognize and honor Edward Day Cohota and Joseph L. Pierce, as well as the numerous others veterans of API descent who bravely fought in the United States Civil War. These two men, both of Chinese ancestry, are explicitly named in this resolution as the most-documented and researched veterans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in the U.S. Civil War. 
   In comparison to the total population in the United States, a disproportionately high percentage of soldiers of API descent are listed on both the Union and Confederate rosters. By volunteering to serve in the Armed Forces of their adopted homeland, they risked their lives and declared their allegiances as vigorously as any other community. 
   Instead of honoring and recognizing their service, our country denied these veterans the ability to naturalize through the bigoted laws enacted during this period. 
   I believe that for their contribution to our Nation's history, and the injustices done to them despite their patriotism, veterans of API descent who fought in the U.S. Civil War are worthy of recognition by the United States House of Representatives. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, without whose efforts this resolution would not be possible. In their own words, the Chinese American Citizens Alliance has been ``committed to achieving passage of this resolution because national historic recognition was the least our country could do posthumously for an important, special group of unsung heroes.'' The Chinese American Citizens Alliance has worked arduously on behalf of these veterans and their families for years, and their work pays off today as the House considers this resolution. 
   In closing, Madam Speaker, I am pleased that this resolution is on the floor today. The families of these veterans and community supporters have waited a very long time for these brave soldiers to be honored by our government, and I urge my colleagues to support this small effort to recognize the contributions made by Asian Pacific Islander Civil War soldiers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2003, the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act. 
   As Chair of the Ethiopia Caucus, I believe that if given the necessary tools, Ethiopia can truly be a lighthouse for Africa. In the dawn of the Ethiopian millennium, it is important now more than ever to celebrate this country with vigilance and genuine partnership. 
   I will continue to be an advocate of humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia and for supporting policies that promote trade and economic development there, but I cannot comply with clear offenses to the democratic process by the ruling government right now. 
   I believe that the financial and ideological backing of the United States administration can encourage the Ethiopian Government to allow for the effective participation of opposition parliamentarians and civil society. 
   I hope we can find a way to provide substantially more support for a true political and economic partnership with the Ethiopian people beyond this legislation. 
   I will vote ``yes'' on Mr. Payne's legislation. I ask my colleagues to do so too.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, the signs of an energy crisis are clear--we are facing the consequences of significant climatic change, our national security continues to be at risk, and our energy economy must change in the face of $100 per barrel oil. 
   Investors are ready to invest billions of dollars into American made next generation clean technologies, but for too long the Federal Government has been subsidizing the old technologies. Inventors and entrepreneurs, the true engines of American economic growth, are already focused on energy, but they are still waiting for Congress to send them the right signals before bringing their full efforts to bear on the problem. 
   That is why I am pleased to rise in support of an energy bill that sends the right signal and will help to revolutionize our Nation's energy economy as we know it, help free us of our dependence on foreign oil, create millions of new jobs, and address global warming. 
   The Energy Independence and Security Act will increase corporate average fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020; greatly expand the national biofuels mandate; require utilities nationwide to provide 15 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020; strengthen energy efficiency for a wide range of products, appliances, lighting, and buildings; create education and job training programs to train the next generation of Americans to ensure we remain competitive in the new energy economy; and repeal tax breaks for profit-rich oil companies and invest that money in clean renewable energy technologies and in much needed research and development. 
   The evidence that we need to change our reliance on fossil fuels has never been clearer. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued its latest, and most dire, report on what we can expect if we do not immediately reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The IPCC has said that worldwide carbon emissions must fall by at least 50 percent by 2050 to limit a temperature rise of about three degrees Fahrenheit and prevent the worst climate impacts from occurring. 
   By passing the Energy Independence and Security Act, we are taking the first step in developing a policy for reducing carbon emissions. I pledge to work diligently with my colleagues to take additional steps in 2008, and urge adoption of this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), H.R. 800. This bipartisan bill brings forth long overdue changes to the broken National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) system. EFCA would add the option of majority sign-up for forming unions and bargaining; provide an efficient timeline for good faith mediation and arbitration, and stronger penalties for violations during the organizing and initial contract negotiations. Ultimately, EFCA would restore workers' freedom to form unions and bargain. 
   Responsible employers voluntarily recognize unions when a majority of workers signal their desire to unionize. Studies have shown that workers believe the sign-up method to be a fair process, free of the pressures and coercion stemming from NLRB elections. Asian-American and Pacific Islander communities share the strong work ethic and desire for advancement at the core of the American Dream and labor membership is a key component to a fair and open competition for jobs. 
   Our Nation is stronger when workers join together and bargain for a better life. Union membership helps to offset some of the race and gender disparities in the labor market. Activism by organized labor has given Americans better wages, paid sick leave, child labor laws, paid vacations, stronger work safety regulations, and more secure retirement. Union workers receive better benefits and higher weekly earnings than their non-union counterparts. Furthermore, workplaces unionized through majority sign-up have better employee relations and greater employee focus on the business. 
   Madam Chairman it is time we allow the workers to choose, not the employer. I urge my colleagues to cast a vote in favor of the American worker and in support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 and to express my dismay over one particular matter not addressed by today's conference agreement. 
   Since its creation in 1997, the CHIP's flexibility, in combination with existing Medicaid programs, has proven highly effective in reducing the number of children who are uninsured in the United States. The bill before us today will invest $35 billion in the program over the next 5 years, ensuring that 6.6 million children currently enrolled will continue to have a health program and allowing for the growth in the program predicted over the next 10 years. 
   I am glad that the bill will allow California and other innovative states to continue to cover families--the health of children is inextricably entwined with that of the family as a whole. I am especially pleased that this bill includes full dental coverage and mental health parity, recognizing that physical health care is only one part of effective health coverage. 
   Despite the desperately needed reforms contained in this legislation, I am deeply disappointed that the conferees did not include language from the House-passed Children's Health and Medicare Protection, CHAMP, Act that would have given states the option of choosing to waive the five year waiting period for Medicaid and CHIP imposed on pregnant women and children who are legally present in the United States. It is unconscionable that Congress will make pregnant women and innocent children pawns in a raucous and frequently misleading immigration debate. I was proud that the House included language that would allow states to make their own decision on this matter and I am saddened that Congress bowed to reactionary anti-immigrant voices on this particular matter and excluded it from this conference agreement. 
   Despite my concern, I support this legislation, as I believe that it is too important to allow to lapse. I hope that House leadership will take note of my and others' concerns about the denial of coverage to legally present, otherwise eligible, immigrant children and pregnant women and will work with us to bring this matter to resolution in as swift a manner as possible. 
   I am glad that the Democratic and Republican leadership have been so active in ensuring that we get this bill to the President before the program expires on September 30th, 2007. With passage of this bill, the health of millions of American children will depend on the stroke of the President's pen. I am sure that I express the sentiments of millions of Americans when I say that I hope the President will make the morally correct choice not to veto healthcare for children when this agreement reaches his desk.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ABOLITION OF THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 272, a resolution offered by my fellow Californian Representative BARBARA LEE to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the elimination of the transatlantic slave trade. I commend my colleague for introducing the resolution and I am proud to be a co-sponsor. 
   As Chair and Founder of the Congressional Ethiopian American Caucus, I am particularly interested in the history of the African Diaspora. My experience has taught me that the history of the Diaspora is as complex and divergent as the communities themselves. Our challenge is to educate ourselves about the Diaspora and to understand how African Americans embrace and explore their heritage. 
   To tell the story of African immigration to the United States, we have a moral and cultural obligation to acknowledge the transatlantic slave trade. Today, the House is recognizing an important milestone in world history by considering H. Res. 272, Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. On March 25, 1807, the transatlantic slave trade was abolished by the British Parliament, and the United States Government followed suit a year later. The transatlantic slave trade was the largest forced migration in the world history, and it accounted for nearly 12,000,000 people transported in bondage from their African homelands to the Americas. 
   On this day, we pay our respects to those who died as a result of slavery, including through exposure to the horrors of the Middle Passage and in resistance to enslavement. As the resolution notes, the slave trade and its legacy continue to have a profound impact on social and economic disparity, racism and discrimination, and continue to affect people of African descent today. As a Nation we must move beyond telling the story about this crime against humanity, to empowering current and future generations to take action against the political and economic structures that impede our social progress. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to develop policies that will repair the damage that resulted from the devastating practice of transatlantic slave trade, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution commemorating its abolition.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3093.  
   Mr. Chairman, this is my first year as a member of the CJS Subcommittee. It has been a great experience working under the leadership of Mr. Mollohan and Mr. Frelinghuysen, and I just want to indicate that it has been a good experience because it has been very bipartisan. 
   I wanted to make a couple of comments about law enforcement. Between 2001 and 2006, the funding for State and local law enforcement grants was cut 43 percent during the time when State and local law enforcement agencies have been expected to take on increased homeland security responsibilities. As a result, last year the FBI reported that violent crime has had its biggest increase in over a decade. This bill reverses that trend, making its biggest investment in restoring the State and local grants and funding for the FBI. 
   The bill includes funding to restart the COPS hiring program to put more than 2,800 police officers on the streets to fight crime, and in my district it is critical to be able to address the gang activities out there.     
   I represent Silicon Valley, Mr. Chairman, and it's the home of technological innovation in America, so I'm keenly aware of how innovation is the driving force behind our Nation's economy, and that to keep our economic preeminence in the world, we need to stay on the cutting edge of science and technology. 
   It's been mentioned before, our support for NSF and for NASA, and I support that, and I think that it's a good step in the right direction. And realigning how we budget NASA has made a critical difference, being that it's going from FTEs to mission-oriented budgeting. That's going to make a great big change. 
   In the Department of Commerce, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, we see a funding increase that restores program cuts that would have been eliminated by the President that included ATP and the Manufacturing Extension Program. These are critical programs to continue to fund if we're going to maintain our edge. 
   NOAA has been funded just over $4 billion, and since climate change is such a big issue, NOAA has a big role in that, and we need to continue to support that group. 
   I'd like to thank, again, the leadership and this opportunity to be part of the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, in any endeavor, one must set achievable goals  and benchmarks. As a teacher, I found that it was critical to provide guidance to students whose reports were not proceeding on schedule. 
   President Bush definitely needs some help in his work in Iraq. His initial research was terribly flawed and cut corners in disturbing ways. He ignored the advice of learned experts in his stubborn pursuit of a flawed hypothesis. When he brainstormed an outline for pursuing the war, he never planned for how it would end. His incoherent strategy in Iraq rambles on and on without any movement towards a successful conclusion. I personally would have failed this student long ago. 
   The question we face today, however, is on whether we should set a strategy for redeploying our troops out of Iraq or continue giving the President a blank check to continue an open-ended war in Iraq. I voted against the war and I want our troops out now. 
   Now that Democrats have been voted in as the majority in the House and Senate, we have responsibilities to our constituents to exercise constitutional and congressional oversight in Iraq. To fulfill that responsibility, I stand in support of the Iraq Accountability Act, which would establish a definite date to end this awful war.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from Northern California (Mrs. Tauscher). 
   Like so many of my colleagues, I stand here today in opposition to President Bush's surge in Iraq. 
   We should not have attacked Iraq in the first place, and we definitely should not escalate things further. The initial evidence for the war was flimsy at best, and realizing that, I voted against the authorization for war. 
   The most recent evidence that the President has presented in support of this surge is even less credible, and I urge my colleagues to prevent the President from throwing more gasoline onto a fire that is already burning out of control. 
   When I speak to veterans of the Iraq war, I become infuriated by their tales of the destruction that this President's policies have wrought in that country. Nor can they fathom why their Commander in Chief insists on squandering the strength of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. 
   While Iraq under Saddam Hussein's rule was a rogue state and an affront to American values, today Iraqi citizens are forced to endure even more severe and deadlier situations. 
   There is no indication that Iraq was a center for international terrorism prior to President Bush's adventure there. Now, as a result of his irresponsible actions, it undeniably is. 
   Over 3,000 brave American service men and women have lost their lives in Iraq in addition to the 100,000 or more Iraqis who have been killed; 25,000 American soldiers have been injured. 
   For what, Mr. President? For what? You have yet to answer this simple question, and I suspect this is because you do not have an answer. There is not, nor can there be, a credible answer to this utter folly. 
   Each Member of this House has tales of constituents whose lives will never be the same because of the Iraq war. 
   In the aftermath of 9/11, one of my constituents joined the Army out of a deep sense of patriotism. One day while on patrol in Iraq, his tank drove over an explosive device, sending the vehicle 10 feet in the air. He survived but suffered severe brain and spinal injuries. For his bravery, he was awarded the Purple Heart, multiple commendations and other medals. 
   After completing a service to his country, he returned home to resume his life with his wife and newly born triplets. 
   Upon returning to work, however, he found that he had difficulty concentrating as a result of his head injury. He was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
   As a result of the strain that the President's policies are placing on the Veterans Administration, he, like so many of my constituents, was unable to receive a change in his benefit allowance in a timely manner. So that he could continue to live in dignity, local officials and media had to put out a call for donations to pick up where his government failed him. 
   This brave man expected that his sacrifices would be repaid with the generosity that America promises to our veterans. Instead, he encountered a system that is overextended and ill equipped to help him when he needed it. Other constituents have told me that when they try to call the Veterans Administration they have to wait on hold for over 2 hours before they can talk to a human being. 
   Is this how we should treat those who put their lives on the line for our country? The Veterans Administration recently testified that it needs a 13 percent increase in funding to address rising costs and increased demand, but the President's budget proposes less than half of that. 
   And now the President wants to further escalate the strain on our already over-extended system by sending more soldiers off to Iraq? I am outraged and I cannot mince my words. This is a national shame. This is not how America repays its valiant heroes. 
   Madam Speaker, we must stop this madness. This surge, this escalation will fail just as past surges have. 
   This conflict requires the diplomatic and political solution, not just simply sending more troops into the fight. We cannot allow this President to shatter the lives of more of our best and brightest. It is time to bring our troops home.

   Every year, I meet with the Filipino World War II veterans who walk the halls of Congress seeking to undo the injustice of the 1946 Recission Act which denied these veterans of their rightful benefits. Of all the Filipinos ordered into combat, only 18,000 are alive today, with each passing day bringing another funeral. These veterans remain loyal to this country. You know in your hearts that these veteran soldiers who fought under our flag deserve the promise we made to them six decades ago. We are a country of promise makers, and therefore, we should be a country of promise keepers. 
   America's greatness is in its strength of character. Now it is our turn in the House to right this injustice. This is not just about the benefits for a few surviving heroes; it is also about our honor as a country and as a legislative body. 
   Let's do the right thing and return to the Filipino World War II veterans their due--recognition of a grateful nation that their service to our country is just as equal as the soldiers with whom they stood shoulder to shoulder on the field of battle.

   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the ``No Child Left Inside Act,'' H.R. 3036. 
   The 21st century global economy increasingly requires scientific and environmental literacy. Unfortunately, due to the narrowing of curriculum under ``No Child Left Behind,'' schools are struggling to offer a comprehensive curriculum inclusive of environmental education. 
   I applaud Representative Sarbanes for championing H.R. 3036, to help ensure our students are prepared to make informed decisions that impact our future, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important bill. 
   I share the gentleman from Maryland's passion for environmental literacy and environmental education, which are also priorities in a bill I introduced, H.R. 1728, the ``Global Warming Education Act.'' 
   I believe that education is essential to ensuring that the public understands both the short- and long-term environmental consequences of dangers such as global warming. 
   In my bill, I sought to establish a grant program to create educational materials, develop climate change curricula, and improve the dissemination of scientific developments in the area of global warming, along with providing practical learning opportunities for people of all ages and from diverse backgrounds. 
   The ``No Child Left Inside Act'' will also establish grants to help environmental education become more effective and widely practiced, and it will provide professional development and training for teachers to incorporate environmental education activities as part of school curricula. 
   It is critical that America fosters an environmentally aware citizenry equipped to make informed decisions that will ensure a secure environment for our future generations. 
   This is why I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize the importance of environmental education by supporting H.R. 3036.

   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day, I rise to urge Congress to support the Filipino Veterans Equity Act. This important piece of legislation will restore U.S. veterans status to the surviving soldiers of the 250,000 Filipinos who were called into military service to the United States Armed Forces by President Roosevelt on July 26, 1941. 
   Of the only 22,000 surviving Filipino World War II veterans, I want to highlight Faustino ``Peping'' Baclig, who currently resides in Los Angeles, California. Peping was among the 75,000 Filipino and U.S. soldiers subjected to the 90-mile trek from Mariveles to Tarlac, better known as the Bataan Death March. He survived the atrocities of Japanese occupation and fought side by side with the Americans, only to have his service as a U.S. national and a veteran denied by the 1946 Rescission Act. 
   We now have a unique moment to undo the injustice of that act and give honor and respect to this brave group of veterans. As Peping tells us, though, ``They pay us to die, but they cannot pay us to live.'' For these men, the Filipino Veterans Equity Act will fulfill a promise we denied them for over 60 years, recognition of a grateful Nation that their service to our country is just as equal as the soldiers with whom they stood shoulder-to-shoulder on field of battle.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Chairman, I rise today to support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), an important step forward in the fight for civil rights in the United States. It is high time for Congress to recognize and address the fear of persecution in the workplace experienced by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans. The Federal Government is right to follow the lead of 20 progressive states to extend federal employment protection to the lesbian and gay community, and I look forward to casting my vote in favor of this bill. ENDA ensures that American workers will be judged on their ability as workers instead of allowing ignorance and fear to bar them from contributing to the success of the Nation and enjoying the unalienable rights of ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' 
   Sadly, more inclusive language was narrowed to exclude the most vulnerable, least understood group within the LGBT community, transgender men and women. I congratulate Representative BALDWIN on offering an amendment to re-insert this wording into the underlying bill and I proudly support her effort. Although this amendment was withdrawn, I was prepared to vote in its favor. Despite this compromise, I support final passage of the bill because I recognize that the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. I trust in my colleagues and my leadership that we will not stop the push for civil rights after consideration of this bill, and I reiterate my dedication to further expanding protection to transgender men and women. 
   Finally, I strongly object to the mischaracterization of this bill as anti-religious. Gay, lesbian, and straight people alike, strongly religious and strongly secular, support this important step in the struggle for civil rights. Yet, the authors of the bill have wisely sought a compromise for those who still hold a religious objection to these civil rights protections by crafting exemptions for religious organizations and schools. 
   I am proud to vote for this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT EXPANSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my support for H.R. 3567, the Small Business Investment Expansion Act. In particular, Title V of the Small Business Investment Expansion Act modernizes the definition of a small business so that it reflects current reality. In today's economy, there are many small companies entering high technology, capital-intensive industries that receive venture capital investment. 
   Many of these small companies are based in my home State of California. California is one of the most innovative States in the country, with the San Francisco Bay area as the birthplace of the biotechnology industry. From 2000 to 2003, California biotech companies developed 32 breakthrough drugs, and over 600 new therapies are currently in the research and development pipeline. Private investment is the lifeblood of the biotechnology industry, and venture capital investment in life sciences typically outpaces investment in any other industry. This venture capital investment  allows small biotechnology companies to pursue breakthrough technologies--from developing cures for debilitating diseases to creating alternative energy sources. 
   Also concentrated in my Silicon Valley district, the burgeoning nanotechnology industry has been predicted to be a $1 trillion market by the year 2017. Many of these small, innovative nanotech companies rely on venture capital investments to support their heavy costs of startup and basic research and development. In 2005, the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology that I commissioned to advise me on ways to promote the development and sustainability of the nanotechnology industry recommended expanding Small Business Innovation Research eligibility in the same way as Title V of H.R. 3567. 
   Unfortunately, the outdated U.S. Small Business Administration regulations currently prevent small businesses from receiving assistance if they rely on venture capital to fund their R&D. Often some of the most important breakthroughs these companies make are a result of the riskier work they do, which only federal funding for small business research can enable. H.R. 3567 will correct this unwise discrimination against small businesses that receive venture capital funding so that these companies will again be able to compete for grants and receive other small business assistance. 
   By making this important change to the SBA regulations, the House will be moving forward on another piece of our Innovation Agenda and helping to keep America a leader in the global marketplace. I thank my colleague Mr. ALTMIRE for introducing this bill; Chairwoman VEL&#193;ZQUEZ and Ranking Member CHABOT for moving it through their committee; and Majority Leader HOYER and Speaker PELOSI for bringing this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3567.

Res. 1195 expresses our condolences and sympathy to our friends of the People's Republic of China for the tragic loss of life and devastation caused by the earthquake in Sichuan Province.

This powerful quake and its aftershocks have killed over 40,000 people, injured hundreds of thousands more, and destroyed entire communities. The full impact of this disaster will not be realized for some time as rescue and recovery efforts are still ongoing. 
   I applaud the courage and determination of the emergency workers that are placing themselves in treacherous situations while still searching for survivors. The recent report of over 200 emergency workers overcome by a mudslide is testament to their peril. 
   The increased openness to news coverage in the devastated areas is also encouraging and has allowed the international community to share in China's sorrow and witness their massive emergency efforts. In support of these efforts, the United States offers any assistance that it can provide. 
   I would also like to reiterate my condolences and sympathy to the Burmese people tragically impacted by Cyclone Nargis, and sincerely hope that the Burmese regime recognizes the desperate need for immediate unfettered international assistance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H. Res. 1195. In times of great natural disasters, all humanity suffers. As the people of China have come together for a moment of silence, the world community must also unify in support of those that have suffered by these natural disasters.

   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, it is with tremendous honor that I rise today to celebrate the 60th anniversary of a great democracy and our close friend and important ally, Israel. With its strong technology sector in both renewable energy development and high-tech research, Israel is a natural friend of Silicon Valley, which I proudly represent. 
   Israel's contribution to the high-tech industry, from computer processors to cell phones, and its development of life-saving medical techniques, benefit people around the world every day. 
   I have fond memories of my first trip to Israel, whose people, history, and culture have left an everlasting impression upon me. 
   I have supported Israel throughout my career, and will continue to do so. We must continue our democratic partnership with Israel. Once again, Mr.  Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Israel.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in unconditional support of H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. This bill provides a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purposes of a federally recognized government-to-government relationship. 
   Since the annexation of the Territory of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians, Hawaii's indigenous peoples, have been treated by Congress in a manner similar to  American Indians and Alaska Natives. Congress has passed over 160 statutes to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians and has repeatedly recognized the United States' political and legal relationship with Native Hawaiians. 
   H.R. 505 formally extends the Federal policy of self-governance and self-determination to Native Hawaiians, thereby providing parity in Federal policies toward American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. 
   This bill does not grant Federal recognition, but provides a process for Native Hawaiians to be federally recognized. The Secretary of Interior will be required to certify the Native Hawaiian governing entity before it is federally recognized. 
   This bill will also provide a structured process to address the longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The bill provides for a negotiation process to resolve these issues with the Federal and State governments and will alleviate the growing mistrust, misunderstanding, anger and frustration about these matters. 
   This measure is supported by Hawaii's Republican Governor, Linda Lingle, Hawaii's congressional delegation, and the Hawaii State legislature. The bill is supported by the National Congress of American Indians and Alaska Federation of Natives as well as numerous other national organizations. In addition, the bill is also supported by a number of organizations in Hawaii who have passed resolutions in support of enacting this bill. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this measure and advance the reconciliation process for our people.

   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and achievements of my dear friend, Lane Evans. 
   For the past quarter of a century, Congressman Evans led efforts on behalf of veterans, including the fight to give Filipino veterans the benefits that they had been promised. He also became legendary in his advocacy for our nation's middle class. As a champion of these causes he earned the respect of America's veterans and their families. 
   He also stood as a tireless champion in the fight to provide justice for over 200,000 ``comfort women'' who were forced into sex slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. He has been a voice for these voiceless women who are still holding out hope that they will receive a formal apology from the Japanese government for the indignity they suffered. I have assured him that I will do my best to continue his work and legacy on this issue after his retirement this year. 
   Today I am pleased to vote in favor of naming a Post Office after a man who deserves our greatest respect. Mr. Speaker, for his leadership, mentorship and companionship, for his work on behalf of those who would have otherwise been forgotten, and for his unparalleled work these past 24 years, I emphatically raise my voice in support of naming a Post Office after my friend, Congressman Lane Evans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Chairman, I rise today to express my support for this bill and my deep appreciation for the leadership of Chairman Obey in the crafting of this bill, the work of the committee staff, and the spirit of bi-partisanship that has marked our subcommittee and full committee proceedings on this bill. 
   Since being elected to Congress, I have worked hard to become a member of this committee and I find it especially gratifying to have had the opportunity to work on this bill. As Mr. Obey is fond of saying, this is the people's bill. It funds the programs which are critical to the health and welfare of millions of my fellow Americans and I feel honored to be a part of taking this country in a new direction. 
   By rejecting the President's request that we cut critical labor, health, and education programs by $7.5 billion, and instead investing in targeted, carefully considered increases, this bill shows the American people Congress is serious about preserving and improving the social fabric of our nation. 
   Although I am disappointed that we were unable to more significantly increase the federal commitment to IDEA, I am glad that the committee protected the program from the President's proposed $291 million cut. I am particularly proud of the increases the bill makes to Title I--education for the disadvantaged, Title VII--health professions diversity programs, and CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis. 
   The more than $4 billion increase in education funding contained in this bill is desperately needed if we are to continue to lead the world in the decades to come. Our students must have solid educational grounding to succeed in college but just as importantly, they must have the means to afford college. The $2 billion increase in Pell grants will go a long way toward making college a reality for many students. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been deeply involved in the effort to bring awareness to the problem of healthcare disparities. Communities of color suffer disproportionately from disparities in healthcare coverage, quality, and outcomes. The investments being made by this bill in Title VII Health Professions programs, particularly the increase in the diversity programs, are vital to increasing the pipeline of minority health professionals in underserved communities. 
   Finally, I would like to highlight the funding crisis that faces CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis. The budget for this Division has remained almost flat since fiscal year 2002 and this has resulted in a serious curtailment of the Division's programs. There are an estimated 30 million people in the United States affected by a liver or liver related disease. Asian Americans face a near epidemic, with 1 out of 10 Asian American and Pacific Islanders infected with chronic hepatitis B. Included in the bill's 7.8 percent increase to the Centers for Disease control, is a $1 million increase for the Division of Viral Hepatitis. This appropriation begins a long overdue reversal of the inadequate budgets given to this Division since fiscal year 2002 and I would like to thank Chairman Obey for acknowledging the need to rectify this situation. 
   Again, I would like to thank Chairman Obey, Ranking Member Walsh, and all my other colleagues on the committee for their hard work and urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. HONDA. Madam Chairman, I'd like to thank the chairman and ranking member for this opportunity. 
   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, has proposed a national coverage decision memorandum for the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents, ESAs, in cancer and related neoplastic conditions. Recent concerns have been raised by both CMS and the Food and Drug Administration about the use of ESAs in treating anemia that results from chemotherapy. 
   The FDA is currently conducting its own scientific review of the issues. These concerns may be valid for many patients treated with ESAs, but as the FDA noted, they do not apply to all individuals treated for chemotherapy-induced anemia or bone marrow failure diseases. 
   I would ask the chairman to work with me during conference to preserve the Senate language requesting that CMS delay finalizing the proposed decision memo for ESAs for non-renal disease indications until after the FDA has completed its current scientific review.

   Mr. HONDA. I appreciate the three speakers here. I think we are all ex-Peace Corps volunteers. 
   I think the other aspect of AmeriCorps is very much like Peace Corps in that we have invested in folks like ourselves, and the return on the investment has paid many, many times over a service to our country, a service to our community, and I think that the kind of investment that we are looking at in AmeriCorps is the same. And the kinds of monies that have been spent for us as Peace Corps volunteers was what we call subsistence allowance to allow us to be able to do the kind of work we do. Coming home, we have been able to share our experiences and fulfill the third mandate, and that was to return back home and give back to our communities. I suspect that this is the same thing that the young people in the AmeriCorps are experiencing.

   Mr. HONDA. Madam Chairman, it's interesting that folks would be making judgment about what I consider an educational facility. I am a science teacher and a good one. I was a student. I grew up in south Chicago where there were other facilities like the Museum of Science & Industry and the Museum of Natural History, without which, as a youngster, I might have gotten more in trouble if I weren't interested in those facilities. It provided me a place to learn in a very casual way, but it was imprinted in me for my life. 
   The Exploratorium, I went there as a student when I was in grade school, and I remember all the experiences I had there. And as a science teacher, I took my classes there. $300,000 is a very small investment for a facility like this. 
   And by the way, I thought that we were always supportive of public/private ventures, and this is one of them. This Exploratorium is not a private facility either. It's open to the public for anyone who wishes to visit it and learn from it. Why, even people from Arizona can come and enjoy the kind of instruction that's in there. For me, it was life-long learning as a science teacher. It was a great facility to engage my students and expand their thinking. 
   And so I think that this is a wonderful investment. And in the words of people from Silicon Valley, ``return on investment is what you get.'' 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to address myself to the two gentlemen from New Jersey and from Georgia with a question: Have you ever administered and run a school, a title I school, that has an ESEA program? No. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is really easy to criticize and throw darts at projects or even employment, if you will, when you have no idea of what you are talking about. I was a principal of two elementary schools. Both were title I schools. Both had ESEA funding. The Federal law at that time, it is probably still in existence, said that Federal funding cannot supplant local funding. 
   So if you are saying that this is duplicative, it isn't. It is supplementary. It is to enhance the programs that are already existing. And the Federal Government has the responsibility to help programs and help youngsters in this country. 
   It is common knowledge that the State has the primary responsibility of education in their States, but the Federal Government has responsibility also. And in their good judgment in the past when they established the ESEA programs, they saw the need to help States fulfill their responsibilities.  
   Mr. Chairman, it is probably easy to poke holes into something you don't know anything about. It is probably even easier to criticize something when you have no experience and no one is going to challenge that.     
   Mr. Chairman, I am here to challenge their premise, and would ask my colleagues not to support this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the assassination of one of the most prominent leaders of the American Civil Rights Movement, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King made the ultimate sacrifice advocating for civil rights when he was assassinated on this day 40 years ago while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee. His untimely death gives our nation impetus to realize the dream he espoused, and carry on his legacy. 
   Dr. King fought to raise the moral and political consciousness of all Americans. As a Baptist preacher, philosopher, and activist, he was most interested in creating a world where he could peacefully and righteously raise his own children. He was passionate about ending poverty and war, both in this country and abroad. Though he is revered for his role within the African American community, he believed that the struggle he led was ultimately for the liberation of the United States and all those who believed in freedom. In this time of global uncertainty and conflict, his wisdom and foresight should resonate with us all. 
   I would like to share an excerpt from his speech given on April 4, 1967 at a meeting of Clergy and Laity Concerned at Riverside Church in New York City:  
   ``Somehow this madness must cease. We must stop now. I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor of America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as an American to the leaders of my own nation. The great initiative in this war is ours. The initiative to stop it must be ours....... 
   The only change came from America as we increased our troop commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt, inept and without popular support. All the while the people read our leaflets and received regular promises of peace and democracy--and land reform. Now they languish under our bombs and consider us--not their fellow Vietnamese --the real enemy.''  
   Dr. King believed in our collective potential to stand for justice and peace everywhere. On this day, we honor his life and legacy by protecting his dream, and living up to our inherent potential.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 426, recognizing 2007 as the Year of the Rights of Internally Displaced Persons in Colombia, and offering support for efforts to ensure that the internally displaced people of Colombia receive the assistance and protection they need to rebuild their lives successfully. 
   This resolution recognizes the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' finding that Colombia's estimated 2-3 million internally displaced persons (IDP) ranks only second to Sudan as the world's largest internally displaced population. As a close ally and strategic partner in Latin America, it is in the deep interest of the United States to assist Colombia's IDPs in rebuilding their lives in a dignified, safe, and sustainable manner. 
   The violence and poor economic situation in the country has disproportionately affected the Afro-Colombian community. Between 1995 and 2005, an estimated 61 percent of Afro-Colombians who received land titles through ``Law 70'' were forcibly displaced from their homes in a deliberate strategy of war by armed groups, many of whom are paramilitaries. In April of this year, my colleagues and I sent a letter to Secretary Rice urging her to ensure that the needs of Afro-Colombians and IDPs are a prime focus of American policy and assistance. It remains our recommendation that initiatives that help develop the capacity of Afro-Colombian communities, including technology transfers, management expertise, global distribution, and economic growth opportunities, and foreign investment that respects the collective land rights of Afro-Colombian communities, would best stabilize the living condition for the impoverished communities. 
   Furthermore, there must be a concerted effort to provide diplomatic and technical support to help secure the return of land to Afro-Colombians and indigenous communities internally displaced by violence, and to increase aid to protection programs. As a newly appointed member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am very pleased to report that the recent State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill for FY2008 includes important language in assisting Colombian IDPs through stronger economic aid. It is our hope that the leadership of the United States through the implementation of progressive programs will finally help heal this open wound on universal human rights. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 426 as we help internally displaced persons of our close ally Colombia rebuild their lives safely and swiftly.

   I first want to commend Speaker Pelosi, the Democratic leadership, and Mr. George Miller for their leadership in making this issue a priority in the first 100 hours of legislation. 
   As Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I stand here with my friends from the Tri-Caucus in support of increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 and urge Congress to support a clean vote to this bill. 
   It has been 10 years since the last increase in the minimum wage; and, adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage is now at its lowest level since 1955. 
   Over the past 5 years, the number of Asian and Pacific Islander Americans living in poverty has grown by 243,000. In 2005, more than 1.5 million Asian Pacific Islander Americans, nearly 9 percent of all APIA families in the U.S., were living below the poverty line. Certain ethnic communities, such as Hmong Americans and Cambodian Americans, experience poverty at up to three times that rate. The median household income for APIA families is down $2,157 since 2000. 
   Now is the time for us to take a step in a new direction and help to improve the quality of life for the estimated 14.9 million workers in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, the Nation brought in the new year by marking a somber milestone: the 3,000th fallen American combatant in Iraq. In response, the President proposes to send even more of a failed and dangerous policy. 
   How much more heartbreak must American families suffer before the President comes to see what the rest of the Nation has long known: His Iraq policy is an utter failure, one that makes our country less and less secure with each passing day, all at the expense of the flower of our youth. How long before the President realizes that each fallen soldier, sailor, aviator, and marine is a valuable, cherished human being and not just a checkmark on a deployment order? How long will President Bush continue to ignore the demands of American voters who have clearly demanded a new direction? 
   Mr. President, I have asked before and I will ask again now: Why? 
   These policies of escalation have been tried in the past in Iraq. The results speak for themselves: 3,000 brave men and women return home in body bags, their families and friends left with nothing but memories; over 22,000 more returning home injured, their lives never the same. 
   America's credibility around the world and its domestic security have been dangerously eroded. We have plunged Iraq into a civil war, further destabilizing an already precarious region. All this while, at home the civil rights of American citizens are slowly being degraded, often without congressional oversight. 
   On November 7, 2006, the American people spoke loud and clear. They demanded a new direction. 
   This escalation is not a new direction. It is a slap in the face to all Americans. And the fact that the President began committing new troops in Iraq before Congress had a chance to respond to his new plan is an insult to this body and an insult to the people who elected us to lead our country in a new direction. 
   Mr. President, you have claimed that you wanted to start this year off in a spirit of bipartisanship and collegiality. As an equal partner, Congress deserves it, America deserves it and, most importantly, our troops deserve it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1361, the Relief for Entrepreneurs: Coordination of Objectives and Values for Effective Recovery (RECOVER) Act of 2007. This bill makes crucial improvements to the Small Business Administration's disaster relief programs. It will help provide greater access to, and more effective distribution of, loans and grants to those affected individuals in the aftermath of natural disasters. 
   One of the many lessons learned from Hurricanes Rita and Katrina is that the Federal Government must be better prepared to assist all the people of this Nation in times of greatest need. In legislating to improve disaster relief programs, Congress must keep in mind the multifaceted nature of any solution and strive to create equitable access for all affected communities. 
   While this bill takes great strides in making funds available to individuals affected by natural disasters, more must be done to ensure access for the segments of the population that may not be reached through standard means, including limited English proficient communities. Among the communities severely impacted by Hurricane Katrina were the Vietnamese American and Cambodian American shrimpers of the Gulf Coast. For many, their livelihoods were destroyed as their boats were left damaged and not seaworthy. These losses were compounded by the inaccessibility of government aid as many of these shrimpers are limited English proficient and were unable to learn of government programs that could have helped them. Unfortunately, the Federal Government fell short of servicing the needs of this segment of the American population. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure equitable access to Federal disaster relief programs for all Americans. We do not know where the next disaster will strike, but we will be better prepared if we acknowledge that different communities have different needs; access to information in the appropriate language is vital. Congress must do its part. The RECOVER Act certainly adds necessary amendments to the Small Business Act, but I stress to my colleagues in the House, we cannot stop there. To ensure equitable access to all affected individuals and communities, Congress and the Small Business Administration must take the extra steps to ensure that information, outreach, and loan and grant disbursement are made available to communities that are difficult to serve. I trust that this House will continue to ensure proper preparation and full and equitable access to relief programs for affected individuals and communities in the next natural disaster to affect this Nation.  
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. 
   As Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I know that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have faced a long history of hate crimes, from the 1880 lynching of Chinese in Denver's Chinatown, to the brutal killing of Vincent Chin in 1982, to post-September 11 violence against Arabs, Sikhs, and Muslims, including the murder of Balbir Sigh Sodhi, and more recently, the killing of Cha Vang, a Hmong individual, in Wisconsin just this year. 
   Hate crimes are under-reported and under-prosecuted. The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act provides the resources necessary for all levels of government to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability. 
   Hate crimes are unique in that they are motivated by hostility toward an entire community, and are oftentimes rooted in a wider public sentiment of discrimination, xenophobia, and intolerance. The passage of this Act is a step in the right direction in promoting tolerance in our intgrated society.

   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Gordon and Chairman Baird for the support of my amendment, and the Science Committee staff for their assistance in putting this amendment together. 
   I would also like to thank the chairman and ranking member for their excellent work on the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007. I strongly support the work of the National Science Foundation, and as a cosponsor of this legislation, I urge my colleagues to support this passage. 
   Some years ago, I was a high school science teacher, and I clearly remember my students stopping me during one of my favorite lessons to ask the timeless question, why do I need to know this? Science is difficult. Global warming is hard to understand also. Some people are asking, why do I need to know this? Hundreds of years ago, Galileo and Sir Isaac Newton made remarkable discoveries about gravity and the behavior of falling objects, but to this day, most people couldn't explain the law of gravity or what determines the speed of a falling object if they had to. Most of the time people can go on with their lives, their everyday lives, without understanding scientific concepts, suffering no ill effects. You don't need to understand gravity to keep from falling. You don't need to understand your lungs in order to breathe. But global warming presents a new kind of a problem.     
   The understanding of global warming will play a significant role in our ability to actually address the problem. And, we don't have much time. Global warming will cause significant impacts, including shifting weather patterns, drought, rising sea levels, and disrupted wildlife migration patterns. 
   Nearly every point on the globe is getting warmer, and the debate is no longer if, but when, these changes will occur. 
   These threats are the most natural consequences of a worldwide overreliance on fossil fuels and destructive, wasteful use of resources. We have lived on the earth, but we have not yet learned to live with the earth. 
   But we can't just give in to the fear and the sense of helplessness. We can turn the tide of global warming if we have the knowledge. That is why we need to know this. 
   My amendment will allow the National Science Foundation to support the creation of K-12 science curriculum, informal education materials, exhibits, and multi-media relevant to global warming, climate science, and greenhouse reduction strategies. 
   The education provided by this amendment will help people of all ages and backgrounds to make choices in their daily lives and in their communities to stop global warming. They will learn about the complex interrelationships between natural cycles and human activity. They will understand how their own actions and their own informed choices can heal the earth. This amendment by itself is, however, not the answer. A comprehensive and sustainable energy and environmental policy will require the expanded use of green energy such as solar, wind, and geothermal. We will also need to continue to find ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from transportation, from industry, and energy production. We need to increase the efficiency of energy use and transmissions, especially in buildings. We need to change much more than just our light bulbs. But people need to know why we need these things, and this amendment provides for that. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 365, recognizing the 150th anniversary of my alma mater, San Jose State University in California. 
   I'd like to thank Representatives LOFGREN, ESHOO, FARR, Chairman Miller, and Ranking Member McKeon of the Education and Labor Committee, and additional cosponsors of H.R. 365, for the support of this legislation. 
   For a century and a half, San Jose State has provided affordable access to quality education. Founded in 1857, it is the oldest public institution of higher education on the west coast. From its beginnings as a normal school to train teachers for the developing frontier, the campus has matured into a comprehensive university, offering bachelor's and master's degrees in 134 programs, including 69 bachelor's degrees with 81 concentrations, and 65 master's degrees with 29 concentrations. 
   In the western region, San Jose State is ranked among the top 10 colleges and universities offering bachelors and masters degrees. San Jose State is part of the California State University System, the Nation's largest public university system. 
   Noteworthy in this sesquicentennial year of celebration is the fact San Jose State is the largest public 4-year university in Silicon Valley with over 32,000 students and 4,000 faculty and staff members. The university awards more than 4,200 bachelors degrees and 2,400 masters degrees each academic year. Since its founding, the university has sent nearly 300,000 graduates into the workforce. These graduates continue to make significant contributions to the region's rich economy and culture. 
   The history of San Jose State is very unique. The university traces its origins to Minns Evening Normal School, established in San Francisco in 1857 by George W. Minns and other dedicated educational leaders to address the shortage of qualified teachers for the new State of California. In 1862, the school became California State Normal School by action of the State legislature. Although initial enrollments were low, demand for teacher training shot up when California instituted free public education for every child, paid for with property taxes. 
   The years of growth and expansion at the new location in San Jose State downtown, the first alumni association was formed in 1873. The determination of California leaders to support teacher training was evident when a fire destroyed the normal school building in 1880. In 1921, the control of the school passed from its board of trustees to the State Department of Education. 
   As the 20th century came to a close, San Jose State University has developed into a thriving comprehensive university known for ``powering Silicon Valley.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to close by recognizing the current president, Don W. Kassing, for all the work he is doing to make San Jose State University one of the great, great higher education institutions in the United States, melding itself with the National Hispanic University and also providing students and intellectual power to NASA Ames and the other Silicon Valley enterprises in Silicon Valley.  
   San Jos&#233; State ranks among the nation's top universities for its academics and ethnic diversity. The university has ranked 10th in the nation for the total number of minority graduates (African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans and Hispanics with bachelor's degrees) across all disciplines. San Jos&#233; State University has conferred bachelor's degrees in business management and the health professions to more Asian Americans than any other college or university in the nation. 
   Noteworthy also is the fact that San Jos&#233; State is Silicon Valley's largest university and fourth largest public-sector employer. Its 154-acre campus is in downtown San Jos&#233;, the nation's 10th largest city and home to many leading technology companies, including Adobe, Cisco Systems, and E-Bay. 
   The history of San Jos&#233; State is very unique. The university traces its origins to Minns' Evening Normal School, established in San Francisco in 1857 by George W. Minns and other dedicated educational leaders, to address the shortage of qualified teachers for the new state of California. In 1862, the school became the California State Normal School by action of the state legislature. Although initial enrollments were low, demand for teacher training shot up when California instituted free public education for every child, paid for with property taxes. 
   An earthquake in 1868 and the challenges of San Francisco's rapid growth spurred school leaders to consider a more stable location for the new school. Several cities vied for the honor; the nod went to the town of San Jos&#233;, then a thriving community of 9,089. State Superintendent O.P. Fitzgerald characterized San Jos&#233; as meeting every requirement: ``The climate is unsurpassed, the place is large enough to furnish all needed facilities ..... the people are intelligent, hospitable and moral.'' In 1870, the trustees selected a tract of land near local transit called Washington Square from among several sites offered by the city. School leaders moved the college and its 150 students to this 27-acre campus in 1871. 
   Years of growth and expansion at the new location followed; the school added more students, faculty, coursework and facilities. The first alumni association was formed in 1873. The determination of California leaders to support teacher training was evident when a fire destroyed the normal school building in 1880. The legislature promptly provided $150,000 to rebuild. By 1887, the San Jos&#233; State Normal School had an enrollment of 800, highest in the nation except for New York City and Philadelphia. 
   In 1921, control of the school passed from its board of trustees to the State Department of Education and it became known as San Jos&#233; State Teachers College. Under the leadership of Thomas W. MacQuarrie, who was  named president in 1927, there was significant growth and expansion of the curriculum, including the first program for college-trained police officers in the nation. 
   In 1932, the San Jos&#233; State College Corporation was formed, the forerunner of today's San Jos&#233; State University Research Foundation, which for the past 75 years has partnered with the University to manage externally funded research and education-related activities that are so integral to the University's mission. The campus gained university status and became part of the California State University system in the 1970s. In 1990, student enrollment topped 30,000 and by 1993, the campus reached cultural pluralism, with no ethnic majority. 
   As the 20th century came to a close, San Jos&#233; State University had developed into a thriving comprehensive university known for ``powering Silicon Valley'' with the high numbers of graduates who went to work there. Fruitful partnerships with area firms also made possible new programs and laboratories, as well as ALL internships, summer research and scholarships. A unique partnership with the city of San Jos&#233; resulted in the construction and opening of the nation's first joint city-university library. 
   In 2006, President Don W. Kassing accepted the largest single private donation to the university in its history, a $10 million gift from alumni Sally and Donald Lucas to create a new graduate school of business. One year later, during this sesquicentennial year, $15 million was given by alumnus Charles W. Davidson for the SJSU's College of Engineering, which ties for the largest single private donation in California State University history. Building upon its tradition as a teacher's college, the university also received a donation of $10 million from alumna Connie L. Lurie for the College of Education. 
   Having receiving both my Undergraduate and Graduate degrees from San Jos&#233; State University I personally attest to the University's academic rigor and integrity. San Jos&#233; State University continues to be a driving force in educating our future leaders and in developing collaborative partnerships with educational institutions, industries, and communities to enhance the quality of education, research, development, and community service for the State of California. 
   I also want to recognize the current president, Don W. Kassing, for all he is doing to make San Jos&#233; State University one of the great, great higher education institutions in the United States, and we all look forward to the next 150 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (CHILD SOLDIERS ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in very strong support of the Child Soldiers Accountability Act of 2007. S. 2135 addresses the ongoing struggle to protect children from the horrors of war. The recruitment, enlisting, or conscripting of children in any armed force is unacceptable. Child soldiers face increased mortality rates as well as emotional and psychological damage that are often irreversible. The time has come for the United States to once again uphold justice and stand up for defenseless children who are at risk of losing their childhood, their families, and their physical and emotional well being. 
   Currently, more than 250,000 child soldiers suffer at the hands of exploitative, ruthless military commanders. Too often, their cries for help are stifled by poverty, ongoing armed conflict, and political instability; it is our responsibility to take up their cause and punish those who have participated in their torment to the extent possible. There is widespread disagreement on the particulars of what might constitute justification for war or aggressive military action, but it is almost universally acknowledged that children should not be used as combatants in such conflicts. 
   It is imperative that the United States sends a clear and firm message condemning the use of child soldiers and showing our willingness to take the necessary measures to respond to those who would use children in this fashion. Passing S. 2135 is a significant step forward in holding perpetrators accountable for their actions, particularly in light of the fact that the United States has not yet ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which expresses the wide-ranging opposition to the use of minor children as soldiers. Children in any country deserve the same opportunity to succeed and thrive at life; I believe this bill will solidify our commitment to a higher moral standard. 
   By passing S. 2135 we have the opportunity to join the many nations fighting the scourge of child soldiering which is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 2135.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 2786, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2007. I was proud to vote in favor of this legislation today. 
   H.R. 2786 will provide housing assistance for those Native Americans who are impoverished and living in dire conditions. It reauthorizes block grants under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) on behalf of Indian tribes for carrying out affordable housing activities. 
   Included in this important legislation is the authorization of the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant and Loan Guarantee Program, which funds infrastructure development and homeownership assistance for Native Hawaiians. The loan guarantee program also helps eligible Native Hawaiian families obtain mortgages. I was proud to vote in favor of this stand alone legislation in July, which was sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Representative NEIL ABERCROMBIE, and I was happy to see it included into H.R. 2786 today. 
   As a proponent of NAHASDA and the Native American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC), I also sponsored report language in the FY2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill which expects HUD to continue to provide resources to the NAIHC, if authorized. The NAIHC is an excellent program which assists tribes and tribal housing entities to provide culturally relevant, safe, sanitary, and quality affordable housing for Native people in American Indian communities and Alaska Native villages. Its importance must not be underscored, as it is the only national housing organization working on behalf of tribes and tribal housing entities across the United States. 
   With the passage of H.R. 2786 today, we have taken an important step towards the reauthorization of NAHASDA and NAIHC and to providing this community with the necessary federal assistance to help achieve the American dream of owning a home. 
   Providing this assistance to Native Americans is in the best interest of our nation. I look forward to continuing to work to advance the cause of Native Americans, as well as the NAIHC.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (SENSE OF HOUSE THAT JAPAN SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR ITS IMPERIAL ARMED FORCE'S COERCION OF YOUNG WOMEN INTO SEXUAL SLAVERY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my unconditional and heartfelt support for those euphemistically known to the world as ``comfort women.'' 
   Let me at the outset thank Chairman Lantos; the vice chair of the subcommittee, Eni Faleomavaega; and the ranking member, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I really appreciate your support and your strong, clear statements. 
   Today, the House will make history as we consider the passage of H. Res. 121, a resolution I introduced which seeks an official apology for what the ``comfort women'' endured under Japan's Imperial Armed Forces during World War II. 
   On this day, I must recognize my good friend and mentor and former colleague, Representative Lane Evans, whose irreproachable character gave these women hope. The legacy of his spirit has remained with me throughout this incredible journey, during which it has been my personal honor to have carried this torch, and I know that his spirit is with me today too. If he is watching, I would like to thank him for his unparalleled courage and tireless efforts to bring justice and the restoration of dignity to the ``comfort women'' survivors. Lane, semper fi. 
   I would also like to recognize Ms. Lee Yong-Soo, a survivor of the comfort stations who is here today with us. Ms. Lee has been a stalwart and passionate advocate for herself and her fellow survivors. 
   On February 15 of this year, Ms. Lee was joined by Ms. Jan Ruff-O'Herne and Ms. Kim Koon-Ja as witnesses in a hearing before the Asia, the Pacific and Global Environment Subcommittee, chaired by my good friend Eni Faleomavaega. I would also like to thank him and Chairman Tom Lantos for their outspoken support for these women. 
   The survivors' riveting and gut-wrenching testimony about the horrors they endured as former ``comfort women'' brought us all to tears and impacted me profoundly. Their courage and indomitable spirit will continue to inspire me every day. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the House will send a message to the Government of Japan that it should deliver an official, unequivocal, unambiguous apology for the indignity the ``comfort women'' suffered. 
   Too many times we've seen women victimized by war and conflict. The experience of these women is a vivid reminder that the human rights of women around the world are never fully secure. We know that rape, sexual abuse and sometimes murder of women and girls in war are still committed by armies in various countries. One thinks of Darfur, Bosnia, and East Timor. 
   We must teach future generations that we cannot allow this to happen. 
   Mr. Speaker, encouraging our good friend and ally, the Government of Japan, to officially and unequivocally apologize is, in my mind, my heart and the minds and hearts of all those concerned about protecting human rights, the right thing to do. 
   I have always believed that reconciliation is the first step in the healing process, and I am proud to be here today on this truly historic occasion to continue to advocate with every fabric of my being for that principle. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of protecting and defending the human rights of ``comfort women'' by voting ``yes'' on H. Res. 121.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3056, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007. Among other provisions, this bill would repeal the authority of the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, to use private debt collection companies to collect overdue taxes. 
   I would also like to voice my support for an initiative being led by Senator BEN NELSON of Nebraska to provide disabled veterans and persons with disabilities with gainful employment as tax collectors. The Disability Preference Program for Tax Collection Contracts would give an incentive to private collection companies to employ people with disabilities. Despite the pending repeal of these debt collecting contracts by the IRS, I sincerely believe this initiative can provide immediate benefits to people with disabilities and be used as a model program for other services and industries to encourage similar hires. 
   Even after enactment of H.R. 3056, complete repeal of private debt collection authority would still take a couple of years while the existing private contracts expire. In that time, Sen. NELSON's initiative could provide disabled Americans invaluable training and experience to help continue their careers in similar services, likely with the same debt collecting company or even with the IRS. Since much of the same background scrutiny in hiring and job training are used for both the debt collection companies and the IRS, these disabled Americans would have an advantage for employment in the IRS. Additionally, under current Federal law, the disabled veterans would have right of first refusal to become IRS collectors. 
   The extraordinarily large number of returning disabled veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are facing new, unexpected challenges to restoring their lives in America. These disabled veterans face an unemployment rate three times that of the general population. After their personal and their families' sacrifices for their country, it is Congress's responsibility to open doors to the largest number of jobs for the disabled, and these debt collecting jobs are exceptionally suited for people with disabilities. Even multiple amputees returning from Iraq, with only a high school education and expecting their career is over, could easily perform and excel in this profession. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I do not generally support the privatization of Federal tax collecting, I applaud Senator BEN NELSON's initiative to provide career paths for disabled veterans and people with severe disabilities.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in very strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 was a critical step forward in the ongoing struggle for equal rights for women. The time has come to make common sense adjustments to the act in order to make it more effective in fighting gender-based employment and pay discrimination. 
   The American dream is undermined daily as women are denied equal pay for their work. Improvement has come too slowly over the past 45 years, with women's wages rising from 59 cents for every dollar earned by a man in 1963 to 77 cents per every dollar earned by a man in 2008. This gap is even worse for minority women, with Latinas earning 52 cents to every dollar--the least of all racial and ethnic minorities as compared to white men. The Paycheck Fairness Act will facilitate the achievement of equal pay between the sexes. 
   A 2003 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that when all the key factors that influence earnings are controlled for--demographic factors such as marital status, race, number and age of children, and income, as well as work patterns such as years of work, hours worked, and job tenure--there is a 23 percent pay gap between women and men that cannot be explained or justified. 
   Women now comprise 59 percent of the work force, compared to about one-third when the Equal Pay Act was first passed. All working people deserve the same opportunities to succeed professionally and personally. The Paycheck Fairness Act will solidify our commitment to this equality and bring us closer to achieving the ideals put forth in so long ago in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by closing loopholes in the law that have allowed employers to evade liability, providing tools to improve outreach and training efforts to work with employers, strengthening the negotiation skills of girls and women, and enhancing the collection of information on women's and men's wages. 
   It is simply unacceptable that in the past 40 years the wage gap has narrowed by less than 20 percent. We have the opportunity to aid millions of American workers to achieve the American Dream, and so I am proud to support H.R. 1338.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, before I start, I want to thank the chairmen of the Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee, the ranking members on the other side, and Chairman Filner for the underlying bill that we are looking at, and also I want to commend Chairman Filner for his unceasing advocacy on behalf of the Filipino-American veterans. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am glad to have the opportunity today to speak about this important issue and to draw attention to the plight of the World War II Filipino veterans. I rise today to strongly urge my colleagues to support the Filipino veterans. 
   These brave men fought alongside American soldiers under our flag throughout the Pacific Theater in World War II, and the United States made a promise to grant them veterans benefits as they were drafted into the U.S. service under President Roosevelt. Subsequently, after the war, Congress shamefully and unjustly legislated this promise away in two Rescissions Acts of 1946. 
   Nearly 1 million Filipinos who were conscripted into service by President Roosevelt were killed in action in defense of our country, and many of them died as they protected the POWs, who were our soldiers, against the Japanese brutality during the Bataan Death March. 
   I support legislation, S. 1315, which will expand benefits, such as life insurance, education and disability assistance for tens of thousands of current veterans and hundreds of thousands in the coming years. Senate 1315 also restores the promise in our words we made in 1942 to the Filipino World War II veterans who bled and died for our country. Today there are only 18,000 World War II Filipino veterans living, most of them in their eighties, and they are dying every day, and this cannot wait. 
   The Senate has already passed S. 1315 by a vote of 96-1 on April 24, 2008, and I urge my colleagues to follow in the Senate's footsteps. This is the right thing to do. 
   There has been some controversy and confusion about the offset to pay for the benefits in S. 1315. I would like to set the record straight today. This bill will close a loophole created by a case known as Hartness v. Nicholson which gave some veterans double benefits that Congress never intended for them to receive. The bill will return the law to what it was originally intended for all future veterans. It will not take any benefits away from veterans who are already receiving them under Hartness-Nicholson. 
   This all seems a bit technical. I know some Members are having a hard time supporting S. 1315. But what it boils down to is that this is the right thing to do, and we need to do it very quickly. 
   Each year I meet with the Filipino community, and each year I read the roll call of those who have passed away. These are men who are courageous and still loyal to the United States and to the flag, and they hold this wonderful spirit and expectation that we will finally keep our word. You know in your hearts that these veteran soldiers who fought under our flag deserve the promise we made them six decades ago. 
   America's greatness is in her strength of character. When Congress makes a mistake, we have the courage to correct that mistake. We have the guts to apologize and make it right. Let's do the right thing and give the Filipino veterans their due. Let's have a vote on this when we come back from recess this September. 
   I yield back my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from Texas continue to reserve his point of order?

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my thoughts on the two pieces of the $183.9 billion emergency supplemental appropriations bill that the House is considering today. 
   Last year, I joined nearly ninety of my colleagues in the House in sending a letter to President Bush pledging that I will only support appropriating additional funds for U.S. military operations in Iraq during Fiscal Year 2008 and beyond for the protection and safe redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. 
   The supplemental bill the House will vote on tonight does not include a number of important policy provisions regarding the war originally included in the bill that was sent to the Senate. These important provisions called for the responsible redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq and required that troops begin to withdraw from Iraq within 30 days of the proposal becoming law, with a goal of completing withdrawal by December 2009. 
   I am disappointed that the supplemental bill we are considering today does not include these provisions, and instead provides $162 billion more for this disastrous war, without conditions. 
   I have heard and read the frustrated thoughts of many of my constituents who are simply tired of President Bush's war. They understand that we have spent an inordinate  sum of tax dollars fighting a war that should have never been waged. They understand that our economy is suffering as a result of our resources being poured into this war. Tonight, I will vote against continuing to fund this open-ended war. 
   However, Mr. Speaker, I remain in strong support of the second amendment to this supplemental appropriations bill, which will fund important domestic priorities. This domestic measure includes a new GI bill to restore full, 4-year college scholarships to veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to help make them part of an economic recovery like the veterans of World War II. It also includes an historic extension of unemployment insurance benefits and assistance to disaster-stricken areas in the Midwest where unprecedented floods have occurred. The number of Americans looking for work has grown by 800,000 over the last year, and the number of American jobs has declined by 260,000 since the beginning of 2008. Both of these measures are beneficial to our country, extraordinarily meaningful to our veterans, and will address the current economic struggle we face. As a representative of Silicon Valley, the hub of high technology in America, I am also happy that this amendment contains a modest amount of funding to help partially address the budget shortfalls facing the agencies that support our Nation's research and development efforts. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that the amendment funding the war in Iraq is without strings or conditions, but more than pleased to prioritize our Nation's urgent priorities in the second amendment to this appropriations bill. We must continue to invest in a positive future for our country.

   The National Academies' report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' found that the United States ``must prepare with great urgency to preserve its strategic and economic security.'' To do this, we must compete by optimizing our knowledge-based resources, particularly in science and technology, and by sustaining the most fertile environment for new and revitalized industries and the well-paying jobs they bring. 
   As a Representative from Silicon Valley, I am keenly aware of how innovation is a driving force behind our Nation's economy. There is one thread that runs through both bills that I particularly support, something I call teaching innovation. 
   H.R. 363 authorizes the NSF to support research on the process of innovation and the teaching of inventiveness, while H.R. 362 enables the development and dissemination curriculum tools for teaching inventiveness and innovation. These provisions are derived from H.R. 1492, the Innovations for our Nation's Vital Educational Needs for Technology (INVENT) Act. 
   From talking to Silicon Valley CEOs, I have learned that, in especially innovative high-tech companies, the cutting-edge work has really been driven by a few highly innovative scientists and engineers who tend to have many patents, while other employees have only a few. To maximize our Nation's knowledge-based resources, I believe we need to figure out how these people do it and teach others those skills. 
   I am grateful to Chairman Gordon and also to the former chairman, Sherry Boehlert, with whom I worked on this during the 109th Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 65TH ANNIVERSARY OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 9066 AND SUPPORTING AND RECOGNIZING A NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to rise today in support of H. Res. 122. I also want to thank the House leadership on both sides, as well as Chairman Conyers, for their leadership in steering this measure to the floor today. While the resolution addresses events from our past, there is much that we can learn from our history, as has been stated by our friend Mr. Issa. 
   This is a resolution recognizing the 65th anniversary of the Day of Remembrance and supporting the goals of the Japanese American community in recognizing a National Day of Remembrance to increase public awareness of the events surrounding the restriction, exclusion and internment of all persons of Japanese ancestry during World War II. 
   The resolution also recognizes that many in the German and Italian communities experienced deprivations during this time as well. 
   This year marks the 65th anniversary of President Roosevelt's signing of Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, and the 19th anniversary of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which was signed into law by President Reagan. 
   In 1942, some 120,000 people were rounded up in this country, primarily from the west coast, and incarcerated. Families were torn apart. Hardworking people had to sell their businesses for pennies on the dollar and their personal properties. Everything these people worked so hard for evaporated overnight. 
   I spent part of my childhood in a camp in southeast Colorado, an internment camp called Amache. H. Res. 122 also recognizes that many in the German and the Italian communities experienced deprivation during this period as well: public humiliation, detention and, at times, deportation. 
   In 1942, on the domestic front, our political leaders failed. Therefore, today we must work to educate the public about the internment of Americans in order to prevent similar injustices to be forced upon anyone in this country. Our civil liberties have not been in as much risk since World War II, and this time we, as political leaders, cannot fail. 
   True to the democratic process, our Nation has been able to look back and admit errors from its past. I can think of no greater evidence to show why the United States, with all its flaws, still is looked to worldwide as the Nation with the strongest and the fairest form of government. 
   By admitting that the government did wrong in its treatment of its citizens and legal residents who were aliens during World War II, Congress and the President reaffirmed our Nation's commitment to the principles founded in the Constitution. 
   However, we must always be vigilant in the protection of our civil liberties, and in this time of tension as we wage a war against terrorism, we must again reaffirm our commitment to the principles in the Constitution. 
   While national security is always a paramount concern for those of us making the laws, as well as executing and interpreting the laws, we see that there are those in government who continue to pursue policies once again that target our civil liberties. 
   The whole point of the Day of Remembrance resolution is about learning. It is about being persistent about the lessons that we have learned from the American of Japanese ancestry, experience that is really an American lesson on the Constitution and is also a lesson of the American character where, upon reconciliation, there is a healing. 
   There is a healing among not only those who were incarcerated, but there is also healing among those who were affected but maybe not necessarily incarcerated. So victims are both those who were directly victimized and those who were indirectly victimized by the misdeeds of our government. 
   Also, the further learning, when we talk about the Day of Remembrance, is that other communities get to reflect upon their own experience at that time and project into the future when this kind of thing should happen again. 
   As a teacher, I want to reemphasize the necessity for this type of resolution as it continues to teach us the old maxim that those of us who do not learn from the mistakes of our past are doomed to repeat them. 
   In today's current light, I want to underscore that national security is my highest priority. It is our government's highest priority, and I support efforts to fight our war against terrorism. But we must also understand that in doing so, we do not again have a failure among our political leadership. We must not give in to war hysteria. We must not fall back to racial prejudice, discrimination and unlawful profiling. 
   It is critical and important, more than ever, to speak up against possible unjust policies that may come before this body. It is critical that we educate all Americans of the Japanese American experience during World War II, as well as the experience of other Americans, like the Japanese Latin Americans. 
   These people were extricated from Latin America, brought over here, had their documents taken away from them, thus becoming individuals without a country, to be used as pawns in exchange for POWs in the Pacific theater. As this resolution does, we must also remember the experiences of our comrades of the German and Italian Americans who were also victimized. 
   In order to learn the important lessons from our own history, I introduced H. Res. 122, the Day of Remembrance resolution, here in this body. I cannot emphasize enough that the lessons of those dark days are more important than ever. Remembering Executive Order 9066, signed on February 19, 1942, rescinded on February 19, 1976, and the reconciliation brought by the redress legislation signed on August 10, 1988, are still instructive to us today. 
   There is a maturity in this country that I am very proud of. This maturity  says that we can learn from our mistakes of the past and we can also teach to other of our lessons that we have learned. We have learned that the Executive Order 9066 was not signed out of military necessity. It was not signed out of national security. 
   It was not signed out of personal safety and security of the Japanese Americans, but, as the Commission on Wartime Internment and Relocation of Civilians concluded, that it was a result of racial prejudice, war hysteria and the failure of political leadership. 
   The experiences from 1942, applied to our situation in this post-9/11, show us that the Constitution of this country is never tested in times of tranquility. Rather, our Constitution is always tested in times of trauma, tragedy, terrorism and tension, that the very principles of our Constitution continuously need to be taught until it is ingrained in our own character, so that every decision we make as a citizen, as adults, as children, as students, and as policymakers, that we will always be true to the principles of our Constitution. 
   The foundation of these ingrained principles is the light that draws people from around this world to overcome any obstacle to come to this country and be part of this society. The word is out around the world that this Nation will protect individual rights against even the most powerful in its government. The protection of our Constitution is what our forefathers and our veterans have shed their blood and sacrificed their limbs and lives for, in order that our Constitution may live and really be reflected in every action that we have, not only in this body but by every action of every citizen of this great country, so as to, or stated in the Preamble of the Constitution, in order to form a more perfect union.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PINEDALE ASSEMBLY CENTER -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Berman for his leadership. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 109, which recognizes the historical significance of the Pinedale Assembly Center, and I want to thank House leadership for bringing two resolutions on the floor today recognizing the important historical aspects of the Japanese American internment. I also want to thank Congressman Costa for his leadership in introducing this very important resolution. 
   Executive Order 9066 authorized the exclusion and internment of all Japanese Americans living on the west coast during World War II. As we recognize the Pinedale Assembly Center, I want us to place the internment period into a broader historical context rather than just focus on the plight of the Japanese Americans during World War II.     
   Our Nation has always battled the dueling sentiments of openness and freedom on the one hand and apprehension and fear of perceived outsiders on the other. Due to apprehension and fear when our economy took a downturn in the 1880s, the Asian community became the target of politicians looking for someone to blame. 
   In 1882 the Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act to keep out people of all Chinese origin. During World War II, Japanese Americans were the well-known target of the government's submission to apprehension and fear. 
   During this time, 10,000 Italian Americans were forced to relocate; 3,278 were incarcerated, while nearly 11,000 German Americans were incarcerated. German and Italian Americans were restricted during World War II by measures that branded them enemy aliens and required identification cards, travel restrictions, seizure of personal property as well. 
   Our Federal Government has made amends for the fundamental violations of the basic rights of those of Japanese ancestry that took place pursuant to Executive Order 9066, but we must continue to learn from these events. In the post-9/11 world, we need to protect our Nation and our civil liberties more than ever. 
   As political leaders we must not fail to uphold constitutional principles.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I strongly support H. Res. 78, a resolution that would restore the privileges of the House Delegates representing the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, as well as the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, to cast a vote in the Committee of the Whole. 
   For the past 12 years, Delegates and the Resident Commissioner have been deprived of the ability to sufficiently represent the voices of their constituents. The time is long overdue to restore this privilege. 
   Of great significance to the Asian Pacific Islander community, the resolution would give greater voice to the approximate 170,000 U.S. citizens in Guam, and the approximate 60,000 U.S. nationals in American Samoa. 
   Permitting the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole improves the legislative process and increases the degree to which the House of Representatives accurately reflects needs of American citizens and nationals. In this regard, every American benefits with a truer democracy. 
   On behalf of CAPAC, I urge my colleagues to pass this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 932. 
   This resolution signifies Congress's appreciation for the critical work school counselors do to provide students and their families with guidance and support, both academic and emotional, toward obtaining a higher education and entrance into the workforce. 
   In his 2008 budget, President Bush proposed eliminating federal support for elementary and secondary school counselors. Under Democratic leadership, the President's proposal was wisely rejected and this Congress provided nearly $14 million of additional support to school counseling programs, for a total of over $48 million. I am proud of this accomplishment, but feel there is still more to be done to meet the needs of our children. 
   In California, eight in nine high school students attend a school with fewer counselors than the national average. This makes California the State with the highest counselor to student ratio in the Nation; over two times the School Counseling Association's suggested ratio. Students attending intensely segregated minority schools are most likely to attend schools with fewer counselors than the national average. Addressing the school counselor deficit is a critical component of closing the achievement gap that plagues our Nation. 
   As we reflect on the vital role counselors play in the lives of our children, we should remember that investing in our schools is an investment in our future; it is the best investment our country can make. 
   School counselors create pathways to success and H. Res. 932 will ensure our Nation comes together this February to recognize their vital contributions.

   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I rise today to recognize  Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, the month of May. 
   As we celebrate the contributions and achievements of our community, I also want to pay special attention to the 250,000 Filipino World War II veterans President Roosevelt called into military service on July 26, 1941. 
   Of the 22,000 surviving Filipino veterans, I want to highlight Faustino ``Peping'' Baclig. Peping was one of the 75,000 Filipino and U.S. soldiers subjected to the 90-mile Bataan Death March. He survived the Japanese atrocities and fought side by side with the Americans only to have his service as a U.S. national and a veteran denied by the 1946 Rescission Act passed by Congress. 
   We now have a unique opportunity to undo the injustice of that act and give them recognition of a grateful Nation that their service to our country is just as equal as the soldiers with whom they stood shoulder to shoulder on the field of battle. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Filipino Veterans Equity Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF ETHIOPIA -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the passage of H. Res. 550, congratulating the people of Ethiopia on the second millennium of Ethiopia. I introduced this resolution, along with my colleague and fellow member of the Congressional Ethiopian American Caucus, Congressman DONALD PAYNE. 
   Ethiopia's calendar is based on the Orthodox Tewahedo calendar which is derived from the Julian calendar. The West follows the Gregorian calendar. On September 11 of this year, Ethiopians around the world celebrated a new millennium according to their official calendar. 
   H. Res. 550 demonstrates congressional support for the Ethiopian American community, and I plan to use the attention surrounding the millennium to highlight priority issues, including political reconciliation and peace in the Horn of Africa. 
   True reconciliation includes the speedy release of political prisoners and granting members of opposition parties the right to participate in a democratic society. Peace in that part of the word will have to involve a final demarcation and implementation of the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. 
   In the spirit of new beginnings, it is my hope that the Ethiopian Government and members of the political opposition take every necessary step toward true reconciliation. It is my hope that Eritrea and Ethiopia will come to a peaceful and fair resolution and finally be able to work together to encourage stability in the region. 
   Members of the Congressional Ethiopian American Caucus are eager to use the millennium as an opportunity to bring national attention to Ethiopia, the original homes of hundred of thousands of Ethiopian Americans. Ethiopia is a symbol of freedom. It is a country with rich history and culture. Ethiopians made important contributions for the freedom of many African countries and fought courageously to defend its own. 
   This resolution pays tribute to the many sacrifices made by Ethiopians over the centuries. In the wake of a tumultuous period in Ethiopian history, it was important for me to do more to increase visibility around this country that has meant so much to an important, but largely overlooked, minority constituency. 
   We want to do more to show our appreciation to the Ethiopian American community for all that they continue to contribute to our society and, more importantly, to support their efforts to bring national attention to the issues that matter to them. 
   Ethiopian Americans make up the second largest African immigrant community in the United States, with U.S.-Ethiopian relations initiated in 1903. Recognizing Ethiopia's role in the formation of a Pan-African movement and defeating colonial rule are key points in the resolution, and a significant aspect of Ethiopian identity. 
   The resolution also recognizes the efforts of all those who organized the millennium celebrations. The African Union has already declared the Ethiopia Millennium as the African Millennium and acknowledges the critical role Ethiopia plays in keeping peace on the continent. I thank my colleagues for passing H. Res. 550, and I look forward to the Senate vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the passage of H. Res. 1357, which commemorates the 20th Anniversary of the signing of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. This law officially acknowledged the ``fundamental injustices'' that resulted from Executive Order 9066, which authorized the exclusion and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. 
   In 1942, some 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were rounded up and sent to internment camps by the United States Government--not out of military necessity, but as a result of racial prejudice, war hysteria, and the failure of political leadership. Families were torn apart and property was lost. My family experienced this injustice first-hand, and I spent part of my childhood at the Amache internment camp in Colorado. 
   Our Government made a mistake when it ignored the civil liberties of Japanese Americans during World War II. That is why passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provided for a formal apology from the Government, along with compensation to the victims, still resonates strongly with us today. The significance and meaning of this legislation allowed our community to move forward. 
   Redress would not have happened without the work of many leaders in the Japanese American community. Senator Daniel Inouye, Senator Spark Matsunaga, then Congressman Norm Mineta and Congressman Bob Matsui were integral to ensuring that the Civil Liberties Act moved forward. 
   I would also like to acknowledge the role played by the Japanese American Citizens League, the oldest and largest Asian American civil rights organization in the United States, and a group I have a long history of involvement with. The JACL worked hard towards achieving redress, and recently passed a resolution also commemorating the 20th anniversary of the passage of redress at their National Convention in Salt Lake City. I commend the JACL for their dedication to our community. 
   Our country draws strength and greatness from our ability to acknowledge and remedy past mistakes--a virtue that has not only benefited the Japanese American community but has shaped me as a policymaker. Despite our flaws, the United States is looked upon as the nation with the strongest and fairest form of government. 
   Recognizing and commemorating the significance of the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 is still meaningful and relevant today, as this resolution reaffirms our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HONDA. As an educator and a classroom teacher and as a principal of a public school, working with youngsters who come from different language background, I find the amendment quite counterproductive and a barrier. Many parents feel embarrassed that they can't help their youngsters, and this would only enhance that. If in our system that we're looking to encourage children to go to school and pursue higher education, this would be but a barrier. And I'm sure that you don't want youngsters to be not going to public education system and applying for these kinds of assistance. 
   I have a thought though. And we have Fortune 500 companies in this country. And I just bought a phone. And in the instruction manuals, the instructions are not only in English but it's also in Spanish, French and German. There must be a reason why Fortune 500s do this. It's about customer satisfaction. And if this government is about satisfying those who are here in this country, who are citizens, who are taxpayers then we should be also looking at this kind of mentality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Congressman TOM LANTOS. 
   It was with great sorrow that I learned of the passing of my esteemed colleague. 
   When I asked TOM LANTOS for his support in defending a group of women who the Japanese Army forced into prostitution during World War II, I knew that if anyone would understand the pain of war, it would be him. For Congressman LANTOS, human rights violations were not just an abstraction. He saw his family decimated by the Nazis during the same war. He himself had suffered through the horrors of a labor camp. 
   After surviving the horrors of the Holocaust, Congressman LANTOS dedicated his life to advocating for the rights of others. He spoke for those who had no voice through his tireless advocacy as the founder of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.            
   A fellow member of the Bay Area delegation, Congressman LANTOS has been a mentor to me. His thirst for justice and advocacy of progressive ideals will live on in all those he inspired during his fruitful life. 
   Congressman LANTOS will be missed by everyone who had the privilege of working with him. I send my deepest condolences to his family, and echo his wife Annette's comments that her husband's life was ``defined by courage, optimism, and unwavering dedication to his principles and his family.'' TOM LANTOS will forever remain a role model and inspiration to me. 
   I will miss him dearly.

Just to comment about both Congressmen Al Green and Xavier Becerra, they too are also members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus, and so they serve dual roles in their leadership. And I think CAPAC, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, enjoys the leadership, experience and the insights of these two gentlemen, and it makes our caucus stronger and partners with the other caucuses. 
   And it's no wonder that they come to Congress on behalf of the community because the communities there trust these two men and they trust their leadership and their insights and their conscience. So to both I say, thank you.

   Mr. HONDA. Mahalo. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Asian American Pacific Islander community and to commemorate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. 
   As Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, commonly known as CAPAC, I feel privileged to be here tonight to speak of the Asian and Pacific Islander American history and accomplishments. 
   And before I continue, I would also like to recognize you, Mr. Speaker, for presiding over this Special Order and also knowing that you too have worked with other Asian American leaders in your home State, specifically Senator Stan Matsunaga. For that we are grateful. 
   Additionally, I will be highlighting those isues affecting our community and the priorities for CAPAC. 
   The history of APA Heritage Month: In celebrating APA Heritage Month, I want to give thanks to the late Representative Frank Horton from New York and my good friend Secretary Norman Mineta, along with Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Masayuki Matsunaga, that May is now designated as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. 
   The first 10 days of May coincide with two important anniversaries: the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants on May 7, 1843, to the U.S. and the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869. 
   In 1992 Congress passed public law No. 102-450, the law that officially designated May of each year as ``Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.'' The first AAPI settlement in this country dates back to 1763, when Filipinos escaped imprisonment aboard Spanish galleons and established a community near New Orleans. 
   The AAPI community quickly expanding. Currently, there are approximately 14.6 million AAPIs living in the United States, comprising just over 5 percent of the total U.S. population. By the year 2050, there will be an estimated 33.4 million individuals living in the United States who identify as Asian alone, representing a 213 percent increase from 2000, comprising 8 percent of the total U.S. population. My home State of California has both the largest AAPI population, 4.9 million, and the largest numerical increase of AAPIs since 2000. 
   There are some needs. Mr. Speaker, this year's theme for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, ``Meeting the Challenges for Asian Pacific Americans,'' reflects hardships overcome by the AAPI community while highlighting the hope we maintain as we contribute to the prosperity of this great Nation. As our community expands, we must also continue to educate our fellow citizens about the uniqueness of our experiences. 
   The AAPI community is often misperceived as monolithic. Our community is extremely diverse in our languages, ethnicities, culture, and challenges. Aggregating such a large and diverse group makes it difficult to understand the unique problems faced by the individual ethnicities and subgroups, such as the Southeast Asian Americans, who are refugees that fled their home countries during the late 1970s and the early 1980s. As a country, we need to better address the needs of the AAPI community when we discuss comprehensive immigration reform, education, health issues, and veterans' affairs. 
   Comprehensive immigration reform: Mr. Speaker, our Nation was founded by immigrants who valued freedom and liberty, who sought to be free from persecution and from tyranny. Families fled their home countries to seek refuge in this great Nation because they too believed in ``liberty, justice, and freedom for all.'' It is in this spirit that  CAPAC supports immigration legislation that shifts the debate from an exclusionary, anti-immigrant, enforcement-only approach to one that confronts the social and economic realities behind immigration; honors the dignity of all families and communities; and recognizes the economic, social, and cultural contributions of immigrants to our great country. 
   Today, AAPIs constitute a growing and vibrant piece of the American fabric. In 2005 close to 9 million of this Nation's foreign born were born in Asia, constituting approximately one quarter of the foreign-born population and over one half of the total AAPI population. Even with a relatively high naturalization rate, there are approximately 1.5 million Asian undocumented immigrants living, working, or studying in the U.S., representing 14 percent of the undocumented immigrants in the United States. These include victims of immigration fraud, who have become undocumented due to no fault of their own. Many work and study hard, pay taxes, and yet live in fear with no hope of gaining a path to legal permanent resident status. Let's give these workers and these students an opportunity. 
   In addition to an earned pathway to citizenship, family reunification is a high priority in the AAPI community. Immigration reform must espouse the family values that are so fundamental to our national ideals. Family members provide care for the sick, for their children, and for their elderly. Family members are crucial for small businesses and educational opportunities. Close to 2 million AAPIs wait years, sometimes even decades, in order to reunite with their families in the United States. AAPI families who seek to be reunited with their family members overseas have not seen their dreams come true because of our dysfunctional immigration system. We need comprehensive immigration reform to address these backlogs. 
   And education: In addition to immigration reform, expanding educational access for all Americans is also a high priority for CAPAC. Mr. Speaker, as Americans, we need to ensure that our children receive a quality education by providing adequate teacher training, funds for after-school and extra-curricular activities, and ensuring that college is affordable for every student who desires to receive a higher education. 
   According to the U.S. Census, 41 percent of Asians age 25 and over have a bachelor's degree or higher level of education. However, when the data is disaggregated for AAPI subgroups, we find that the ``model minority'' stereotype is, in fact, a myth. According to the 2000 Census, only 9.1 percent of Cambodian Americans, 7.4 percent of Hmong Americans, 7.6 percent of Lao Americans, 19.5 percent of Vietnamese Americans, and 16.5 percent of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders who are 25 years and older have a bachelor's degree or higher degrees. 
   These numbers show that we must do a better job of disaggregating the data and information about our communities to assess the needs of those hardworking Americans who still falter behind. 
   To address the disparities between subgroups of the larger AAPI community, we need Congress to pass the Asian American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions bill, which my colleague from Oregon, Representative David Wu, has introduced in January. This legislation will provide Federal grants to colleges and universities that have an enrollment of undergraduate students that is at least 10 percent AAPI and at least 50 percent of its degree-seeking students receive financial assistance. 
   As a caucus, we will work to increase the availability of loan assistance, scholarships, and programs to allow AAPI students to attend a higher education institution; to ensure full funding for teachers and bilingual education programs under the No Child Left Behind law to support English language learners; and to support full funding of minority outreach programs for access to higher education such as the TRIO programs to expand services to serve AAPI students. 
   In health, Mr. Speaker, a common misperception of AAPIs is that as a group, we face fewer health problems than other racial and ethnic groups. But, in fact, AAPI as a group, and specific populations within this group, do experience disparities in health and health care. For example, AAPIs have the highest hepatitis B rates of any racial group in the United States.     
   This week, health advocates from around the country will be participating in a National Awareness Campaign to bring attention to and educate their communities about prevention of hepatitis B through testing and vaccination. In the United States, 12 million people have been infected at some time in their lives with the hepatitis B virus, and more than 5,000 Americans die from hepatitis B related liver complications each year. 
   Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for more than half of the chronic hepatitis B cases and half of the deaths resulting from chronic hepatitis B infections in the United States. In order to break the silence surrounding this deadly disease and bring awareness to the American people, Congressman Edolphus Towns, Congressman Charlie Dent and I have introduced H.R. 366, which supports the goals and ideals of National Hepatitis B Awareness Week. I hope my colleagues will join me in educating our communities about the dangers of this disease. 
   AAPIs are also five times more likely to develop cervical and liver cancer than any other ethnic and racial group. Furthermore, according to the Census Bureau, 18 percent of AAPIs went without insurance for the entire year in 2000. This means that the uninsured are not only more likely to go without health care for serious medical conditions, they are also more likely to go without routine care, less likely to have a regular source of care, less likely to use preventive services, and have viewer visits per year. 
   At the same time, without appropriate language translation services or properly translated materials, limited English proficient immigrants cannot receive adequate care as well as State and Federal benefits for which they may be eligible. In the AAPI community, 76 percent of Hmong Americans, 61 percent of Vietnamese Americans, 62 percent of Korean Americans and 39 percent of Tongans speak limited English. Therefore, eliminating health care disparities in the AAPI community must include data collection, linguistically appropriate and culturally competent services and access to health insurance. 
   CAPAC has been working with both the Congressional Hispanic and Black Caucuses on the Health Care Equity and Accountability Act to eliminate ethnic and racial health disparities for all of our communities. The act would expand the health care safety net, diversify the health care workforce, combat diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities, emphasize prevention and behavioral health, and promote the collection and dissemination of data and enhance medical research. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to extend my gratitude to the patriotic men and women serving our country in the military, including the 62,378 AAPIs who are on active duty in the military, and the 7,904 AAPIs who are currently deployed in the global war on terrorism. I also commend and thank the 446,000 AAPI veterans who have fought for our country. 
   I would like to highlight and honor the Filipino veterans who have not been compensated or recognized for their service, which I believe is a national disservice to these brave veterans. As a country, it is our duty to ensure these veterans have equal access to all of the benefits and treatment that other veterans receive. We believe that our troops should be taken care of when we send them into battle and that they should be given the respect when they return home. Therefore, CAPAC endorses H.R. 760, the Filipino Veterans Equity Act introduced by Representative Bob Filner, who chairs the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. CAPAC thanks Representaive Filner for his leadership on this issue. 
   H.R. 760 would do justice by providing the full benefits promised to all Filipino veterans who fought in World War II under the command of the U.S. military. The Filipino Veterans Equity Act would eliminate the disparities and  benefits between some Filipino veterans and restore the honor and dignity they so deserve. With Congressman Filner as the Chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we have a great chance to get this bill to the floor. 
   There are many firsts among the AAPIs. I am proud of our community's accomplishments, and I would like to recognize many of the AAPIs first in areas of art, film, sports, science, academia and politics, but also emphasize that they should not be the last. 
   In 1847, Yung Wing, a Chinese American, graduated from Yale University and became the first AAPI to graduate from an American university. 
   In 1863, William Ah Hang, a Chinese American, became the first AAPI to enlist in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War. 
   In 1922, Anna May Wong, in her lead role in ``The Toll of the Sea,'' at the age of 17 became the first AAPI female to become a movie star, achieving stardom at a time when prejudice against the Chinese in the United States was rampant. 
   In 1944, An Wang, a Chinese American who invented the magnetic core memory, revolutionized computing and served as a standard method for memory retrieval and storage. And today we have iPods that are smaller than a deck of cards that can hold up to four gigabytes of information, all coming from this 1944 invention by An Wang. 
   During World War II, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team of the United States Army, comprised mostly of Japanese Americans, became the most highly decorated unit of its size in the history of the U.S. Army, including 22 Medal of Honor recipients, Senator Daniel Inouye being one of them. 
   In 1946, Wing F. Ong, a Chinese American of Arizona, became the first AAPI to be elected to State office. 
   In 1947, Wataru ``Wat'' Misaka became the first ethnic minority and the first AAPI to play in the National Basketball Association for the New York Knicks. How about that? 
   In 1948, two Californian divers, Dr. Samuel Lee, a Korean American, and Victoria Manalo Draves, a Filipina American, became the first AAPIs to win Olympic gold medals for the U.S. 
   In 1956, Dalip Singh Saud, an Indian American, became the very fist AAPI to be elected to the U.S. Congress. 
   In 1959, Hiram Leong Fong, a Chinese American, became the first AAPI to be elected as a United States Senator and is the only AAPI to actively seek the Presidential nomination of a major party. 
   In 1965, Patsy Takemoto Mink, a Japanese American, becames the first AAPI woman and woman of color elected to the United States Congress. 
   In 1971, Judge Herbert Choy, late Ninth Circuit Court judge, became the first AAPI to sit on the Federal bench. 
   In 1985, Haing Ngor, a Cambodian American survivor of the Khmer Rouge regime, became the first AAPI to win an Academy Award for his role in ``The Killing Fields'' movie. 
   In 1985, Ellison Onizuka, grandson of a Japanese immigrant, became the first AAPI astronaut to reach outer space, and in 1986 died in the space shuttle explosion of the Challenger. 
   In 2000, Secretary Norman Mineta was confirmed as Secretary of Commerce under President Clinton and became the very first AAPI to hold a cabinet post; then continued his service to America as Secretary of Transportation under President Bush. 
   In 2001, Secretary Elaine Chao was confirmed as Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush, becoming the first AAPI female to hold a cabinet position. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Asian and Pacific Islander American community continues to fight for our civil rights as Americans. Even after the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, we as a community did not grow embittered or cowed by discrimination; instead, we progressed and moved forward. 
   I am a proud member of the AAPI community, and I am proud to be one because we continue to serve as positive contributors to our many communities by investing in education, business and cultural opportunities for all Americans. 
   In closing, this Asian Pacific American Heritage Month we take pride in our history, accomplishments and the promise of our future as we continue to pave the way for a better tomorrow and a better America.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5940, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act. 
   I commend Chairman Bart Gordon and the other members of the Science and Technology Committee, on which I am proud to have once served, for the hard work and thoughtful consideration that went into this bill. I am pleased that this bill includes numerous provisions that I originally proposed in my own legislation, the Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities, NANO, Act, H.R. 3235. 
   Nanotechnology has the potential to create entirely new industries and radically transform the basis of competition in other fields, and I am proud of my work with former Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert on the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 to foster research in this area. 
   But one of the things policymakers have heard from experts is that while the United States is a leader in nanotechnology research, our foreign competitors are focusing more resources and effort on the commercialization of those research results than we are. 
   Both H.R. 5940 and my own bill would focus America's nanotechnology research and development programs on areas of national need such as energy, health care, and the environment, and have provisions to help assist in the commercialization of nanotechnology. 
   In recent months, there has been much discussion about potential health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. Uncertainty is one of the major obstacles to the commercialization of nanotechnology--uncertainty about what the risks might be and uncertainty about how the Federal Government might regulate nanotechnology in the future. Both my bill and H.R. 5940 require the development of a nanotechnology research plan that will ensure the development and responsible stewardship of nanotechnology. 
   Other important areas that are addressed by both H.R. 5940 and H.R. 3235 include: the development of curriculum tools to help improve nanotechnology education; the establishment of educational partnerships to help prepare students to pursue postsecondary education in nanotechnology; support for the development of environmentally beneficial nanotechnology; and the development of advanced tools for simulation and characterization to enable rapid prediction, characterization and monitoring for nanoscale manufacturing. 
   I am also pleased that H.R. 5940 will require that the NNI Advisory Panel must be a stand-alone advisory committee. This is a concept, I originally proposed in 2002 in the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board Act, H.R. 5669 in the 107th Congress. 
   I would like to thank the members of the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology, BRTFN, a panel of California nanotechnology experts with backgrounds in established industry, startup companies, consulting groups, nonprofits, academia, government, medical research, and venture capital that I convened with then-California State Controller Steve Westly during 2005, for the important recommendations included in its report, Thinking Big About Thinking Small, many of which are reflected in the bill we are considering today. I would also like to thank Scott Hubbard, who was the director of the NASA Ames Research Center at that time and who served as working chair of the BRTFN, and all of the staff at Ames whose hard work made the task force run so well and helped produce a great report. The report is available on my website at http://honda.house.gov/issues/links/brtfn &lt;report &lt; final.pdf. 
   Again, I congratulate the Science and Technology Committee and Chairman Gordon for their work on this bill and thank them for incorporating so many of the provisions from my bill into H.R. 5940, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to reauthorize the Nation's nanotechnology research and development program.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. I commend Speaker PELOSI and Representative  DINGELL for bringing this important legislation to the floor for consideration. 
   I strongly believe that Medicare should ensure that seniors have access to the drugs and biologics they need. I applaud the leadership's effort to avoid the use of government price controls and restrictive formularies, while broadening the effort to make medication more affordable for our seniors. 
   It is critical that the Secretary structure the negotiation process so that the result does not limit seniors' access to both proven and new therapies. 
   Small, emerging biotechnology companies are researching and developing cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and other devastating diseases. The majority of these companies are small companies without approved products, which are highly reliant on the public and private capital markets. 
   As Medicare negotiates prices, we must be careful to protect this important research, which is costly and takes a long time to come to fruition but has added much to our quality of life. 
   I believe that this legislation is an important first step in achieving important cost savings for our seniors and urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. For decades, increases in college tuition have outpaced inflation, posing financial challenges to many students and families. 
   As a former teacher, school principal and school board member, I am committed to providing our students with greater access to a higher education, thereby ensuring that America remains competitive in the global economy. Having well-trained teachers in our classrooms is essential to preparing our children for the jobs of tomorrow. 
   It is estimated that over 2 million new teachers will be needed in the next 10 years. H.R. 4137 provides individuals seeking a rewarding career in teaching more opportunities to enroll in high-quality teacher preparation programs. 
   This legislation will enhance the teacher workforce by establishing Centers of Excellence in teacher training and providing grants to community colleges to establish or improve teacher preparation and professional development programs. H.R. 4137 will also help improve reading for as many as 10 million struggling readers. 
   During my tenure as a school administrator, I successfully established a program for students with dyslexia. Central to this program was the specialized training every teacher received on how to address the needs of students with reading difficulties. 
   After more than 20 years, there still appears to be a gap between what is known about effective reading structure and how teachers are being trained. H.R. 4137 includes provisions to expose this gap by examining the quality and extent to which teacher training programs are based on the recommendations of the congressionally requested National Reading Panel.

<DOCNO>Mr. HONDA. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE PERSONS, GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IMPOVERISHED, DISADVANTAGED OR OTHERWISE IN POVERTY -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 198, a resolution introduced by Congresswoman Barbara Lee that expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should set a national goal of cutting poverty in half over the next 10 years. 
   Poverty can be defined as meaning a lack of the basic necessities of life such as food, shelter, clothing, health care, education, security, and opportunity. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2006 over 38.7 million men, women and children across this country struggled to survive on an annual income well below the national poverty line. The number of people living in poverty has increased by over 5 million since the year 2000. In a country that prides itself on being the land of freedom and opportunity, and that has a level of affluence unparalleled by any other nation in the world, these statistics are both alarming and unacceptable. 
   I am a proud cosponsor of H. Con. Res. 198 because I believe that any nation that considers itself great must make a concerted effort to step up and do something about the problem of poverty. When the average national poverty rate is at 13.3 percent and growing, the status of poverty in this country should not be diagnosed as simply an unfortunate anomaly, but rather, as a nationwide epidemic; an epidemic that should be treated with the utmost care and concern, because it is a condition that affects all of us. Poverty erodes the health and security of our Nation's most valuable resources--our children and our communities. Strong, healthy communities are necessary for the preservation of the American way of life, a way of life that cannot exist when infected by the ills that are symptomatic of poverty stricken areas. 
   In addition, poverty hits hardest those with the least amount of immunity against the conditions that contribute to poverty. While minority communities have made many significant advancements over the past few decades, a disproportionate number of minorities are still impoverished and disadvantaged. African Americans comprise nearly 25 percent of people living in poverty, Hispanics 22 percent, and Asian Americans nearly 11 percent. Native American communities capture an astounding 25.3 percent of people living under the poverty level, many living in what are considered ``fourth world'' poverty conditions. Many Native Americans on the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations will not make it through the winter due to inadequate housing, warm clothing, and nourishment. In this country, and in this day and age, these numbers are simply deplorable. Unfortunately, they do not stop there. 
   More than half of those living at or below the Federal poverty level come from single parent households, and children ages 18 and younger have the highest rate of poverty of any age group with 17.6 percent living at or below the poverty line. Instead of receiving a proper education in school, learning valuable life-lessons and leadership skills in extra-curricular activities, and partaking in the many other childhood activities that are a necessary part of growing up, nearly 13 million kids will spend the day wondering whether or not they are going to eat that night, or whether their mother or father will be drunk or in prison when they get home, that is assuming they even have a place to go home to. Nevertheless, these children are expected to perform well in schools, meet the national score on standardized tests, or risk having their school shut down thanks to No Child Left Behind system. Children who live under such conditions are not destined to succeed. Most will not graduate from high school. Many will turn to gangs, drugs, or a life of crime, and as a result, spend most of their adult life in and out of prison. 
   Poverty is the result of a deep structural problem that implicates our value system as well as our educational and economic institutions, and it is a problem that permeates into all aspects of society. The costs to victims of poverty are great, but the costs to us are greater. 
   That is why I wholeheartedly emphatically support the commitment to cutting poverty made by H. Con. Res. 198. It will not be easy, but there is a moral, and social urgency facing us. We have the opportunity today to impact the lives of millions and give others the opportunity to share in the great wealth that our nation has to offer.
