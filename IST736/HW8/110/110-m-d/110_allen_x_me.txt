<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (IMMEDIATE RELIEF FROM RISING FUEL PRICES NEEDED -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, my constituents in Maine and millions of Americans nationwide face an unprecedented crisis as they agonize over how  they will pay skyrocketing oil bills to keep their homes and their families warm in the winter ahead. Hundreds have written to me with their concerns. I want to share a few e-mails and letters to illustrate the magnitude of this problem. 
   Amelia from Harrison, Maine, writes: ``I am a 16-year-old girl. This summer, instead of being a teenager and having fun, I am staying home to take care of the house because my parents don't have time. My dad works three jobs and my mom works one to pay for the constantly rising prices of gas, food and oil. With my parents working four jobs, you would think we would have enough money to get by. We don't.'' 
   Marie from Gorham writes: ``I am a single foster parent. I have two daughters with special needs. I am worried sick on how I am going to be able to pay $500 or more every 3 to 4 weeks to heat my home. I can't look my foster daughters in their eyes and tell them I can't afford to keep them. We are their family.'' 
   Michael from Topsham wrote on behalf of his 87-year old father-in-law, who lives alone Auburn, Maine: ``Last year his oil fuel cost was approximately $6,400. He is a retired Army Reserve Master Sergeant with 20 years of service. His annual expenditure for fuel oil this year would likely be $10,200. This would consume 85 percent of his annual income of $12,000. Our elderly American citizens will be unable to financially manage these costs. Our government needs to intervene and help our elderly citizens during this unprecedented fuel crisis.'' 
   Marie, Amelia and Michael's stories are just a few examples of the human toll from soaring heating oil prices. More than 8 in 10 Mainers rely on oil to heat their homes. The average Maine household uses between 800 and 1,000 gallons of heating oil a winter. The median home income in Maine is $43,000. At current prices, the average home will pay between $3,700 and $4,700 just to heat their homes. Many will spend more than $5,000. This is more than 10 percent of the gross income for the median income household in 5 months. Coupled with soaring costs for gasoline, food and other essentials, people worry they may have to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families. 
   Madam Speaker, this Congress must act now before the winter freeze sets in. We need a new comprehensive energy policy to free ourselves from foreign oil. The people in Maine and America are suffering right now, and we need to provide them with immediate relief in the short term to help them get through the winter. 
   I have a plan to do just that. First, we must fully fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, and weatherization programs to help the poor, the disabled and the elderly on fixed income. 
   Second, we must provide relief for middle-class families fighting to make ends meet. 
   Last week, Carolyn McCarthy of New York and I introduced H.R. 6605, the Home Heating Fuels Cost Relief Act. Our legislation would provide a $1,000 refundable tax credit for individuals, $2,000 for families, toward the price of home heating oil, as well as a program to provide up to $10,000 in low interest loans for families to weatherize their homes 
   Third, soaring gas prices and heating oil prices are crippling small business like independent truckers and lobstermen. These businesses are the backbone of the Maine economy. I have introduced H.R. 2133, the Small Business Fuel Cost Relief Act, to create a tax credit for eligible businesses for any amount they spend on fuel, including gasoline, diesel, natural gas and heating oil, over the price on Labor Day 2004, adjusted for inflation. 
   Madam Speaker, families and small businesses in Maine and across America work hard for the money they spend on fuel. They deserve leadership in Washington that will act now to bring immediate relief from rising gasoline and heating fuel prices. 
   They also demand leadership to change direction and implement an energy policy that harnesses American ingenuity and entrepreneurship to reduce dependence on foreign oil, maximize conservation and efficiency, perfect alternative fuels and technologies, create jobs, and put America on the path to sustainable, affordable energy future. That is the task this Congress faces.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, we have a health care crisis in America. Rising health care costs are overwhelming individuals, families and businesses, large and small. We have a staggering 41 million individuals, nearly one in six Americans, without health insurance. In America, that is just not fair. 
   Millions more Americans have only catastrophic coverage, with $5,000 to $15,000 deductibles. Others have policies with copays so high that basic health care needs, including preventive and diagnostic service, are not met. Many families are literally one serious illness away from bankruptcy. 
   To fix our broken economy, we have to fix our broken health care system. We must build a stronger, more effective health care system before it is too late. The future of our country and our ability to compete in the global economy depend on it. I believe that every American has a right to quality, affordable health care that doesn't blunt the competitive edge of employers or unduly burden taxpayers. It is time for bold action. 
   I have created the Healthy Americans Plan to relieve the strain on families and individuals, ease the burden on businesses and nonprofits and drive down costs. It builds on the strengths of the existing American health care system, but provides new and better choices for businesses, the self-employed, families and individuals. 
   My plan will offer quality, affordable health insurance choices like those available to Members of Congress. My plan will help small businesses offer employee health coverage by providing them with a refundable tax credit. It also improves access to medical care in rural areas and provides relief for middle-class families and individuals who are struggling to afford health insurance. 
   The key elements of my plan include the following: 
   All Americans, including the self-employed and owners and employees of small businesses, will be guaranteed the freedom to purchase a quality plan that is affordable and right for them. 
   Americans who like their current health care coverage will have the security of knowing they can keep it. 
   Insurers will have to compete for business on the basis of cost and quality, not by profiting from and discriminating against people because of age or preexisting conditions. 
   National choices will include private plans as well as a nationwide option, a  nationwide public option. Employees enrolled in the national plan will be able to keep their plan even if they change jobs, move to a different State or have changes in their medical condition. 
   Costs will be driven down, with comprehensive measures designed to improve quality and promote efficiency, including investing in health information technology. 
   Under my plan, people aged 55 to 65 will be allowed to buy into Medicare to provide security to early retirees, who are often charged higher premiums based on their age and risk of incurring higher medical costs. 
   My plan ensures that all children have access to health insurance by expanding the SCHIP program and improving outreach and enrollment. 
   It eliminates barriers so parents can cover their children up to age 25 under their family insurance plan. 
   Middle-class Americans deserve a health care system with affordable insurance premiums and access to the best possible care. Small business owners need a system that allows them to stay competitive and provide good coverage for their employees. 
   Older Americans and younger Americans, two of our most vulnerable populations, need a system that guarantees access to necessary care, regardless of income level. 
   We need experienced, dedicated leadership to address the fundamental shortcomings of our existing health care system. My Healthy Americans Plan will make the system more efficient and cost-effective and will improve access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (LIMITING USE OF FUNDS TO ESTABLISH ANY MILITARY INSTALLATION OR BASE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2929, the Lee-Allen bill to ban permanent bases in Iraq. 
   Regardless of one's position on U.S. military operations, we can all agree on the need for the Iraqi Government to succeed. The perception that the United States plans a permanent presence in Iraq fuels the resentment against our troops and complicates the path towards political reconciliation in Iraq. Too many Iraqis believe that we intend to stay in their country indefinitely. 
   A clear statement by Congress, not part of a larger bill, that we do not intend a long-term or permanent military presence in Iraq is necessary to send a strong signal to the Iraqi people and to the world. It supports our goal of handing over responsibility for security and public safety to Iraqi forces. 
   Passage last year of prohibitions on permanent bases in Iraq based on legislation I wrote with the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) marked perhaps the first time Congress legislated to change the direction of our Iraq policy. In total, three ``no permanent base'' provisions have been enacted. H.R. 2929 make these permanent. Twice the House has rejected amendments to weaken these provisions. 
   Recent statements by administration officials, however, are troubling. The White House Press Secretary said recently the President envisions a United States military presence in Iraq ``as we have in South Korea,'' where American troops have been based for more than 50 years. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates made similar comments. 
   H.R. 2929 reaffirms that the United States has a clear and consistent policy against a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq. I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT: RESTORING FAIR ELECTIONS IN THE WORKPLACE -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Employee Free Choice Act. It is natural to believe, as most Americans do, that since workplace elections have secret ballots, they are similar to the elections we have for municipal, State and national offices. Unfortunately, choosing to join a union is not like the choices we all make at voting booths in November. 
   Americans rightly expect not to be fired or harassed for the way they vote. They do not expect to hear that their jobs may be shipped overseas or that they may lose their health care coverage. 
   On the other hand, the law gives employers that oppose unions with illegal means a chance to do such things. Employers that want to fire or threaten the union-friendly worker can calculate ahead of time that it will only cost them a few thousand dollars in fines if they are caught. And wronged employees might not be reinstated for years, long after the union effort has run its course. 
   Other tactics are legal but unfair, such as mandatory meetings for employees to listen to their employer's antiunion views with no similar opportunities for unions to respond. 
   Workers are subject to intimidation so effective that many are afraid to vote for a union against the wishes of their employer, even in private, even in a secret ballot. 
   One study recently conducted by the University of Illinois found that 30 percent of employers fire prounion workers, 49 percent threaten to close a workplace, and 51 percent coerce employees with bribes or favoritism. 
   These acts are not legal under the National Labor Relations Act, but the fines are so paltry and the legal process so slow that unscrupulous employers are undeterred. People are afraid to vote for a union because they are afraid to lose their jobs and because the law does not adequately protect them. 
   These are not the kind of elections Americans expect at their polling places. The Employee Free Choice Act would bring our workplaces closer to the democratic ideals we do expect. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act would strengthen employees' ability to choose. It would discourage the firing of employees by increasing fines and penalties during the election process. It would require mediation and arbitration to end delays and make sure that the first contract negotiations do not drag out for years. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act would also replace secret ballots with a card check procedure in which a majority of workers, not just the majority of voters, sign cards authorizing a union. 
   Why is it so important to ensure access to unions? Inequality is rising in our country. Two years ago, Alan Greenspan said, ``A free-market society is ill-served by an economy in which the rewards are distributed in a way which too many of our population do not feel is appropriate.'' 
   Whether or not you believe that increasing inequality in our country is tied to declining union membership, one thing is clear. Union workers have better rates of health care coverage, better wages, and are five times more likely to have a pension. 
   Access to health care, better wages, secure pensions, these are things Congress is trying to give back to the middle class in America. Making our economy work for everyone is a complicated, ongoing process. I believe the Employee Free Choice Act is one important step toward accomplishing that goal. 
   In most American workplaces, the process of forming a union is contentious. Yet, though they may differ over issues like wages, health care and pension benefits, employers, employees, supervisors and company owners are all striving for the same goal: American competitiveness in a global economy. 
   Finding a middle ground on the question of compensation, training and health care boosts American productivity, innovation and competitiveness. By giving the lion's share of the power to employers, we not only cheat workers, we cheat our economic future. 
   As we approach 2020, our income distribution is trending toward 1920. Americans do not want to be left to the market-based whims of health savings  accounts, privatized Social Security, or personal job retraining accounts. They want a government that helps individuals provide for themselves and their families. 
   Senator Wagner wrote the National Labor Relations Act in 1934 to ensure that workers would have an unambiguous, unmitigated right to representation in the workplace. He said then that ``the denial or observance of this right means the difference between despotism and democracy.'' 
   Let us give Americans a fair shot at organizing again. They deserve protection under the law. I urge my colleagues to support the Employee Free Choice Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (FEDERAL OCEAN ACIDIFICATION RESEARCH AND MONITORING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his outstanding leadership on this important issue. 
   I also rise to urge passage of my bill, H.R. 4174, the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act. 
   I want to commend Chairman Gordon and Chairman Lampson of the Science and Technology Committee for their leadership and foresight in supporting this legislation to give us the tools we need to manage and protect our marine resources and coastal communities. 
   I also want to thank Mr. Hall and Mr. Inglis for their support on this bipartisan legislation. And also, once again, I want to thank Mr. Inslee and Mr. Baird for their leadership. 
   Finally, I guess I should say a special thank you to Ellen Bolen on my staff, my now Sea Grant fellow who has worked so hard on this particular bill. 
   My legislation establishes a comprehensive, interagency program to conduct research on the processes and consequences of ocean acidification due to global climate change. 
   Ocean acidification has the potential to profoundly change our ocean ecosystems and may seriously and negatively affect commercial and recreational fisheries, tourism, agriculture, and many other ocean-related industries. 
   The impact of global climate change is nowhere more apparent than in our oceans. Icecaps are melting and coral reefs are dying. Approximately one-third of the carbon dioxide released by the burning of fossil fuels ends up in the oceans, altering ocean surface carbon chemistry. Acidic conditions can impede shell formation in important marine shellfish species, and are harmful to many organisms, from corals to shellfish to plankton, that are essential to the food chain for many larger fish and marine mammals. 
   Research by scientists at St. Joseph's College in Standish, Maine, has revealed that ocean acidification due to climate change may substantially increase the mortality of young clams, threatening a $16 million industry and the livelihoods of 1,800 commercial clam diggers in Maine alone.     
   Three decades ago, when acid deposition threatened Maine's lakes, we documented the harm and devised a legislative response through monitoring and research. My legislation will provide similar tools to respond to ocean acidification. To protect future generations, we must understand the consequences that ocean acidification could have on our natural resources and coastal economies so that we can mitigate and adapt to those consequences. 
   The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act will direct and fund key research to examine the effects that climate change is having on our oceans and on our fisheries. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (BRING OUR TROOPS HOME -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my disappointment with the votes we took last week on Iraq. There were some provisions in the amendment that I voted against that I strongly support, including the ban on torture and the requirement for sufficient rest time for our troops between deployments. 
   I helped lead the effort in this House to prohibit the administration from establishing permanent military bases in Iraq. I have been outspoken on the failure of previous Congresses to hold private contractors accountable and to punish waste, fraud and profiteering. But last week I could not vote for these provisions because the amendment did not include a firm, responsible deadline to bring our troops safely home. 
   Let me be clear: Any funding bill that does not contain a binding deadline to end this war is an open-ended commitment to continue it. That's  why I have and will continue to vote against such legislation. 
   It is now 62 months since the invasion of Iraq and 60 months since President Bush's ``Mission Accomplished'' pronouncement. It has been 16 months since the beginning of the troop surge that President Bush and his congressional allies believed would give the Iraqis breathing space to resolve their internal conflicts and assume responsibility for their own security. 
   The vast majority of Americans concluded a long time ago that this war was a mistake. It has strengthened al Qaeda and Iran. It is time to end the war responsibly and bring our Armed Forces safely home. 
   The death toll of brave Americans now stands at 4,072, with nearly 30,000 wounded, many with life-shattering physical and mental and emotional scars. More than one in three soldiers and marines returning from Iraq later sought help for post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health problems. The toll on our military families is tremendous. More than 1.7 million Americans have served at least one tour in Iraq or Afghanistan. Four in 10 of these troops have served more than one war zone mission. 
   Our open-ended commitment in Iraq undermines our ability to meet challenges to our national security elsewhere. 
   We clearly have much work to do in Afghanistan, where the 9/11 attacks originated. We must also be concerned about the readiness of our Armed Forces in the event that a new threat arises elsewhere in the world. And then there is the toll the war continues to take on our ability to address our needs here at home. 
   More than 5 years into this war, we know that it will cost more than $600 billion, but we still don't know what its final price tag will be or how much longer we will continue to pay it. We do know that our national debt is soaring, that our economy is either teetering on the edge or already in recession, and that the price of crude oil is approaching $130 per barrel. In my hometown of Portland, unleaded gasoline has jumped to nearly $4 a gallon, with heating oil now surpassing $4 per gallon. 
   And we know that these fuel costs are draining family budgets throughout Maine and across America. Is there any question that our open-ended presence in Iraq contributes to these soaring costs? Is there any doubt that the money we are borrowing to pay for this war, largely from the Chinese and the Saudis, will leave our children an enormous debt to pay? 
   We are spending more than $3,800 on this war every second. In the time since I began to speak, we've spent another million dollars. These are funds that we could use to fix our ailing health care system, to repair our crumbling infrastructure, to invest in education for our kids, to implement an energy policy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, fight climate change, create new jobs, and stimulate new technologies. 
   Mr. Speaker, more than 140,000 courageous and capable American forces remain in Iraq. They continue to serve with great ability and tremendous courage in the crossfire of a bloody, intractable religious civil war waged, in one form or another, for more than a thousand years. 
   We need much more than a change in mission for fighting the war in Iraq. Congress must change policy through a firm, responsible deadline to end it. As George Mitchell demonstrated in northern Ireland, only a firm deadline will compel the leaders of the warring factions to assume responsibility for their own security and their own future. And we need a plan to win the peace by engaging Iraq's neighbors to join us to create a stable, successful Iraq because that outcome is as vital to their long-term interests as it is to ours. 
   Enough is enough. Let's close the open-ended commitment President Bush and his allies in Congress have given to this war. Let's set a firm, responsible deadline and bring our troops safely home.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (THE NEED FOR FAIR TRADE POLICIES -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to trade policies that are unfair to American workers. 
   Congress must insist on a new model for trade that makes American workers the top priority. Trade agreements must also take into account protections for the environment and ensure access to life-saving medicines. 
   Developing trade agreements that take these priorities into account will be difficult, but we must not rush into obligations which will ultimately harm our own interests, and we must reject the false choice between expanding our trade opportunities and fairness to U.S. workers. 
   It is simply wrong to follow the old model that we know hurts the livelihoods of so many of our constituents. That is why Democrats are pushing for new priorities in the trade deals that the administration is negotiating with Colombia, Peru, Panama, South Korea and other countries. 
   Congress must continue to press the administration to change its trade policies and provide specific, constructive suggestions to advance the goals of our workers and our economy. 
   Unfortunately, the Bush administration doesn't act as though it believes that Congress should have a real say in trade negotiations. One example, though it is certainly not the only one, is the matter of allowing access to life-saving medications. 
   Congress has passed legislation directing the administration to respect  the Doha Declaration, an agreement that allows countries flexibility under WTO rules to provide for public health. Although the administration signed the Doha Declaration, USTR has completely ignored Congress' directive to respect it. 
   Every trade pact negotiated since 2002 has contained stringent intellectual property rules sought by the major drug companies. By keeping medicine prices high, these rules increase industry profits but restrict access to needed medicines for citizens in developing countries. Even in current free trade negotiations, USTR continues to ignore the will of Congress to respect the Doha Declaration. 
   That is why a new framework for trade must include a stronger role for Congress. The current model of nonbinding negotiating objectives permits the President to ignore the wishes of this Congress. 
   It is no surprise that the administration has favored large corporate interests at the expense of American workers, the environment and global health. But it is wrong. However, our new majority in Congress will respond to workers who have been hurt by previous trade agreements. After all, trade agreements have affected my home State of Maine's manufacturing, farming and service sectors. 
   Soon Congress may be asked to consider renewing fast track authority. I voted against the Trade Act of 2002, which granted fast track authority to the President. I urge my colleagues to reject renewal of fast track in its current form. It is vital that Congress continue to press for change, firmly and constructively.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act. A college education is the foundation of economic mobility in America. College graduates enjoy higher incomes, better career opportunities and more financial stability. 
   College has never been more important than it is today and, sadly, never more expensive. But in the last few years Federal support for higher education has declined. We have been moving in the wrong direction. 
   That is why H.R. 5 is so critical. It will save middle and low income students thousands of dollars in debt. The bill cuts the interest rates on federally subsidized Stafford loans in half over 5 years. It will save the average college student in Maine who starts school next fall $2,170 over the life of his or her loan. Maine students starting in 2011 or after will save an average of $4,200. 
   Sixty years ago, the GI bill sent a generation of veterans to college. Thirty years ago, Pell Grants and Stafford loans extended this opportunity to more working class Americans. The future economic prosperity of America turns on giving today's students the same opportunity. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 5, to provide for the rules package of the 110th Congress. I am proud that the first act of this new Congress is to pass long-overdue ethics and lobbying reform. 
   Today, we end the era of Jack Abramoff and Tom DeLay, when the levers of government were used less to help American families and more to reward monied special interests. Today, we take a major step to restoring Americans' trust in the legislative branch of government. 
   We will ban gifts from lobbyists, trips funded by lobbyists, and the use of company planes. We will shut down the K Street Project. We will force Members of Congress to take responsibility for their earmarks. And we will ban arm-twisting for votes. 
   The need for reform is obvious. The alliance between the previous leadership and K Street lobbyists came at a disastrous cost for democracy, decency, and the public interest. The best example is the industry-written Medicare D prescription drug bill passed in the middle of the night. The majority leadership held the vote open for 3 hours as they twisted arms and levied threats. Thousands of Maine seniors can see today that the program was designed to serve the insurance and pharmaceutical interests more than the people on Medicare. 
   I am pleased that the ethics package includes reforms that Congressmen David Obey, Barney Frank, David Price, and I introduced 1 year ago. I thank Chairwoman Slaughter and Speaker Pelosi for incorporating our ideas, simple ideas, like ensuring that we all have time to read bills before they are voted on. 
   H. Res. 6 will restore the people's voice to the people's House. Every American family will benefit by legislation that is advanced in an open and transparent manner, rather than written by lobbyists behind closed doors. 
   I urge the adoption of this resolution and the entire Democratic rules and ethics reform package.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (SUPPORTING THE IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on legislation to set a path for the responsible redeployment of American troops from Iraq. I will support this bill because it will end American involvement in the Iraqi civil war and bring our troops safely home. 
   This week marks the fourth anniversary of a war born in deceit and prolonged by mismanagement. I voted against the invasion in 2002; I will vote now to end this war by supporting the Iraq Accountability Act with its benchmarks and timetables for redeploying U.S. forces from Iraq. 
   For 4 years, previous Congresses neglected their oversight responsibilities while the administration made mistake after mistake. The congressional majority failed to conduct thorough investigations, demand accountability, or offer policy alternatives. We have paid a steep price for that neglect, including the lives of more than 3,200 American Armed Forces, with another 24,000 wounded, many critically. 
   The new Congress is providing long overdue leadership, taking action to end U.S. involvement in a civil war with no end in sight. Responsible military disengagement from Iraq is in the national security interests of the United States. There are no easy, cost-free options. But our perpetual presence in Iraq has sapped our military strength, undermined our credibility around the world, and limited our investments in domestic priorities like health care and education. 
   This week, the House of Representatives has a choice: Either endorse the President's open-ended commitment, or adopt a plan that demands accountability, sets a timeline for redeployment, and restores the readiness of our Armed Forces. 
   The President's strategy of indefinite intervention is simply not sustainable. The situation in Iraq has moved beyond our military's ability to shape events in a positive direction. Extending our presence merely delays our ability to recover the ground we have lost, our diplomatic initiative, our global reputation, and the broken state of our ground forces. 
   The Iraq Accountability Act has three key components: 
   First, it uses President Bush's own benchmarks to require the Iraqis to assume responsibility for their own security. If they meet those benchmarks, all American forces would leave Iraq by the summer of 2008. If they do not, American forces will leave as early as the end of this year. 
   Second, the bill supports our Armed Forces by requiring the President to certify that any troops deployed to Iraq are fully and properly equipped, and that their deployment follows Department of Defense standards for readiness and rest between deployments. 
   Third, it provides funds needed to ensure that returning troops and veterans receive the best possible health care and other services they deserve. 
   The American people expect us to say where we stand on the war in Iraq. By supporting the Iraq Accountability Act we are voting to use the long-neglected powers of Congress to bring U.S. involvement in the Iraqi civil war to an end. I urge, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Iraq Accountability Act when it comes to the floor tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, if this Congress is serious about wanting to address the causes and consequences of climate change, then it is critical that we invest in the infrastructure we need to monitor and forecast that change. 
   Earlier this year I introduced H.R. 2342, The National Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observing System Act of 2007. This important legislation would create an integrated ocean observing, monitoring, and forecasting system, modeled after Maine's Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, that could save lives and billions of dollars annually. 
   I am pleased to announce that my bill has been included in this energy bill, H.R. 3221. I commend Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RAHALL of the Natural Resources Committee for their leadership and foresight in including this legislation to give all of our citizens tools that they need to plan for and adapt to global climate change. 
   In addition to monitoring and forecasting climate change, the Ocean Observing System would protect coastal communities and protect the economic interests of ocean-going industries like shipping and commercial fishing by improving warnings of tsunamis, hurricanes, coastal storms, El Ni&#241;o events, and other natural hazards. 
   I applaud this and other climate change provisions in the bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.

In fact, some wood composites engineered by the University of Maine and developed by research conducted under this grant program are being used by the Army Corps of Engineers in Iraq, Afghanistan and worldwide. 
   This funding will allow the University of Maine to continue its strong support of traditional wood products production and enhance the competitiveness of our domestic industry. 
   I strongly oppose this amendment, and I would add simply that I don't know of any program that spins off more small businesses than this wood composite program at the University of Maine.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and thank her for her strong leadership on this issue. The bill that we are considering today addresses shortcomings in current stem cell policy while maintaining strict ethical standards in stem cell research. Embryonic stem cell research offers promise to millions of Americans suffering from spinal cord injuries and chronic illnesses, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, and diabetes. 
   Neither Congress nor the administration should prohibit the medical community from pursuing a promising avenue of research that can improve the lives of millions of Americans. Embryonic stem cell research is supported by the majority of my constituents in Maine and has overwhelming bipartisan support across this country. I have heard from hundreds of constituents who support this bill, including Virginia, from Gardiner, Maine, whose mother is stricken with Parkinson's disease. 
   She describes the conditions of limited mobility her mother faces as horrific. Celia, in Madison, Maine, says her twin sister, Maura, was paralyzed from an auto accident and hopes for a better life. 
   We need to ensure that our scientists can pursue the promising research of embryonic stem cells to help these people and millions like them. We cannot allow the politics of this issue to undermine groundbreaking research, impede science and place at risk the health and well-being of victims and their families. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (RISING FUEL PRICES -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my disappointment that the administration has done nothing to rein in rising fuel prices. 
   The past 7 years have brought hardship to anyone in Maine with a vehicle to fill up at the gas station, a furnace to feed, or a livelihood dependent on affordable fuel. 
   As you can see in this chart, in January 2001 oil traded at $23 to $25 per barrel. This week, it topped $120 per barrel. 
   In January 2001, #2 heating oil cost Maine families and businesses $1.55 a gallon. This week, it topped $3.85. 
   In January 2001, regular unleaded gasoline cost Maine drivers $1.55 a gallon. According to the AAA, the going price in Portland this week is $3.55 a gallon, and rising. 
   In January 2001, diesel for their rigs cost Maine's independent truckers $1.53 per gallon. In Bangor this week, it was $4.33 per gallon. 
   These past 7 years, the oil companies have padded their bottom lines at the expense of the hardworking people of Maine and across the country. For the past 7 years, everyone in Maine has paid a steep price for the Bush administration's disastrous energy policy and for Big Oil's efforts in Congress to block legislation to stop energy profiteering. 
   What has the administration done? Nothing. And they will do nothing unless the people's elected representatives push them to action. 
   That is why I have called upon the Federal Trade Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Attorney General of the U.S., and the Secretary of Energy to launch an immediate investigation of price fixing, manipulation, rampant speculation, and other unscrupulous behavior in the petroleum markets. Inappropriate and criminal behavior by oil companies, their subsidiaries, agents, or employees must be prosecuted and punished to the full extent of the law. 
   These outrageous price increases are a cruel blow for Maine families whose incomes are stagnant or shrinking, and whose costs for health insurance, college tuition, and other everyday expenses continue to rise faster than inflation. Fuel prices are an economic catastrophe for Maine farmers, fishermen, and other small business people. For some of Maine's independent truckers, like those I met on the road in Kennebunk when they were coming down here, unbridled fuel costs when coupled with a stagnating economy may very well put them out of business. 
   As independent truckers are staring down unemployment, oil companies are reaping record profits. However, for one sector of the economy, the last 7 years have been a bonanza. 
   In 2001, the Big 5 Oil companies posted combined profits of just over $40 billion. In 2007, their combined profits topped $123 billion. ExxonMobil's $41 billion profit last year was more than all of the Big 5 combined in 2001, and  smashed the record for the highest annual profit in history for a U.S. company. 
   To put that number in perspective, ExxonMobil's profits last year were more than we spent on road construction; they were greater than the amount the VA will spend on health care for our veterans this year. ExxonMobil's profits were larger than the entire budget for the Homeland Security Department in fiscal year 2008. That is profits, not revenues, and those profits come directly from the pockets of our constituents who pay the oil companies' exorbitant prices. 
   In the House, we passed the Federal Price Gouging Act to give the Federal Trade Commission explicit authority to investigate and punish those who artificially inflate the price of energy, especially those who profit most, those at the top of the chain. The bill has passed the House, but it has stalled in the other body. 
   It is also time to go after the energy speculators who drive up energy prices through off-market trading. Those trading practices are unseen and unregulated, but they do great damage. I support the Close the Enron Loophole Act, and the Preventing the Unfair Manipulation of Prices Act legislation to hold oil speculators accountable to the same rules that already govern traders who are trading on regulated markets. 
   It is time now to roll back the $14 billion in tax breaks and incentives that we gave to Big Oil in the 2005 energy bill. It was a disgrace then, and it is an outrage now. I voted against these tax incentives, tax breaks in 2005, and I am pleased that the House under new leadership has already voted to role them back. But in the other body, Big Oil's friends have maneuvered to block a vote on the rollback bill. 
   Finally, we need to provide targeted relief to the small businesses that depend on fuel, whether they are heating buildings or driving trucks. We need more leadership in the House and over in the other body and with the administration.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, there are 11 million reasons to vote for this bill, and each is a child in a working-class family who will grow up healthier and stronger as a result of its passage. 
   Every dollar we invest in the SCHIP program saves money over time. The children we cover are far less likely to require more expensive health care later on, far more likely to be better achievers in school and much better prepared to become productive adults. 
   SCHIP today provides health care to 6 million children. This bill will cover an additional 5 million children who qualify for SCHIP but today lack coverage. 
   Maine has developed one of the best SCHIP programs in the Nation. This bill offers States the flexibility to tailor outreach efforts to their specific needs and capacities. Failure to pass this legislation would mean the loss of health coverage for millions of children. But every child should have access to quality, affordable health care. 
   I am proud of the comparative effectiveness research provision in this bill. It will reduce health care costs and improve quality for all Americans. It does that by providing doctors and their patients with valid evidence-based information on how different treatments for particular medical conditions compare to one another. This data can help doctors and their patients determine whether or not new or high-priced drugs, devices, and other medical treatments provide better clinical outcomes. 
   This is a critically important piece of legislation. It helps our kids. It preserves Medicare for our seniors. It makes sure our physicians and other providers are adequately reimbursed. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (HANLEY DENNING, ``ANGEL DEL BASUERO'' -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, Hanley Graham Denning was only 36 when a terrible traffic accident in Guatemala took her away from us on January 18. She was revered in Guatemala where she was known as ``El Angel del Basuero,'' the Angel of the Dump. 
   Hanley was a native of Yarmouth, Maine, and a Bowdoin College graduate, with a master's degree in early childhood education from Wheelock College. 
   After college, she helped children affected by AIDS in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and then taught impoverished children at a Head Start program in North Carolina. 
   Because so many children were from migrant families and spoke little or no English, Hanley decided to go to Guatemala to learn to speak their language. While in Guatemala City in 1999, the Portland Press Herald reported, a friend suggested she visit the garbage dump. There, Denning began the work that would come to define her life. 
   On that trip to the dump, the largest in Central America, Hanley was shocked to see a tiny hand reaching out from a cardboard box. ``At first she thought it was a doll, then she realized it was a baby,'' her friend Rachel Meyn told the Press Herald. ``The image kept playing over and over in her head,'' Meyn added, ``and from then on she decided she had to do something.'' What Hanley Denning did was to sell her car and her computer, convert an old chapel near the dump into a drop-in center for the children, and give 40 Guatemalan boys and girls a refuge from the filth and stench of the dump. 
   Hanley soon learned that the health hazards at the dump were only a small part of the danger facing these children. Most came from single-parent households, where mothers scavenged the dump, often helped by the children, to find scrap to sell in order to buy food. Drug abuse, crime, child abuse, and predation were rampant. Hanley decided to create an environment where the children could escape harm and find the kind of encouragement that she as a former Head Start teacher knew would give them a better chance to grow into healthy successful adults. She called it ``Camino Seguro,'' Safe Passage. The mothers and the children of Guatemala call Hanley Denning ``Angel del Basuero,'' Angel of the Dump. 
   Eight years later, Hanley's modest effort has grown into a program that helps more than 500 needy children at three sites. It has an annual budget of $1.6 million and 100 Guatemalan staff members, including teachers, social workers, cooks, and other support staff. There is a three-story educational reinforcement center, with 13 classrooms, a fully stocked library, a computer lab with 13 computers, a kitchen for preparing 550 lunches daily, a medical clinic serving all children and their family members, and a garden. Teens can receive vocational training, mothers and grandmothers can attend adult literacy and parenting classes. 
   In addition to their daily hot lunches, each child who attends regularly receives a monthly food bag for their family. Nearly 600 children fated to scavenge the dump like their parents are now in school. ``I used to look into the children's eyes and see the adults they would become,'' Hanley once told the reporter. ``Now they have a little hope. I see a bit more spark.'' 
   But the success of Safe Passage is only part of Hanley Denning's legacy. Her angelic touch reached beyond the Guatemalan slums and into the lives of hundreds of volunteers, many of them teenagers, who worked for Safe Passage over the years. There are 50 volunteers working at Safe Passage in any given month, including 20 long-term volunteers who make a 1-year or 2-year commitment to the program. 
   As Jason Moyer-Lee told the Portland Press Herald's Bill Nemitz, ``I couldn't believe that someone from my town who went to my high school could actually make something like that happen. When Hanley sat down and talked to you, she made you feel like, without your help, Safe Passage couldn't happen,'' he said. ``It didn't matter how much you gave or how little, she made you feel like you were the number one contributor.'' 
   ``I've never loved more than when I was combing lice out of children's hair,'' added Aly Spaltro, a Brunswick High School senior who volunteered at Safe Passage in the past and plans to return before she returns to college. 
   Although his sister Hanley died young, her brother Jordan said at her memorial that she had lived a much fuller life than most people, and she inspired everyone who loved her to ``give every ounce of ourselves to what we truly believe in.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I refer to safepassage.org for on Hanley Denning's life.  
   Catherine Lopez Reyes, a five year old at Safe Passage, best summed up the feelings of all whose lives Hanley Denning changed for the better: ``Hanley, te quiero mucho, We love you very much, Hanley. 
   To learn more about Hanley Denning and her Safe Passage program, visit the website safepassage.org.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (MERCURY EXPORT BAN ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for his outstanding work on this piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, H.R. 1534, the Mercury Export Ban Act. I want to thank not just Mr. Wynn but Mr. Dingell, Mr. Shimkus, and Mr. Barton, all of those who have worked so hard on this particular legislation. 
   It is a well-established fact that mercury is a powerful neurotoxin harmful at even low exposure levels. Mercury is harmful whether it is inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. Once exposed to water, elemental mercury is transformed to methylmercury, which is highly toxic and which has a tendency to bio-accumulate in both fish and the humans who eat the fish. Very young children with developing nervous systems are particularly at risk. In addition, pregnant mothers who are exposed to mercury pollution can transmit mercury to their unborn children, increasing the chances of miscarriage and birth defects. Mercury can also be found in high concentrations in mothers' breast milk. 
   My bill seeks to combat a large source of mercury pollution worldwide: namely, the export of elemental mercury from the United States to developing countries. This mercury is used largely for artesinal mining. Exposure occurs when miners handle the mercury. It enters the water when miners pan for gold, and it enters the air through the smelting process which emits mercury vapor. 
   According to the U.N. Environmental Programme, approximately 15 million people worldwide, including 4.5 million women and 1 million children, engage in artesinal mining with mercury, exposing them to the poisons that mercury produces. Some of this mercury is exported from the United States. That should be unacceptable to us as a Nation. 
   Further, the export of mercury for artesinal mining harms Americans who are exposed through the global air transport of mercury pollution or through the consumption of mercury-contaminated fish. Scientists have estimated that up to one-third of U.S. mercury air pollution has traveled to the U.S. from Asia, where mercury pollution is extensive, including from mercury exported for artesinal mining. Much of the fish that we eat, including tuna, is imported from off the coast of Asian and South American countries where the use of mercury in artesinal mining is widespread. 
   The Departments of Defense and Energy are the two largest holders of mercury in the United States. The EPA has urged DOE and DOD not to sell its mercury stockpiles due to the serious human health and environmental risks associated with mercury. DOD and DOE have agreed. However, that ban is not in law, which is why my bill prohibits the Federal Government from exporting mercury. In addition, private companies may still export this poisonous and hazardous material, which is why my legislation is necessary. 
   Together with my friend Mr. Shimkus at the full committee markup, I offered an amendment to create a long-term mercury storage repository. This amendment was the result of a stakeholder process over the last several months to develop a consensus product. Stakeholders included NRDC, the Environmental Council of the States, the American Chemistry Council, the Chlorine Institute, and the National Mining Association, all of whom have endorsed this amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will place in the Record a letter from these groups in support of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 2009 budget resolution before us today. 
   I want to thank Chairman Spratt and my other colleagues on the Budget Committee for their hard work in bringing to the House a bill that represents the priorities of this Congress. 
   This budget places families and communities first. It increases funding for our veterans so they receive the health care and benefits they have earned and deserve. It increases funding for homeland security officers, including funding for firefighters and police officers, who keep our communities safe. It protects Medicare and Medicaid and includes a plan to increase the State Children's Health Insurance Program to keep our communities healthy. It protects funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and funds important efforts to promote renewable energy initiatives and protect our environment. This budget stands in sharp contrast to the President's proposals, which included cuts to these vital domestic programs that invest in our children, our communities, and our economy. 
   In order to strengthen our economy and our country, we must invest in those who drive it: the middle class. That is why this budget also includes a plan which I strongly support that will extend and expand middle class tax cuts, including the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the 10 percent bracket. 
   This is a budget that will strengthen our middle class, our communities, and our economy and make our country safer. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (APPEAL FOR ENACTMENT OF THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my continued support for the Employee Free Choice Act, a bill which the House passed 2 weeks ago which I hope the Senate will soon consider. 
   I was proud to support House passage of the Employee Free Choice Act because I believe that the current law places undue burdens on workers who are trying to exercise their rights to organize. 
   Under the current law, workers are often subject to intimidation, and employers receive a slap on the hand for illegal activities. One study recently conducted by the University of Illinois found that 30 percent of employers fire pro-union workers, 49 percent threaten to close a work site, and 51 percent coerce employees with bribes or favoritism. 
   Because of these acts, many workers are afraid to vote for a union against the wishes of their employer, even in private. 
   If those statistics are not compelling enough, I urge my colleagues to consider the fact that the United States is the only industrialized Nation to have a union avoidance industry of any size. This industry, on which corporations spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year, exists solely to help businesses resist unionization efforts and undermine union strength. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act would close the legal and illegal avenues to intimidation that some employers use, thereby strengthening employees' ability to choose. 
   It would discourage the firing of employees by increasing fines and penalties during the election process. It would guarantee that first contract negotiations don't drag out for years by requiring mediation and arbitration to end delays. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act would allow the use of card check procedures, in which a majority of workers, not just a majority of voters, sign cards authorizing a union. 
   Why is it so important to ensure access to unions? Inequality is rising in our country. Two years ago, Alan Greenspan said: ``A free market society is ill served by an economy in which the rewards are distributed in a way which too many of our population do not feel is appropriate.'' 
   Whether or not you agree that increasing inequality in our country is tied to declining union membership, one thing is clear: unionized workers have better rates of health care coverage, better wages, and are five times more likely to have a pension. 
   Access to health care, better wages, secure pension: these are the things the House is trying to give back to the middle class in America. Making our economy work for everyone is a complicated, ongoing process. The Employee Free Choice Act is one important step we can take toward accomplishing that goal. 
   In many American workplaces, the process of forming a union is contentious. Yet, though they may differ over issues like wages, health care and pensions, employees, supervisors, and company owners are all striving for the same goal, to make their company work and for competitiveness in a global economy. 
   Finding a middle ground on questions of compensation, training and health care boosts American productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. When employers control the outcome, we not only cheat workers; we cheat our economic future. 
   As we approach 2020, our income distribution is trending toward that of 1920. Americans don't want to be left to the market-based whims of health savings accounts, privatized Social Security, or personal job retraining accounts. They want a government that ensures that individuals can provide for themselves and their families. 
   Senator Wagner wrote the National Labor Relations Act in 1934 to ensure that workers would have an unambiguous, unmitigated right to representation in the workplace. He said then that ``the denial or observance of this right means the difference between despotism and democracy.'' 
   It is unfortunate that the Employee Free Choice Act faces obstacles in the Senate, but it is time to give Americans a fair shot at organizing again. Everyone deserves protection under the law. 
   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the Employee Free Choice Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania for organizing this event tonight and for yielding to me. 
   I was here in 1997 when the SCHIP program was passed, and it was passed with very strong bipartisan support. People on both sides of the aisle, and many of the same groups that you just mentioned, people on both sides of the aisle believed, as virtually all Americans do, that our children should get health care. They ought to be able not just to go to an emergency room when they're seriously ill or have had an accident, but they should be able to get preventive care so they can grow up to be healthy children and healthy productive adults. That's really, I think, a fairly basic proposition. And that's what drove us back in 1997. 
   And now you were asking, what happens if this program doesn't continue? Well, if it's not reauthorized, then 6 million children in this country lose their health insurance. And if they lose their health insurance, maybe some of them, when they're seriously injured, will go to an emergency room, but most of them will lose the preventive care that they get today. 
   The President put in his budget $5 billion over 5 years for an increase in SCHIP, which would fund about one-third of the amount that States are estimated to require over the next 5 years. In other words, the President's position is that this is a program that should be cut back. And that probably is why he made the veto threat, which he basically said, look, people, children and adults, have access to an emergency room; and one thing we want to be careful not to do is expand health insurance if it's through a government program, which is bizarre, because the SCHIP program is designed for people who cannot afford to buy health insurance in the private market today. That's why they don't have it. 
   What we're trying to do is continue this public/private partnership because most States provide coverage through private plans. It's a Federal/State partnership, with 70 percent of the money coming from the Federal Government and about 30 percent coming from States. So States are choosing to fund this program for the obvious reason that our kids deserve to have health care coverage. Outside of the White House, this, I think, is a broadly accepted proposition. 
   I just want to say a few things about my State of Maine. Maine has been very aggressive in using this particular program. We have one of the lowest rates of uninsured children in the country. Only 7 percent of our children do not have health insurance, and the national rate is about 12 percent. But that, for us, we're a small State, but that's about 19,000 children who do not have health insurance. And for those families, for those parents, they know it makes a difference whether or not their kids have health insurance. And they, I know because I've talked to them, worry about whether they're going to get the kind of coverage, the kind of vaccinations, the kind of preventive health care that everyone hopes for their children, because that's really a fundamental point here. 
   I don't think there is a parent in America that doesn't want their children to have good health coverage, to get the health care they need when they need it. And that is what this program attempts to do. Because there are 6 million children in this country today who qualify for the SCHIP program but are not signed up, for whatever reason. Some States aren't being aggressive enough and the Federal Government contribution is falling short. 
   There are another 3 million who don't qualify for SCHIP and still don't have coverage. And all we're trying to do, as Democrats, is to expand that coverage. Now, we can argue about how fast we expand it, we can argue about how we pay for it, but the bottom line is this: children in America deserve to have health care. And we know if they have health insurance, whether the program is privately run or whether the program is publicly run, or some combination, they are much more likely to grow up into healthy, productive children and healthy, productive adults. That's what we're fighting here today for. 
   I want to thank you, my colleague, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, and all the rest of my friends here tonight for pushing this issue so hard and so long. We will not fail. And I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. If the gentlewoman would yield, there are differences among States and now aggressively they seek to use the money that comes from the Federal Government. So there certainly are differences among States in that respect. 
   But I just wanted to comment. It is absolutely true that most people who buy insurance through a private plan will try to cover their kids as well, except that today one of the trends in this country is that the wheels are coming off this employer-based health care system and increasingly, by about a million people a year over the last 4 or 5 years, the number of uninsured is going up. It's now about 46 million people. And one of the reasons, and this is why I've done a plan for small businesses, one of the reasons is the small business community is simply not able to afford the kind of insurance they had in the past. And what they're doing, they're tending not to cover family members, which includes the children, and to require the employee to pay a higher and higher percentage, which some employees simply can't do. 
   So what we're seeing here, at the same time as the President is saying we don't want to expand this successful children's health care program, we're watching the number of uninsured  steadily climb, both adults, and now children for the first time in a long period of time, having the number of uninsured climb because the private market, the employer-based market isn't working as well as it did in the past. 
   We have a national health care crisis on our hands, and this is a part of the solution. It ought to be the easiest part of the solution. But here is the President's spokesman the other day saying this will encourage many to drop private coverage purchased through their employer or with their own resources to go on a government-subsidized program. This is a program that is designed for people who don't have health insurance. We know these children don't have health insurance. We know how many there are. We know where they are. And we ought to be able to do a better job than simply to raise this kind of ideological objection. We ought to cover them first in the most practical, cost-efficient way. 
   I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (RECOGNIZING CRAIG PENDLETON, FOUNDER OF NORTHWEST ATLANTIC MARINE ALLIANCE -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few moments to talk about Craig Pendleton, a fisherman from Maine who has dedicated his life to protecting and supporting small-boat fishermen and the communities that depend on them. 
   Craig is part of a long and proud tradition of fishing families in Maine. Like many fishermen in New England, he experienced the decline of major fishing stocks in the late 1980s and early 1990s and was frustrated by Federal management strategies that seemed to penalize fishermen without really helping to rebuild the stocks. 
   Many fishermen experienced that frustration, but Craig stands out because he responded by rolling up his sleeves and working hard to find solutions. In 1997, my first year in the Congress, Craig founded the Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance, or NAMA. 
   The purpose of NAMA was to work with fishermen up and down the coast of New England to articulate a vision for the future of fishing and fisheries management. Most of these fishermen were small owner-operators who had never participated in politics or management, but through NAMA Craig was able to get them involved. 
   NAMA was a new voice in the debate over how to manage New England's fisheries. Environmental organizations and Federal managers had long recognized that fish stocks were in trouble, but the small family fishermen were typically shut out of high-level discussions about how to solve the problem. These were the people without advocates, without lawyers, without expensive lobbyists. However, they were often the first to suffer the brunt of any new limits on fishing. 
   These are the fishermen that NAMA fights for. Over the years, under Craig Pendleton's lead, NAMA has worked tirelessly to help local fishermen understand the complicated jargon of new Federal fisheries regulations and draft their own proposals for new fisheries management plans. I worked closely with Craig and NAMA when I drafted provisions in the recently reauthorized Magnuson-Stevens Act to protect the interests of small-boat fishermen. Fishermen feel empowered by NAMA. 
   Recently, NAMA became one of the leading proponents of Area Management, an innovative fishery management strategy that allows local communities to take a leading role in managing fisheries resources. The strategy rests on the commonsense idea that fishermen, if they choose, should be able to take responsibility for environmental stewardship and the fair allocation of fisheries resources in their own communities. 
   Recently, Craig Pendleton announced that he is stepping down from the position he has held for 12 years as coordinating director of NAMA. Here today on the floor of the House, I would like to recognize Craig for all his years as a tireless advocate for fishermen and fish and for all that he has achieved for small-boat owners and operators in Maine and across the country. 
   I admire Craig and the other men and women involved with NAMA because they are willing to endure significant personal sacrifice to ensure that the fishing industry and way of life that they love are preserved for their children and grandchildren. I hope that those future generations will stand at the helms of their fishing vessels and see our time as a turning point, when small fishing communities across the country began to take a leading role in the management of the fisheries resources on which they all depend. Craig Pendleton is a pioneer of that movement, and I would like to thank Craig on behalf of the people of Maine and wish him the best in his future endeavors.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (MERCURY EXPORT BAN ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 906, the Senate companion to my legislation, the Mercury Export Ban of 2008.  
   This bill includes several changes that represent a compromise with the Senate, but at its heart is my legislation that passed with strong bipartisan support in the Energy and Commerce Committee and by voice vote on the floor of the House last November. 
   I want to thank Chairman Dingell, former Chairman Wynn, Ranking Member Barton and Mr. Shimkus for the work they have done on this legislation. I also want to express my gratitude to Senators OBAMA and MURKOWSKI for introducing this legislation on the Senate side and to Senator Boxer for her efforts. I would also like to thank Jim Bradley of my staff for all his hard work on this bill. Upon its passage today, this bill will be sent to the President to be signed into law. 
   It is a well-established fact that mercury is a powerful neurotoxin, harmful at even low levels of exposure. Mercury is harmful whether it is inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin. Once exposed to water, elemental mercury is transformed to methylmercury, which is highly toxic and which has a tendency to bio-accumulate in both fish and humans who eat the fish. 
   Very young children with developing nervous systems are particularly at risk. In addition, pregnant mothers who are exposed to mercury pollution can transmit mercury to their unborn children, increasing the chances of miscarriage and birth defects. Mercury can also be found in high concentrations in women's breast milk. 
   My bill seeks to combat a large source of mercury pollution worldwide, namely, the export of elemental mercury from the United States to developing countries. This mercury is used largely for our artisanal mining. Exposure occurs when miners handle the mercury. It enters the water when miners pan for gold and gets into the air through the smelting process which emits mercury vapor. 
   According to the United Nations Environmental Programme, approximately 15 million people worldwide, including 4.5 million women and 1 million children, engage in artisanal mining with mercury, exposing them to the poisons that mercury produces. Some of this mercury is exported from the United States. That should be unacceptable to us. 
   The export of mercury for artisanal mining harms Americans who are exposed through the global air transport of mercury pollution or through the consumption of mercury-contaminated fish. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency reports that as of 2004, 44 States, including my State of Maine, have fish advisories that cover 13 million acres of water and over 75,000 miles of rivers and streams. 
   Scientists have estimated that up to one-third of U.S. mercury air pollution has traveled to the U.S. from Asia where mercury pollution is extensive, including pollution from mercury exported for artisanal mining. 
   Much of the fish we eat, including tuna, is imported from off the coasts of Asian and South American countries where the use of mercury in artisanal mining is widespread. 
   The Departments of Defense and Energy are the two largest holders of mercury in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency has urged DOE and DOD not to sell its mercury stockpiles due to the serious human health and environmental risks associated with mercury. DOD and DOE have agreed. However, that ban is not in law, which is why my bill prohibits the Federal Government from exporting mercury. In addition, private companies may still export this poisonous and hazardous material, which is why this legislation is vital. 
   The Mercury Export Ban Act before us today is the result of a months-long stakeholder process on House side that worked to develop a consensus product. Stakeholders included the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Council of the States, the American Chemistry Council, the Chlorine Institute and the National Mining Association. There are not many pieces of legislation that move through this Congress supported by such a diverse group. 
   The bill prohibits the export of elemental mercury from the United States and requires DOE to designate a long-term storage facility to accept mercury from private sector sources, particularly the chlor-alkali industry and the mining industry, when the export ban in the bill takes effect on January 1, 2013. The bill does not require that all excess mercury be transferred to DOE, rather it gives the private sector the option of placing mercury into storage at DOE. If there is a more practical or more cost-effective private sector solution, the affected industries are more than welcome to pursue that option. 
   DOE will be allowed to charge a fee to recoup the government's cost of storing this waste. In addition, all applicable and appropriate environmental laws apply with respect to this facility. 
   The legislation will allow the chlor-alkali industry to place into safe storage the roughly 1,500 tons of mercury stockpiled at aging plants. It will also allow the mining industry to store the approximately 50 to 100 tons of mercury it generates annually as a byproduct of our air filtration systems. 
   The process used to develop this legislation can be a modeled. On a bipartisan basis, we sat down together. We worked out our differences and brought interested and affected parties to the table to hammer out a compromise. 
   I also want to thank a number of staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee, including Dick Frandsen, Caroline Ahearn from the majority staff, along with Ann Strickland, who has now left, as well as Dave McCarthy and Jerry Couri from the minority staff and Mo Zilly, formerly of Mr. Shimkus' staff, for their hard work as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation, and I urge all Members to support its passage. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 2342, the National Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation Act. I commend Chairman Rahall and Chairwoman Bordallo of the Natural Resources Committee for their leadership and foresight in supporting this legislation to give us the tools we need to manage and protect our marine resources and coastal communities. I also want to thank Mr. Brown and Mr. Young for their work on this bill. 
   My legislation establishes a nationwide integrated ocean and coastal observing system, based on the internationally acclaimed Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, GoMOOS. That is the acronym, GoMOOS. GoMOOS was developed by Maine oceanographers, and has improved safety for fishermen and boaters, increased understanding of ocean weather and helped forecast the effects of global climate change. 
   My legislation builds on the success of regional programs like GoMOOS and will greatly enhance our knowledge about our oceans and their resources and vastly improve our ability to manage them properly.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (JOSIAH AND KATHLEEN PIERCE, 2007 NATIONAL TREE FARMERS OF THE YEAR -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to congratulate two of my constituents, Josiah and Kathleen Pierce of Baldwin, Maine, for being selected as the 2007 National Outstanding Tree Farmers of the Year. 
   Jo and Kathy were selected by the American Tree Farm System for their sustainable management of approximately 2,000 acres of woodland in Southern Maine. Part of the property has been in Jo Pierce's family for six generations. 
   Jo describes his management philosophy as 100-year thinking about preserving the land's ability to pay for itself by periodic logging and yet maintaining the diversity of plant and animal life that can only be found in and around old forests. 
   Jo and Kathy's grandchildren represent one measure of long-term management. Jo wants them to marvel at rare and unusual plants and animals that are otherwise frequently lost to short-sighted harvesting. Jo and Kathy keep their property open to the public for hiking, hunting, and other traditional uses. They want other people to experience their own attachment to the land. 
   The award recognizes Jo and Kathy's civic contributions. In particular, Jo's service as president of the Small Woodland Owners Association of Maine, an influential State advocacy group, demonstrated his interest in sharing his knowledge of sustainable forest management with other owners. 
   The award is also a tribute to Rene Noel, the forester who advises Jo and Kathy about best practices with respect to management of their land. 
   Maine is a small State. I am particularly pleased to recognize Jo and Kathy's achievement because Jo and I have known each other for many years. Our fathers were friends. We share a similar perspective about our forest property, and we share the same forester. 
   In Maine and across the country, much of our forest land is in private hands and often in relatively small lots owned by individuals. The future quality of our forests, and the diversity of life they sustain, depends in large part on the knowledge and commitment of their owners, especially to their ``100-year thinking'' about sustainable management. 
   Jo and Kathy Pierce, National Outstanding Tree Farmers of 2007, are models for how other forest landowners can use, protect, and preserve for future generations the woodland habitat they own today.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (A RESPONSIBLE EXIT STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, our country faces great challenges: energy independence, global warming, economic competitiveness, health care, and widening income inequality. But when I visit with people in Maine, the first issue they bring up is Iraq. 
   We cannot address our other pressing issues unless we solve our most urgent problem: Iraq. We cannot make many needed investments in our future until we put our involvement in Iraq in the past. The war in Iraq is straining our military and compromising our ability to address vital priorities like global terrorism and nuclear proliferation. It is diverting attention from dealing with Iran, North Korea, and Afghanistan. Since the President will not, Congress must lead to force Iraqis to take responsibility for their own security by directing an orderly redeployment of troops and promoting a political solution in Iraq with a focus on transition to Iraqi control. 
   Recent experience shows that the U.S. must impose deadlines with consequences so that Iraqi leaders will be compelled to take responsibility. An unending U.S. military presence in Iraq creates a climate of dependency that undermines the goal of having the Iraqi Government control internal security. 
   There is a growing consensus that only a political solution, not a military one, will address the sectarian conflict in Iraq. Yet President Bush has rejected the wisdom of military commanders, the Iraq Study Group, and the voters by choosing to send more troops into the crossfire of a sectarian civil war. If the President won't provide an exit strategy, Congress must take the lead in ending the war. 
   To achieve this goal, I have cosponsored H.R. 645, a bill introduced by Representatives David Price and Brad Miller. The bill would, by December 31, 2007, terminate the authorization for military operations in Iraq that passed, over my objection, in 2002. 
   The original mission Congress authorized, eliminating weapons of mass destruction and ousting Saddam Hussein, is no longer operative. If the President wants U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the end of this year, he should justify his plans and seek new approval from Congress. I am confident that the new Congress will not give the President a blank check, as the congressional majority wrongly did in 2002. 
   H.R. 645 also requires the President to submit a plan and timetable for phasing out troop deployments by December 31, 2007. It declares that U.S. policy is to withdraw forces in order to transfer responsibility to Iraqis; prohibits funding for permanent U.S. bases; authorizes employment, democracy, and governance programs; and creates a special envoy for Iraq regional security. 
   America's servicemen and -women in Iraq have served with skill, determination, and courage. We owe them and their families our gratitude and our unwavering support. Our legislation does not cut off funds for armor and protective equipment still needed by our troops in the war zone. 
   No exit strategy will succeed unless it has broad public support. I support H.R. 645 as a responsible approach to ending the war by focusing on U.S. policy and on the now outdated congressional authorization for the use of force. Citizens deserve to know where their elected officials stand on the war and not just on the escalation. I have let my constituents in Maine know where I stand and how I believe Congress should take a long overdue leadership role in ending this war.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Mr. Flake. This amendment would strike funding for the Lobster Institute CORE Initiative for the University of Maine, a program vital to the continuation of the lobster industry. 
   I will say a few words in a moment about the importance of the lobster industry, not just to Maine, but to New England and to the entire Northeast, but I want to go straight to this particular program. 
   The Lobster Institute's CORE Initiative provides for conservation, outreach, research and education in order to sustain the lobster. This is one of the most successfully managed fisheries along the Atlantic coast. When you look at this from the point of view of the private sector, this is not a case of a big corporate fishery. The lobster industry is primarily a small fishery with individual lobstermen who cannot possibly afford to do the research on the scale that this institute does. I would say that the institute is funded primarily by contributions from the industry itself, some people who are contributing to the research, and through private donations by the Friends of the Lobster Institute. 
   But fundamentally, this kind of research done by our land grant universities is absolutely essential. The University of Maine does work on wild blueberries. It does work on potatoes. The industry itself could not possibly sustain industrywide research because those industries, like the lobster industry, are made up primarily of small businessmen and -women. 
   Frankly, it is exactly this kind of public-private partnership that makes our economy stronger than it ever could be without this support. 
   Let me give you some examples. The CORE program aims to establish a unified logical progression of research to address lobster health, stock assessment and environmental monitoring issues. For example, in southern New England, we have some very serious disease issues with some lobsters. We have to be able to track those diseases and make sure that we understand what is going on. 
   The program will also develop infrastructure to support lobster health and habitat research.     
   The information that is gathered by the institute is communicated to the public in many ways. Outreach education conducted by faculty, students and industry members, as well as conferences, seminars and workshops  throughout the region spreads information developed by the institute. The institute is also home to a lobster library which holds nearly 2,000 journal articles, research reports and informational pamphlets. 
   Basically, what we're saying is that one of the reasons the lobster industry is one of the most successfully managed fisheries in the Northeast is precisely because of this research. And some Federal contribution, a small contribution, $200,000 is what's at stake here, is the linchpin that holds this organization together. 
   A few final concluding comments. The private sector, which is supported by this research institute, includes jobs for 8,000 fishermen and countless other jobs for additional businesses such as dealers, distributors, boat builders, marine suppliers and a variety of tourism-related businesses. 
   Throughout the Nation, the lobster industry has an economic impact of somewhere between $2.4- and $4 billion a year, with 10,000 commercial lobster licenses issued each year. It's ranked, American lobster, I would say Maine lobster, but, you know, who's quarrelling here, American lobster is ranked third on the U.S. seafood export list, proving that it's essential to our economy. 
   In Maine, we have 5,800 licensed lobstermen, and the catch from Maine lobstermen makes up approximately 70 percent of all U.S. landings. 
   I would just say in conclusion, this may seem like a small amount of money to a small research institute, but it holds together a private industry of great economic importance not just to Maine, but to the Northeast and to all of our oceans-related industries. 
   That's why I strenuously object to this amendment. I urge its defeat. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (ON IRAQ, WE NEED LEADERSHIP, NOT INEFFECTIVE COMPROMISE -- (House of Representatives - July 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, Americans are aching for our leadership to end the war in Iraq. Instead, they find the President and his enablers in the House and Senate doing everything they can to block legislation that would require him to bring the troops home by a date certain. Each day seems to bring some new proposal that purports to be progress. 
   Upon examination, however, they leave the President free to pursue his discredited policies and serve his diversionary tactics by politicians searching for cover. One proposal calls for the President to submit a plan by mid-October to narrow the use of U.S. troops in Iraq to fighting terrorists and securing borders and U.S. interests. It won't bring home a single American serviceman or woman. 
   Another proposal seeks to ``change the mission'' of American forces, but doesn't guarantee when or even if their redeployment will begin. Supporters of ``changing the mission'' claim it would result in troop reductions, but they offer no evidence of that. Americans will remain the targets of violence, and U.S. policy will continue to sow resentment in the Muslim world. In my opinion, ``changing the mission'' is the war supporters' latest excuse to avoid decisive action to bring the war to a conclusion. 
   This is not the leadership the American people expect and that our national security demands. The failure of the President's surge strategy means he has lost the ability to shape events in Iraq in a positive direction. Only by redeploying our forces from Iraq can we rebuild our depleted military, restore our global reputation and redirect resources to fight al Qaeda. 
   Just last week, the National Counterterrorism Center reported that al Qaeda has regrouped in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, enabled by the President's diversion of resources to Iraq. 
   I opposed the Iraq war from the start and take no comfort in the fact that many of my most ominous predictions have proven true. In a September 6, 2002, op-ed in the Portland Press Herald, I predicted that the war would be fought ``in city streets filled with civilians, making precision bombs useless and casualties high. It will cost billions to wage the war and billions more to rebuild.'' 
   America has suffered nearly 30,000 casualties, including more than 3,600 combat deaths. The war has cost half a trillion dollars, resulting in huge deficits that will burden our children's future. 
   On October 8, 2002, during the House debate on the war resolution, I said, ``If the U.S. acts unilaterally or with just a few other nations, there is a far higher risk of fueling resentment in Arab and Muslim nations and swelling the ranks of the anti-U.S. terrorists.'' Unfortunately, this is exactly what has happened. 
   I voted against the war and have been an outspoken critic of the case made to justify it, the mismanagement of the occupation and the failure to hold the administration accountable for its so many mistakes. 
   More than 18 months ago, I called for a deadline to redeploy our forces. A firm deadline was, and is, the best way to end the U.S. involvement in Iraq and force the Iraqis to assume responsibility for their own security. As former Maine Senator George Mitchell demonstrated in his Northern Ireland diplomacy, a firm deadline can be a very effective way to get parties in conflict to compromise their differences. 
   Nothing but the force of law will move President Bush to alter his stay-the-course strategy. Nonbinding resolutions are not sufficient to compel a real change in policy and get us out of Iraq. This President is stubbornly determined to delay the inevitable at the cost of additional precious American lives. More than 600 of our troops have died since the surge began. 
   The other costs include greater hatred of the U.S. in the Islamic world, more terrorists inspired by that hatred and, with our Armed Forces stretched to the breaking point, great insecurity for our Nation. 
   Unless Members of Congress who supported President Bush's war policy steadfastly for 5 years stop looking for cover and do the right thing, the President will prevail and our troops will remain in Iraq. 
   Our Armed Forces have done all that we asked of them and have performed their mission with great skill and courage. President Bush will keep our troops in the crossfire of the Iraqi civil war until Congress sets binding dates for their redeployment. That action represents the leadership needed to bring our troops safely home.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act. 
   In particular, I want to call attention to section 3065 and to thank Chairman Oberstar and the Chair of the subcommittee, Ms. Johnson, for their support of the city of Saco, Maine. 
   Section 3065 authorizes construction of modifications to an Army Corps of Engineers jetty at the mouth of the Saco River in the Camp Ellis neighborhood of Saco. The Corps built the jetty more than 130 years ago and subsequently has lengthened, smoothed, and raised it. 
   Unfortunately, the jetty is destroying the Camp Ellis neighborhood by contributing to what the Maine State geologist has called the worst coastal erosion in the State. Thirty-eight homes have been lost to the sea. Currently, homes that were once six rows back from the shoreline are in danger of being destroyed. During winter nor'easter storms, one part of Camp Ellis often becomes an island. 
   These dangerous conditions are caused by a structure erected, improved, and maintained by the United States Government. For that reason I believe that the Federal Government must act to alleviate the problem. Section 3065 funds a spur jetty and a series of breakwaters that will diminish the force of wave action on the beach. For the past 7 years, I have been actively involved with Federal, State, and local officials, as well as with Camp Ellis residents, all dedicated to fixing the Camp Ellis erosion problem. 
   Passage of WRDA could not be more timely. On Monday I was there in the middle of the storm surge, and during this week's nor'easter, Camp Ellis lost at least two homes to the sea. If the proposed modifications to the jetty had been made, these homes would not have been destroyed. 
   I urge passage of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, given the history of the last few years, there is no reason to take what the Republican minority is saying seriously. And I say that because the history of the last 6 years has been to prove that people who don't believe in government don't run it well. 
   It is also true that past Republican budgets have never made permanent the President's tax cuts. So there is rank hypocrisy to suggest that there is a tax increase embedded in this one when there was a similar increase embedded in past Republican budgets. 
   But, beyond that, what we are really talking about is criticism from a party which ran up $3 trillion in the Federal debt over the last few years; and they have done that, frankly, by putting their tax cuts for the richest people in the country on a credit card. Only they don't intend to pay the credit card. They intend our children and grandchildren to pay back the credit card with $3 trillion of additional Federal debt. 
   Now, we could go on, on that subject, but the bottom line is budgets are about priorities; and the Democratic priorities in this budget are very, very different from what the administration and the Republicans have done before. 
   For example, clean water. In my home State of Maine, we value the environment. A good environment is absolutely essential to the health of our economy, because so many people come to me precisely because we have clean air and clean water and a beautiful place to visit. So it is important to the economy. People move to Maine because it is a fabulous place to live, and the quality of the environment is important there as well. Our future responsibility for the planet is all tied up in environmental issues. 
   But the President and the past Republican Congress has reduced the Clean Water State Revolving Fund over the last few years. Clean water is a basic value for all Americans, and they tried to reduce funds for the Clean Water Revolving Fund. Conservation and preservation of important resources, important to all people in this country, they tried to cut it. We are increasing that funding. 
   The bottom line is this: Our budget priorities are dramatically different. We have rejected the administration's proposed cuts to core environmental programs such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Fish and Wildlife Refuge System, and EPA's own budget. They have been trying to reduce funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. We have a different set of priorities. We increase that funding, and this makes a dramatic difference. This budget funds conservation and environmental protection infrastructure at $31.4 billion, $2.46 billion more than the President requested. 
   We have provided a deficit neutral reserve fund for the reauthorization of the farm bill, and a significant portion of that increased funding would go toward enhancing the Department of Agriculture's natural resource conservation programs. 
   I would go on to say that expanded agricultural conservation programs help farmers better comply with environmental regulations, and they certainly provide valuable natural resource benefits for the public. 
   The bottom line is this: clean water, clean air, protecting public health, improving the environment, fulfilling our responsibility to preserve the planet for our children and grandchildren, to preserve our parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and open space. That is what this Congress should be doing. That is what this Democratic budget does. It is a dramatic change from the past, and I just want to congratulate Chairman Spratt for the good work he has done in making this budget environmentally sensitive.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, this day has been a long time coming for many of us.  
   Back in 1998, I was hearing from my constituents in Maine about the high price of prescription drugs, and I introduced a bill to tie drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries to the negotiated prices that the VA gets. The Congress didn't act, but in Maine we enacted Maine Rx. We negotiated lower prices, and we got them for so many people in Maine who were really desperate for lower-priced prescription drugs. 
   The Congress, under Republican leadership in the House and Senate, delayed and delayed. Eventually, it got to be too hot to handle and we passed Medicare part D. 
   Today, the defenders of Medicare part D are saying, Well, it is doing well because it doesn't cost as much as we thought it would cost. In truth, the real winners are on Wall Street. 
   Last November, in reviewing pharmaceutical profits, the New York Times said: ``For big drug companies, the new Medicare prescription drug benefit is proving to be a financial windfall, larger than even the most optimistic Wall Street analysts had predicted.'' Well, if it is a financial windfall for PhRMA, it is a lousy deal for the American taxpayer. Market forces, some say, will yield the lowest prices, but the VA gets lower prices, Medicaid gets lower prices, other countries get lower prices than the Medicare D plans. 
   It is very clear that negotiation will drive down prices, particularly if the Secretary negotiates especially strongly on those highest priced drugs, those drugs that are most out of line. 
   Secondly, the advocates are arguing that PhRMA and its allies are saying that negotiated prices will reduce revenue so much they will have to cut R&D. We have heard that for over 20 years; it has never happened. 
   This bill, finally, will be a good deal for taxpayers and a good deal for our seniors.  
   ``For big drug companies, the new Medicare prescription drug benefit is proving to be a financial windfall larger than even the most optimistic Wall Street analysts had predicted. . . . Wall Street analysts say they have little doubt that the benefit program. . . has helped several big drug makers report record profits.''(NYT, 11/6/06)

   Mr. ALLEN. I thank Chairman Peterson for yielding for the purpose of a colloquy. 
   I want to congratulate him in the passage of this farm bill. I want to commend him for significant funding increases, in particular for the Senior Farmers' Market and Nutrition program, a program that provides fresh fruits and vegetables to low-income seniors through farmers markets, roadside stands and community-supported agriculture. When it is working properly, this program provides health benefits to seniors and new business opportunities to farmers. 
   I had submitted an amendment that was not made in order. My amendment would have made it easier for States to incorporate community-supported agricultural distribution programs into their Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition programs. In particular, my amendment would have given States the flexibility to set the maximum benefit level per senior in a way best suited to the needs of farmers and seniors in each State. 
   Our experience in Maine has been that community-supported agriculture works extremely well for farmers and is an excellent way to reach seniors who do not live close enough to a farmers market or who are not mobile enough to get up and go shopping. Indeed, Maine's community-supported agriculture program has drawn national acclaim since it was instituted. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would simply ask Chairman Peterson if he is willing to work with me to incorporate these beneficial reforms into the 2007 farm bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank our Speaker and the majority leader for scheduling this long overdue debate on Iraq. For 4 years we have suffered from a Congress that was unwilling to lead, and content simply to follow on Iraq. The previous majority gave the President a blank check for the war and rubber-stamped the funding. They ignored oversight, avoided investigations, and stifled debate. 
   Today in Iraq, the price of this neglect is the loss of too many American lives caught in the crossfire of a sectarian civil war. 
   Now our new Democratic leaders and committee chairs are asserting Congress' constitutional responsibilities on war and peace. We are reclaiming a congressional role in foreign policy in order to bring a responsible end to the U.S. military involvement in Iraq. One step is this resolution, which sends a vital signal of disapproval of the President's escalation plan. Another is the  ambitious list of long overdue oversight hearings. 
   In the first 5 weeks of this Congress, we held more hearings on Iraq than the Republicans held in all of 2006. The next step, we should use the appropriations bills to shape policy in Iraq. 
   I strongly support the Skelton-Lantos resolution, which expresses support for the troops and disapproval of the President's escalation. Only a political solution, not a military one, will address the sectarian conflict in Iraq. Yet President Bush has rejected the wisdom of his military commanders, the Iraq Study Group, and many other experts by choosing to send more troops into a Sunni-Shia conflict that we cannot control. 
   Escalation, we know, is opposed by the majority of the American people. More telling, it is opposed by a majority of the Iraqi people. When the White House war plans diverge from the wishes of the people and leaders of Iraq, we must question the relevance of the mission. Our statement on the escalation is important, but our constituents also deserve to know our position on an exit strategy. 
   We cannot make needed investments in our future until we put our involvement in Iraq in the past. This war is straining our military and undermining our ability to deal with domestic challenges. We must force Iraqis to take responsibility for their own security by directing an orderly redeployment of the troops and promoting a political solution in Iraq with a focus on transition to Iraqi control. 
   Recent experience shows that the U.S. must impose deadlines with consequences so that Iraqi leaders will be compelled to take responsibility. An indefinite U.S. military experience in Iraq creates a climate of dependency that undermines the goal of having the Iraqi Government control internal security. It is not in our national interests to have U.S. troops placed between warring factions in a sectarian war. 
   To achieve this goal, I support H.R. 645, a bill introduced by Representative DAVID PRICE and Representative BRAD MILLER. The bill terminates, by December 31, 2007, the authorization for military operations in Iraq that passed, over my objection, in 2002. The original mission, eliminating weapons of mass destruction and ousting Saddam Hussein, is no longer operative. 
   If the President believes troops should remain in Iraq beyond 2007, he must come to Congress and justify a new mission, and Congress would have to vote to approve a new mission. H.R. 645 also requires the President to submit a plan and timetable for phasing out troop deployments by December 31, 2007. It prohibits funding for permanent U.S. bases in Iraq. It authorizes funding for employment, democracy, and governance programs in that country, and it creates a Special Envoy for Iraq regional security. 
   America's servicemen and women who have been sent to Iraq have served with skill, determination, and courage. We owe them and their families our gratitude and our unwavering support. 
   Like every Member of Congress, I have been to too many funerals not to understand the sacrifice of those who have served, and their families. Neither H. Con. Res. 63 nor H.R. 645 cuts our funding for armor and protective equipment still needed by troops in the war zone. Congress must take a long overdue leadership role in ending this war. This resolution is an important first step, and I urge all Members to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ALLEN. (NO MORE ``BLANK CHECKS'' ON TRADE: FAST TRACK HAS HURT MAINE'S WORKERS -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to renewing trade promotion authority, also known as fast track. 
   Fast track in its current form is nothing more than a blank check for the administration to negotiate harmful trade agreements without congressional input. 
   I voted against the Trade Act of 2002, which granted fast track authority to the President. Those of us who opposed such a large grant of authority are not surprised that, given a blank check, the Bush administration has made regional and bilateral deals to suit narrow corporate interests and cut Members of Congress out of the process. 
   We need to examine what has happened to hardworking people in my home State of Maine since Congress signed that blank check. Between January of 2001 and December of last year, Maine lost more than 20,000 manufacturing jobs. In the same period of time, Maine also lost 8,000 information sector jobs, in what surely is just the beginning of trouble for our service sectors. Only one month ago, Moosehead Manufacturing, a furniture-making firm in the towns of Monson and Dover-Foxcroft, Maine, employing 120 people, closed its doors as a result of competition from China, Mexico, and Brazil. Moosehead Manufacturing tried for years to adjust to the pressure of foreign competition by changing its products and the structure of its workforce, unfortunately, to no avail. Fast track authority allowed the administration to continue to make trade deals without adjusting their tactics in the least, even as jobs flowed out of my State. 
   It isn't clear how lost manufacturing jobs will be replaced in Maine. What is clear is that these jobs were casualties not of the inevitable forces of globalization, but the abuse of a process that is closed to the majority of Americans. 
   That is why I voted against fast track, and why I am here to urge my colleagues to vote against renewal in anything like the form of the current law. 
   Mainers who lose their jobs because of global competition often have to accept lower wages when they find another job. This week, The Washington  Post reported that nearly half of workers laid off between 2003 and 2005 who were successful at finding new employment took a pay cut at their new jobs. Nearly 30 percent reported earnings losses of 20 percent or more. 
   The same is true for Maine manufacturing sector workers. According to a 2002 survey done by the Maine AFL-CIO, laid-off manufacturing workers who found new employment lost on average 16 percent of their wages. One out of three laid-off workers lost pension benefits. 
   Congress is under pressure to renew fast track. The administration claims that it cannot negotiate bilateral or multilateral agreements without it. 
   The administration has had long enough to demonstrate what it will and won't do with fast track authority. Our constituents deserve to be heard when trade deals are negotiated, not ignored. Rather than write another blank check, Members of Congress should take an active part in trade negotiations. We must insert accountability into any future grants of authority to the executive branch. We must strive to create agreements that meet the test of what serves the public good, rather than what serves narrow special interests. 
   I strongly believe that the choice between agreements that open new trade opportunities and agreements that protect workers is a false one. We can and must achieve both objectives. We can address health care, education, job training, and technological investments to make our firms more competitive. We can do more to retrain and cushion the blow for workers who lose their jobs as a result of foreign competition, and we can rewrite the model for trade agreements so that the interests of hardworking Americans are a priority. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose renewal of fast track in its current form.
