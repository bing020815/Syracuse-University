<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (DEMOCRATS REFORM EARMARK PROCESS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, 7 years into his Presidency, President Bush is finally urging reform of the earmark process. He is a little late.  
   Congressional Democrats have already begun reforming the earmark process. We realized reform was necessary after the number of earmarks in appropriations bills skyrocketed under the Republicans. You didn't hear the President complaining then. In fact, he signed every appropriations bill that came to his desk. 
   Democrats, in stark contrast, have led the way in bringing transparency and accountability to the earmark process. We instituted a 1-year moratorium on earmarks in 2007 until a reformed process could be put into place. We also adopted rules that provided for unprecedented transparency in earmarks and then significantly reduced the number of earmarks last year. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are pleased to hear that the President is interested in reforming the earmark process. The Bush White House requests and receives funding for hundreds of earmarks each year, and we look forward to working with the President to both limit and bring increased transparency to the Presidential and congressional earmarks.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (IRAQIS CALL FOR WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN TROOPS IN 2010 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, congressional Democrats have repeatedly urged President Bush to bring our troops home from Iraq honorably, responsibly, safely, and soon. 
   After rejecting 18 months of attempts by the Democratic majority to adopt redeployment timetables, the President now proposes a vague general time horizon that falls far short of a commitment to ending involvement in Iraq. The Iraq Government was more direct. For the second time this month, Iraqi officials have indicated their support for the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces by the end of 2010. 
   Maybe these statements served as a wake-up call to the Bush administration. It appears they are finally getting the message that the war in Iraq cannot go on indefinitely. Perhaps President Bush should pass the message along to Senator McCain, who continues to believe that our commitment in Iraq will last 50 to 100 years. 
   Madam Speaker, we need a new direction in Iraq that allows our troops to come home and allows us to focus on the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and around the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 660 provides for consideration of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007 under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate to be controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule also makes in order the substitute reported by the Committee on Financial Services, modified by the amendment in part A of the Rules Committee report, as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. The self-executing amendment in part A would ensure that the bill complies with the new PAYGO requirements. It would require the enactment of a joint resolution to permit Federal compensation under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. The joint resolution, approving a certification by the Secretary of Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretaries of State, Homeland Security and the Attorney General, that there has been an act of terrorism, would be considered by Congress under fast-track procedures. 
   The rule makes in order two amendments printed in the Rules Committee report, each debatable for 10 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Terrorism Insurance Program was originally enacted as a short-term backstop for an insurance industry that was very hard hit by the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. In the years since, we have seen that the private insurance market is unable to cover the risk of both domestic and foreign acts of terrorism without assistance. 
   The original legislation, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, referred to as TRIA, was set to expire at the end of 2005. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 extended the government backstop for two more years, through the end of this year, but left the long-term questions surrounding the program unanswered. Those unanswered questions include: whether the government-run terrorism insurance program is really necessary; how to manage the possibility of a nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attack, and how best to allocate the risk of terrorist attack between the government and private insurers. The rule provides for consideration of a bill that answers those questions. 
   Experience has shown that there is a true need for government involvement in terrorism insurance. The exposure for private companies is just too great. In the wake of September 11, 2001, many companies opted to exclude terrorism risk from private insurance policies, leaving no coverage in the event of another attack. TRIA requires primary insurers to make terrorism insurance available to commercial clients that wish to purchase it while at the same time helping those insurers manage their exposure to risk of loss. 
   The legislation this rule provides for consideration will extend TRIA for 15 years and make necessary revisions aimed at furthering the development of a private market of terrorism risk insurance. Such a long-term extension is vital because it provides certainty and stability to the insurance and real estate markets. 
   People may think that TRIA is only an issue for businesses in New York City, but that is clearly not the case. In the upstate New York district which I represent, small insurance companies like Utica First, Preferred Mutual and Utica National felt the dramatic impact that 9/11 had on the private market. In the year that followed the September 11 attacks, Utica First saw the volume of policies they were writing in the New York City area increase 27 percent as other companies ceased offering coverage. In order to do so, they risked both their existing surplus and their industry ratings and also incurred greater expense because their own reinsurance required that they purchase a separate terrorism cover. Small companies like this, that continued to offer coverage, are to be commended for taking on greater risk exposure in order to provide the necessary coverage and allow businesses to continue in business and people to continue to work to support their families. 
   The legislation would also require insurers to offer coverage for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorist acts. Small insurers, like those in my district, are especially concerned about the effect of adding the nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological requirements to TRIA, but the risk of such an attack is real, and not having any system in place would enhance the devastating effect such a horrific attack would have if it were to happen again in our country. 
   This bill strikes a good balance because it not only phases in the nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological coverage beginning in 2009, but also provides small insurers, those whose direct earned premium is less than $50 million, the ability to apply for an exemption of up to 2 years with the possibility of further extending that exemption. 
   This legislation would also make several other critical changes to the terrorism risk insurance program. It would change the definition of terrorism under TRIA to include domestic terrorism, and reset the program trigger level at $50 million. It would expand the program to provide for group life insurance coverage, would decrease deductibles for terrorist attacks costing over $1 billion, and reduce the trigger level in the event of such an attack. Finally, it would require studies on the development of a private insurance market for terrorism risk insurance. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a critical step in protecting our national and economic security in the fight against terrorism. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. I think the gentleman is right, this may be unprecedented; but the attack on 9/11 was unprecedented as well, and sometimes unprecedented events require unprecedented action, and that's what we are attempting to do today, create a rule to enact legislation like TRIA to create a backstop so that insurance companies can continue to create a stable environment for business to thrive in New York City.

   This is critical legislation. This is important not just to New Yorkers, this is important to the entire country. This is a critical piece of legislation that must get passed, and the steps that we are taking today are necessary if we are going to create the stability in business that is necessary to continue and allow our economy to grow. 
   I don't think it's absurd for the people who were there on 9/11. I don't think it's absurd for the insurance companies that now want to begin to insure the businesses and buildings in New York City. Oh, no, this is not absurd at all. This is the business of Congress. This is what we do, and this is what we do best.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I am troubled by the fact that today, everything we hear from the other side is smoke and mirrors. They want to talk about everything except what we are here to talk about today, and that is the rule on the TRIA legislation. 
   My friend from Texas infers that the Rules Committee is not open, honest and ethical. Well, I resent that. I think we are very open, we are honest, and we are very ethical. He knows that, and he shouldn't put petty partisan politics ahead of what we are here today to do, and that is to pass a rule on TRIA legislation. 
   Protecting the security and safety of America is without question our top priority and the reason that we are here in Congress as Members of this institution. The horrible terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, had a devastating effect on so many people in this country; not just New Yorkers, but people all over this country. 
   It also had a devastating economic impact on the commercial insurance market. Many primary insurers stopped writing policies. Special guidelines were instituted when insuring buildings thought to be likely terrorist targets and other properties surrounding them. Reinsurers, those companies that insure the insurance companies, excluded terrorist events from coverage altogether. 
   To address this market failure, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and that was under the Republican Congress, because it was the right thing to do. And we will continue to do the right thing here today. 
   TRIA has been a success. Primary insurers are able to write policies and business owners are able to obtain coverage. Stability was restored to this vital market. If we do not act now to extend TRIA, this program will expire and we will be back where we were following the September 11 attacks. 
   H.R. 2761 extends TRIA by 15 years to provide added certainty to this vital sector of our economy that a mere 2-year extension cannot provide. The bill also lays the groundwork for the inclusion of coverage for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorist acts, while at the same time allowing for an exemption for small insurers that would be unfairly impacted by this necessary expansion. 
   The circumstances before us are unlike anything we have confronted in our Nation's history. We must not allow terrorist attacks to force valuable businesses to fail because they cannot afford insurance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today as a member of the new Democratic majority, watching out for the interests of our Nation's business community by providing much-needed predictability in the terrorism risk insurance market. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (MAJORITY MAKERS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the great State of Ohio for organizing this and bringing us all together here, and I thank all of you for being here. 
   Like so many other Members of Congress, I have had an opportunity to go to Iraq. And recently I came back from there, about 3 weeks ago, and I couldn't help but be so impressed with the incredible job that our troops are doing there. The men and women that are there are doing everything that is asked of them and much more in an incredibly hostile environment.     
   And they're doing it not just as a job, but they're doing it with intensity and passion. And they're doing a great job at what they do in just incredibly hostile circumstances. I am convinced, after seeing the job that they did, that our military, in a just cause, could accomplish anything we ask of them, anything in the world. And I was just very impressed with how hard they're working. 
   But you can't help but be troubled by the fact that the mission there continues to change. I can't help but think about, the old example that they use in football is every time that the team sets up to kick a field goal they move the goalpost back. It just seems like that's what we're doing. First, as my friend from Vermont just said, we were told we were going to Iraq for weapons of mass destruction. That didn't pan out. We were told we had to remove a dictator in Saddam Hussein. Our soldiers did that, and they did it magnificently. Then we were told we had to stay until there were free elections. We had free elections. Then we were told that we had to stay there; in fact, we not only had to stay there, we had to increase our numbers there, we had to have a surge so that we could reduce the violence so that the government would have an opportunity, would have a chance to come together. And that's exactly what our soldiers did. And despite that fact, we are still told that we will continue to be there. This is just unimaginable. 
   Our soldiers have done everything that we have asked of them, and much more, in an incredibly hostile environment, and yet they continue to be told that they have to stay in Iraq. And for what?  
   I am convinced, after meeting with Dr. Salam al-Zubaie, the Deputy Prime Minister, that the factions in Iraq will continue to fight, they will continue to use America as a crutch for as long as they possibly can. We gave them time. We did exactly what we said we would do. And what did they do? They squandered that time. They continued to posture for a better position, and they continue to do that today. Blood is spilling, Iraqi blood, American blood, and they continue to posture. Violence increases, and they continue to posture. They refuse to come together. It is high time for us to allow Iraq to take over, to stand up for itself. They will stand up when we stand down. 
   The other thing that was very amazing, when you see it, and we talk about how much money we're spending there, we talk about the $16 million an hour, the $2 billion a week. And they sound like numbers until you actually go there and you see the amount of equipment and you see the amount of investment we are making there. And obviously that is something that we have been doing and we will continue to do. But when you think about the fights that we have here right on this floor, the debates that we have on this floor about things like SCHIP, about things like improving our infrastructure that's crumbling, about things that are good domestically for our economy, and we don't do them. And we discuss and continue to debate about the money, and yet we spend billions and billions of dollars in Iraq. 
   I think while we do that, countries like China continue to take money and they invest it in their economy. We need to make our investment in our domestic economy, in our bridges, in our infrastructure, in our economy, in our health care system, in education. Those are the things that the American people want. Those are the things that we ran on last year. Those are the things that we promised the American people. And those are the things that we need to continue to work on. 
   I thank you thank you very much, my colleagues from the freshman class, for being here today. And, Ms. Sutton, thank you very much for bringing us here.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (NEW BUSH ADMINISTRATION RESTRICTIONS TO THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, last month the Bush administration dealt yet another blow to uninsured Americans, this time focused on millions of uninsured children in our Nation. 
   New guidelines set forth by the administration require that children must go without health insurance for at least 1 year before States will be allowed to provide them with coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program. The administration also requires States to enroll at least 95 percent of the children below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level before they can provide health coverage to other low-income children, a standard that no State in the country can currently meet. The Bush administration is limiting the very flexibility that has made the CHIP program successful. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable for the President to require low-income children to spend a year of their lives without health insurance, especially when we have a program in place that can provide them with the coverage they need today. It is time for the President to stop playing political games with the children's health care and to vow to work with us to strengthen, not weaken, the CHIP program.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Chair, NASA's accomplishments over the years have led to some of the greatest advances in human history. These scientific discoveries have led to everything from prolonging the average life span to improving the overall quality of life. NASA's research and exploration has also helped to unlock some of the greatest mysteries in the universe. The problem, however, is that too often the American public doesn't have an opportunity to fully experience NASA's accomplishments. It is when these accomplishments are transferred from the Federal sector to the private sector and the general public that the true benefits of what has been achieved can be realized. 
   Clearly, we don't have the ability or the financial means to shuttle every American into space, but we can do a better job of bringing the space experience into televisions, computers, and classrooms around the world. 
   The House Science and Technology Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall and Chairman Udall, recognize that point. The underlying bill includes language directing the NASA administrator to develop a technology plan that will allow the general public to experience missions to the Moon, Mars and other destinations in our solar system. 
   My amendment aims to take this effort and expand it in a way that leverages existing technology underway at our universities and high-tech businesses. 
   Specifically, my amendment tasks NASA to examine the feasibility of entering into contracts with appropriate public-private sector and international partners to share images and video of space missions with the public. The amendment promotes good government by requiring NASA to engage in a transparent bidding process when awarding contracts as it sees fit. 
   This new chapter in scientific discovery presents a valuable opportunity to engage public and private sectors in advancing NASA's mission for the 21st century. My upstate New York district is fast becoming a science and technology hub. We have an opening here to work together with colleges and universities, private research facilities, and small and large high-tech businesses to provide NASA with the tools it needs to better educate the public about space. 
   I would like to highlight that this amendment is intended to provide NASA with an additional resource to meet its goals. This measure would authorize NASA to conduct its own feasibility study to determine if and how it can best use the talents of our independent innovators to support its new international exploration initiative. This requirement would grant NASA the flexibility it needs to create a plan that best fits the ideas of its new program. 
   This amendment would also require all NASA contract decisions to be awarded following a fair and transparent bidding process. 
   This amendment has the backing of the State University of New York, the New York State section of the American Physical Society, the American Association of Geographers and the Information Technology Association of America. I respectfully urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment and support the contributions that our public and private universities and businesses make to scientific and technological progress in this country. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman for his comments. I would just point out what this amendment does is it attempts to get the private sector more engaged by promoting within NASA the push to transfer not from the public sector, not to just have this go from the public sector to the universities, but from the public sector to the private sector, to get the private sector more engaged and more involved in distributing the information. So that is slightly different than what I think the bill has because we do attempt to get the private sector more engaged. After all, that is probably the best way, by using the market system, to get the information out. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5749, EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 1265 provides for consideration of H.R. 5749, the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   Madam Speaker, our economy is in trouble, and hardworking Americans across the country are bearing the weight of it. Times are especially tough for middle-class families. The labor market continues to deteriorate, the price of gasoline and food continues to rise, the value of real estate continues to decline, and millions of American households are forced up to rack up more and more credit card debt just to make ends meet. And we are not talking about frivolous expenditures. Middle class families are racking up credit card debt to do things likes paying their electric bills or buying school supplies for their children. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people deserve better. Since the beginning of this year, when the majority first began to push for an extension of the unemployment benefits, the national unemployment rate has surged to 5.5 percent, the largest 1-month increase in 20 years. Yesterday, 144 members of the minority made it clear that they don't think the situation is serious enough to warrant extending unemployment benefits for Americans struggling to make ends meet, so we are here again today. 
   To me, 8.5 million unemployed Americans is a very serious situation. To me, trying to fill up your car with gas at $4 a gallon when you just lost your job is a very serious situation. And to me, when so-called free trade agreements are moving jobs across the border and no new quality jobs are being created, it is a very serious situation. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe government should lend a hand when its citizens are struggling, especially hard-working, middle-class families. But whether you agree with that or not, extending unemployment benefit is one of the most cost-effective, fast-acting ways to stimulate the economy. 
   Putting money directly into the pockets of struggling workers ensures that it will be spent quickly on daily necessities, boosting our economy and making it a little easier for folks to make ends meet. Every dollar spent on unemployment benefits generates $1.64 in new economic demand. In my home State of New York, an extra 13 weeks of unemployment benefits would infuse $600 million into the State economy. 
   For my constituents in upstate New York, a struggling economy and high unemployment has been a fact of life for a very long time now. My district hasn't reaped the so-called cyclical job  growth benefits from trade agreements. Oh, we lost our jobs all right, but we haven't seen the job creation yet. In fact, employees of businesses in my district have applied for trade adjustment assistance over 200 times since the program's inception, and of those applications, the Labor Department certified over half as a result of trade agreements. Unfortunately, as factories close, hard-working families have nowhere to go but to stand in line outside the local unemployment office. The American people deserve better, and that is why we are here today. 
   This bill would provide up to 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits in every State to workers exhausting their regular benefits and provide an additional 13 weeks to States with higher unemployment levels. 
   Federal unemployment trust funds, which were created exactly for this type of situation and have more than enough reserves to cover the costs, will finance these benefits. This costs will not be deferred to our children to pay back, and the trust fund will do so in a structure very similar to the temporary extended unemployment compensation program established in response to the last recession in 2002, an emergency extension, I might add, which was passed by the previous Republican Congress in the same way we are doing today, when there were fewer long-term unemployed workers. 
   Madam Speaker, extending these benefits for struggling Americans is the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the rule and the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I think people, the American people, hear people in Congress cite statistics and studies as if the people they are referring to are not real. These people, a person who loses job, who has to support his family, doesn't care if the statistics say that his State has the lowest unemployment in America. He doesn't care.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, unemployment insurance can mean the difference between saving a home and failing to make a mortgage payment. It can mean the difference between purchasing needed medications and going without, and it can mean the difference between filling up the car to go out and look for another job and having to stay home. This legislation has the potential to help over 4 million unemployed Americans put food on their tables while quickly stimulating the economy. 
   The number of long-term unemployed Americans is higher now than when Congress last extended benefits in 2002. I am hopeful we can come together later today, Republicans and Democrats, to do the right thing and pass this rule and the underlying legislation. American workers and families can't wait any longer.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, over the last 6 months the new Democratic Congress has passed over 37 major pieces of legislation, many of them with bipartisan support, which have helped millions of Americans. Unfortunately, President Bush seems content with the status quo, opposing two-thirds of our forward-agenda. 
   Today, the President will again veto legislation providing for a serious Federal investment in lifesaving stem cell research, supported by 70 percent of the American people. Further stem cell research would give new hope to millions of American families across the country suffering from life threatening and debilitating diseases like lupus, juvenile diabetes and Parkinson's. 
   Earlier this year, we approved a defense authorization bill that includes a 3.5 percent pay raise for military personnel. The President's response was a veto threat. He believed a 3.5 percent raise was too much. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is never too much gratitude and respect we can show for our troops. We don't show gratitude with lip service, we show it by action.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong support of this amendment. And I'd like to start off by saying to my colleague that I respect a great deal from Texas, this amendment is not about sharing power. It's not about giving power from one part of the country to another. It's about how do we do it. Do we do it in a thoughtful way? Do we do it in a reasonable way? Or do we do it in a way by using eminent domain, by running high power lines over people's land, by taking people's land? Is that the American way? Is that the way we want to have our energy policy dictated to the States and the localities? I think not.  
   I think there is a better way to do it. There is a more thoughtful way to do it. We are facing such a plan in New York, and it's ill-conceived and poorly thought out. And that's not the way we should be running our energy policy in this country. It should be in a more thoughtful way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, again, I rise in very strong opposition to this bill.  
   This bill does so few things in terms of getting power to where it needs to be. They talk about the fact that the original 1221 was intended to help get power to places that need it to help alleviate congestion. But, in fact, the NYRI proposal in New York State does nothing whatsoever to prevent congestion. Rather, it does more to create congestion than to alleviate it. 
   I strongly support the Hinchey-Wolf amendment because I believe that using eminent domain to take people's property in order to run power lines over it is the wrong thing. It is not the American way. It is not what we came to Congress for. And I strongly oppose that.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (LUMBEE RECOGNITION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 465 provides for consideration of H.R. 65, the Lumbee Recognition Act. For over 100 years, the Lumbees have been in Federal recognition limbo. This legislation, which maintains the strong bipartisan support of 215 Members, aims to bring closure to the issue of full Federal recognition for Lumbee Indians of North Carolina, which has lingered in question for far too long. 
   There's absolutely no question that the Lumbee Indians constitute an Indian tribe. The Lumbee were first recognized as a tribe in 1885 by their home State of North Carolina. After initially seeking Federal recognition in 1888, the Congress acknowledged the Lumbee Indians as an Indian tribe via the Lumbee Act of 1956 but denied them any benefits and privileges of such status. This rare form of recognition is nothing more than an unjust half measure that must be corrected by Congress. 
   Those opposed to the underlying bill will argue that it is the duty of the Department of the Interior to recognize the status of an Indian tribe. However, because of the action taken by Congress in 1956, creating half-measure recognition, the Department of the Interior has ruled that the Lumbee tribe is not eligible for the tribal recognition process which it administers. That's a very important point that should command the attention of every Member of this body. Simply put, the Department of the Interior is saying to Congress, your legislation in 1956 created this recognition problem and now you are the appropriate branch of the Federal Government to rectify it, that is, Congress. 
   The recognition of an Indian tribe by the United States has always ultimately been the responsibility of Congress. Even though the Department of the Interior established an administrative process for recognition of the tribes in 1978, Congress has since recognized nine tribes by special legislation where there were special circumstances. Further, because Congress tasks the administration with the authority to establish an administration recognition process in no way means that Congress completely abdicates its authority over such matters. 
   Madam Speaker, numerous bills have been introduced regarding Federal recognition of the Lumbee starting way back in 1899. And during that time, numerous hearings were held and reports were filed. Most recently, the Natural Resources Committee held a hearing in April of this year where the underlying bill was debated and amendments were offered. Further, the Department of the Interior has researched and studied the Lumbee history 11 times. 
   Madam Speaker, we owe it to the Lumbee Indians and the State of North Carolina to write the final chapter and close the book on the issue of full Federal recognition. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, in response to my colleague from North Carolina, I would have to say that  while it is the role of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to certainly deal with Indian tribes, we have delegated that responsibility to them as Congress, to that agency. We have not abdicated our responsibility. That is our responsibility as Congress. We should not give over our responsibility in any particular area completely to an agency. We have delegated that responsibility to them, and I think it is the responsibility and the duty of people in Congress to bring forth recognition in cases such as this. 
   With that, I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega).

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, for over 100 years the Lumbee Indians have been recognized by their home State of North Carolina. 
   The Department of the Interior has researched the Lumbee history on 11 separate occasions. Numerous bills have been introduced, many congressional hearings have been held, and the Department of the Interior has stated that the Lumbee are not eligible for the Department's recognition process because of Congress' action in 1956. 
   The gentleman from Connecticut has asked the question, what are we trying to hide? That's insulting. There is nothing that anyone is trying to hide. What we are trying to do is recognize a long-overdue injustice and recognize the Lumbee Tribe. That is what this bill is about, that is what all the hard work from the gentleman from North Carolina is about, is to rectify a long-overdue injustice. 
   Clearly, the time for half-measures is over. We have a responsibility to address the issue and write the final chapter of the unfortunate Lumbee Indian Federal recognition saga, which has gone on far too long. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my colleague and good friend, the gentlelady from California, for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of this rule and the underlying bill, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   I have listened to stories from around my upstate New York district from families affected by life-threatening and debilitating illnesses: children with childhood diabetes, men and women with spinal cord injuries, lupus, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Every day, these brave Americans fight the odds with the hope that stem cell research will one day give them a new lease on life. 
   The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act will ensure that our Nation's scientists are able to work towards making that hope a reality. Most importantly, this bill creates an ethical framework, stronger than the President's current policy, which must be followed in conducting this lifesaving research. The bill only authorizes the use of stem cell lines generated from embryos that would otherwise be discarded by fertility clinics and requires written, informed consent from the donating women. 
   My constituents support this ethically responsible lifesaving research, and I stand with them today to give hope to millions of people around the country. 
   Opponents say they believe life is sacred, and I agree. It is. So let us leave no stone unturned to give as many people the opportunity, the chance to live, people with lupus, with Alzheimer's, with Parkinson's, with diabetes. Let us pass this stem cell bill. 
   The message from the American people is clear. It is time for this administration to do the right thing and sign this critically important law. 
   My colleague talks about bumper sticker policies and pandering to liberal blogs. This is not about pandering to liberal blogs. This is about listening to the American people. It is time this administration listens to the American people and signs a stem cell research bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, as a former DA from upstate New York, I know firsthand the scourge that methamphetamine has laid upon our rural areas. And I represented a district that was both urban and rural, and I saw that methamphetamines did to the rural areas what crack cocaine did to the urban areas. And I think that it is imperative that we take these steps that we are taking to fight methamphetamines. 
   The difference, however, between methamphetamines and crack is that there is a derivative effect that methamphetamine has, and that is that it affects the people who live in the households of people who produce methamphetamines and law enforcement officers when they go into those areas. So it is very important that this bill is passed because it does exactly what local law enforcement needs, and that is for the Federal Government to act in a way that develops strategies for fighting methamphetamines, strategies for protecting our law enforcement officials. 
   So I strongly support this bill, and urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 985, WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Florida, for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, accountability is a word often used but seldom implemented. For the last 12 years it is as if Congress forgot one of its principal responsibilities is to demand accountability from the administration and protect the American people from waste, fraud and abuse. 
   The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, which this rule provides consideration for, will provide additional transparency and accountability for the way the Federal Government spends tax dollars of the hardworking Americans. 
   It is no secret that the only way we can truly gather firsthand accounts of instances where waste, fraud and abuse occur is from the people on the inside, the Federal employees. Unfortunately, not all Federal employees are currently protected from being fired if they unmask corruption or other fraudulent activities going on inside the administration. 
   This legislation goes right to the heart of the issue by extending much needed whistleblower protections to Federal Government employees working on national security, government contractor employees and transportation security employees, including baggage screeners at our airports. It only makes sense that Federal employees, especially those who have undergone extensive background investigations, obtained security clearances and handled classified information on a routine basis, be afforded the same rights and whistleblower protections as all other Federal employees. 
   In addition, this legislation takes some very important steps. It would abolish the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction for overhearing whistleblower appeals cases, taking away its Supreme Court-like jurisdiction and allowing the appropriate Federal appeals courts in the respective circuit where the incident took place to hear such cases.  
   For instance, if the instance of whistleblowing were to occur in New York, in my district, that is the Second Circuit. The initial decision rendered by the Second Circuit should be appealed in the Second Circuit. It should not be required to come to the Federal Circuit here. 
   The current appeals structures for hearing whistleblower cases not only places a hefty financial burden on individuals who would have to travel from across the country to D.C. just to have their appeal heard, it also provides a disservice to our Nation's legal system by overburdening one court. 
   As a former district attorney, I know from experience that having the ability to draw on decisions from similar cases rendered from different courts around the country would greatly improve our legal system. It would benefit all parties involved, and further enhance our Nation's exceptional legal system. Further, by allowing other Federal circuit appellate courts to hear whistleblower appeal cases increases the opportunity for those cases to be heard by the United States Supreme Court. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to level the playing field for all Federal employees who have the courage to stand up for the American people. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this rule and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3093, COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 562 provides an open rule for consideration of H.R. 3093, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008. 
   I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee and ranking member for reporting out a bill that not only does not pay lip service but makes critical investment in our Nation's communities. 
   The bill provides $725 million for Community Oriented Policing Services, more commonly known as the COPS program, 25 percent above the current funding level. As a former prosecutor, I know how vitally important these programs are in assisting local law enforcement to hire and train law enforcement officers to participate in community policing, purchase and deploy new crime fighting technologies, and develop and test new and innovative policing strategies. 
   The administration had proposed to modify the COPS program into a new discretionary grant program, but the committee has chosen instead to keep COPS as a separate dedicated grant program. This is a proven model for getting these grants to the communities that need them, and I applaud the committee for preserving this program. 
   The bill includes $303 million for Economic Development Administration, the EDA. The EDA administers several economic development programs including public work grants for upgrading infrastructure, planning, and trade adjustment assistance for communities that bear the burden of jobs outsourced to other countries. 
   Additionally, the legislation would direct the EDA to consider with favorable bias grant proposals which incorporate green technologies and strategies that would reduce energy consumption, reduce harmful gas emissions, and contribute to sustainability. 
   The bill provides $50 million, 52 percent more than the current funding, for the Weed and Seed program. The Weed and Seed program helps localities develop programs to weed out and deter crime, and then take the all-important step that is so often left out of seeding the formerly high crime areas with programs to promote neighborhood revitalization. The funds will be used to carry out this mission in cities, such as my home in Utica, New York, and  sponsor activities such as truancy prevention, conflict resolution, mentoring, and job training for at-risk youths. 
   Additionally, the bill, this resolution, provides for consideration and includes $40 million for grants, technical assistance, and training to State and local governments to develop dedicated drug courts that subject nonviolent offenders to an integrated mix of treatment, drug testing, incentives, and sanctions. 
   As a DA, I quickly learned that no matter what initiatives law enforcement took to reduce the supply of drugs, it never really affected the demand for drugs which never seemed to diminish and, therefore, created a seemingly endless market for drug dealers. But when my office established the county's drug court program, I realized the powerful effect that the program had in helping enrolled participants get control of their addiction and thereby reducing their demand for drugs. The appropriation of $40 million for drug court provided by H.R. 3093 is $30 million more than the current level, and I congratulate the committee for increasing funds for this vital and proven weapon on the war on drugs. 
   H.R. 3093 would also create incentives to fight illegal immigration. It would prohibit the Federal Government from using any of these funds on any entity that does not participate in the basic pilot program which allows employers to verify whether potential or current employees can legally work in the United States. This voluntary pilot program was created by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act of 1996 and allows employers to verify employment status through an automated system linked to the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security data bases. 
   This legislation also includes $6.5 billion for the National Science Foundation. This level of funding will support the doubling of NSF's budget over the next 10 years, and represents a true commitment to investment in basic research and development, which will provide for innovation and future technologies. This commitment is an important part of the innovation agenda designed to maintain the United States' competitiveness. 
   H.R. 3093 also includes over $17.6 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA's unique mission is to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery, and aeronautics research; and this appropriation enables them to accomplish this mission by restoring some of the cuts made by the administration to science, aeronautics, and education portfolios at the agency. This recommendation also provides for the continued efforts of NASA's Moon-Mars goals. The act calls on NASA to expand human knowledge, develop and operate advanced aeronautical and space-faring vehicles; encourage commercial use of space; coordinate with other U.S. agencies to maximize research results; cooperate with other nations in research and applications and to preserve U.S. preeminence in aeronautics and space. 
   This bill also prohibits the use of funds by the FBI to issue National Security Letters in contravention of the statutes authorizing their use. National Security Letters enable the FBI to secretly review customer records of suspected foreign agents without judicial review. In March, the Department of Justice Inspector General reported that the FBI agents had in numerous cases misused National Security Letters without complying with either statutes or DOJ guidelines governing their use. This widespread abuse of secret investigatory powers undermines the very notions of liberty and freedom from tyranny upon which this Nation was founded. The prohibition on use of funds contained in H.R. 3093 will ensure that such abuse does not continue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have addressed only a handful of the important programs for which H.R. 3093 would appropriate funds. My remarks have focused on the criminal justice, NASA funding, and economic development aspects of the bill; but there are many other important areas addressed in this legislation. It provides funding for critical scientific research, including several programs which study global warming and climate change that the administration attempted to eliminate. The Appropriations Committee has approved a bill which would maintain the funding of this critical research, and I once again thank them for their work and welcome a chance to vote in favor of this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) for his comments, and I couldn't agree with him more. Clearly, the safety of our Nation from foreign enemies is critical, and it's something that needs to be a priority and is a priority with this Congress and prior Congresses. 
   But one thing that I think is critical that we can never forget is safety doesn't begin at our borders. Safety is something that we need to recognize within our borders as well, and this bill takes great strides in terms of ensuring that our children are safe when they go to school. It puts more police officers on the street. It increases funding for the DNA database to help us locate rapists and criminals who have committed crimes and locate them and  bring them to justice. It funds the drug court program, which is critical in terms of dealing with people who are addicted to drugs. 
   This bill takes a balanced approach to law enforcement, takes a balanced approach to what this country needs to keep our citizens safe, both internally and externally as well. And I believe that it is a very good bill, and that we should support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, the Appropriations Committee has presented us with a bill that will provide funding agencies related to Commerce, Justice and Science for the fiscal year 2008. 
   The bill contains a higher overall allocation than was requested by the President, but with very good reason. By all measures this bill will have a real, tangible impact on all Americans, improving their daily lives in many ways. It funds the Economic Development Administration, Weed & Seed program, prescription drug monitoring, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Census Bureau, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and community-oriented police services. 
   And I would just like to mention in that regard, from a personal perspective, in my community in which I live, there is a small police department, 20 officers; that as a result of the community-oriented police in New Hartford, New York, they were able to get three additional police officers, increase their technology significantly. That's a 15 percent increase in officers to that department. The COPS program makes our streets safer. 
   The Drug Corps program is a phenomenal program that this bill will continue to fund. And I would urge any of my colleagues in Congress to someday sit through a Drug Corps graduation program. When they see that, and they see the testimonies of the people who have finished, and listen to their families talk about how devastating drug addiction has been to their family and how this program has helped them, they would strongly support this bill and strongly support the Drug Corps program. 
   In short, H.R. 3093 provides critical funding for programs that keep our streets safe, our economy prosperous, and allows our scientists to continue studying global warming and climate change. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a vote of ``yes'' on the previous question and on the rule.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud support today of the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. My constituents in upstate New York know what it is like to have to pay more than most people in the country for energy. They also know what it is like to have to deal with winters that are more severe, and they know that during those winter months they have to adjust their budget to be able to handle the added expense for fuel costs. 
   But they also know that prices will continue to rise if something is not done to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels.     
   However, we must address our long-term energy demands with more than just short-term solutions. We have to face the facts, and the fact is that oil is a finite resource. We ought to be investing in a wide array of clean energy. 
   The giveaways this legislation will reclaim from oil and gas industry will be placed into a renewable energy account to fund research and development of alternative fuels, providing a much needed new direction to address our Nation's growing energy needs. 
   It is important to note that we don't pass this legislation today for ourselves, but rather we pass this legislation for our children and our children's children.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, yesterday General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker made it clear that the Bush administration intends to continue its current strategy in Iraq with no changes, despite absolutely no progress on political reconciliation. 
   Today when we listen to both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testify again, it's important to remember that the principal objective of the President's troop escalation plan was to give the Iraq Government time and the proper environment to create political reconciliation. 
   I recently returned from Iraq, and it's obvious that the political reconciliation that we hoped for is not taking place. They have had both, but the reconciliation remains elusive. General Petraeus himself has admitted that there has been no sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation in Iraq. 
   How much longer will General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker and this administration demand our troops and our Nation continue to sacrifice for the sake of an Iraqi government that is unwilling and unable to secure its own future? I would like to hear the answer to that question today, because many of us here in Congress do not believe it is our Nation's best interest to keep more troops on the ground in Iraq.

   It is long past time for Congress to debate whether or not the President's latest troop escalation will actually change the situation on the ground in Iraq. This is a debate that Congress must have. We will all have 5 minutes to explain to our constituents and to the American people and to our troops why we either support the President's strategy or why we think it is time for a new direction. 
   This is the first time since the war began that every Member of the House will have 5 minutes to speak about the situation in Iraq. The last time Congress was allowed so much time for a debate on the war was during the lead-up to the first gulf war back in the 1990s. 
   Mr. Speaker, every single one of us in this House supports the efforts our troops are making in Iraq. Some believe the best way to support them is to allow the President to conduct the war in any way he sees fit, without question. I believe it is our job in Congress to ask the tough questions, and that is what we are doing this week.

Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, Democrats passed a comprehensive solution to the country's energy crisis, but for all of their talk about solving this problem, Republicans still oppose the effort. It's no surprise the Republicans are against this commonsense energy plan. The plan makes Big Oil pay royalties on land they've leased for years so Americans can start benefiting from oil companies drilling on our land. That's only fair. It is the American people's land. Shouldn't they get some of the benefits? 
   Our legislation also repeals tax breaks and subsidies that Big Oil has been getting for years, thanks to the Washington Republicans. Every quarter, Big Oil is announcing larger profits. They don't need corporate welfare. This comprehensive energy legislation will help people--those middle class Americans suffering from high gas prices and dealing with the failed Bush-McCain economy at the same time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 195 provides for consideration of H.R. 556, the National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthened Transparency Act of 2007 under an open rule with a preprinting requirement. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services.  
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clause 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order the amendment in the nature of a substitute reported by the Committee on Financial Services as an original bill for purpose of amendment, which shall be considered for amendment by section with each section considered as read. 
   The rule provides that any amendment to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute must be printed in the Congressional Record prior to consideration of the bill. Each amendment so printed may be offered only by the Member who caused it to be printed or his designee or her designee and shall be considered as read. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, foreign investment creates jobs and serves as a vital component of our Nation's economy. However, we as a Nation cannot afford to sacrifice the safety and security with a foreign investment review process that jeopardizes American lives. Take, for instance, our Nation's ports, which employ thousands of Americans and handle a large majority of U.S.-bound cargo. New Yorkers and many of my colleagues take the security of these ports very, very seriously. We as a country cannot go halfway on port security. We must take all the necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of our infrastructure and, more importantly, our constituents. 
   We took a giant step in the right direction on port security a few weeks ago when we approved legislation that would require screening of 100 percent of all U.S.-bound shipping containers over the next 5 years. And today we are taking another step by reforming and strengthening the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, also known as CFIUS, process by which the Federal Government reviews foreign investments in the United States for their national security implications. 
   As a new Member of Congress, I am new to this institution, but the controversy surrounding the Dubai Ports scandal last year echoed far beyond the Washington Beltway. I, along with many of my constituents, was troubled by the administration's approval of a deal to allow a company owned by a government of the United Arab Emirates to manage terminal operations at six major U.S. ports. It was clear that the administration dropped the ball and that the national security review process for foreign investments had failed. 
   The National Security FIRST Act would significantly reform the foreign investment review process so that we never have another Dubai debacle, by ensuring that the proper steps are taken to keep our ports, our cities, and our citizens safe and secure. The National Security FIRST Act also requires the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to conduct a 30-day review of any national security-related business transaction. After a 30-day review is conducted, it would be required to conduct a full-scale, 45-day investigation of the effects the business transaction would have on national security, if deemed necessary. 
   In addition, the legislation requires the committee to file semi-annual reports to Congress, keeping the American people informed and shedding some much-needed sunlight and transparency on foreign investments in the U.S. infrastructure that could have potentially devastating consequences to our security and our citizens. 
   And while the legislation strengthens and reforms the process, it also allows the critical flow of foreign investment into the United States economy to continue, which is critical if we are going to successfully compete with the rest of the world in this age of globalization. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, last night during the debate in the Rules Committee, some questions were raised as to the appropriateness of an open rule as opposed to bringing this bill under a suspension of the rules. 
   I think that question was answered clearly in that 12 amendments were filed on the bill, three by Democrats and nine by Republicans. I think that question was clearly answered, an open rule is preferable and there are amendments filed. 
   Protecting the safety and security of Americans is without question our top priority as Members of this institution. It is overwhelmingly clear that the current process is in place for the Federal Government to review foreign investment is broken. 
   The National Security FIRST Act will provide the necessary reforms to the process and keep our infrastructure, our cities, and most importantly, our constituents safe and secure. 
   It will also ensure that a debacle like the one that occurred last year at Dubai Ports does not happen again, while still continuing to encourage the very important foreign investment in our economy here in this country. I would strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule, and the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered. 
   The resolution was agreed to. 
   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, we have sat here for the past hour and listened to so many speakers talk about energy, when the underlying bill is actually the Coast Guard reauthorization bill. But if our colleagues want to talk about energy, then I think we should point out some very obvious facts to them. 
   First of all, when the Clinton administration finished in the White House, oil was at $27 a barrel. It is now at $119 a barrel, a significant increase. Yet they try to point the finger at this Congress, this Democratic Congress that has been in the majority for 16 months. Yet on every bill that we bring up, every bill that the Democrats bring before this Congress that attempts in any way, shape, fashion or form to reduce the price of oil, we get nothing but ``no'' votes from the other side of the aisle. That is their response to high energy costs. That is what they want to do to the American people in terms of the energy costs. 
   I said earlier in the debate a point that I think is very important. They want to talk about priorities as what we do for the big energy companies, what we do for the big oil companies. Well, that is not the priority of this side of the aisle. We want to talk about alternative energy. We want to talk about reducing the dependence on foreign oil, reducing the dependence on gas and on fossil fuels, thereby making our country stronger, both domestically and internationally. If they want to talk about gas and oil, that is the debate. But this debate is about the Coast Guard bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, the men and women of the Coast Guard are to be commended for their service to our country and their commitment to the multifaceted mission of the Coast Guard. They serve their country, they risk their lives, just to keep us safe, safe along our coasts, safe along our inland waterways; not thousands of miles away, but right here in the United States. We need to ensure that they have the tools and the support to do the job in the best way that they can. The Coast Guard deserves and needs this bill. The American people deserve and need this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, after extensive consideration by three House committees, it is time to bring the Coast Guard authorization bill to the floor. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1126 provides for consideration of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2008, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, with 40 minutes controlled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and 20 minutes controlled by the Committee on Homeland Security. The rule makes in order 15 of the amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee. 
   This rule also takes steps to prevent terrorist acts against our Nation by allowing for the text of H.R. 2399, the Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act, to be added upon House passage of the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act, and for the whole package to be sent over to our colleagues in the Senate. The Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act, which passed the House on May 22, 2007, by an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 412-0, provides strong new enforcement tools at the border, including increased criminal penalties for alien smuggling, human trafficking and slavery, drug trafficking, and terrorism or espionage. 
   It also subjects smugglers and traffickers to even higher penalties for transporting persons under inhumane conditions, such as in an engine or storage compartment, or for causing serious bodily injury. 
   It directs the Department of Homeland Security to check against all available terrorist watch lists, alien smugglers, and smuggled individuals who are interdicted at the U.S. land, air and sea borders. 
   And it tightens proof requirements for distinguishing covert transportation of family members or others for humanitarian reasons for which the penalties are less severe. 
   Since the September 11, 2001, terrorists attacks, the Coast Guard has served as the primary agency responsible for our Nation's maritime security. The fact that the Coast Guard has risen to meet this heightened responsibility, while at the same time continuing to fulfill its nonsecurity missions, is a testament to the commitment and honor to the service men and women of the Coast Guard. 
   The bill that this rule provides for consideration will ensure that the Coast Guard can continue to perform all facets of its mission in an uncompromising way. H.R. 2830 provides the necessary resources by authorizing 1,500 additional Coast Guard personnel and increasing the funding to the Coast Guard by $8.4 billion, $200 billion over the President's request. 
   The underlying legislation sets requirements for security around vessels that transport, and facilities that process, liquefied natural gas, giving the Coast Guard the responsibility for enforcing security zones and requiring it to certify that State or local governments have the necessary resources before they can assist in security patrols around facilities. It also directs the Department of Homeland Security to analyze the threat of a terrorist attack on gasoline and chemical shipments and report to Congress.  
   H.R. 2830 will bolster port security and immigration enforcement by establishing an Assistant Commandant for Port and Waterways Security, authorizing additional maritime security teams and by establishing the Waterway Watch Program whereby civilian boaters can notify the Coast Guard of suspicious activity. 
   The Coast Guard Authorization Act enhances safety standards in one of America's most dangerous occupations--the one portrayed on the popular television series ``The Deadliest Catch''--by increasing safety equipment requirements on fishing vessels, requiring training for vessel operations, and by changing the appeals process for suspending and revoking a mariner's license. 
   The bill also addresses one of the Coast Guard's Integrated Deepwater Systems Program, which has been beleaguered by several well-publicized delays, cost overruns, and problems with the designs of certain replacement assets. The bill increases accountability for the Deepwater Program by addressing systemic contract management problems and establishing a civilian chief acquisition officer reporting directly to the Coast Guard commandant. 
   H.R. 2830 also requires ships to begin installing water treatment systems to reduce the spread of invasive species in ballast water carried by the ships. These requirements are a step in the right direction because they will protect the waterways of every State and territory of the United States, and the industries and communities that rely upon them, from aquatic invasive species that enter the waters of the United States via the ballast water systems of commercial vessels. The bill also addresses other environmental concerns by requiring double hulls for U.S. ships carrying over 600 cubic meters of oil and providing for implementation of an international agreement on maritime pollution. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation this rule provides for consideration is the product of extensive hearings and consideration by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Homeland Security Committee and the Judiciary Committee. I commend the chairmen and ranking members of those committees for their commitment to addressing the needs of the Coast Guard and our Nation's maritime security. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my friend from Texas for his comments. 
   I would just like to make two points in that regard. The first point is that he mentioned that this bill doesn't deal with the LNG issue. And I would beg to differ. This bill ensures that the Coast Guard will be there to ensure and protect the safety of our liquefied natural gas facilities that are built out in the deep water or out in the ocean. It's critical. Security is absolutely critical to these facilities, and that's exactly what this bill insures. 
   Secondly, my friend mentions that we have not done anything about energy. Well, I would respectfully say that anyone who says that, I would have to ask them where have they been for the past 16 months. We have done a great deal with respect to energy. The difference is that we haven't done anything to help large oil companies because we believe that they are part of the problem. We have done things to help develop alternative energy, because that is the future of America. It's about making America less dependent on foreign oil and less dependent on the large oil companies. That's what we have done. That's what Democrats believe in, and that's what we will continue to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life of suffragette and abolitionist Martha Coffin Wright. Martha Coffin was born in Massachusetts on Christmas Day 1806, the youngest child of Thomas and Anna Coffin. After her father's death from typhus in 1815, Martha's mother assumed the responsibilities of the family's business, setting an example of an independent, self-reliant woman that would shape Martha's views about the role of women in society. In 1824 Martha Coffin married Peter Pelham. Soon the couple moved to a frontier fort in Florida where Martha would give birth to her first daughter. Tragically, Peter died 2 years later in 1826 leaving Martha a 19-year-old widow with an infant child. To support herself and her daughter, she moved to Auburn, New York, to teach painting and writing at a Quaker school for girls. Soon after relocating to Auburn, she met and married a law student named David Wright with whom she would have six more children. In July of 1848, Martha's older sister, Lucretia Coffin Mott, a prominent Quaker preacher visited Martha's home in Auburn. During the visit, Martha, Lucretia, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton met to plan the Seneca Falls Convention at which 68 women and 32 men would sign the Declaration of Sentiments. This revolutionary document, modeled on the Declaration of Independence, stated that all men and women are created equal. It would be another 72 years before the 19th amendment gave American women the right to vote. 
   In the years following the Seneca Falls Convention, Martha Coffin Wright was also active in the abolition movement. With her sister, Lucretia, she attended the founding meeting of the American antislavery society in Philadelphia in 1833 and later presided over numerous antislavery meetings, including two in upstate New York, in early 1861 that were disrupted by angry anti-abolitionist mobs. Martha bravely opened her home in Auburn to the Underground Railroad in Auburn where she harbored fugitive slaves. In 1863 Martha and other women's rights activists formed the Women's National Loyal League to carry petitions for the abolition of slavery which would finally be achieved in 1865 with the ratification of the 13th amendment. 
   After the Civil War, Martha was also instrumental in the formation of the American Equal Rights Association, which attempted to merge the issues of black suffrage and women's suffrage; and in early 1874 she was elected president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. In December 1874, Martha took ill with typhoid pneumonia and died in Boston on January 4, 1865, at the age of 68. 
   Madam Speaker, Martha Coffin Wright's dedication and commitment should inspire all of us. I am proud to represent the region of upstate New York where Martha Coffin Wright and countless others fought tirelessly for equal rights for all. I am proud to represent the people of Seneca Falls, New York, who established the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1969 to honor the contributions of great American women with a permanent home. I was honored to attend the induction of Martha Coffin Wright into the Hall of Fame this past weekend. 
   I am proud to represent the birthplace of the women's rights movement, the importance of which was recognized by Congress in 1980 with the creation of the Women's Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to once again join me in honoring the contributions of Martha Coffin Wright and reaffirming the historical significance of Seneca Falls, New York with a voice vote in favor of House Resolution 588 recognizing the achievement of a truly great American, Martha Coffin Wright.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, Democrats made a promise last November to bring accountability back to Congress and the Federal Government. In just a few short months, we have conducted thorough and meaningful oversight on a series of issues that would have been swept under the rug by the previous Republican leadership, which sadly was often more concerned with protecting the administration than doing the right thing. 
   Earlier this week, the Justice Department, at the request of congressional Democrats, released thousands of pages of e-mails and internal documents related to the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys by the administration. The documents indicate that the administration's contention that the attorneys were dismissed for performance-related reasons simply is not true. 
   This Congress is seeking to attain the rest of the story by asking senior White House officials involved in the U.S. Attorney scandal to testify under oath. Unfortunately, the administration does not want to comply and provide the American people with the facts. 
   As a former elected district attorney, I know how critically important it is for prosecutors to be independent and to perform their job without fear of retaliatory firings. 
   It is time for this administration to do the right thing and hold those responsible for the scandal accountable.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, today marks the first time in a decade that those hardworking workers who earn minimum wage will receive a pay raise. Today, around the Nation, workers who have been paid $5.15 for 10 years will finally get a boost in their pay. This wage increase will directly benefit low-income workers who need it most. 
   We should never forget that most minimum wage workers are adults who work to support themselves and their families, and many are single mothers who must work several jobs to make ends meet. And while some at the very top are primarily benefiting from the supposed economic recovery, most workers have seen very little economic progress. Average real wages are lower today than they were in 2001, even though productivity is up by 13 percent. 
   Madam Speaker, this wage increase is a great concrete step by the new Democratic-led Congress toward a broader agenda that will help us not only grow our economy, but ensure that every American benefits from that growth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, I rise to join my good friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Patrick J. Murphy) in strong support of this amendment and the underlying legislation. 
   I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Financial Services Committee for producing a bill that updates the National Federal Insurance Program to meet the needs of the 21st century. It improves flood mapping; increases financial accountability; and is comprehensive, responsible public policy that will benefit thousands of Americans in the highest risk areas. 
   Mr. Chairman, across my district in upstate New York, the increasing frequency and destructive power of rainstorms and snow melts in recent years has caused flooding disasters which have seriously damaged homes and businesses in a number of communities. 
   Some of these communities in the Susquehanna River Basin, like the city of Oneonta, suffered a fate last year similar to the areas in Pennsylvania situated in the Delaware River Basin. The city of Oneonta experienced very damaging flooding in June of 2006 caused by severe rainstorms. However, it is now September of 2007, and there are local homeowners and businesses still wrestling with FEMA's burdensome claims process waiting on settlements they were assured as National Flood Insurance Program policyholders. 
   Mr. Chairman, the same is true for the local city government in Oneonta. It took almost 1 whole year after the disaster for FEMA to fully reimburse the city for repairs to public infrastructure severely damaged during the floods. Even after many months of persistence at the regional FEMA office, the city was left with no recourse and had to seek the assistance of my office for intervention. 
   Finally, after encountering hurdle after hurdle for a year, the city received their reimbursement from FEMA. We should ask ourselves, should we not strive to create more efficiency in an agency that is still learning lessons in the aftermath of Katrina and Rita?     
   Mr. Chairman, the amendment Mr. Murphy and I are offering today will study the feasibility of creating an independent office within FEMA. Its primary task will be to help local homeowners and business owners in Upstate New York and across the U.S. to navigate the often tedious and complicated Federal flood insurance claims system within the National Flood Insurance Program. 
   The amendment establishes a National Flood Insurance Advocate, which would be tasked with providing insurance policyholders across the U.S. with a type of ombudsman to represent the public interest by investigating and addressing complaints. The amendment also requires that the National Flood Insurance Advocate report to Congress with analysis of the major  problems facing the National Flood Insurance Program. This National Flood Insurance Advocate is based on the successful model of the Taxpayer Advocate Service, which has helped countless constituents navigate the Internal Revenue Services. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this amendment, and I urge support for passage of the bill.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, last week the Census Bureau came out with a new report that shows the number of children living without health insurance increased last year by 700,000. It is the second year in a row that the number of uninsured children has increased. Today, 8.7 million children in this country are going without the critical health care services they need to live a healthy and productive life. 
   Fortunately, this Democratic Congress has acted to reverse this disturbing trend. Last month, this House passed the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. The legislation provides an additional $50 billion in funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program which today provides 6 million children access to private health insurance. 
   Unfortunately, there are 6 million other children that are eligible for the program but are not currently enrolled. Our $50 billion investment would allow us to reach almost every  child who is currently eligible which would significantly reduce the number of uninsured children in America. 
   Madam Speaker, this Congress has acted. It is time for the President to join with us in prioritizing the health care needs of our children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 429 provides for consideration of H.R. 1100, the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site Boundary Revision Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Natural Resources and makes in order the substitute reported by the Committee on Natural Resources. The rule also allows for consideration of all three amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee on H.R. 1100. 
   Madam Speaker, let me begin by congratulating my good friend and freshman class colleague Mr. Shuler for working this thoughtful legislation through the legislative process. H.R. 1100 will further preserve the legacy and communicate the stories of internationally recognized author, Pulitzer Prize-winner, and great American historian, Carl Sandburg. 
   Located in the pristine wilderness of North Carolina is the 248-acre Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site. Each year, over 150,000 people visit for the purpose of learning about Carl Sandburg's positive influences on writing, or to hike and just enjoy the splendor of this beautiful, pristine site. 
   In recent years it was determined by interested parties at all levels, local, State and Federal, including the National Park Service, that increasing  the size would be desirable to carry out the purposes of this historic site. 
   H.R. 1100 addresses the need for more space by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to acquire up to 115 acres of land from willing sellers by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. 
   Now, for some unknown reason, some my colleagues have labeled this legislation an ``egregious example of landgrabbing'' by the Federal Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. The key point to this legislation is that the land would have to be acquired from ``willing sellers.'' 
   Of the 115 acres, 5 acres would be used to construct a new visitor center and parking lot, and the remaining 110 acres would be used to enhance the overall experience when visiting the site. Visitors will now have an opportunity to sit on the same ridge Carl Sandburg sat to pen some of his greatest works and explore the same beautiful mountainside Carl Sandburg would frequent with his family for picnics. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1100 has strong bipartisan support here in the House, and bicameral support from North Carolina's two Senators, who have introduced companion legislation. 
   Further, H.R. 1100 has the support of the administration, as well as the State of North Carolina and Henderson County, where the site is located. 
   All of that said, with such broad support, one might ask why are we here debating a rule for consideration of this legislation? The reason is that during a subcommittee and later full committee markup, it was discovered that there are a few Members of this body who object to the legislation in its current form. Those Members made several attempts to alter the existing legislation by amendment during the committee process. In addition, those same Members submitted amendments to the Rules Committee which we will consider later today, again seeking to alter this legislation. 
   While one might argue that our debate today is unnecessary, I contend it is yet another example of the majority's efforts to provide our colleagues with opportunities to offer their amendments, voice their views, and make their objections known here in the House Chamber. I look forward to a fruitful discussion of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond by saying that it's important to note on this bill that all this bill really does is to create an environment for people to donate the land or for funds to be donated to actually purchase the land, and we're not talking about a vast tract of land. We're talking about a very small amount of land, 115 acres, 22 acres of which have already been pledged, and basically are waiting for this legislation to be passed so that the conservatory could be created so that the acreage can be donated to it. 
   So I would say in response to my good friend and colleague from Washington that this is not any type of huge land grab. This is really just a very small amount of acreage that is being set up and being donated just to enhance the whole, again, experience of the Carl Sandburg site. 
   So I think it is a very good bill. It is a good rule, and I would urge all of my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I must say I'm a bit confused because the gentleman from Texas is opposing the rule, the rule which is allowing the amendment that he is speaking of. So the Rules Committee has put the amendment in, the Bishop amendment, that he's talking about. It will entitle a full and fair debate on it this afternoon, and we are giving the gentleman everything that he has asked for. And he stands up here and talks about some type of hypocrisy, and frankly, I just don't understand why he is mentioning that, why he is talking about that when, in fact, we are giving the rule that allows for debate on that particular amendment. 
   So we are, in fact, giving the gentleman exactly what he is asking for, and he is opposing the rule. So I guess I just don't understand what his point is, but I would say that we are supporting the rule that, in fact, does allow for full and fair debate on this particular amendment.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, my colleague from the Rules Committee talked about the fact that the American people would hear sob stories. Well, I don't know if I have a sob story to tell, but I certainly have a true story to tell about the people in my district and how they have been affected by trade. 
   I rise today in strong support of the rule and the Trade Globalization Assistance Act. Unfortunately, it seems some of my colleagues only want to focus on the long-term effects of trade and globalization and neglect the short-term consequences. 
   Trade clearly creates an ebb and flow of jobs coming and going, and we have been hearing that. The problem in my district is, while the jobs have been going, they have not been coming back. The high-tech, the high-quality, high-paying jobs have not come back to my district. We have only seen the grave loss of jobs. 
   Over the last 30 years, my upstate New York district has been devastated by job loss. The fact is that since 1974, employees of businesses in my district have applied for trade adjustment assistance 227 times. 
   This is a list of some of the companies that have applied. They're companies like Utica Cutlery, Chicago Pneumatic, Oneida Ltd., General Electric, IBM, Smith Corona, Burrows Packaging. These were keystone companies in upstate New York economy, and in most cases, these companies ended up closing their doors. 
   It's important to look at commercial air travel in our district and how that's been affected by the loss of business as a result of trade. In our district, the Syracuse Airport during the 1970s serviced about 1.6 million flights a year. The Oneida County Airport, 750,000 flights a year. Today the Syracuse Airport has 1.2 million flights, and the Oneida County Airport is closed. That's well over a million flights a year that used to fly out of central New York that no longer do. The reason? The loss of jobs, the loss of business, and the loss of people. 
   The drastic loss of business and slow recovery creates a dilemma that the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act seeks to address. Most notably, the legislation provides for creation of 24 manufacturing redevelopment zones to encourage the redevelopment of communities that have suffered substantial decline in their manufacturing base. 
   The legislation also doubles the amount of training funds from $200 million to $440 million, so that workers eligible for TAA training are no longer turned away because the program has been inadequately funded. 
   Madam Speaker, we have to be realistic about trade and we need to empower our workers with adequate training services. The Trade and Globalization Assistance Act is not a government handout. It's not wasteful Federal spending. It's a way to be helpful to Americans who now need our help. And after all, isn't that what government is all about, the ability to help people who need it when they need it? 
   This is a good act, this is a good rule, and it's a very good bill. It's a commonsense plan to address the short-term consequences and long-term effects of trade globalization.

   Mr. ARCURI. I'm sorry, 3.9 percent. The problem is that that 3.9 percent can go to the people who are unemployed and, frankly, do nothing whatsoever for them because they are out of work as a result of loss of jobs, the people in upstate New York, the people in Ohio, the people in the Northeast who have lost their jobs as a result of trade. You can talk about what the percentages are and how much the GDP grew, but the fact of the matter is they have lost their job and they are out of work. Today we are here to help those people that have lost their job by supporting this rule and by passing this bill because this will help them in the short term to make it until they find new employment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  
   Mr. Chairman, as a freshman, I find myself at somewhat of a disadvantage in terms of listening to people speak from both sides of the aisle talking about the history of this institution and the way that things have been done over the past several Congresses and over the past several years. And I find that to be somewhat of a disadvantage. 
   But I also find it to be somewhat of an advantage. And I find it to be an advantage in that you get an ability to look at things from a different perspective, from a new perspective, from a perspective not jaded by how things were done in the past, but looking at it on how things should be done. 
   And one of the things that I can't help but notice as a former district attorney, when I used to try cases and I would listen to opening statements, you can always get a sense of how good your own case was by listening to the opening statement of the other side. And when they talked about everything, when they talked about the facts, you knew they had a good case. But when they talked about everything but the facts, you knew they didn't have much of a case. 
   That's what we hear happening tonight. We're not hearing anything about this bill. We're not hearing discussion of the facts. We're hearing everything but what this bill is about. 
   Earlier this week we had, in Rules Committee, a very good debate on this bill. And one of the points that was brought up on this bill was an issue that I think was very important, and that was the requirement that this bill would have to require ICE to reach out to local institutions, whether it were State, local or Federal, where people were being held that could be deported, and that would be on a monthly basis, to make a determination whether or not those people should be deported. 
   And Ranking Member Rogers raised a very good issue during that debate, and he and I had some discussion on it. And he said, well, I believe that what we should be doing is spending more of our priority on the people who are not incarcerated, and I think this bill spends too much time worrying about the people who are incarcerated. My response to which was, as a former DA, the last thing we want to do is let somebody who is right under our nose get away from us. We need to stay focused on the people that are incarcerated. They are right there. They are under our nose, and we need to stay focused on it. 
   That's what this bill does. But the point, the real important point of that debate was, it was a substantive debate. It was a debate based on the issues. It was a debate based upon the content of the bill itself, not about everything else, not about what happened in the past, not about how things were done or what is going on. It was based upon the substance of the bill. And I think that's what this debate should be focused on. 
   I think it is a good bill. I think this debate is a good debate when it stays focused on the substance of the bill. And that's what I believe, as a former DA, this bill is a good bill because it deals with important issues that make our communities safer places.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, President Bush proposed that our Nation spend another $196 billion in Iraq next year. Today we will spend $330 million fighting the war in Iraq. Imagine that. Every day, $330 million in taxpayer dollars is going to Iraq. 
   Just imagine for one moment what we could do here in the United States with that money instead. We could hire an additional 1,700 Border Patrol agents to work our borders for an entire year. We could provide health care to 50,000 more veterans so they receive the essential health care treatment that they need. We could enroll 46,000 more children in Head Start for 1 year, so they can receive early childhood education. If we took 1 day of funding from the Iraq war, we could help nearly 800,000 families keep their heat on this winter through the LIHEAP program. We could provide 270,000 more children health care coverage through the CHIP program. 
   Mr. Speaker, while President Bush has no problem sending billions of dollars to Iraq, he is neglecting essential needs here in America. The Democratic majority in this Congress refuses to follow that lead.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 976 provides for further consideration of H.R. 5349, which extends the Protect America Act of 2007 for 21 days under a closed rule.     
   The rule provides 1 hour of debate, with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank my colleague from Washington for his insightful history on the FISA bill. I would submit that I agree with him that the FISA bill is necessary for the security of America. No one questions that. No one on our side of the aisle questions that. The question that we do have is does the Senate bill actually take away some of the liberty that is so necessary to the American people. 
   All we are asking for is an extension of 21 days. When you think about it in the grand scheme of things, 21 days to make a determination whether or not this bill continues to give the American people the liberty that they have had for over 200 years, that is not a lot to ask for. I would much rather have 21 days, keep the bill in effect but extend it for 21 days, knowing full well that the end product is something that not only ensures our security but guarantees our liberty. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's passion on this issue. Certainly it is the type of issue that elicits real passion from people. But I think we as a body need to be sure that the steps that we take are deliberative and thoughtful. Certainly reacting to an issue such as this in a passionate way may deprive us of taking the necessary steps that we need to ensure that the liberty of our citizens is kept intact. 
   Again, I would just point out that this bill is asking for an additional 21 days within which Congress can continue to review the documents that we have asked for that we have only recently received to make a determination, again, a deliberative determination based upon facts and reasons and not on passion. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, my colleague seems to be asking us to rely upon assurances given to us by this administration, this same administration that has told us about weapons of mass destruction, the same administration that told us that Iran was building a nuclear bomb. And then she asks why we are skeptical about taking the word of the administration. 
   As my colleague knows, the House passed the RESTORE Act last November. It was not until last night that the Senate passed a bill reauthorizing and reforming the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill is significantly different than the one we passed in November. 
   As is the case when the House and the Senate have differing bills, it is appropriate for the two to meet and reconcile their differences. That is exactly what we intend to do in a bipartisan and bicameral way. 
   However, as my colleagues also know, the President's preferred surveillance law is set to expire on Saturday. The underlying bill will extend that law for 3 weeks and give the House and Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees time to work toward a conference agreement. Additionally, it will also give our Members, Republican and Democrat, time to review reams of highly classified materials which were only provided to us by the White House in recent days, despite requests dating back all the way to May, 8 months ago. These materials are absolutely critical as the House considers the request which has been made by the White House to grant what amounts to a blanket transactional immunity to telecommunications companies who participated in the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance plan without any explanation of what that immunity is for. While the President has been quick to call on Congress to act, it is he who has continued to ignore countless congressional requests for information about the actions of his administration. 
   As a former State attorney, I know firsthand that not even a first-year prosecutor would even entertain the idea of granting immunity without knowing what that immunity is for and who that immunity is being granted to. 
   From his seat, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee noted last night in Rules that he cannot recall a time in his 45 years in the House when an administration has asked Congress to provide immunity to anyone or anything without telling us why. The House is not opposed to granting such immunity, but if we are going to act, then we need to know why. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are on the verge of passing long-term FISA reform, but it will take time because there are very real differences between the positions of the majority Members of this body and the Senate and the White House. Those who come to the floor today to delay this extension and engage in a manufactured obstructionism, which has become so symbolic of the congressional Republicans, are doing a great disservice to this Nation.     
   We will overcome this obstructionism, and we will use the next 3 weeks to reconcile our differences and come to the American people with a bill that protects our homeland without sacrificing our civil liberties. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague, you know, obviously raises a good point. As a former FBI agent, he was very concerned, he is very concerned, and he continues to be very concerned with doing the right thing, getting the people who are breaking the laws, hurting our children and who are putting our citizens in jeopardy. But no one in this Chamber has the market cornered on that. That is something that I think universally throughout this Chamber there is a strong desire to fulfill. That is why we are here. We are here to protect and defend our citizens and to protect and defend our Constitution, and that is all we are asking for today: 21 days to ensure that we are able to look over the recommendations, to look over the material that has recently been forwarded to us by this administration to ensure that we are not only protecting and securing this country, but rather that we are also doing it in a way that protects our liberty.

   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my friend and colleague from New York for his statements. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that the speakers on the other side continue to try to couch this argument in a way and frame it in such a way that makes it appear that people on our side, the Democrats, don't care about the security of this country in the way that they do. And it's obvious that nothing could be further from the truth. 
   Simply by extending the FISA bill for 21 days to ensure that we have all the information that is out there and all the information that is available and that we have an opportunity to go through it in a thoughtful way doesn't mean that we have less concern for security but, rather, an equal amount of concern for security and also for the liberty of the American people.

   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my colleague from Washington for his comments. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we have learned anything since the terrorist attacks of September 11, it is that the balance between security and civil liberties is not only difficult, it's absolutely critical. Providing this 3-week extension will do nothing to block or hinder the efforts of our intelligence community. Quite the contrary, it enhances their ability to do their jobs effectively and ensures the integrity of their efforts because it gives us time to get these reforms right. 
   I want to remind my colleagues that voting to defeat the previous question is a vote to deny the administration the ability to utilize its existing authority under law to assess threats, gather intelligence and protect the freedom and security of every American. 
   Twenty-one days isn't a long time. And based on the sensitivity and public interest in this issue, we owe that to the American people and the framers of the Constitution to strike a fair balance that allows us to protect the civil liberties of Americans and to provide the administration the tools and resources to protect our Nation from another terrorist attack. Twenty-one days is a fair request. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, the economic stimulus package that President Bush will sign into law today is a bipartisan victory for the American people. This broad-based stimulus package will provide tax relief of up to $600 per individual and $1,200 per married couple, plus an additional $300 per child. Recovery rebate checks could be sent out to 130 million Americans as early as May. 
   The stimulus package includes unprecedented tax relief for working families. The measure provides $32 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in the recovery package. This is a critically important provision in the stimulus package because economists say that the tax rebates that include low- and moderate-income families are 24 percent more effective as stimulus than rebates that leave these families out. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is our hope that this stimulus package will help jump-start our economy so more Americans can live the American Dream.

   Mr. ARCURI. I do appreciate the passion of the gentleman from Oregon. 
   This is an important issue. It's so important that when this bill came to the floor back in June when Congressman DeFazio offered it, I supported it. I guess it's about priorities, Madam Speaker. And the priorities are what do you do to pay for it. 
   Now, first off, this bill is about energy, it's about tax extenders. 
   First off, the proposal, the amendment that the gentleman is talking about, is not germane to this bill, first and foremost. 
   Secondarily, there is no pay-for-it in it. 
   Now 2, 3 months ago when there was a pay-for in it, we couldn't get it passed because not enough people on the other side of the aisle would support it. And the fact of the matter is,  you know, we did pay for it with royalty payments from oil companies. 
   And for me it's very easy. Let's look at what our priority is. Let's see: the priorities of large oil companies or the priorities of rural school districts.

   It's pretty easy for me when you look at oil companies and you look at school districts, that's a no-brainer. Yet people on that side of the aisle voted against it because it had a pay-for in it. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, I just think, one, this is not germane; two, it's not paid for. Clearly I will support it with the pay-for that was in it last month, but I think clearly without any question it's unfair for the gentleman to characterize it the way he has.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, I have no doubt that the gentleman is very concerned with the real people on the ground. There's absolutely no doubt. It is the gravest concern to all of us. 
   The fact of the matter is, when you weigh the needs of the individuals against the needs of oil companies, how can you call that a bunch of baloney? If the royalties, the taxes that we're placing on oil companies are going to be there to help people in rural schools, that's nothing? That's not baloney. That's the real thing. That's what we're doing to help children, and yet they forget about that. 
   Yet he doesn't even mention it. He talks as if that doesn't exist, that it's just a bunch of baloney. It's not baloney. It's the real thing. That's what we came to Congress to do. And yet they want us to put the needs of oil companies ahead of the needs of individuals. It's just not the right thing to do. 
   This bill's not about that. This bill is about renewable tax credits so that we can become energy independent, so that we could stop being reliant on the big oil companies and on foreign oil so that we can develop renewable energy. That's what this bill is about. That's what this rule is about.

   Mr. ARCURI. Well, if what the gentleman says is true--and I have no reason to doubt that--that means that he voted against it despite the fact it would have helped all the other rural school districts in the country because it didn't do anything for his State. 
   And I certainly can sympathize with the fact that he would be upset that it didn't do anything for his State, but the bill would have done a great deal for the rural school districts throughout the rest of the country at the expense of large oil companies. 
   So again from my way of thinking, when you weigh the overall good of rural school districts versus oil companies, the rural school districts win every time.

   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my friend from Texas for his comments. 
   You know, I used to be an attorney. And when I used to practice, I tried a lot of cases. And when we would start our cases and we would make our opening arguments and we would proceed through the closing arguments, I always knew how good the case was on the part of the other side, especially during openings, because when the other side talked about the facts in the case, you knew they had a very good case. But when they talked about everything else except the facts, you knew they didn't have a very good case. Such is what we are seeing here tonight. They're talking about everything but what this rule is about. This rule is about creating a rule so that we can have tax extenders, so that we can promote alternative energy in this country, something that everyone says  that we need to do, and we are doing it in a responsible way with a pay-for. 
   Now, it's great they talk about things that they would like to do, other proposals, other amendments, but no one says where the pay-for is going to come from. So where is that pay-for going to come from? Are we going to just borrow and spend our way to it? I mean, we're borrowing $700 billion now, what's a little bit more? We had a pay-for in it when the bill was offered 2 weeks ago, yet it wasn't voted for. But what are they talking about? Everything but what we're here for today. 
   Now they want to bring up oil again, as if the Democrats don't care about oil prices, as if the Democrats hadn't just passed a bill that did a number of things to bring energy prices down in the short term, in the middle term, in the long term; but that's not enough. They don't want to talk about what we're here for today because then the American people might look at it and say the Democrats have the right idea; they want to create tax incentives so we can have real alternative energy in this country and not be dependent on foreign oil, not be dependent on our big oil companies. 
   No, Madam Speaker, we do not have anything against the big oil companies, we just think our priorities should be here on this particular bill with a pay-for and with creating tax incentives so that we can produce renewable, green-collar jobs right here in this country, jobs that cannot be outsourced or shipped overseas. That's what this rule is about. 
   Supporting this rule and the tax relief legislation we will consider is simply common sense. We can provide tax relief and incentives for middle class families, spur innovation, create tens of thousands of new jobs, reduce our dependence on oil from hostile nations, and reduce greenhouse gases at the same time. And we can do it all in a fiscally responsible manner, pay for it today, not spread it out on our children and grandchildren. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous question and the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1333, which recognizes this September 2008 as Tay-Sachs Disease Awareness Month. I am proud to cosponsor this resolution, and I commend my friend from Ohio, Senator Brown, for spearheading a companion resolution in the Senate. 
   Tay-Sachs Disease is a progressive neurological disorder for which there is no treatment or cure. The most common form of it affects infants who appear healthy at birth and seem to develop normally at first; but at around 6 months, symptoms of the disease begin to appear. The baby gradually begins to regress, losing the ability to crawl, turn over, sit or reach out. Eventually, as paralysis sets in, the child becomes blind, deaf and unable to swallow. Tragically, few infants born with Tay-Sachs live past the age of 5. 
   This terrible disease appears most often in families with no prior history because the Tay-Sachs gene can be carried through many generations without being expressed. However, when two carriers of the gene become parents, there is a 1-in-4 chance that any child they have may be born with the disease. 
   While about 1.2 million Americans are carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene, certain populations are at much higher risk. About 1 in 30 American Jews, 1 in 50 Irish Americans is a carrier. French Canadians, Louisiana Cajuns, Pennsylvania Dutch are high risk populations, but all populations are at risk. 
   It's easy to reduce this terrible disease like Tay-Sachs to statistics, but there are real human stories behind these statistics that must not be overlooked. My wife's son, Joey Deon, was born a happy, healthy and all around pleasant baby. There was no warning he would be afflicted by this terrible disease. But at the age of 1 he began to show symptoms. His mother, like many other parents of children with Tay-Sachs, was forced to watch a once active, healthy baby slowly lose his bodily functions.     
   God came to claim his angel in his sleep one day before his 5th birthday. Thankfully, he did not suffer as many with this disease do suffer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. He did not suffer, but very often children afflicted with this disease suffer badly before death. 
   Madam Speaker, a simple blood test can identify carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene before they have children. But very few people, including those in high-risk populations, are aware of its  availability. This critical test can identify carrier couples before a tragedy occurs. Raising awareness of this terrible disease is important, but it is critical that we also put the words into actions. 
   Millions of Americans who suffer from rare diseases like Tay-Sachs and more common diseases like cancer stand to benefit from an expanded Federal commitment to stem cell research. We must also continue to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health. Federal support for cutting-edge biomedical research will make treatments and cures for diseases like Tay-Sachs a reality. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1333 and Tay-Sachs Awareness Month.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1490 waives a requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII requiring a two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee. The resolution applies to any rule reported on any legislative day through September 27, 2008, providing for consideration or disposition of a measure to  provide incentives for energy production and conservation, to extend certain expiring provisions, to provide individual income tax relief, and for other purposes. 
   I rise today in support of this rule because American families and small businesses need tax relief now more than ever. This rule will allow us to bring legislation to the House floor later today that will not only strengthen our economy by directing tax relief to middle class families and creating jobs at small businesses, but also will help to bring this country into a new alternative energy future that will help to create green collar jobs right here in America, jobs that cannot be outsourced to foreign countries or overseas. 
   Since being elected to Congress, I have voted, along with this body, to cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses on at least 14 separate occasions. In doing so, this Congress has upheld its pledge to the American people, and I have kept the promise I made to my constituents to provide much-needed tax relief and incentives for economic growth. 
   I know that there are many families and businesses in my district that are struggling in the current economic crisis. With talk of a $700 billion plan to bail out Wall Street, we cannot, in good conscience, fail to take action to help so many families facing the ever-escalating costs of gasoline and home heating fuel into this winter. 
   This legislation we will consider provides tax relief and incentives to those who need them most at a fraction of the cost of bailing out the financial industry. 
   This Congress has shown a strong commitment to the pay-as-you-go rule that we adopted last January. I applaud my Blue Dog Coalition colleagues for their outspoken leadership on the PAYGO consideration and the PAYGO issue. When I explain to folks back home what PAYGO is, I ask them a question: You have to balance your books each month, don't you? The individuals say, of course. They, of course, understand what it means to balance their books. They would not think of spending more than they earn. Businesses would not think of spending more than they earn. You have to ensure that you have enough income coming in to cover your expenses, and, of course, they respond with a nod of the head. They understand it. They get it. And then I say: Shouldn't the Federal Government operate in the same way when it involves spending your tax dollars? 
   The legislation this rule will allow us to consider today will extend a number of critical tax relief measures targeted at middle class families and small businesses to improve the quality of life and strengthen our economy. Supporting this rule and the tax legislation we will consider later today is simple common sense. 
   We can provide tax relief and incentives to middle class families, spur innovation, create tens of thousands of new green collar jobs, reduce our dependence on oil from hostile nations and reduce greenhouse gases--and we can do it all in a fiscally responsible manner. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my friend from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, when you listen to the people on the other side of the aisle, you would think that everything that's happened is the fault of the Democratic Party. 
   They have had the White House for 8 years. We see oil prices as high as they have ever been. Two oilmen in the White House, yet we still see that. We see the economy as bad as the economy has ever been. We're talking about bailing out Wall Street with $700 billion that we're borrowing. 
   This rule today for this bill is about tax extenders, and that is extenders that would create incentives for alternative energy to help us wean ourselves off of our addiction to foreign oil. And we're doing it in a prudent way, in a way that doesn't borrow and spend, doesn't dump this on the backs of our children and grandchildren, but rather as a paid-for. 
   The bill that my colleague from Washington spoke about, it's a very good bill, but it hasn't been paid for. These tax extenders today that we're talking about have been paid for. They are extenders that are prudent and responsible. 
   Supporting this rule and the tax relief legislation we consider later today is simply common sense. We can provide tax relief and incentives to middle class families, we can spur innovation, create tens of thousands of new jobs, reduce our dependence on oil from hostile nations, and reduce greenhouse gasses. And we can do all of it in a fiscally responsible way. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1501 provides for consideration of H.R. 7060, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule because American families and small businesses need tax relief now more than ever. This rule will allow us to bring legislation to the House floor later today that will not only strengthen our economy by directing tax relief to middle class families and creating jobs at small businesses, but also help to bring the country into a new future of alternative energy not dependent on foreign energy and foreign fuel. 
   Since being elected to Congress, I have voted along with this body to cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses on at least 14 occasions. In doing so, this Congress has upheld its pledge to the American people. And I have kept my promise I made to my constituents to provide much-needed tax relief and incentive for economic growth. 
   I know that there are many families and businesses in my district that are struggling in the current economic crisis. With talk of a $700 billion plan to bail out Wall Street, we cannot, in good conscience, fail to take action to help so many families facing the ever-escalating costs of gasoline and home heating oil into this winter. This legislation we will consider provides tax relief and incentives to those who need them most at a fraction of the cost for bailing out the financial industry. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Congress has shown a strong commitment to the pay-as-you-go rule adopted last January. I applaud my Blue Dog Coalition colleagues for their outspoken leadership on PAYGO. When I explain to folks back home what PAYGO is, they always ask the same question. I ask, you have to balance the books each month, right? Why shouldn't the government do the same? And they all get it. My constituents get it. And the American people get it. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, there are still some Members of Congress who are steadfastly against the idea of being fiscally responsible in balancing the Federal books in the same way our constituents balance their checkbooks. But it appears that even our colleagues in the Senate are beginning to come around. The legislation we will consider later today is proof that you can provide tax relief in a fiscally responsible way. 
   The legislation this rule provides for consideration of will extend a number of critical tax relief measures targeted at middle class families and small businesses to improve the quality of life and strengthen our economy. During these tight economic times, it is also absolutely critical that we pass legislation to invest in jobs for today and long-term development for tomorrow, including jobs in the alternative energy sector like wind and biomass that will reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and bring the price of gasoline and heating oil to levels that families and businesses can afford. 
   I am a realist. I understand that we can't bring back the millions of manufacturing jobs, including thousands in my own congressional district, which have been moved overseas. However, we can look to the future, a future of our Nation's economy that is green, and re-create jobs that we once lost. It is absolutely essential that we leverage every possible option, whether it is through tax credits, investment through research and development, or education to advance alternative and renewable energy development. 
   Mr. Speaker, tax credits for alternative energy production have the power to truly jump-start our economy and create good-paying, highly skilled jobs that cannot be outsourced overseas, the type of jump-start, Mr. Speaker, which is already happening in my upstate New York district with the creation of new green collar jobs. In the last 2 years, I have spoken numerous times throughout the debate over extending these renewable energy tax credits about the new businesses in my district that are utilizing the national investment in alternative energy to create good-paying jobs in upstate New York. Those businesses are to be commended. That is why I'm proud to support the approximately $15 billion in long-term, clean renewable energy tax incentives and investments included in this legislation which we will vote for later today.     
   I hope that by doing so, it will encourage other companies to follow suit, both in my region and across the Nation. 
   The underlying legislation extends and modifies critical tax credits for production of electricity from renewable sources, ranging from wind, solar and geothermal energy to closed loop and open loop biomass. Specifically, the legislation includes extension of clean, renewable energy bonds, efficient commercial building tax incentives, investment tax credits for solar and fuel cell systems, tax credits for energy efficiency upgrades to existing homes, tax credits for production of efficient home appliances, and tax incentives for consumer purchase of energy efficient products. 
   Most of these incentives either expired at the end of the last year or are set to expire at the end of this year. It is vitally important to sustaining the development of clean energy technology industries, which will lead to the creation of new jobs, that these tax credit incentives are extended. 
   The legislation also includes an extension of the Research and Development Tax Credit that allows companies to claim credit for a portion of their R&D expenditures. Extending the R&D credit is vital to ensuring that America remains on the cutting edge of innovation that keeps our domestic companies competitive. This credit is of particular interest in the area of New York that I represent, because its extension will further the expansion of microchip fabrication and nanotechnology industries which are beginning to blossom in upstate New York. 
   American companies rely on this credit and upon its continuing to adequately plan for their long-term research projects. I support this 2-year retroactive extension to provide that continuing extension, and I will continue to work for a much-needed permanent extension that would eliminate concerns over expirations or lapses. 
   The legislation also extends and expands and creates important tax credits for individuals. 
   Supporting this rule and the tax relief legislation we will consider later today is simply common sense. We can provide tax relief and incentives to the middle class, spur innovation, create tens of thousands of new jobs, reduce our dependence on oil from hostile nations and reduce greenhouse gas. We can do all of this in a fiscally responsible manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this rule and the underlying legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, this week the Democratic Congress makes college more affordable for American students and families by sending the College Cost Reduction and Access Act to the President. After initially threatening a veto, President Bush now says he will sign the bill into law. That's good news for millions of students and their families who are trying to figure out how they're going to afford a college education. 
   Under President Bush, college tuition has increased 40 percent over inflation, putting college out of reach for many. While college costs have increased over the last 7 years, Pell Grants and other Federal aid have remained flat, which has created an imbalance in the grant-to-loan ratio that students face. For some who are fortunate enough to attend college, they are leaving with more than $20,000 in loan debt. 
   Our legislation begins to remedy that imbalance by providing the largest investment in college funding since passage of the GI Bill in 1944. Under our legislation, we increase Pell Grant scholarships by more than $1,000, and we cut student interest rates in half. 
   Mr. Speaker, Democrats promise to make college more affordable this week, and we are living up to that promise.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I rise to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman. 
   My intention today is to raise awareness of the Members of the House of Representatives surrounding the issue of administrative budget of the Social Security Administration and the impact it has on real people across America. Because previous Congresses have failed to meet the basic funding requirements of the Social Security Administration, the agency is in the process of closing field offices to try to rein in costs. One of those field offices is in my district, the 24th Congressional District of New York in the city of Auburn. Auburn serves as a population base for rural Cayuga County; and of the approximately 81,000 residents in that county, nearly 20,000, or 25 percent, are on Social Security, that is, they receive benefits. 
   Closing the field office in Auburn, New York, means that those 20,000 beneficiaries, most of whom are elderly, will need to drive to the next nearest offices in Syracuse or Geneva, New York. Public transportation in this area is inadequate, and this potential closing will mean that many residents will simply not have access to a Social Security Administration office for face-to-face interviews. Staff of the Social Security Administration has explained that the services can be provided by phone or through the Social Security Administration online system, but for these financially vulnerable beneficiaries, these were not real options. 
   I don't believe that the Social Security Administration should close or consolidate field offices until the agency reports back to Congress regarding the number of recipients who would be negatively impacted and allow the Congress to thoroughly review the economic analysis of potential field office realignment, consolidation, or closing proposals.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5975, to rename the post office in Waterville, New York in memory of Corporal John P. Sigsbee. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with both incredible pride and sadness that I address the House today to speak on this bill that pays tribute to the life and sacrifice of one of this Nation's fallen soldiers, U.S. Army Corporal John Sigsbee. 
   On January 16, 2008, Corporal Sigsbee of Waterville, New York was killed in action 50 miles north of Baghdad during his second tour of duty in Iraq.     
   The family he left behind while in the line of duty will soon receive his second Military Purple Heart on his behalf. Corporal Sigsbee was only 21 years old when his life was taken in service of our country. 
   John Sigsbee graduated from Waterville Central School in 2004 and attended Mohawk Valley Community College. Upon completing his first year of college, John decided to join the U.S. Army to further finance his higher education and became wounded one month to the day during his first tour of duty in Iraq. 
   John was sent home to recover at the Brooke Army Medical Center, where he was visited by Army personnel who awarded him for his bravery. These officers told John that he needed time to heal properly from the burns he suffered when his tank drove over two IEDs, and that he needed time to consider his decision to return to service. However, John replied, with his mother at his side, ``Give me one year and I'll be back.'' John did just that, and it was then that his mother started to know what ``sacrifice'' truly means. 
   John went back and gave all that he had to give. In his mind, there was no question that his place was back with his fellow troops in Iraq to fulfill his responsibilities as a young American soldier. 
   Corporal Sigsbee valiantly served as a member of the 32nd Cavalry Unit in the 101st Airborne Division, a dedicated young man who every day honored his responsibility to his country and his mission. Corporal Sigsbee's purpose and sacrifices will be remembered by the entire village of Waterville, county of Oneida and now, with passage of this bill, by the whole Nation. 
   During calling hours and funeral arrangements for Corporal Sigsbee, his family and loved ones received an outpouring of gratitude and support by the village of Waterville. Over 2,000 citizens attended calling hours to pay their respects for this young American, and 300 members from local veterans' organizations came to the local high school as a show of strength and unity for their fellow soldier. Additionally, a 50-car procession escorted his body from the Griffiss Airfield to Saratoga National Cemetery where he was laid to rest. 
   On that day, January 25, 2008, Corporal Sigsbee received a true hero's welcome from not only his family and friends, but from people who did not know him yet wanted to give their thanks, thanks to a man who paid the ultimate price for their safety and their freedom. The renaming of this post office may be considered by some as a simple act by Congress. But it will forever symbolize to the village of Waterville and the citizens of Oneida County, and to future generations, the deep appreciation that this legislative body has for this man's life and contributions, and for the actions of each and every member of our Armed Services. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to support this legislation renaming the Waterville, New York, Post Office after and in honor of Corporal  John P. Sigsbee and to forever honor the life of this soldier, son, brother and American hero.

We also increase funding for efficient and renewable energy programs so we can create the green collar jobs of the future. Our budget also invests $7.1 billion more than the President for essential education and job training programs that are so important at a time when Americans are losing their jobs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman from Vermont, my friend from the Rules Committee, for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule and the underlying legislation for the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act. 
   I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member for reporting out the bill. It does not pay lip service, but makes critical investments in our Nation's transportation and infrastructure at the levels guaranteed under SAFETEA-LU. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill rejects the administration's proposed funding cuts to the FAA Airport Improvement Program, highway programs, and Critical Housing in Community Development programs. The bill provides $140 million more than current funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, and $850 million more than the President's  request for the FAA Airport Improvement Program, which provides grant and aid for airport planning, construction, and development. 
   Recipients of the AIP funds, such as Griffis Park Airfield in my Upstate New York district, have benefited greatly from the program. Over the last few years, AIP funds have helped Griffis continue to fully develop as a regional aviation facility, become the new home to Oneida County Airport, and create long-term regional economic growth for a region often strained to attract new investment.     
   The bill also maintains our commitment to keeping our airways safe by providing $7 billion, 219 million more than the current funding, to hire more than 1,400 new air traffic controllers to replenish the workforce as the rate of retiring air traffic controllers continue to grow. 
   This bill also provides $20 million more than the President's request to hire and train more safety inspectors and other aviation safety activities. 
   The bill boosts funding for the Federal Transit Administration by providing $288 million more than the President's request for mass transit programs. Local transit authorities such as Central New York Regional Transit Authority and CENTRO in my district will now be able to expand their hybrid bus fleet and continue to provide low-cost, convenient, clean, energy-efficient transportation services to commuters in both upstate and New York City. 
   The President's budget request seeks to eliminate funding for the Hope VI program, but I am so pleased that this legislation will maintain our commitment to providing affordable housing for the many disadvantaged individuals across the country, individuals that still struggle daily to meet their families' needs, even while working full-time jobs. 
   H.R. 3074 restores funding for the Community Development Block Grant Program, which this administration has cut since 2001 by nearly 35 percent. This bill provides $1.1 billion more than the President's request for CDBG grants, which allows local governments in cities such Utica, Rome and Auburn, New York, to provide critical services to revitalize neighborhoods, promote economic development and improve quality of life for those starved of financial resources.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with tremendous pride that I rise today to deliver my first formal remarks on the floor of this fine institution on such an important issue. That, of course, is providing a fair and decent wage to our Nation's most economically disadvantaged. 
   Nine years is far too long for anyone to wait for a wage increase, especially a single mother who works 40 hours a week but still has to face the decision of whether to buy food or medicine for her children. I find it unconscionable that, in a country as rich as ours, anyone working full time should have to make such a decision. 
   Opponents argue that raising the minimum wage will only stifle economic growth and force employers to lay off workers. I couldn't disagree  more. For starters, the logic just doesn't add up. Take, for instance, a small family-owned mom and pop grocery store in Upstate New York, which I represent. Some argue that the owners of that store would have to hang up a going out of business sign on their window because of the costs associated with the wage increase. But that thinking only looks at half the issue. The additional business that they will get as a result of the more disposable income that people have to spend in their store would clearly make up for it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be part of a Congress that will not maintain the status quo, and I urge my colleagues to support this long-overdue wage increase, not because it is the easy thing to do but because it is the right thing to do.

   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of legislation that is very important to the many colleges and institutions in my district in upstate New York. 
   The legislation before us is a promise made to the American people, a promise to make college more affordable to the Nation's future leaders and to the people that need it most, the middle-class families. We are doing that by cutting student loans in half over the next 5 years. 
   It is no secret that rising tuition fees are making it more difficult for students to attend college. In response, we are taking action today to alleviate the heavy financial burden many students face after graduation when the loan collector comes knocking on their door. Through this legislation, we are providing relief where it is needed most, while at the same time creating incentives to attend college for those who otherwise might not, and we are doing it in a fiscally responsible way by meeting the pay-as-you-go requirements. 
   Madam Speaker, the message from America is clear. The time to act is now. I urge my colleagues to support this measure and provide needed financial relief to the hardworking, middle-class families and students who need it most.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my friend and colleague from California for yielding time to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support today of this rule, the fiscal year 2009 Defense Authorization Act, which this year is appropriately named after the distinguished Republican ranking member, Mr. Hunter. 
   I commend Chairman Skelton and the entire House Armed Services Committee for their ability to work in a strong bipartisan fashion to produce a defense authorization bill that will enhance our Nation's security by providing our troops with superior equipment, and improve the quality of life for our servicemembers and their families by providing a 3.9 percent pay raise for all servicemembers, and require the administration to provide the American people with more transparency and accountability regarding the funding of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   When it comes down to it, maintaining a strong national defense and providing for our troops should never be a partisan issue. We can disagree regarding specific provisions and proposals on occasion, but the fact remains that the American people want bipartisan solutions from Republicans and Democrats. That moves our Nation forward, and that is exactly what this rule and the underlying defense authorization will do. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to urge my colleagues to resist the temptation to point fingers and be partisan on this issue with the farm bill. We need to work in a bipartisan way, because this is what is important to America's farmers, and very, very important to America. By passing this rule and the defense authorization bill today, we can prove to the American people that bipartisanship still exists inside the walls of Congress.

   Mr. ARCURI. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Additionally, I would like to point out that whenever anybody makes factually incorrect statements on the floor, I am going to yield to my colleagues to make sure that the record is made clear, and that is why I yielded to Mr. Edwards on that point. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill, the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill, like very few other things that we as a body deal with, deals and helps and touches many, many millions of Americans, whether it is CDBG money that goes to help the elderly make a senior center more accessible, or whether it is fixing our roads that thousands of commuters travel on every day, it is a bill that is critically important. All we have heard from the other side of the aisle are procedural reasons why we shouldn't go forward. That is what the American people are tired of. They are tired of the process, the procedure. They want action. They want things accomplished. 
   During the break, I had an opportunity to talk to my friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Representative Kagen, and he made a good point. He said, you know, while we spend billions of dollars in Iraq, and no one talks about it, we hear all kinds of complaints when we try to spend millions of dollars domestically on programs that help Americans, needy Americans, people that need it most. 
   Mr. Speaker, that's why we need to pass this rule. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 817 provides for consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3074, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. 
   I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member for bringing a conference report to the floor that makes critical investment in our Nation's transportation infrastructure at levels guaranteed in SAFETEA-LU. 
   The conference report also rejects the administration's proposed funding cuts to the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program, highway programs, and critical housing and community development programs. 
   The conference report provides $151 million more than current funding for the FAA, $765 million more than the President's request for FAA Airport Improvement Program, which provides grants for airport planning, construction and development. 
   Recipients of AIP funds such as Griffiss Park Airfield in my upstate New York district have benefited greatly from this program. Over the last few years, AIP funds have helped Griffiss continue to fully develop as a regional aviation facility, become the new home for the Oneida County Airport, create long-term regional economic growth for a region seeking to attract new investment. 
   The conference report also maintains our commitment to keeping our airways safe by providing $7 billion for air traffic organization, including $16 million to hire more than 1,400 new air traffic controllers to replenish the work force as the rate of retiring air traffic controllers continues to grow, and provides critical funding to hire and train more safety inspectors and for other aviation safety activities. 
   Mr. Speaker, this conference report provides $3.5 billion more than current  levels for the Transportation Department. These additional funds will provide for much needed investments in our Nation's highways, road construction and repair, and transportation safety. 
   This conference report boosts funding for the Federal Transit Administration by providing $227 million more than the President's request for mass transit programs. Local transit authorities, such as the Central New York Regional Transit Authority and Centro in my district, will now be able to expand their hybrid bus fleet and continue to provide low-cost, convenient, clean and energy-efficient transportation services to commuters in both upstate New York and in New York City. 
   This conference report also increases funding for the Housing and Urban Development Department by $3.1 billion above the President's request. 
   The President's budget request sought to eliminate funding for the HOPE VI program, but I am so pleased that this legislation will maintain our commitment to providing affordable housing for the many disadvantaged individuals across our country, individuals that still struggle daily to meet their family's needs, even while working full-time jobs. 
   In 2003, the City of Utica, New York was the recipient of an $11.5 million HOPE VI grant for revitalization of a local residential community. This grant has allowed for significant improvements in safety and greater access to service and facilities for its residents. It would be a shame if similar communities around the country were unable to reap the benefits of the HOPE VI program. 
   The conference report restores funding for the Community Development Block Grant program, which this administration has cut since 2001 by nearly 35 percent. This conference report provides $922 million more than the President's request for CDBG grants, which allow local governments in cities such as Utica, Rome and Auburn, New York to provide critical service to revitalize neighborhoods, promote economic development and improve quality of life for those starved of financial resources. 
   Localities across my upstate New York district rely on CDBG funds to support vital redevelopment efforts that improve housing, assist local businesses, and offer services that promote safety and reduce crime. CDBG funds have been used by the City of Utica to prepare sites like those in the Corn Hill area for new housing construction by demolishing existing structures, replacing antiquated sewer lines, planting trees, constructing new sidewalks and curbs and paving streets, improving the quality of life for all the citizens of that city. 
   CDBG funds have been used in the City of Auburn to provide small business assistance loans to help new businesses make it through their first critical year of start-up, retain their employees, and grow their business. CDBG funds are also used by Auburn to support after-school programs, child care subsidies, and even counseling for children in crisis. 
   In the City of Rome, these funds are also used to assist new small businesses and also to assist low- to moderate-income persons make needed health and safety improvements to their homes, such as helping seniors with the installation of ramps and railings that allow them to remain living in their homes, and helping people deal with emergencies like failure and roof collapse. These are important parts of this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to point out to my friend and colleague from Arizona that this point of order is about whether or not to consider this rule, and ultimately to consider a measure that invests in our Nation's vital transportation infrastructure and housing program at a time when we desperately need it so much in this country. In fact, I would say it is simply an effort to try to kill this conference report, and on a faulty premise at that. 
   Every single earmark in this conference report has been properly disclosed in conformance with the House rules. The blanket waiver against consideration of the conference report did not include a waiver of either clause 9 or rule XXI of House Resolution 491. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, we must consider this conference report which provides funding for our Nation's priorities. For example, Community Development Block Grants to provide communities with funds to assist low and moderate-income persons; housing for the elderly, disabled, and homeless veterans; foreclosure mitigation and reconstruction of the Minnesota bridge and the repair of aging bridges throughout our Nation that is desperately needed. 
   Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that the new House Democratic majority has implemented the most honest and open earmark rule in the history of the United States House of Representatives. But don't take my word for it. A few weeks ago, Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Commonsense, was quoted in CQ Weekly as saying, ``The House has given us more information than we have ever had before on earmarks, and they deserve credit for that.'' 
   I am troubled with the analogy given by my colleague from California comparing it to a drinking problem. I would say the comparison, considering the way the Republicans abused the process, would be to a person who started a fire, then called the fire department, and when the fire department came and put out the fire, they then turned around and criticized the fire department for the way that the fire was put out. 
   That is the situation that they have. They abused the earmarks when they were in control of the House, and now they are critical of our majority when we attempt to fix it. It is important to remember which side actually abused the earmark process and who actually stepped up to the plate to reform the system and provide transparency.  
   We didn't wait until 2 months before the election. We responded to the people's call for more openness on the first day of Congress. It seems quite clear to me that the minority is more concerned with obstructionism, while we are focused on actually meeting the needs of our constituents and the people in this country. 
   This question of consideration is the result of an unwarranted point of order against our rule. A ``no'' vote will prevent consideration of a critical package that has strong House and Senate bipartisan support. 
   So despite whatever roadblock the other side tries to use to block this bill, we will stand up for housing and we will stand up for the critical infrastructure upon which our economy depends. We must consider this rule and we must pass this conference report today. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to consider this rule. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, as Congress and the Bush administration continue to discuss a proposal to help turn Wall Street around, it is important that the administration know that this Congress is not going to just hand over $700 billion without any accountability or oversight. 
   The administration's proposal is a nonstarter, because it does not hold Wall Street executives accountable for their bad decisions. The crisis on Wall Street did not just happen. CEOs and other executives at the financial institutions made bad decisions, and we need to ensure their bad decisions are not rewarded. 
   For years, CEOs have been walking away from faltering companies with millions of dollars in compensation. Last year, the CEO of Merrill Lynch resigned after the company lost $10 billion, and its stock lost 45 percent of its value. Despite these failures, the CEO walked away with $161 million retirement package. 
   In any Wall Street recovery package, we need to ensure that the CEOs are not rewarded for their poor decisions with bonuses and other large compensation packages. They need to be held accountable. This is the taxpayers' money.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 260 provides for consideration of H.R. 1433, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007, under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour and 20 minutes of general debate, with 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary, and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except those arising under clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the amendment printed in the report shall be considered as adopted, and the bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. The rule waives all points of order against the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Nation was built upon the principle that it was patently unjust to require people to pay taxes to a government within which they had no direct involvement, what came to be familiarly called ``taxation without representation.'' The fact that approximately 600,000 U.S. citizens live under taxation without representation within the United States today is repugnant to our very notion of democracy and to those who fought and died in creating this great Nation. How can the United States deny democracy in its capital while it promotes democracy abroad? 
   These citizens pay billions of dollars in Federal taxes and have sacrificed their lives in Iraq and every other war since the American Revolution. This is taxation without representation at its worst, and it is completely undemocratic. No other democracy in the world denies to its citizens in its capital city the right to vote. We here in America, the symbol of democracy to so much of the world, must not deny that right to our citizens. 
   This bipartisan legislation would correct this injustice by granting the citizens of our Nation's capital with a voting representative in the House of Representatives. 
   Some of my colleagues have suggested that this legislation is unconstitutional, that we in Congress will be acting outside our power in enacting this bill. To this, I must respectfully and strongly disagree. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution clearly enumerates the powers of Congress. Among the powers listed in Article I, section 8 states that Congress shall have the power ``to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over'' the District of Columbia. Article I, section 8 also gives Congress the power ``to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper'' to execute its enumerated powers. 
   Further, in 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, giving residents of the new District of Columbia the right to vote. Since the capital was still being established, citizens were allowed to continue voting in their States, Maryland and Virginia. Congress then took this right away by statute in 1800 when the Federal Government assumed control of the District of Columbia. In the political battles that followed, District residents were denied a vote in Congress. Certainly, if Congress can remove the right by statute, so too can it reinstate that right by statute. 
   In the landmark Supreme Court case McCulloch v. Maryland, Chief Justice John Marshall said: ``Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.'' 
   Extending full representation in the House to residents of the District of Columbia is a legitimate end. It is within the scope of Congress' power to exercise exclusive legislation in matters concerning the District of Columbia and consistent with not only the letter of the Constitution but also the spirit in which the Constitution was written by our Founding Fathers, that is, ``taxation without representation is tyranny.'' 
   I, for one, want to correct this grave injustice and provide the citizens of Washington, D.C. with the same rights afforded to every other citizen in this great Nation. Our actions today will do just that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully disagree with my friend and colleague from Texas. I think he is trying to characterize this bill as an attempt to create statehood for the District of Columbia, which is not what this bill does. This bill attempts to do what the Constitution says that Congress can do, and that is, exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the District. That is what we are doing here, and there is precedent to that. 
   In 1949 in the Tidewater case, the Supreme Court upheld a decision which allowed Congress to give diversity jurisdiction to the District of Columbia, and now, generally, diversity jurisdiction only can occur between States, and despite the fact that clearly the District of Columbia was not a State, they were able, through an enactment by Congress, to be given that status of diversity jurisdiction. 
   The District of Columbia is not a State. It is not being treated as a State, but rather as a district for the capital, for the Federal capital. So it does have a special and unique treatment, and I think the Founding Fathers realized that it would be different, that it would not be like a State, and, in fact, it was part of the history why they came and created a capital. 
   When they were in Philadelphia, they were not happy with the fact that they had to constantly appeal to the Pennsylvania Legislature for the right to do different things, so they intended to create a capital that they would be able to have jurisdiction over. 
   That was the historical reason why the District of Columbia was created. So the fact that Congress then gave itself, or the Constitution gave Congress the right to make laws and make rules for the District of Columbia is the reason why today we are introducing this bill. 
   So I believe that we are not attempting to give D.C. statehood, but, rather, to give it a right to vote in this body, which is exclusively within the jurisdiction of Congress and within the right of Congress to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to point out, in listening to the debate, that when one looks at some of the decisions from the Supreme Court with respect to the steps that Congress, the powers of Congress, you can't help but think of Marbury v. Madison, which is one of the first great cases considered by Justice Marshall in the early Supreme Court. 
   In that case, the Supreme Court basically outlined what was the framework for the separation of power between the different branches of government. Basically, it set forth to Congress that it could not dictate to the Supreme Court or to the justice branch of government what the jurisdictions of or what their jurisdiction was. 
   Basically, what that decision came to recognize is the fact that within the particular branches of government, each branch has exclusive power and that only the Constitution can set jurisdiction. 
   Clearly, that is what we are doing here today. The Constitution makes it very clear that Congress has exclusive legislative right over the District. That is exactly what we are attempting to do today. We are attempting to give the District of Columbia the right to vote, as we are entitled to do, as the Constitution clearly enumerates that Congress has the right to do.

   Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his remarks. He talks about bipartisanship. Frankly, I can't think of an issue that is more bipartisan than giving each and every American the right to vote. That is exactly what we are attempting to do here today. 
   You know, I can't help but think as a new Member of Congress that when we came down back in January to be sworn in, and my daughter and my family were here, one of the first things that my daughter said to me was noticing on a license plate ``taxation without representation.'' She asked me what that meant and why they were talking about that because she remembered studying about it in school. 
   It is critical. It is so important to us as a Nation to practice what we preach. We are in other places in the world. We are fighting wars for freedom, and we talk about how important it is to give people the right to vote and to be free, and that is exactly what we are doing here today.

In fact, we have spent $400 billion attempting to give the people in Iraq freedom and the right to vote.

   We have all heard the stories about soldiers being moved into Building 18 with mold, mice, and cockroaches because Walter Reed had simply run out of space. 
   Time after time this administration has cut the Veterans Administration budget during a time of war. And now the President wants to send an additional 21,000 troops into Iraq. How can we think of sending more troops into Iraq when we don't have enough space here in our military hospitals to provide the wounded with the care they rightfully deserve?

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Chairman, today is not about a FISA debate. Actually, it's not even about whether or not Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten have a right to claim an executive privilege. What it is about is does a person in this country have to follow the laws of the United States, follow the rule of law, follow the Constitution and abide by a legally administered subpoena. 
   And I guess the best way to talk about that is to draw a comparison. Under the Constitution, a person has an absolute right to claim their fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. So, if a person is subpoenaed to testify in a criminal matter, they can't call the judge up and say, ``Judge, I think I might have a fifth amendment problem here. I'm not going to show up.'' The judge will tell them they have to be in court and they have to assert their fifth amendment right after they are asked a question. The same thing applies here. They have to appear before Congress and at least assert that right before they can claim some kind of privilege; otherwise, the entire system falls apart.

States have laws that help companies with approved power projects obtain the necessary right-of-ways, and these laws work. They have worked for many years. I know of no power line project anywhere in the country that has ever failed to be completed once it had been approved and the company held the necessary permits to begin construction. 
   We understand that there are serious energy needs facing this country that must be addressed swiftly and judiciously. All this amendment does is permit an already approved company from using Federal eminent domain to drag a property owner into Federal court and take his land. That is a supreme power of the Federal Government. 
   This is not a Democratic or Republican issue or liberal or conservative issue. This is about protecting the rights of the citizens of this country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, in closing, there is an old saying that we should think globally but act locally. That is exactly what this amendment attempts to do. That is the idea behind this amendment. 
   We crafted it very narrowly, and despite some of the comments by the speakers about the problems that this would create, it does no such thing. In fact, it does just the opposite. This achieves all of the things that we need in this country. That is, getting energy and power to our large communities, to our large cities, to New York, to Los Angeles, to the places that need it.  
   It does it in a responsible way. It does it in such a way that the localities, the areas that we call the faucet, have some say in getting the power to the sink, and that's the area that FERC refers to as the place that needs the power, and, equally as important, that the people along the way have some say as well. 
   That's what this amendment does; and, as I say, it is supported by, as my friend, Mr. Hinchey, said, most of the Governors in this country. 
   The amendment deals with the concerns of localities. It deals with the constitutional rights, the States' rights that our States are most concerned with and, most importantly, it deals with the needs of all Americans. 
   I strongly support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, I have only been here for 7 months, but in that short time it has become overwhelmingly clear to me that some of my colleagues are more concerned with establishing a reputation than addressing the needs of the American people. 
   Over and over, some of these colleagues from the other side of the aisle march down to the floor and take aim at appropriations projects that they feel aren't worthy of Federal support, as if people at one end of the country know what is important for people on the other end of the country. 
   I hear them talk about these earmarks and try to demonize them, talk about them being hidden and going to powerful Members of Congress. Well, there is nothing hidden about this. It is very clear what this project is. And as for powerful Members of Congress, I would like to be impressed, but I know as a freshman I am certainly not a powerful Member of Congress. 
   There are no winners or losers here. They talk about winners or losers here. The only winners are the American people. This program is for the American people. It is to ensure that our grapes and our wines that are so important to so many people in this country continue to be high quality and the kind of quality that makes America competitive. 
   The benefit of this project is not limited to my congressional district, but to people all over the country. Mr. Chairman, it is not about making a point or establishing a reputation; it is about conducting important research  that protects the safety of our food supply, helps our domestic economy and the grape industry.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, April 12, 32-year-old Utica police officer Thomas Lindsey was shot and killed in the line of duty during a routine traffic stop in Utica, New York, my hometown. 
   A 5 1/2 -year veteran of the Utica police force, Tom served for more than a year with an elite squad tasked with handling special assignments. Tom was the kind of guy that, as a teenager, he traveled to Mexico one summer just to build churches. And prior to his tenure as a Utica police officer, he served our Nation honorably as a U.S. Marine as an embassy guard. 
   As a former district attorney, I had the distinct privilege of working hand in hand with the dedicated men and women of the Utica Police Department. This loss affects those brave men and women and their families hardest of all. 
   Tom put his life on the line in the Marines and as a police officer, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect his country and the community. Losing someone like Tom is a great tragedy, but in this tragedy there is a lesson. We must learn from the way Tom lived his life and his commitment to public service, his community and his country. 
   My prayers are with Tom's mother, Carmella Lindsey-Schisler, his girlfriend, Lisa, and his family and coworkers. 
   I hope everyone can take a moment today to thank the men and the women in their local police departments who serve them so well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I'm here tonight, I rise to honor Mike McNulty. 
   You know, I think I'm probably one of the only ones that remembers Mike way back. I was a college student at University of Albany when Mike was representing the Village of Green Island as mayor. And I can remember listening to the news and hearing not only about Mike, but about his entire family that served the Albany area for so many years with distinction. And I can't even tell you how great an honor it was when I finally was able to meet him, and then to serve with him here. 
   But I want to talk about my experience with Mike McNulty in a little different way. I'm one of the new Members, one of the three new members of the New York delegation. And being a new Member, obviously, you look for people to get advice. And Mike, being the Dean of the Upstate delegation, I naturally turned to him. And so many times I would sit down next to him and ask him questions. And I can't tell you how many times he would turn to me and say, well, Mike, I think you might want to handle it this way, or think about it this way. And there was one time in particular when we were dealing with an issue that was difficult and I was a little bit concerned about it. And Mike sat down and said, Mike, really, you will see that it will work out, just think it through and handle it. And I don't think 2 days passed when exactly the advice that he gave me went exactly the way he said it would go, and the issue worked out. 
   And it wasn't just the fact that Mike is always there to give freshman Members like myself advice, it's not only the quality of the advice that he gives, but the way that he gives the advice, in a patient way, in an understanding way, never forgetting what it's like to be new, never forgetting what it's like to not be completely familiar with the procedure, and just having the patience of a brother, of an older brother sitting down and explaining things. And that means a lot, Mike. It has meant a lot to me, and I know it has meant a lot to the other freshmen. 
   What you have done for this institution, for the State of New York is incredible. And it's an honor to not only have been able to know you, but to have been able to have served with you. 
   So congratulations and good luck to Mike McNulty, the consummate gentleman from New York.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1041 provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 3773, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. The rule makes in order a motion offered by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to concur in the Senate amendment with the amendment printed in the Rules Committee report on this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have come a long way on the crucial issues of intelligence-gathering. I commend Chairmen CONYERS and REYES for their diligence in providing much-needed attention in evaluation of FISA, while ensuring that we provide our Nation's intelligence community with the necessary tools and resources to prevent a future terrorist attack on our Nation.  
   Over the last few weeks, my office phone lines have been burning up with calls from constituents regarding FISA and the need for Congress to take action. Unfortunately, the calls were prompted by a far-reaching misinformation campaign aimed to scare the public into believing that the House majority is in some way prohibiting our Nation's intelligence community from monitoring the terrorists. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only are these claims false, they are unconscionable. 
   I don't believe any Member of this institution, Republican or Democrat, wants to shackle our Nation's intelligence community from preventing another terrorist attack. Frankly, I am getting alarmed by the claims by some of my colleagues. For the last couple of weeks, we have heard only one message from the other side of the aisle: take up the Senate bill because it has the support of the President. I have no interest in being a rubber stamp for this administration, nor of any elected body, even the Senate. That is not why I was sent to Congress. I certainly mean no disrespect to the Senate, but my constituents sent me to Congress to use my judgment and conscience to help govern. 
   The chairman of the Judiciary Committee said it best earlier in the week during our Rules Committee hearing when he said we are not an appendage of the Senate. I couldn't agree with Mr. Conyers more. It is our responsibility to the American people to exercise our legislative duty. Furthermore, with an issue like FISA and intelligence-gathering, I am confident that the American people would expect the House to exercise that duty to the fullest extent possible. 
   We are a bicameral form of government. The changes we are proposing to the Senate bill today represent a powerful step forward in the legislative process. The administration has made it overwhelmingly clear that they need to use electronic surveillance to track and identify terrorist targets. And despite the misinformation campaign and the rhetoric, the proposal we will vote on today makes it easier for our Nation's intelligence community to wiretap suspected terrorists by explicitly not requiring a court order to wiretap targets believed to be outside the United States. In addition, the proposal provides for surveillance of terrorists and other targets overseas who may be communicating with Americans. 
   And we are all well aware of the issue of immunity for telecom companies. It seems like that is all we have talked about here for the past several months. As a former prosecutor, I can say from experience and without hesitation, you never provide immunity to anyone unless you are sure whom you are giving the immunity to and why you are giving the immunity out. 
   One point that has not received enough emphasis over the last few weeks is that the telecom companies have immunity under current law. However, the problem is that anytime a telecommunication company goes to court, this administration steps in and says this is classified material and the question is deemed state secret, and therefore you are not allowed to talk about it. In that way, the telecom companies are not allowed to even defend themselves, but rather have to sit there and answer for any charges civilly made against them. 
   I, for one, couldn't agree more that if the intelligence community goes to a telecom company with adequate authorization and says, We need communication records for person X because he or she is believed to be a terrorist, the telecom company deserves to be afforded that protection. Unfortunately, we have absolutely no idea what the administration requested and what the telecom companies have provided. 
   Our proposal provides a commonsense, balanced approach to address the immunity issue. We want to provide the telecom companies with a legal way to present their defense in a secure proceeding and in a secure way in district court without the administration asserting state secret privileges to block those defenses. 
   And, again, don't be fooled by the misinformation campaign. We are not talking about broadcasting the content of those defenses over the public airwaves, rather just the opposite will be done in camera and in secret. This would involve ex parte proceedings in camera. That is one-on-one telecom company and a Federal district court judge behind closed doors. That way, the determination of whether or not the classified material is, in fact, a state secret is made by a neutral third party and not just this administration. 
   Finally, our proposal establishes a bipartisan national commission with subpoena power to investigate and report to the American people on the administration's warrantless surveillance activities and to recommend procedures and protections for the future in much the same way that the 9/11 Commission did. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must bring the misinformation campaign and partisan wrangling to an end. There is no question that there are groups and individuals out there who seek to do us harm. There is no question that my colleagues and I want to give the people who protect us from the danger every tool they need to keep fighting terrorism. The proposal we will vote on today will, in fact, provide our Nation's intelligence community with the resources to prevent future acts of terrorism while protecting the freedoms of the citizens under the Constitution. Everyone in this body wants the same thing, and that is to protect American citizens. This bill does exactly that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, it just seems to me that this debate is becoming more and more political rather than focusing on what we're here to do, and that is to ensure that the people of this country have absolutely the best FISA bill that they can, a bill that not only protects us but ensures that the Constitution is protected as well. That's what this FISA bill does. It takes the best of all the things that we have been trying to achieve over the past several months and incorporates it into a bill, including unshackling the telecom companies so that if they have done what has been asked of them and what is permitted to do under the law, that they are allowed immunity. We certainly don't want to prosecute people who have been trying to help our country and keep our country safe. Nonetheless, this puts into effect the important factors of ensuring that those things are done. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak).

   However, when he speaks about things that just blatantly aren't true, for some reason, and I don't know if it's an attempt to frighten the American people, it's troubling. This bill, this FISA bill, allows the government to wiretap any foreign national, whether they are overseas or they are here. This is just blatantly untrue. What he says about the fact is that we cannot wiretap, we can't monitor a person that comes to this country who is a foreigner. It's just blatantly untrue. This FISA bill allows that to happen. 
   It's somewhat disheartening when people mention facts that just aren't true, and I certainly hope it's not for political reasons; but let's stick to the facts, because the facts are clearly that this bill allows that to happen.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California, and I would just like to say we are hearing about everything except this energy bill. And, Mr. Speaker, I would point out this is a good bill, and so the people on the other side of the aisle want to talk about everything but this rule and this bill. 
   I rise today in strong support of this rule and this bill, H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Act, which will not only bring this country into a new alternative energy future, but strengthen our economy, create jobs, and boost small businesses in the very towns and rural communities where we need it most. 
   During these uncertain economic times, it is absolutely critical that we pass legislation to invest in jobs for today and long-term development for tomorrow. 
   The best way to encourage growth and development of new technology is to let businesses invest their own money in ways that expand our economic horizons. Tax credits for alternative energy production have the power to truly jump-start our economy and create good-paying, highly skilled jobs that can't be sent overseas. 
   In my upstate New York district, our location with natural resources and first-class scientific and technological community makes us perfectly poised to seize the opportunity to create a new green economy, complete with green jobs. 
   I recently had the opportunity to see firsthand what investments in alternative energy production can do. I attended a groundbreaking at Mascoma's $30 million cellulosic ethanol facility in Rome, New York, and went to the grand opening of the Schuyler Wood Pellet plant in Herkimer County, which will create 18 full-time green jobs on-site, enough wood pellets to heat 33,000 homes, and provide a $10.5 million investment in upstate New York's future. That is the kind of future and the kind of bill we are here to support today. 
   This is why I am especially glad to support the over- $8 billion in long-term renewable energy tax incentives included in the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Act, tax incentives that will help companies like Mascoma and Schuyler Wood Pellet continue to grow and spur additional economic activity. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this rule and the underlying legislation.

The President's first two vetoes involved legislation that would expand Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, which has the potential to unlock the doors to cures for diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer's. Two times, congressional Republicans sided with the President enabling his veto to stand and thereby denying hope to millions of American families. 
   The President's third veto came on the war funding bill that finally included a deadline to bring our troops home from Iraq. Again, Republicans sided with the President, and our troops continue to be bogged down in a war that the President himself says could continue for another decade. Then, last week, the President vetoed a fourth bill that would provide private health insurance to 10 million low-income children. It received strong bipartisan support in Congress, and there are enough votes in the Senate to override the President's veto.

   Chairman Oberstar, thank you first for your leadership on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and for bringing forward this bill. 
   As you know, this past February GAO reported that the very unique airport which is closest to our Nation's capital, National Airport, is underutilized. In fact, the GAO reported that National Airport is the least congested airport of the top 30 in the Nation. 
   Residents of my Upstate New York district want to continue visiting our Nation's capital for business or pleasure at a reasonable airfare. However, because a very few airlines control the vast majority of landing and takeoff slots at National, that is artificially limited. 
   Mr. Chairman, like all of my colleagues, I appreciate your strong leadership and guidance on aviation issues and your genuine concern for regional interests. I therefore respectfully request that you strongly consider adopting findings of GAO's conclusive report and increase flying at National Airport by a very modest two round trips per hour so that new competition can be added, so that fares can be decreased.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, it is time to rein in this administration's prevalent use of no-bid contracts. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this rule and the Accountability in Contracting Act. 
   In the last five years, spending on ``no-bid'' or ``sole-source'' contracts has more than doubled. The administration contends that in every one of these cases there were ``urgent and compelling needs'' that required these contracts to be awarded without a competitive bidding process. In the case of the emergency response to disasters like hurricanes Katrina and Rita, I don't dispute that the need was urgent, but for non-emergency contracting needs, we must get our fiscal house in order. 
   Just as any family has a budget to stick to, shouldn't we reach a point after an emergency when there has been enough time to consider multiple, competitive bids? A point after which the ``compelling needs'' are a little less urgent? By last June--nine months after Hurricane Katrina--$10.6 billion had been awarded to private contractors for recovery efforts, but only 30 percent of that had been awarded competitively. 
   I know of no small business in Upstate New York, who could get by without reasonably budgeting for their expenses--even in times of emergency. Why should taxpayer dollars be spent differently? 
   Oversight of these contracts has been no better. Audits have revealed that post-Katrina contractors have over-billed, double-billed, and billed for work that was never completed. The Defense Contractor Audit Agency found that through fiscal year 2006, over $10 billion in contractor charges in Iraq have been identified as ``questioned'' or ``unsupported.'' 
   Under this administration, the use of ``cost plus'' contracts has increased more than seventy-five percent. These cost-plus contracts guarantee a contractor a fixed profit, regardless of how efficiently they spend the government's money--taxpayers' money. These contracts provide no incentive to look after the bottom line because they guarantee there will always be money off the top. When indefinite, no-bid contracts contain ``cost-plus'' provisions, the opportunity for foul play is only amplified. 
   The Accountability in Contracting Act addresses these concerns. This bill limits to roughly 8 months the time that federal no-bid contracts can last. It requires each federal agency that has awarded at least $1 billion in the preceding fiscal year to develop and implement a plan to minimize the use of contracts entered into using no-bid procedures and cost-reimbursement type contracts. The bill also establishes a system to increase competition in contract bidding and requires agencies that enter into a no-bid contract to make ``justification and approval'' documents public within fourteen days after awarding a contract. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have a responsibility to the American people to spend their hard-earned tax dollars in a fiscally responsible way. And the Accountability in Contracting Act will help reach that end by providing much-needed transparency to the way the federal government awards contracts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 862 provides for consideration of H.R. 4299, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of H.R. 4299 except those arising under clause 9 and clause 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will make my remarks brief. We have debated the substance of this bill before, and the House passed a similar version in September with the support of 312 Members of this body. The measure we will consider today contains many needed revisions to the terrorism risk insurance program to ensure our national and economic security. 
   The terrorism risk insurance program was originally enacted as a short-term backstop for an insurance industry hard hit by the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 of 2001. In the years since, we have seen that the private insurance market is unable to cover the risk of both domestic and foreign acts of terrorism without assistance. 
   Experience has shown that there is a true need for government involvement in terrorism insurance. The exposure for private companies is just too great. In the wake of September 11, 2001, many companies opted to exclude terrorism risks from private insurance policies, leaving no coverage in the event of another attack. TRIA requires primary insurers to make terrorism insurance available to commercial clients that wish to purchase it while at the same time helping those insurers manage their exposure to risk of loss. 
   The legislation this rule provides for consideration of would extend TRIA for 7 more years. This is a shorter extension than the 15-year extension that the House originally passed but still far longer than the 2-year extension that was enacted in 2005. A 7-year extension will provide greater certainty and stability to the insurance and real estate markets than presently exists, and that is good for business. 
   The legislation would also make several other critical changes to the terrorism risk insurance program. It would change the definition of terrorism under TRIA to include domestic terrorism and reset the program trigger level, where the government backstop kicks in, to $50 million, where it was in 2006. It would expand the program to provide for group life insurance coverage; would decrease deductibles for terrorist attacks costing over $1 billion; and reduce the trigger level in the years following such an attack. 
   The TRIA bill which the House approved in September would have required insurers to include coverage for nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological attacks in policies they offer. However, this provision has been removed from the bill because some insurers, particularly the smaller insurers, raised concerns regarding their ability to cover the additional risk when private reinsurance does not exist. 
   To address these concerns, the legislation will mandate a study by the Government Accountability Office on the availability and the affordability of private insurance coverage for nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological attacks. This provision represents a commonsense first step in addressing the economic fallout of such an attack. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is critical in protecting our national and economic security in the fight against terrorism. It will also help many of the small- and medium-sized insurance companies located in my congressional district provide coverage in this ever-changing 21st century. 
   I commend Financial Services Committee Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for their bipartisan effort to bring this vital, time-sensitive piece of legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Frankly, all we have heard lately, especially in the Rules Committee debate, is that this bill is not going to pass the Senate, this bill is going to get vetoed by the President, and therefore the House should follow what the Senate is going to do and the House should follow what the President suggests. That is not the reason 435 Members of this House were elected. We were elected to do what we think is best for this country, and not what the Senate thinks is best, and not what the President thinks is best, but what the House of Representatives thinks is best. That is what this bill is attempting to do, give what the House of Representatives thinks is best in this important piece of legislation. 
   Protecting the safety and security of America is, without question, a top priority of this institution. The horrific terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, had a devastating effect on many people in this country. The attacks also had a devastating economic effect on the commercial insurance market. TRIA has been a success. Primary insurers are able to write policies and business owners are able to obtain coverage. Stability was restored to this vital market. 
   If we do not act now to extend TRIA, this program will expire at the end of the month and we will be back where we started after the September 11 attacks. We have debated this bill before and the House passed a similar version in September, with the support of 312 Members. I hope that the TRIA legislation we will consider here today will enjoy the same overwhelming bipartisan support. We must not allow the threat of future terrorist attacks to endanger or close valuable businesses because they cannot afford insurance. This is not an exercise in futility, as my colleague said in his opening, but rather an exercise in necessity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question. 
   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

   When I look at the things that this House has done this year, things like appropriating money so that student loans are increased, Pell Grants are increased so that our children who go to college leave college with less debt, less saddled for the future; when I think of the sacrifices that parents make so that they can help their children through college, so that when  their children finish college they're not saddled with debt; those are the kind of considerations that we need to take into consideration today in fixing the AMT so that we don't saddle our children with incredible debt in the future, that we fix the AMT and we do it in a responsible way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1233 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 5540, the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network Continuing Authorization Act. The resolution provides 1 hour of debate, controlled by the Committee on Natural Resources, and makes in order all amendments submitted to the Rules Committee for consideration. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by congratulating my freshman class colleague from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) for his leadership on behalf of the Chesapeake Bay. Mr. Sarbanes has worked diligently and tirelessly in a bipartisan fashion to transcend partisan politics and ensure the Chesapeake Bay remains a vibrant recreational and economic network for many years to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule and the legislation which it provides for consideration of will continue the important restoration and conservation of the Chesapeake Bay watershed by permanently authorizing the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network. 
   The Chesapeake Bay is our Nation's largest estuary. Many people often think of the Bay only as Maryland and Virginia, but the Bay's watershed covers 64,000 square miles in five States and the District of Columbia. In fact, the watershed's most northern part, or what we in upstate New York would call the starting point, extends into a significant portion of my congressional district and actually starts in Cooperstown, New York. 
   As a result of its size and location, the Chesapeake Bay has played a role in the development of American history, from early settlement and commerce to military battles and transportation development, as well as recreational uses. It truly is worthy of preservation, both for its natural beauty and the impact on our Nation's cultural evolution. 
   First established in 1998, the Chesapeake Bay Network is a comprehensive protection program for the Bay. The programs authorized serve to identify, conserve, restore and interpret the natural, historical, cultural and recreational resources within the watershed. These programs can also educate local communities on the significant sites in their region and how their community impacts the overall health of the Bay. The law requires the National Park Service to award grants to State and local agencies and nonprofit organizations with a full matching requirement for such projects. 
   The resulting network is a system of over 150 parks, museums, historic communities, scenic roadways, watertrails and water access points located within the vast Chesapeake Bay watershed. Each of these sites tells a piece of a vast Chesapeake story while providing Federal support for the preservation and improvement of these sites, to enhance both the historical and recreational experience. The network is overseen by the National Park Service, but the Park Service only manages about 10 of the network's sites. Other gateways are managed by local, State and nongovernmental organizations. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Network has always been a bipartisan program. The legislation that created it in 1998 passed the House on suspension by voice vote and was agreed to by unanimous consent in the Senate and signed into law by President Clinton. In 2002, a clean 5-year reauthorization received similar unanimous support in Congress and was signed into law by President Bush. 
   The White House Conference on Cooperative Conservation headed by the Department of the Interior has called the network a success story. The legislation this rule provides for consideration of will permanently extend the authorization for this bipartisan program. It is worth noting that the National Park Service has also recommended permanent reauthorization of the network. 
   I encourage all my colleagues to vote for this rule and the underlying bill and to continue to support the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my friend from Washington for his comments and just point out, Mr. Speaker, that on the one hand my colleague from Washington says that we are not allowing anyone to make any amendments, that we have closed the rule, and yet we have allowed every amendment in the Rules Committee that was offered including the one amendment from the gentleman from Utah. And then he criticizes in saying that we allow debate for 2 hours on this bill. You can't have it both ways. We have allowed debate on this bill, we have allowed for people to bring their amendments if that is what they choose to do and have an open Congress just the way we talked about.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that my colleague from North Carolina talks about inaction. And he would have the American people believe that inaction means not drilling. They are two distinctly different things. Just simply because I don't advocate drilling doesn't mean that I am not for alternative energy. We cannot drill our way to energy independence. It just doesn't make sense.

   Mr. ARCURI. Reclaiming my time, it is not about drilling. That is what some people in this House want to talk about. It is not. It is about developing alternative energy. In my district, we are developing cellulosic ethanol. In my district, we are developing geothermal power. We are heating schools, we are heating buildings, we are heating offices with geothermal. It is about developing alternative energy. It is not about drilling, drilling, drilling. Because in the end, what is going to happen is in 10 years or in 15 years we are going to defer this problem to our children. It is not something that we should just dump on their laps by just moving the problem to them. 
   We can drill today, we can drill tomorrow. And then in 10 years and in 15 years our children and our grandchildren will have to deal with this. It is time to deal with it today. Mr. Speaker, it is time to deal with it today and to deal with it now, not to defer it to our children. That is not what a good parent does.

   Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman for the history lesson and for the lesson on what drilling means. I really appreciate that. I know we don't have a lot of domestic oil in New York, but I appreciate having him tell me what drilling means. 
   But when people in my district talk to me about what are we doing about gas, and we get those very same questions, I tell them that we have done some things. We have passed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension Consumer Protection Act. I tell them we've passed the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act. I tell them we've passed the OPEC and big oil companies accountability bill. I tell them we've passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. I tell them we've passed the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act. I tell them we've passed the Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act. I tell them we've passed the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act. I tell them we've passed the Energy Market Manipulation Prevention Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, America is tired of the same old rhetoric. They want new solutions. When I talk about geothermal projects that we have in our district, when I talk about cellulosic ethanol plants, when I talk about wood pellet plants, that is new strategies. Those are new philosophies. Those are the kind of strategies that we need in this country for real, long-term change in direction, the kind of direction that will make it easier for our children and our grandchildren to live and to function and not to be dependent on foreign oil.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I don't think there is a person in America today that hasn't been affected either personally or through their business by the high cost of energy, by the high cost of gas. You know, we all go to the gas pumps. Just last weekend when I was home, I was pumping the gas, and you could see the look on people's faces as they watched the amount and as they went inside to pay the bill. And we all know, whether you're in New York or whether you're in the State of Washington or whether you're in Texas, no matter where you are here in this country, we all know and experience the same thing. 
   However, the strategy of finger-pointing and blaming just will not get this country to where we need to be. We talk about here whose fault it is. We constantly have people pointing the finger. The fact of the matter is in 2002 when this President took over in the White House, the price of oil was $25 a barrel. Today it's nearly $130 a barrel. The cost of gas per gallon has tripled. 
   We could point the finger. We could blame. We could do a lot of things. The fact of the matter is we cannot drill our way to energy independence. And people here would have you think that there is no drilling and there is no exploration going on in this country. Right now in my State, in fact, in my district, in the southern part of New York State, the northern part of Pennsylvania, there are huge amounts of exploration going on for natural gas.  Huge natural gas fields there. They are looking for gas. They are searching for gas. They are finding it in this country. It is going on. The American people will have all of the energy that they need. 
   However, if we are going to get to where we need to be as a country, we cannot depend on a finite resource. We can't depend on gas and oil. It will be gone. It will eventually deplete, and our children will be right where we are now paying double, triple, quadruple what we are paying now for energy. 
   It is time to look toward alternative energy, and that's what we advocate; Not stopping drilling. No one wants to see us stop drilling or stop exploration. Just to be practical in terms of how we develop our alternative energy in the next step that we take. 
   Mr. Speaker, allow me to bring us back here to the discussion, just for a moment, of the real reason that we're here today, and that is the reauthorization of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network. I think it's sad that this bill seems to have been trivialized today because this is a very important bill. This means a great deal to many people that live in the States that the Chesapeake Bay watershed is in but more importantly to this country. 
   It is such an important part of our history and a critical part of our future. This is a program that did not have even a single Member of Congress oppose its creation or its subsequent reauthorization. Over a decade that the program has existed, it has been heralded as a success by the administration and Congress alike. 
   The program was unanimously reauthorized by Congress 5 years ago. The legislation this rule provides for consideration would now permanently extend the authorization for this bipartisan program. And the National Park Service has recommended this permanent reauthorization of the network. Everyone agrees that the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network is a good program. That's had a positive impact on the preservation and recreation within the Chesapeake Bay watershed. 
   I would also like to point out, Mr. Speaker, that we on the Rules Committee have made every amendment on this legislation submitted by the Republican minority for consideration. This will allow for both a full debate and a vote on every item of legislation with which the Republican minority has issue. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 161 is a rule to provide for consideration of H.R. 976, the Small Business Tax Relief Act, under suspension of rules at any time on the legislative day of Friday, February 16, 2007. 
   This rule is necessary because under clause 1(a) of rule XV, the Speaker may entertain motions to suspend the rules only on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of each week. In order for suspensions to be considered on other days, the Rules Committee must provide for consideration of these motions. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying how honored I am as a member of the distinguished Rules Committee to manage the rule for consideration of such an important piece of legislation that will provide $1.3 billion of tax relief for our Nation's small business. 
   This legislation, the Small Business Tax Relief Act, is strongly supported by a host of business organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the NFIB, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Restaurant Association. 
   Small businesses are the backbone of this Nation's economy. Every day we as Americans utilize the services of small business owners, whether it is dropping off our dry cleaning, grabbing a bite to eat at a local diner or pizzeria, or waiting in line to pick up a prescription at a local pharmacy. We depend on our small businesses.     
   It is a constant struggle for most small businesses just to keep the lights on. Utility costs continue to skyrocket, and larger companies continue to expand services, pushing out the mom-and-pop stores in cities and towns across the country. My constituents in Upstate New York have experienced this loss of economic activity firsthand, but that trend has continued. 
   The Small Business Tax Relief Act would help small businesses grow and hire new workers by extending and expanding tax provisions that encourage investment in new equipment and promote the hiring of disadvantaged workers, and it does so in a fiscally responsible way that meets the pay-as-you-go requirements. Small business owners have to balance the books and stay on budget each month. It is only fitting that we do as well. 
   Specifically, the bill would help small businesses invest in new equipment by extending and expanding expensing options for 1 year and increase both the amount small businesses can deduct from their taxes and the number of small businesses that can take these deductions. 
   The bill would extend the work opportunity tax credit, which provides incentives to employers to hire individuals that frequently experience barriers to work for 1 year, and expand it to cover disabled veterans. In other words, it helps those who need jobs by giving employers tax credits for creating jobs. 
   It would enhance the current tip credit for small businesses by maintaining the current tip credit that small businesses take for the Social Security taxes they pay on their employees' tips, instead of allowing it to drop with the long-overdue increase in the minimum wage this legislation will help achieve. 
   The bill also contains a provision that would simplify tax-filing requirements for businesses owned jointly by a husband and wife, providing much-needed relief for the many small firms throughout this country. 
   Right now, there is a glitch in the Social Security tax law which only allows one spouse, most often the husband, to get credit for paying into Social Security. This leaves women who work as equal partners in an unfair situation. The Small Business Tax Relief Act fixes this glaring inequality by ensuring that both partners, equal members of the team, receive their justly deserved entitlement benefits. 
   Moreover, this legislation does not only help small businesses. It is a win-win, because passage of the Small Business Tax Relief Act is also a critical step in finalizing an increase in the Federal minimum wage for 13 million hardworking Americans. 
   I made a promise to my constituents that I would go to Washington to fight for a long-overdue increase in the Federal minimum wage. Passage of this measure takes us one step closer to fulfilling that promise. 
   I want to be clear. I support a stand-alone increase in the minimum wage, like the legislation we passed a few weeks ago with overwhelming bipartisan support. However, 10 years is too long for any hardworking Americans to wait for a wage increase. Let's not force them to wait any longer. The time to act is now. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I first of all would like to thank my fellow New Yorker and the dean of our delegation, Chairman Rangel, for his very hard work in bringing this very important bipartisan bill to the floor. I think it shows the depth of his knowledge and understanding of the issues, and I think it is very critical that we address this bill today. 
   Mr. Speaker, $1.3 billion in tax relief for our small business owners is the kind of sensible, responsible tax relief I am proud to support. Let's help small businesses do what they do best, and that is create jobs and strengthen our economy. 
   During the debate at the Rules hearing, some of my colleagues were asking the question why we had to move so quickly on this bill, why we couldn't wait until Congress came back in session. 
   I couldn't help but think of the old adage, why put off until tomorrow what you can do today. People who earn $5.15 who want the minimum wage raised have been waiting for 10 years. People in small business who pay more than they need to want tax breaks. It is the sensible thing to do, and it is the sensible thing to do right now. 
   As I said earlier, this is a win-win scenario, because passage of this bipartisan fiscally responsible legislation will also clear the way for a much-needed and well-deserved increase in the minimum wage. America's workers have been waiting far too long for a pay raise. Let's not make them wait any longer. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and on the previous question, because our small business owners need some relief and American workers deserve a raise.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1332, SMALL BUSINESS LENDING IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 330 provides for consideration of H.R. 1332, the Small Business Lending Improvements Act of 2007 under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Small Business. The rule makes in order the substitute reported by the Committee on Small Business as an original bill for purpose of amendment. The rule makes in order all four germane amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee. And finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, this bipartisan legislation, crafted under the leadership of my colleague from New York, chairwoman of the Small Business Committee, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez, maintains support of a wide range of organizations, including the Independent Community Bankers of America, the American Dental Association, the American Veterans, and American College of Physicians. 
   Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. In my home State of New York, 99 percent of all businesses are small businesses, and they employ 52 percent of the nonfarm, private sector workforce. In 2005, an estimated 62,000 new small firms began operations in New York, creating $77 billion in entrepreneurial income for the State of New York. 
   In my district and across this country, Americans depend on small businesses to drive the economy and provide essential everyday services. Sadly, it is a constant struggle for many of these entrepreneurs just to keep the lights on, as larger companies continue to push out the mom and pop businesses in the cities and towns across the country. 
   My constituents in upstate New York have experienced this loss firsthand. I am proud to have the opportunity, as a member of the distinguished Rules Committee, to manage this rule for such an important piece of legislation for our Nation's small businesses. 
   The Small Business Lending Improvements Act will help strengthen our Nation's small businesses by updating and streamlining two of the Small Business Administration's largest financing programs, the 7(a) and 504 loan programs. 
   This bill will make the 7(a) program more affordable for both borrowers and lenders by reducing fees and increasing the SBA guarantee on 7(a) loans. It will also modernize the 504 Certified Development Company Program by improving the ability of CDCs to liquidate defaulted loans and by requiring their local community leaders be included on every CDC board of directors. And it will make permanent the Community Express Program, providing increased access to capital for socially and economically disadvantaged small business owners. 
   This bill also establishes two important new 7(a) loan programs, one to encourage private health care providers to establish practices in federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas, and one to assist our Nation's veterans in starting or expanding a small business. 
   Despite an abundance of health professionals, New York State has 102 communities designated by the Federal Government as Health Professional Shortage Areas. Only 16 percent of the physicians practicing in New York provide services in these medically underserved areas. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the district I am privileged to represent is short nearly 70 dental, primary care and mental health practitioners. Further, a handful of counties I represent don't even have a resident OB/GYN, forcing thousands of women to travel 40 to 50 miles just to seek routine care. 
   Madam Speaker, this problem is not confined to upstate New York. Over 60 million Americans currently live in medically underserved areas across the country. The Small Business Lending Improvements Act will address this critical shortage by establishing a 7(a) loan program that reduces lender and borrower fees by half and increases the government guarantee to 90 percent of the doctors and dentists serving Health Professional Shortage Areas. 
   These financial incentives are critical to encouraging private health care providers to establish practices in underserved areas and to expand access to quality health care for millions of Americans. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation will also ensure that our returning servicemen and women are afforded every opportunity to start or expand a small business by establishing a dedicated 7(a) loan program for veterans. 
   An estimated 900 of New York's Reservists currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan are self-employed, and another 100 are considered key employees within small businesses. The absence of these men and women during 12- or 15-month deployments often forces the small businesses they own to operate at greatly reduced levels, at times declining to near startup conditions by the time the owner returns. An absence due to deployment is most detrimental to the smallest towns where many Reserve and Guard members operate businesses essential to the community. 
   The Small Business Lending Improvements Act will help address the obstacles faced by small business owners deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan by eliminating borrower and lender fees and increasing to 90 percent the government guarantee for loans to veterans under the 7(a) program. 
   According to American Veterans National Commander Thomas C. McGriff, ``These lenders fees, which can amount to thousands of dollars, are due up front and can deter entrepreneurs from seeking financial assistance altogether.'' 
   Madam Speaker, by creating a lender structure tailored specifically for veterans, this bill will encourage entrepreneurship and help to repay the enormous debt we owe to our brave men and women in uniform.  
   Madam Speaker, it is our Nation's small businesses that keep our Nation's economy moving full speed ahead. Let's take this opportunity to provide further encouragement for the creation of new small businesses and for our Nation's existing small business owners to expand 
   I am proud to support this bipartisan legislation and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, people around America are talking about gas. That's all we hear. 
   There is a difference, however. The people back home in upstate New York are talking about gas because they are frustrated with the high prices. Yet other people in this country are attempting to demagog this issue and to turn it into a political issue. 
   We listen to the oil company executives say that we should drill, drill, drill. Drill our way to energy independence. Well, that's an impossibility. They say it as if we should believe what the oil company executives tell us, because, after all, they have always told us the truth in the past. That's just not the way it is. 
   In fact, if you look at the facts, you will see that there are 68 million acres available for drilling in this country that oil companies have failed and refuse to drill upon. Yet they continue to talk about drill, drill, because they don't want the alternative. They don't want to talk about conservation, and they don't want to talk about alternative energy. 
   This is useless, and it's divisive to America. We need to find solutions by working together, not pointing the finger and blaming others.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 1516 provides for the consideration of H.R. 7201, the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 and H.R. 7202, the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2008. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority members of the Committee on Ways and Means for both H.R. 7201 and H.R. 7202. 
   Mr. Speaker, allow me to cut right to the point here. We're here again to consider a rule that will allow us to debate two very critical pieces of legislation: The first, the package that invests in clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency to help create thousands of new green-collar jobs and lower energy costs for the American people; the second, a package that extends several key tax credits and deductions for small business owners and working families across this country. 
   This Congress has shown a strong commitment to the pay-as-you-go rule adopted last January. Both pieces of legislation that this rule provides consideration for are fully paid for. Let me repeat that. They are fully paid for. That means neither of these bills would add to the enormous national debt that continues to haunt us. 
   In terms of substance, the two pieces of legislation we will consider would extend and modify critical tax credits for the production of electricity for renewable sources, ranging from wind, solar and geothermal energy to closed-loop and open-loop biomass. 
   They would provide tax credits for the production of efficient home appliances. They would provide tax incentives for consumer purchases of energy-efficient products. 
   It would extend for 1 year the personal income tax deductions for tuition and education expenses, helping more middle class families send their children to college. It extends the State and local sales tax deductions. It provides our teachers with the ability to claim a credit for out-of-pocket expenses they incur when purchasing classroom supplies to better educate their children. It would extend the new standard deduction for State and local property taxes and for the child tax credit so working families would have more of their hard-earned dollars to spend where they would need it most--on their families. It would extend the research and development tax credit. 
   Last but certainly not least, it would provide a 1-year extension of the Secure Rural Schools program, which is not only important to the western Members of this body but also to my constituents who live near the Finger Lakes National Forest in Upstate New York. 
   There are tax credits and extenders that just about every Member of this body can agree on, and supporting this rule is simple common sense. We can provide tax relief and incentives to middle class families. We can spur innovation. We can create tens of thousands of new jobs, green-collar jobs. We can reduce our dependence on oil from hostile nations, and we can reduce greenhouse gases at the same time. We can do this all in a fiscally responsible way, without pushing the burden back on the shoulders of our children and of our grandchildren. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

It may very well have been. I wasn't here at that point. 
   It's just when I think about it, it's unfortunate that they forgot about that when President Bush took over the White House. Totally forgot about it. And in fact built up the largest deficits that we've ever seen in this country. 
   And they had some other priorities, and that was giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, spending the surplus that we had on tax breaks for America's richest people, and that's unfortunate.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, last week, Congress, with strong Democratic support, passed the new GI Bill, which provides all veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars the promise of a full 4-year college scholarship. The bill makes veterans a part of the American economic recovery. 
   The original GI Bill in 1944 allowed millions of families to achieve the American Dream. It also set our economy on the right course after World War II. For every dollar spent on the GI Bill, $7 were returned to the economy. A similar economic spark is needed today. You would think that the new GI Bill would gain the support of President Bush. But he opposes it. Unfortunately, the vast majority of House Republicans opposed the bill when it was on the floor last week. We must make sure that the brave men and women that we are sending off to battle have everything they need and deserve when they return home.  
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats vow to never leave a veteran behind after returning from war by ensuring that they receive the quality care and benefits they have earned. That includes living up to the promise of providing them access to quality higher education.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6049, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1212 provides for consideration of H.R. 6049, the Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means and waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule also provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule and H.R. 6049, the Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, which will not only bring this country into a new alternative energy future, but strengthen our economy by directing fiscally responsible tax relief to middle class families, creating jobs at small businesses in the very towns and rural communities where we need it the most. 
   The legislation this rule provides for consideration of will extend a number of critical tax relief measures targeted at middle class families and small businesses, including deductions for State and local sales tax, tuition education expenses, and expanding the child tax credit and research and development tax credit. 
   During these uncertain economic times, it is also absolutely critical that we pass legislation to invest in jobs for today and long-term development for tomorrow, including alternative energy like wind and biomass that will reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and bring the price of gas at the pump to a level families and businesses can afford. The best way to encourage growth and development of new technology is to let businesses invest their own money in ways that expand our economic horizons. Tax credits for alternative energy production have the power to truly jump-start our economy and create good paying, highly skilled jobs that can't be sent overseas. 
   In my upstate New York district, our location, natural resources, renowned colleges and universities and world class scientific and technological companies perfectly poise our community to seize this opportunity to create a new green economy, complete with green jobs. 
   I have spoken numerous times throughout the debate over how to extend these renewable tax credits and about the new businesses in my district that are utilizing the national investment in alternative energy to create good paying jobs in upstate New York. Those businesses are to be commended, and that is why I am proud to support nearly $20 billion in long-term clean renewable energy tax incentives and investment included in the Energy and Job Creation Act. I hope that doing so will encourage other companies to follow suit, both in our region and across this great Nation. 
   The underlying legislation extends and modifies critical tax credits for the production of electricity from renewable sources ranging from wind, solar and geothermal energy to closed-loop and open-loop biomass. It would also extend clean renewable energy bonds, efficient commercial building tax incentives, investment tax credit for solar and fuel cell systems, tax credit for energy efficiency upgrades to existing homes, tax credits for production of efficient home appliances and tax incentives for consumer purchases of energy efficient products. Most of these incentives either expired at the end of last year or are set to expire at the end of this year. It is vitally important to sustaining the development of clean energy technology industries that these incentives are extended. 
   H.R. 6049 also includes an extension of the research and development tax credit that allows companies a tax credit for a portion of their research and development expenditures. Extending the R&D credit is vital to ensuring that America remains on the cutting edge of innovation that keeps our companies competitive and working here, not offshore. This credit is of particular interest to the area that I represent because its extension will further the expansion of the microchip fabrication and nanotechnology industries which are beginning to blossom in our region. 
   American companies rely on this credit and upon its continuity to adequately plan their long-term research projects. I support this 1-year extension to provide that continuity and I will continue to work with leaders on the committee and in this body to seek a permanent extension that would eliminate concerns over expirations and lapses. 
   The bill also extends important tax credits for individuals, as well as creating new and expanded credits. It extends for 1 year the personal income tax deductions for tuition and education expenses, the State and local sales taxes, and teachers' out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies. The bill creates a new standard deduction for up to $700 for couples to cover State and local property taxes, and expands the eligibility for the refundable child tax credit. Under the child tax credit, certain low-income taxpayers can claim a refundable tax credit equal to 15 percent of their earned income above an inflation-adjusted threshold. In 2008, this threshold is set to be $12,050, but under H.R. 6049 that threshold will be reduced to $8,500, providing increased  relief to more than 12 million families with children nationwide. 
   Supporting H.R. 6049 comes down to simple common sense. We can create tens of thousands of new jobs, reduce our dependence on oil from hostile regimes, reduce greenhouse gases, spur innovation and provide tax relief to middle class families, and we can do it all--and let me emphasize this--all of those things, without adding to the national deficit. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to make one point. Some people in this institution tend to talk about trial lawyers and seem to want to point out the things that they do that they think aren't good. But no one talks about the fact that trial lawyers are out there representing people who have been injured. They are protecting people's civil rights. They are defending people on a contingency fee basis who don't have the money to come forward and sue people that have hurt them. That is critically important. And this bill does not give a windfall tax rebate to lawyers. All it does is allow them to claim expenditures that they have put out in the year that they have made that expenditure, no different than any other business in this country can do. 
   So I think it is unfair to criticize trial attorneys who are out there doing the kind of things that people hire them to do; and that is protecting people's civil rights and ensuring that people who are injured are able to get what they need so that they are not victimized even further. 
   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California, my friend and colleague from the Rules Committee, Ms. Matsui.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague and friend from Washington. It's always a pleasure managing a rule on the floor with you. 
   I would like to thank him for making a point which I think is a very good point in his closing, and that is we can't drill our way to oil independence. I think that is abundantly clear, especially to Americans. I think they know that. 
   The fact of the matter is, is that oil is a finite resource. That as much as we want to dream and that as much as we want to wish, it is a finite resource. And while there may be reserves that may last us 5 years or 10 years, the fact of the matter is if we don't deal with the fact that it is a finite resource, then our children and our grandchildren will have to deal with the fact that there is no more oil left. 
   That's what today's bill does. That's what this rule does. It attempts to take real steps to promote alternative energy because that is the future of our children and our grandchildren. 
   H.R. 6049, if it passes the House today, it will be the fourth time the House has voted to extend many of these energy tax provisions. In each of the previous three times, the legislation has come under heavy fire because of the revenue-raising provisions that were included to ensure that the extensions were compliant with House pay-as-you-go rules. That is the new Democratic majority's commitment to lowering the national debt by bringing fiscal responsibility back to the House of Representatives. 
   The debate has not fallen on deaf ears. I applaud the Ways and Means Committee and Chairman Rangel for its tireless commitment to finding less controversial means for paying for this vital tax relief and alternative energy development incentives. Their efforts have been successful judging by the list of organizations and businesses that are supporting H.R. 6049, including the League of Conservation Voters, the National Retail Federation, the National Wildlife Federation, Dow Chemical Company, The Sierra Club, The American Farm Bureau, and the list goes on and on. 
   Providing tax relief to middle class families and small businesses, providing incentives to promote alternative energy development, and adhering to fiscal responsibility should never, never be a partisan issue. 
   Too often in this Chamber we hear countless reasons why not to do something, but the fact of the matter is, we cannot afford to allow the vital tax relief and renewable energy incentives in H.R. 6049 to fall victim to Washington politics. 
   Just to set the record straight, by voting ``yes'' on the previous question and voting ``yes'' on the rule and bringing this legislation to the floor, it will allow 11 million families to deduct State and local sales taxes; it will allow 3 1/2 million teachers to deduct classroom expenses so they can better educate the children they teach; it will allow 4 million families the ability to deduct education expenses and help put their children through college; it will allow 13 million families to claim the child tax credit and make it a little easier to put food on their table; and it will allow 27,000 domestic businesses to remain competitive in the global marketplace by investing in vital research and development. 
   Clearly we in the majority are working to advance the interests of the American people. I am hopeful we can come together later today, Republicans and Democrats, pass this rule, pass the underlying legislation, and move our country forward. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (CONGRATULATING THE HAMILTON COLLEGE CONTINENTALS ON WINNING THE NCAA DIVISION III WOMEN'S LACROSSE CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1259, to congratulate the Hamilton College Lady Continentals on their NCAA Division III women's lacrosse championship. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today and represent such a talented group of athletes in New York's 24th Congressional District. The Hamilton Continentals this year completed the best season in the college's 29-year women's lacrosse history, and are the first team at the college to ever reach the national semifinals in any NCAA championship. 
   This truly phenomenal team has demonstrated passion and commitment to their sport, racking up an impressive 21-1 record this year and creating the longest winning streak in Division III women's lacrosse. This group of 20 athletes knows the true meaning of teamwork, while also proving that they are each formidable opponents on the field through their impressive individual records. 
   Ten Hamilton players have garnered an amazing total of 11 All-America awards throughout their college careers. This year alone, four Continentals won All-America awards this year, six players were selected to the all-region team, and nine players were selected to the all-league team. 
   Hamilton College, located in Clinton, NY, is a nationally-recognized liberal arts college that consistently ranks in the top 20 liberal arts institutions across the Nation. The college receives applications from around the country and around the world, contributing to a student body with diverse interests and talents with a great potential for achievement and innovation. Given the college's commitment and the dedication of their students, there is no doubt that it will continue its centuries-long tradition of excellence in scholastics and, now, athletics. 
   The accomplishments of the Hamilton Lady Continentals cannot be applauded without commending the efforts of their coaching staff. Head Coach Patty Kloidt, and assistants Amanda Nobis and Mackay Rippey, have guided the Lady Continentals to victory this year. This nurturing and inspiring coaching team was named the 2008 Liberty League Coaching Staff of the Year, and Head Coach Patty Kloidt was recently named 2008 NCAA Division III Coach of the Year by the Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches Association. On behalf of my colleagues in Washington and in my district, I wish to congratulate this team on their success and recognition. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to support this resolution congratulating the Hamilton College Lady Continentals women's lacrosse team, and to support them in their future endeavors as they continue to inspire athletes across the country.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act, would address an important issue surrounding our Nation's efforts to expand electric power to major urban areas, and that is, of course, the safety issue. 
   On the morning of March 12, 2007, a CSX freight train derailed approximately 34 cars near Oneida, New York. Reports indicate there was an evacuation covering a 1-mile radius. Luckily, there were no reported deaths or injuries. However, a large fire occurred at the scene, and residents and emergency responders reported hearing secondary explosions. CSX provided information that there were 40 tank cars carrying liquid petroleum gas in the train. What's more, the derailment closed the New York State Thruway for several hours, requiring traffic to be detoured miles out of the way. 
   Prior to this incident, there were 18 train derailments in western New York between January, 2005, and September, 2006, which further suggests the condition of New York State's freight railways are in need of serious attention and repair. 
   While this concern continues to trouble the people of New York, a private company is seeking to build a 190-mile high-voltage direct current transmission line from the town of Marcy in Oneida County, located in my district, to the town of New Windsor in Orange County in Mr. John Hall's district. 
   The company estimates that more than 90 percent of the proposed primary and alternative routes will follow existing rights-of-way, both along railroad tracks and natural gas lines. The transmission line would consist of 135-foot-tall towers and be operated with a rated power flow of 1,200 megawatts. A portion of the proposed route follows the New York Susquehanna & Western Railway right-of-way, which would run through some of the more heavily populated cities and towns in upstate New York. This is a situation where the consequences and risk are not only unknown but wholly unnecessary.     
   For these reasons, my amendment to H.R. 1401 would require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation, to conduct an assessment of the safety and security vulnerabilities of placing high voltage direct current electric transmission lines along active railroad rights-of-way. 
   The assessment shall, at a minimum, evaluate the risks to local inhabitants and consumers of electric power transmitted by those lines, associated with a train collision or derailment that damages such electric transmission lines. 
   It is no secret that as our cities continue to grow they will need more energy, and I fully support addressing that need; but meeting that need must be done in a safe and a responsible way. 
   To this end, my amendment simply requires the Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation to take a hard look at our existing rail infrastructure and assess the security vulnerabilities so that we can avoid further electric power interruptions and preserve the safety of our constituents. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, so the record is clear, as the distinguished chairman of the Military Construction VA subcommittee, Mr. Edwards, so eloquently stated many times right here on the floor of this House, there is a clear difference between the new Democratic majority's approach to veterans and the previous Republican leadership approach. 
   The difference is that under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and the new Democratic majority, supporting veterans is one of the highest priorities of this Congress. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim that we are leaving veterans out in the cold. As elected Federal representatives, we are accountable for not only our words but our actions as well. What the other side won't tell you is that we had passed a continuing resolution in the beginning months of this Congress because the previous Congress failed to ever pass the MilCon-VA appropriations bill last year. They also won't tell you that the continuing resolution included an increase of $3.4 billion for veterans health care. The other side doesn't want to talk about the emergency supplemental spending bill we passed a few months ago which included an additional $1.8 billion for veterans discretionary spending. I am no mathematician, but $3.4 billion and $1.8 billion add up to $5.2 billion, which is larger than any increase in veterans spending passed by the previous Republican leadership. 
   I admit I am a new Member, but I can still look back at the record to see that the last time the previous Republican leadership passed the Veterans appropriation bill on time was 1996. It sounds to me like the other side of the aisle is suffering from a case of selective memory. 
   The new Democratic majority has not forgotten about our veterans. We have already passed legislation which has been signed into law that will provide an additional $5.2 billion for our veterans. Mr. Speaker, the numbers speak for themselves. The new Democratic majority has and will continue to provide for our Nation's veterans. 
   Back to the issue, we are facing a national crisis with hundreds of thousands of families losing their homes and an expected 2 million more over the next 2 years. The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act provides long-overdue and much-needed protection to those families. 
   As I said earlier, every American deserves the opportunity to achieve the American Dream of home ownership. It is because of the leadership and bipartisanship of Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus that I am proud to stand here today as we make meaningful, commonsense steps to help more American families achieve that dream. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

Since taking control of Congress, we have provided real support for our veterans by passing the largest veterans funding increase in history. 
   But don't take my word for it, listen to what veterans organizations are saying about our historic veterans funding bills. The American Legion called it ``an impressive commitment to this Nation's servicemembers, veterans and their families.'' 
   The Veterans of Foreign Wars said: ``The record funding level acknowledges the deep debt this Nation owes to its defenders and that the care and services provided to them is the ongoing cost of war.'' 
   The AMVETS wrote: ``Overall, AMVETS believe these funding levels will ensure VA will be able to serve America's veterans and their families with dignity and compassion.'' 
   Madam Speaker, for most of the year President Bush opposed the investment in America's veterans. This legislation simply would not have been possible without a Democratic Congress and their commitment to our veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 704 provides for consideration of H.R. 3246, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 
   I rise today in strong support of this rule and H.R. 3246. I want to thank the distinguished chairwoman of the Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management Subcommittee, Ms. Norton, Chairman Oberstar, and the ranking members, for drafting this legislation to authorize three new economic development commissions. 
   H.R. 3246 establishes the Northern Border, Southeast Crescent and Southwest Border Regional Commissions and reauthorizes the successful Delta and Northern Great Plains Regional Commissions. These five commissions will  help bring economic development to regions of our country that desperately need it. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation creates a Northern Border Regional Commission that will bring much-needed job creation and economic development resources to the Northeast region. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and upstate New York will all benefit tremendously from the establishment of this commission because it will assess and address the very specific needs, assets and challenges of this region. 
   Over the last several decades, upstate New York, including my congressional district, has experienced a consistent pattern of economic distress resulting from substantial loss in the manufacturing sector, coupled with an aging infrastructure and lack of opportunities for a skilled workforce. My district alone has seen a staggering loss of more than 14,000 manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2005. This has been devastating to our local communities; however, this loss isn't an anomaly. It is extremely characteristic of several States in the Northeast. A targeted regional approach like this one created by this bill can help bring economic vitality to this region. 
   The three new commissions are modeled after the highly successful Appalachian Regional Commission, ARC. The commission similar to the ARC will create Federal-State partnerships where local development districts and other nonprofits bring project ideas and priorities from the local level to the commissions to promote economic development. 
   Specifically, the Northern Border Regional Commission will be charged with investing $40 million per year, rising to $60 million per year by 2012, in Federal grants focused on local transportation and infrastructure projects, broadband development, alternative energy projects, agricultural development, and health care facilities. With regional planning, technical assistance, and funding of projects aimed at encouraging economic prosperity, this Commission will help local communities work together to support common developmental goals. 
   Simply put, the numbers speak for themselves. Since its creation, the ARC has reduced the number of distressed counties in its region from 219 to 100, cut the poverty rate from 31 percent to 15 percent, and has helped 1,400 businesses create 26,000 new jobs. In fiscal year 2005, each dollar of the ARC funding leveraged $2.57 in other public funding and $8.46 in private funding. 
   Speaking from personal experience, six counties in my upstate New York district have experienced similar success being a part of the ARC. The Village of Sherburne in Chenango County is a great example of how small ARC grants are extremely helpful in leveraging funds from State, local and private sources for economic development initiatives that create jobs. A $200,000 ARC grant to improve aging water infrastructure in Sherburne, New York, a problem that is plaguing many States in the Northeast, was able to leverage close to $4 million in State and local community investment. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Northern Border Regional Commission will not only extend benefits to economically distressed counties in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont; it will give upstate New York counties like Oneida, Herkimer, Cayuga and Seneca the opportunity to enjoy the same benefits their neighboring counties in the southern tier enjoy under the ARC. 
   We need to ensure that every American has access to job training, employment-related education and high-tech infrastructure so that we can retain and grow our global competitive edge. I am confident that the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act will help us achieve that end. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman. With all due respect, I couldn't disagree more. While some of my colleagues on the other side continue to criticize our new earmark rule, the fact of the matter is that the House Democratic majority has implemented the most honest and open earmark rule in the history of the United States House of Representatives. But don't take my word for it. In this week's CQ Weekly, Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense is quoted as saying: ``The House has given us more information than we have ever had before on earmarks, and they deserve credit for that.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the other side continues to talk about their plan to modify the earmark rule, but what they don't tell you is that their earmark rule would not cover any measure not already covered by the earmark rule presently in effect. It is important to remember which side actually abused the earmark process, and who actually stepped up to the plate to reform the system and provide transparency. We didn't wait until 2 months before the election; we responded to the people's call for more openness on the first day of this Congress. 
   It seems quite clear to me that the minority is more concerned with obstructionism, while we are focused on actually meeting the needs of our constituents. That is exactly what this bill does and what the underlying rule does.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. If I may reclaim my time, the bill today is covered by it. As I say, this bill is about helping Americans. This is about putting Americans back to work and about putting money back into the development of infrastructure, into financing hospitals, and doing the kind of things that I was sent to Congress to do today. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, passage of this bipartisan legislation, which this rule provides consideration of, is a critical step toward helping some of our neediest communities achieve economic parity with the rest of the country. The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act authorizes the creation of five regional economic development commissions under a common framework of administration and management. These commissions are designed to address problems of systematic underdevelopment in their respective regions. 
   In general, the five commissions authorized in this bill will utilize the successful Appalachian Regional Commission model, which facilitates a bottom-up approach. Local development districts, nonprofit organizations, and others bring projects and ideas to the commission from the local level, ensuring that the actions of the commission reflect local and regional economic development needs and goals. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned a short while ago, the Northern Border Regional Commission created by this legislation builds on the success of the ARC. It would be charged with investing $40 million each year in Federal resources for economic development and job creation in the most economically distressed border areas of Maine, New York, New Hampshire, and Vermont. This commission will help fund projects that both strengthen traditional sectors in the region's economy and help to diversify it. The Northern Border Regional Commission is focused on helping areas in the Northeast that have higher levels of unemployment, a significant loss of population, and significantly low household incomes. 
   This legislation is yet another example of true bipartisan cooperation often seen on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on the previous question and the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my concern about a dangerous precedent and irresponsible wrongdoing in this administration. 
   Recent media reports have revealed that the Office of the Vice President exempted itself from a presidential Executive Order created to protect national security information. Since 2003, the Vice President's office has refused to properly report whether they possess certain classified information and went so far as to block inspection of their office to find out. The Vice President justified the step by saying that his office was not part of the executive branch of government. 
   I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that the rest of the executive branch complied with the order and properly reported their handling of critical classified information. 
   Mr. Speaker, I raise two serious objections to this practice. First, mishandling of classified data poses a grave and serious risk to our country and one should not take that lightly. And, second, as a former district attorney, I believe that no one is above the law. Rule of law must apply to everyone equally. How do we expect to enforce the law in localities when it is broken and held in ill regard at the highest levels of government? We must hold this administration, like all other Americans, accountable for their actions.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, later today the House will have an opportunity to vote on a strong new FISA bill that has been negotiated over the last couple of weeks. 
   The new legislation will modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. First, it rejects the President's plan to provide blanket immunity to telecom companies who turned over information about their customers. Instead, it gives the Federal court the exclusive opportunity to hear clear classified evidence in order to make a determination whether telecom companies should be held liable for their actions. 
   Our legislation also requires a special bipartisan commission to investigate the Bush administration's use of wiretaps and other surveillance programs. The commission would be similar to the bipartisan 9/11 Commission that played a critical role in reviewing the events leading up to 9/11 and developing recommendations on how to best protect our Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, House Democrats are hopeful that Republicans will join us in supporting a FISA bill that protects our Nation and our civil liberties.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, today American families are paying the price for 7 years of failed economic policies  by this administration. This year alone, our economy has lost more than 300,000 jobs. It's important to remember that in order to just keep up with the population growth, our economy must create at least 150,000 jobs per month. 
   These statistics are devastating to millions of unemployed Americans who are increasingly competing against each other for the very few jobs that have become available. Yet President Bush continues to sit on the sidelines hoping that the economic situation will correct itself without additional governmental intervention. 
   The Democratic House believes the government must act, and it must act now. That's why we passed legislation last month that would extend unemployment insurance to workers who have exhausted their benefits. We also plan to move a second economic stimulus package that should help create jobs. I hope both President Bush and congressional Republicans would finally realize that this is the right thing to do.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6003, PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown, and Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for their bipartisan leadership on the Amtrak legislation we will consider today, and as they showed yesterday in the Rules Committee, for their passionate advocacy on behalf of this great bill. 
   There has been much discussion about the condition of our Nation's transportation system and the growing pressures it faces from all sides: skyrocketing costs of fuel and maintenance; increased congestion from growing demand; and global climate change. 
   H.R. 6003 will take tremendous strides toward addressing these pressures by continuing our commitment to Amtrak and passenger rail service. Maintenance costs will continue to hinder us, but expanding and improving passenger rail service has the potential to relieve congestion both on our highways and in the skies by offering passengers a viable alternative. A shift toward rail can reduce the harmful CO  
   2 emissions generated by the transportation system. 
   For too long Amtrak has been the symbol of partisan politics in Washington. If we are to have a robust and successful system that users can rely on, then we must make a bipartisan commitment to supporting Amtrak. We cannot waiver on this commitment and expect to keep pace with the national rail systems of other developed countries around the world. 
   Partisan bickering has hurt Amtrak's overall state of repair. In fact, the Department of Transportation's inspector general concluded that, ``Despite multiple efforts over the years to change Amtrak's structure and funding, we have a system that limps along, is never in a state of good repair, awash in debt, and perpetually on the edge of collapse.'' That must change. 
   Amtrak's maintenance backlog is a major impediment to its success. In recent years, Amtrak's ridership has grown at a modest but continuing rate, and Amtrak's on-time performance has declined down to an on-time arrival rate of 67.8 percent. 
   The Department of Transportation's inspector general has stated that Amtrak's continued deferral of maintenance increases the risk of a major failure on its system. Currently, Amtrak has an estimated $6 billion in backlogged capital maintenance needs, including $4 billion on the Northeast Corridor, its most profitable line. 
   I would gladly take the train home to my Upstate New York district, or from my home in Utica to New York City, but currently that is not a viable option because of the minimal Amtrak service. And even when there is service available, it is unreliable. Deferred track maintenance, especially in Upstate New York, has required lowering the speed limits on significant portions of the track. In addition, competition with freight carriers for priority on tracks causes Amtrak trains to become seriously delayed, to the point where train schedules are simply unreliable. The on-time arrival rate between Albany and Buffalo is a mere 42 percent, meaning that less than half of the trains arrive on time.     
   Unfortunately, for hardworking Americans, passenger rail is the only option for travel because of record high fuel prices, making air and car travel less viable.

   The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act will aggressively address these concerns. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this rule and the underlying bill and continue to support the viable passenger rail option in our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my friend from Arkansas for yielding, and I would like to thank you for what you do for the Blue Dog Caucus. 
   You know, the thing that first attracted me to the Blue Dog Caucus was the fact that they believe so strongly in fiscal responsibility in the pay-as-you-go idea, and the fact that we have to tighten our belt, we have to make some very difficult decisions. It's not easy when there are things that we need for our district and things that we know we need here domestically, and yet we can't spend more than we have. And it's no different than we would in our own home. You don't buy things that we can't afford. We can't enact legislation, we can't create bureaucracies that we can't pay for. And that's why I'm so proud to be a member of the Blue Dog Caucus. 
   I did just return from Iraq just a few days ago. And I couldn't help, while I was there, noticing immediately the amount of money that we have spent in Iraq. You know, when you look at the fact that you ride along and you see that we have literally created, built whole cities in the middle of the desert, in the middle of this expansive environment we have actually created cities and the amount of money, the amount of cement, the amount of wood that we've used to build these bases and the amount of material that we have there. I can remember that in one of the bases we pulled up to one area, it was huge, and there was nothing but electric transformers in a huge field; and those were transformers that they were using to put new electric and bring new power to different places in Iraq. And then we drove a little further and there was another area with nothing but Humvees and another area with nothing but bulldozers. And you can't help but realize just how much money and how much time and expense we're expending to rebuild Iraq. 
   And during the course of our conversation while we were there, we were talking about some of the things to one of the members of the military, one of the things that they needed there. And I couldn't help but think back in my district in upstate New York, back in Utica, there are things that we need that we don't have. We need improvements to our airport that we don't have. We need improvements to our roads. And much like your district in Arkansas, we have been waiting for a connection between Utica and the city of Binghamton, a Route 12 extension. We've been waiting for years and years, since before I was born, for that; and still we talk about it. And yet we spend billions of dollars. You quoted the figure $16 million an hour we are spending in Iraq. We continue to spend it, and we've been doing it for years and years. 
   And while we continue to spend that money, we continue to spend resources that are critical to us while countries like China are continuing to invest  their money in their own economy, in creating jobs within their country. We need to be spending our money to create jobs in our country. 
   And, you know, while I was in Iraq, the one thing 
   that I was struck by probably more than anything else is the incredible job that our troops are doing. Anybody that you talk to that's been to Iraq, the first thing they talk about is the incredible job that our troops are doing. And I couldn't help but think that any just cause anywhere in the world that we ask our troops to perform and complete, I have utter confidence that they can do it. Our military is just an incredible organization. They do what is asked of them and much, much more. And they have done the same in Iraq. And I think that it's time that we give them more direction in terms of a mission and that we start to give the Iraqi people a little more ability to stand on their own. I think when we start to bring our troops home, when we start to allow them to stand up and handle their own affairs, they will do it, and they will do it in a good way and in a fine way and we will be there to help them. 
   But, you know, there was a book written about 2,500 years ago by the Chinese general Sun Tzu, and it was called ``The Art of War.'' And in that he writes an interesting paragraph and he says that in any extended confrontation, regardless of how wise a nation's counselors are, no country can win in a prolonged war. 
   This war has been prolonged far too long. It is time, I believe, for us to focus upon what is important here domestically, that we stop focusing on spending so much money in Iraq and we begin to focus again on the things that are happening here in this country. So I believe that it's time that we allow the country of Iraq to stand up for itself, and that we begin to bring our troops home. 
   I thank you, and I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, traveling across my district, there is one thing I hear about again and again, and that is gas prices. Whether it is at the grocery store or at the gas pumps, Americans are feeling the crunch. Skyrocketing gas prices are hitting hardworking families across my upstate New York district and across the country. 
   Today, we will take one more step to bring down gas prices by cracking down on price gouging by big oil companies. The Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act would provide relief for consumers by giving the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate and punish companies that artificially inflate the price of energy. 
   The largest oil companies have seen record profits and record paychecks for their CEOs, while middle-class families struggle just to fill up their tank. It is time to hold them accountable. 
   Under this bill, the Justice Department could impose criminal penalties of up to $150 million on corporations and jail sentences of up to 10 years to crack down on wholesale and retail companies charging unconscionable and excessive prices. Penalties from price gougers would go to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, to help families with heating and air conditioning bills. Already this Congress has fought to increase domestic oil supply and hold OPEC and speculators accountable for price manipulations.     
   We have invested in new alternative energy sources that will decrease our dependency on finite fossil fuels and create good-paying jobs in places like Upstate New York. 
   Mr. Speaker, we owe it to our constituents and to our children and grandchildren to do everything we can to bring down outrageous gas prices, put our economy back on track and make sure that this country is on a new path to energy independence and success.

They don't really have a lot of interest in pointing fingers; they just want us to act in a bipartisan fashion to bring these record prices down. But of course that hasn't stopped the oil company executives from pointing fingers, and of course that is what they do. That is all they can do. Anything but let the American people see where the real fault is, with the oil companies. 
   Last month, nonetheless, Congress acted in a strong bipartisan fashion to pressure the administration to temporarily suspend the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which experts agree will help drive down gasoline prices. This bipartisan House also overrode the Presidential veto on the new farm bill that makes an historic commitment to more affordable home-grown American biofuel and increased the oversight of commodity futures in order to detect and prevent market manipulation of energy prices. 
   Mr. Speaker, as this House prepares to debate more energy legislation this week, I hope we can work together to provide some relief at the pump.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, we have heard so much today from the other side about the fear that they have that this provision will somehow put Americans at risk.

   I think it was Benjamin Franklin who once said that any country who gives up its liberty for its security deserves neither and will end up losing both. And I think clearly this bill takes that into consideration. 
   This bill clearly provides for security for our country. It clearly provides our Intelligence Community with the ability to obtain information that it needs and use that and analyze it in a way that keeps America safe to prevent another 9/11 activity. 
   At the same time, this bill also protects Americans' rights and gives us the ability to prevent wiretapping of Americans here in this country. 
   We're not talking about foreign-to-foreign. They can do that. They have done that in the past, and they will continue to do that. This clearly deals with protecting Americans.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague and friend from Vermont for yielding time to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I would just like to respond to something that my colleague from Texas said just a few moments ago with respect to good ideas in the Rules Committee. I happen to agree with him. I think that the proposal was a very good idea, and it is something that certainly I would think very strongly about supporting. However, I voted against it because I felt that there were questions of both germaneness and also I felt that by not going through the committee process, it would somehow make it less likely that that bill would pass, and that was the reason that I voted against it. It had absolutely nothing to do with a partisan issue, but more because I feel it is a good idea and it would stand a better chance of passage by working through the committee process. So I think it is important that we point out here that the Rules Committee is, in fact, a committee that recognizes good ideas and supports good ideas; and simply because we disagree about issues does not mean we do not support good ideas on our side of the aisle. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of an open rule on this bill, and  I am pleased that my colleagues on the Rules Committee, including those on the other side of the aisle, voted unanimously to approve this rule. That level of support speaks volumes about the importance of bringing the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure bill to the floor of this Chamber for consideration. 
   During Science Committee Chairman Gordon's remarks before the Rules Committee yesterday, he pointed out an issue that requires our utmost attention if we as a Nation ever hope to truly address our Nation's addiction to oil. The issue is that cellulosic ethanol and other biofuels are highly corrosive and not compatible with the fuel distribution infrastructure currently in place to transport them in our country. 
   Biofuels are the wave of the future. Continued domestic production and use of biofuels will reduce air emissions, diversify our energy supply, and decrease our dependence on foreign oil. A classic trifecta, if you will. 
   Unfortunately, this transportation barrier imposes increased cost burdens and could slow the transition we hope to make away from fossil fuels. The Advanced Fuels Infrastructure bill takes a giant first step in the right direction to address the biofuel infrastructure problem by tasking the Environmental Protection Agency to develop additives, blendstocks, technologies, and other methods to make biofuels less corrosive. 
   Members of my staff joke that I am hooked on talking about cellulosic ethanol. I am more than hooked. I think I would say I am addicted. No pun intended. But the truth be known, I would rather be addicted to some type of energy that is produced domestically rather than a foreign or fossil fuel that is produced somewhere else other than in this country. And so are many of my colleagues in this Chamber. Like me, they understand the substantial benefits that biofuels like ethanol will provide for our Nation's growing energy demand. 
   We in Congress and our counterparts at the State level also realize the role which government has to play in developing cost-effective methods of producing these fuels. Last December my home State of New York awarded $14.8 million to build and operate a cellulosic biomass-to-ethanol demonstration plant in Rochester, New York. A professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, was recently awarded a $10 million grant to upgrade Cornell's industrial biotechnology laboratories and improve researchers' abilities to liberate sugars from woody biomass and convert them into biofuels. In addition, the Biorefinery in New York Project is about to embark upon a $20.6 million public-private partnership to demonstrate commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol production in Lyonsdale, New York. Half of that $20.6 million is private investment from a Texas-based energy company that will be pumped directly into the New York State economy. For too long New York State has been exporting money out of state to meet our energy needs. Now we are importing those dollars back. 
   The President's fiscal year 2008 budget request includes many misdirected funding cuts; however, it does include a $292 million grant for research and development programs to promote biofuels, most notably the wide-scale production of cellulosic ethanol. This figure is more than double the fiscal year 2006 appropriation of $119 million. Cellulosic ethanol plants are starting to pop up all across Upstate New York and the rest of the Nation thanks to top-notch researchers. 
   I stand here today very proud to support this open rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Although it has been a couple of years since I was 30-something, I appreciate your yielding me some time. 
   Thank you for being here tonight and for talking about some reasonable positions that we're taking with respect to energy in this country. It's sad. I've been here for the past couple of hours, listening to my colleagues and to my friends from the other side of the aisle who were talking about their perception of what Congress is doing. It's sad because it's a real revisionist sort of perception because they see it from a perspective that, frankly, just isn't the case. 
   When they say that nothing is being done, frankly, I don't know what they're talking about or what they're seeing, because there are a number of things being done. They may not be the things that they would like to see done, but clearly, a number of steps have been taken, and I think they are steps that are practical and smart and wise. 
   One of the things that troubles me is that the only thing we hear from the other side of the aisle is drill, drill, drill. All they ever talk about is drill, and that presumes that we are going to be drilling for oil and that we are going to be reliant upon oil. You know, that's what put us in the situation we're in now--the reliance upon a finite resource that is not going to last forever. They want to continue to drill, and it's important. 
   I was just reading an article, and it talks about how important it is to drill. I support drilling. I think we should drill. There are 68 million acres that are available to drill on, and we should be drilling on them. We should be drilling in Alaska on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That's why they call it the ``petroleum reserve,'' because there's petroleum there. We can be drilling there. We should be drilling there. The oil companies can do it. Why aren't they doing it? Well, if their companies are making the biggest profits in the history of their business, why would they do anything differently? 
   That's why we have backed legislation that says ``use it or lose it.'' It's the same thing that we do for the coal companies. If they have reserves, if they have leases on the properties, they should very well be drilling on them. 
   You know, recently, I spoke to a group of teenagers, high school students, in an organization called Boys State, in New York State. There were about 600 young boys, and I was speaking to them, and I was talking to them about how important it will be in the future for energy policy to be focused on not just finite resources but on the future. 
   It's interesting because, when you talk to young people about the future, when you talk to young people about renewables, when you talk to young people about geothermal, about wind power, about solar power, and about cellulosic ethanol, they get it. It occurred to me that our generation got it back in the '70s. When everybody was talking about the energy crisis back in the '70s, we got it. We understood exactly what needed to be done. Only it wasn't done, and the last generation passed the problem on to us. Now it is our responsibility to do something, not to pass it on, not to just drill, drill, drill, drill, and then in 10 years or in 15 years have our children and our grandchildren have to deal with the very same problems that we're dealing with today.  
   We need to have a responsible, reasonable energy policy. That's the difference between what our side of the aisle is developing and what the other side of the aisle is developing. They're not developing an energy policy. Drill, drill, drill is not an energy policy. You cannot drill your way to energy independence. All you can do is become more dependent. 
   I'm a former D.A., and it's a lot like being addicted to drugs. When you see drug dealers, people who are addicted to drugs, all they want are more and more drugs. We can not be addicted to oil. We can't just constantly look for more and more oil. That is part of the solution, but it is only a part of the solution. 
   It's also the renewables. It's natural gas. It's geothermal. It is cellulosic ethanol. It's biofuels. That is the future. That is what our country should be looking at. That's real energy policy. That's the futuristic kind of energy policy that I want to pass on to my children so that my children don't have to be saddled with the same problems that our generation is saddled with. Those are the kinds of things that we should be doing, as any good parent would do. 
   I heard my colleagues a little earlier talking about natural gas reserves. I'm fortunate to represent an area in Upstate New York that actually has one of the largest shale deposits of natural gas, the Marcellus Shale Deposit, which extends from northern Pennsylvania into southern New York and into eastern Ohio. 
   There, the Federal Government doesn't control or own any of that land. That's privately owned by farmers, by individuals, and we're starting to see some oil companies leasing small amounts of that property. Well, there's no governmental regulation here. There's no difficulty in terms of getting leases. If the energy companies want to come out and get the leases, they can do it. It is available to them. So, when we hear these arguments that Congress is putting some kinds of limitations on the ability of energy companies to drill, that just isn't the case. That isn't factual. 
   What we need to develop in this country is a real long-term energy policy that deals not only with the short term but with the middle term and with the long term. There are a couple of other points that I think are very important that I would just like to touch on. 
   Recently, we passed a piece of legislation that required the President to stop buying into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That was critically important. Additionally, we need to do a little more. Perhaps we need to have the President release some of the petroleum that is in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.     
   You know, it's there for a reason. It's there for an emergency. I would say there is an emergency that we're in today. And perhaps that's the kind of thing that the President should be looking at now. 
   Additionally, in Congress we've taken some intermediate steps like we reappropriated the Amtrak bill. That's critical. We've passed legislation that provides for rural mass transit. In a time when energy prices are high, people are going to rely more upon mass transit. 
   That is the kind of strategy that we need, a full-scale energy strategy that deals not just with drilling, that deals not just with nuclear, that deals not just with renewables, but across the board. 
   So I think that is clearly what the Democratic majority is working towards. It's working towards trying to move America off our addiction to finite resources like gas and oil and move it into something that makes more sense for our future, for our children, and for our grandchildren. 
   I would like to thank the gentleman very much for yielding the time to me.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arkansas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to this administration's call for 21,000 new troops in the surge in Iraq. As one of three New Yorkers in the Blue Dog Coalition, I am very proud of the position that the Blue Dog Coalition takes with respect to identifying issues of fiscal responsibility. They have done that very thing with the war. 
   There are many, many reasons why we shouldn't be involved in the war in Iraq, and the Blue Dogs have pointed out one additional reason for that in terms of the cost that this war has and the way it has burdened our country. 
   When I talk to people in my district, they always ask me, why are we spending so much money on the war, when we have such great needs for education or for health care or for housing? Those are all issues that people are very concerned about; yet we continue to spend billions and billions of dollars on a very unpopular war. 
   My other concern with respect to this war and this operation in Iraq is the fact that our Army is an army that is a volunteer army, which means that in order for us to continue to defend our country and to get the numbers that we need in the Armed Forces, we need to have high numbers of volunteers. Yet with this protracted engagement that we are involved in now in Iraq, it continues to lower morale and makes it more and more difficult to attract troops and to attract recruits to our military. 
   I am very humbled when I hear my colleague PATRICK MURPHY, a real patriot, a veteran of Iraq, get up here and speak and talk from his heart about the things that he experienced while he was in Iraq. It concerns me, because I believe that this war and this engagement in Iraq is doing more to hurt the morale of our military than any other operation that we have seen in recent history. It concerns me because I hear different anecdotal stories from people in my district. There is one I would like to share with you. 
   Mr. Speaker, a constituent of mine who was a very patriotic young man enlisted in the armed services and actually did three tours of duty. He did one in Afghanistan and two in Iraq. He was wounded and received the Purple Heart and received a Bronze Star. 
   After his last tour in Iraq, he was ready to leave the military. He talked to his people in his outfit, and they asked him if he would stay and help to train troops in a non-deployment type of position stateside. Being the patriotic person that he is, he agreed to do that. 
   The problem for him was that because of the buildup and because of the steps that are being taken now, he was  told that he would no longer be able to continue in a nondeployment type of position, but would rather have to go into a third tour of duty in Iraq. It put a huge strain on him. It put a huge strain on his family. 
   These are the kinds of concerns that we have when it comes to the morale and when it comes to the future of our military.     
   And speaking from myself, I would just like to say that I believe that this type of action and this type of activity puts a huge strain on our military. 
   I strongly support the efforts of the Blue Dog Coalition because I believe that they point out the things that we need to do as a country. We are talking about a resolution that will create a Truman type of committee that will help to oversee efforts and oversee different actions which are taking place by different contractors in Iraq. So I am very pleased to be here today to talk on behalf of the Blue Dog Coalition.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to just respond to my colleague from California saying that we can't win the war on 2-month funding intervals. I would submit we have now been at this Iraq war longer than it took us to win World War II when we were fighting both Japan and Germany, and still we are no closer, and, I would submit, further from what they define as ``victory.'' 
   I, like so many Americans, have tried to be patient with this administration in extricating us from the difficulties we find ourselves in in Iraq. They first told us there were weapons of mass destruction. None were found, yet we were still patient. Then they told us we were there to remove a tyrant. We removed Saddam Hussein, yet we are still there, and we continue to be patient. They told us we were there to fight terrorism, and we have been fighting terrorism, and we still remain patient. 
   Now they tell us that we are there to make our families safer. Well, I don't feel that my family is any safer as a result of our being in Iraq. And like the American people, I am losing patience with the hollow promises that this administration has made about getting us out of Iraq. 
   I rise today in support of this rule because I think that it is time that we change the course, we change the direction. How many strategies is this administration going to adopt before they arrive at success? 
   Last night in the Rules Committee I got to thinking as we were discussing this rule about my own children, about my family, and I thought about how would my children look at me later in life, how would my grandchildren look at me later on, in terms of how we tried to stop this conflict in Iraq. Then I thought about a situation that I talked about a lot during my campaign. 
   During my campaign, when I was trying to decide whether or not I would run, my son and my daughter, who are both teenagers, were not supportive of that. One day my son said to me, Dad, what is it that a Congressman does? I started telling my son what a Congressman does. 
   He said, Dad, are you saying that if you get to Congress, you will be able to stop the war in Iraq? 
   I said, Not alone, but certainly with the other Members of Congress. 
   He said then, I really think that you should run for Congress, because the war in Iraq is a bad thing and too many people are dying. 
   My son, then 15 years old, got it. He understood what it was about. He understood that we are in Iraq for the wrong reason. He understood that it was time to change the course and change the direction. 
   That is why I rise today. I rise because I support the rule that will get us out of Iraq, but, more importantly, because my children know that it is the right thing to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 317 provides for consideration of H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting  Rights Act of 2007, and H.R. 1906, a direct spending offset bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Nation was built upon the principle that it is patently unjust to require free men and women to pay taxes to a government within which they have no direct involvement; a principle so important that the Founding Fathers knew if they were unsuccessful they would become outlaws and probably forfeit their lives. 
   The fact that approximately 600,000 U.S. citizens live under taxation without representation within the United States today is repugnant to our very notion of democracy. How can the United States deny democracy in its Capital while it promotes democracy abroad? 
   These citizens pay billions of dollars in Federal taxes, have sacrificed their lives in Iraq and other wars since the American Revolution. 
   However, when you look at the text of the 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states, ``The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration,'' you might ask yourself: Since there is no mention of the District of Columbia in this amendment, and it only refers to ``the several States,'' then how is it that D.C. residents are required to pay Federal income taxes? 
   The answer is that Congress, by statute, specifically, enacted the District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1947, which imposed Federal income taxation on the residents of the District of Columbia. 
   And when the law was challenged in the courts in 1970 in the case of Breakefield v. D.C., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld both the tax and Congress's constitutional authority to levy it. Further, the Supreme Court later denied even to hear the appeal. 
   This is taxation without representation at its worst, and it is completely undemocratic. Furthermore, what is clearly evident from the Court's review of Breakefield is that if Congress can levy taxes on D.C. residents without a constitutional amendment, then surely Congress can give D.C. residents a full voting representative within the House of Representatives without a constitutional amendment. This notion that there is a binding precedent for Congress to legislate on all matters related to the District of Columbia is further supported by decisions in such cases as Tidewater, and Adams v. Clinton. 
   Our actions today would correct this injustice by granting the citizens of our Nation's Capital a full voting representative in the House of Representatives. 
   Some of my colleagues have suggested that the D.C. House Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional and that we in Congress will be acting outside the power enacting this bill. This is not true. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution clearly enumerates the powers of Congress. And among the powers listed, article I, section 8 states that Congress shall have the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the District of Columbia. Article I, section 8 also gives Congress the power ``to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper'' to execute the enumerated powers. 
   Further, in 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, giving residents of the new District of Columbia the right to vote. Since the Capital was still being established, citizens were allowed to continue voting in their States, Maryland and Virginia. Congress then took that right away by statute in 1800 when the Federal Government assumed control of the District. In the political battles that followed, District residents were denied a vote in Congress. Now, certainly, if Congress can grant the right and then remove that right by statute, so too can it reinstate the right by statute if it so chooses. 
   In the landmark Supreme Court case McCulloch v. Maryland, Chief Justice John Marshall said: ``Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited but consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, they are constitutional.'' 
   Extending full representation in the House to residents of the District of Columbia is a legitimate end. It is within the scope of Congress' power to exercise exclusive legislation in matters concerning the District of Columbia and consistent with not only the letter of the Constitution, but also the spirit in which the Constitution was written by the Founding Fathers, that ``taxation without representation is tyranny.'' 
   Too much time has passed. Every day that we fail to act is one more day that we deny democracy. It is time to correct this grave injustice and provide the citizens of the District of Columbia the same rights afforded to every other citizen in this great Nation. Our actions today will do just that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments, but I could not disagree with him more. 
   First of all, this bill does not attempt to create statehood for the District of Columbia. In fact, as I said just a few moments ago, the legislation that has been passed in prior occasions, the one, in fact, with respect to requiring residents of the District of Columbia to pay income tax, despite the fact that the 16th amendment says that it is for the residents of the States, indicates very clearly that the District of Columbia is not a State and, rather, that Congress has the authority and the ability to make legislation with respect to the District of Columbia. In the Tidewater case, again Congress came forward and said that diversity jurisdiction applies to the District of Columbia even though it is not a State, and clearly that was upheld by the Supreme Court. 
   So this is not without precedent. This is something that Congress has done in the past because under article I, section 8, they have exclusive jurisdiction over the District of Columbia. 
   A couple of other points that I just would like to respond to. My colleague said that the majority just won't listen to reason, and I can't help but think that maybe that is what was said about the Founding Fathers by the members of parliament, that the people in America just won't listen to reason. How dare they talk about being represented just because we tax them? 
   This issue is critical. We tax the people in the District of Columbia. They are citizens of the United States. They fight and they die in our wars. They should be able to have a voting Member in Congress. 
   He also said that the majority has sunk to an all-time low. I am very troubled by that. If giving the right to vote to Americans, giving the right to vote to people who live here in the District of Columbia, in our capital, is sinking to an all-time low, then that is where I want to be, because clearly that is what we should be doing. We spend billions of dollars in other places in the world to ensure that citizens in other places in the world have the right to vote. We certainly should be able to do that here in our own country.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Texas and my colleagues on the Rules Committee for their spirited debate in this issue. I would also like to thank my distinguished colleague from the District of Columbia for her leadership on this issue and her passion. She has shown such incredible focus in terms of what she feels and what she believes, and it is contagious and I commend her for it. 
   This is an issue that is not only important to the residents to the District of Columbia, but it is important for the residents of the entire country because it is about giving the right to vote to people who deserve it. And that is what our country was founded on and that is what we are all about. 
   In my closing, I would just like to mention several points that were discussed in the previous debate, and one of them was brought up by my colleague from North Carolina. And I am troubled by the fact that he is attempting to talk about power grabs and talking about turning this issue into a political issue. This is not a political issue. It never has been. That is what the American people don't want out of their Congress. They want debate on issues that are important to the people. 
   This is something that is important to all of America. It is important to the residents of Utah, and it is important to the residents of the District of Columbia. It is not about a power grab. It is not about politics. And that is what the American people don't want to hear their Representatives in Congress talking about. They want to hear about why we support a bill. And the reason that this bill is important, the reason that this bill is critical is because it is constitutional. 
   My colleague from Texas said that the end doesn't justify the means, and I agree with him; the end cannot justify the means. This bill is not about that. This bill is clearly constitutional. 
   And I remind my colleague from North Carolina that if he looks at why Congress originally set up the District of Columbia, it was because the capital was in Philadelphia, and they were not able to do the kinds of things in Philadelphia that they wanted to because Pennsylvania was a sovereign State and they couldn't tell the State of Pennsylvania what they wanted done. So they came upon this idea to create a district, a district which they would have control over. That is why the District of Columbia was set up. That is why we are debating this bill today.

   Nearly 600,000 citizens of Washington, D.C. have waited far too long for equal representation in this Chamber. They have sacrificed their lives defending this great Nation and paid their fair share of taxes.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3996, TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule and the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007. 
   I applaud Chairman Rangel and the House leadership for providing a broad-based tax relief package in a way that promotes fiscal responsibility by complying with pay-as-you-go rules adopted by the House at the beginning of this Congress. 
   To be honest though, I'm a bit baffled by the comments from some of my colleagues suggesting that they oppose paying for the $50 billion AMT portion of this bill and would rather add it to the national debt, pushing that debt on to our children and our children's children. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was that sort of fiscal irresponsible behavior that allowed the previous Republican Congresses to erase the budgetary surplus that existed in 1999 and skyrocketed the national debt by more than $1.3 trillion in the course of 6 years. 
   While I may not agree with 100 percent of all the so-called pay-fors in this bill, I strongly believe that we in Congress must balance our own books just as all taxpayers do with their own finances. 
   H.R. 3996 contains many important tax cuts for both businesses and individual taxpayers. Far and away, the most important of these would save an estimated 21 million Americans from paying the AMT. In the district I represent in upstate New York, this bill will save over 36,000 people from having to pay higher taxes, nearly 6,000 of whom make less than $75,000 a year and have never had to pay the AMT before. That, Mr. Speaker, is middle-class tax relief. 
   H.R. 3996 also includes an extension of the research and development tax credit that allows companies a tax credit for a portion of their R&D expenditures. Extending R&D credit is vital to ensuring that America remains on the cutting edge of innovation and keeps our companies competitive. 
   American companies rely on this credit and upon its continuing to adequately plan their long-term research projects. I support this 1-year extension to provide continuity, and I will continue to work with leaders on the committee and in the body to seek a permanent extension that would eliminate concerns over expirations or lapses. 
   As I said earlier, I'm not in total agreement with all the revenue raising measures contained in H.R. 3996. I do have some reservations about the so-called ``carried interest'' provisions, especially as it relates to real estate partnerships. Specifically, I'm concerned that reclassification as income of carried interests paid to managers of real estate partnerships may create a disincentive for general partners to manage partnerships that seek to develop higher risk projects in areas that need development or redevelopment. 
   In spite of these reservations, I will vote for this rule and H.R. 3996. I will continue to work with my colleagues to address these concerns, and I'm confident that together we can find an appropriate and fiscally responsible way of ensuring that development projects in areas that depend on them will continue to attract necessary investment. 
   I believe we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007 is a good bill that brings much-needed tax relief to both America's middle-class families and our businesses, and I'm especially proud that we are doing it in a fiscally responsible way, following the PAYGO provisions adopted by this House in the same way that every household in America does.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6304, FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1285 provides for consideration of H.R. 6304, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided among and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the chairman and ranking minority member on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
   Madam Speaker, we have come a long way on the crucial issue of intelligence gathering. First, I must commend our majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, for his commitment and dedication to reaching a sensible, bipartisan and bicameral agreement on FISA. Ensuring that we provide our Nation's intelligence community with the necessary tools and resources to prevent a future terrorist attack on our Nation must transcend partisan politics, and doing it in a way that protects the rights guaranteed to law-abiding Americans under this Constitution. 
   Clearly, thanks to the hard work of Mr. Hoyer, Minority Whip Blunt, Chairman Reyes and many others, we will continue to work to protect the American people today. 
   Bringing this FISA agreement to the floor is the result of months of long and thoughtful deliberation between the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, and the White House. What we're doing today is proof that we in the House should not have to just settle on the will of the Senate. It's proof that we can achieve a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on how our Nation gathers its intelligence. This type of bipartisanship is precisely what the American people expect of us. 
   Today we're not voting on the Senate version of the bill, instead we have the opportunity to vote in favor of a sensible, bipartisan FISA bill that will help protect our Nation from terrorism, while protecting the civil liberties we, as Americans, hold dear. 
   I also admit that I don't think the FISA agreement is perfect, but seldom should we expect an opportunity to vote in favor of legislation that every Member of this Chamber believes to be perfect. 
   Effective legislation demands bipartisan consensus. And an example of such bipartisan consensus is the issue of immunity for telecom companies. The civil liberty protection provision in this agreement finally removes the shackles for our telecom companies to tell their side of the story. No longer can the administration step in and assert the ``State Secrets Privilege'' and deny telecom companies and the plaintiff seeking to protect his or her Constitutional rights the opportunity to make their case in front of a judge. 
   As a former district attorney, I for one couldn't agree more that if the intelligence community goes to a telecom company with adequate authorization and says, we need communication records for person X because he or she is believed to be a terrorist, the telecom company deserves to be afforded that protection. 
   Unfortunately, under the old system we would never know if adequate authorization and substantial evidence, for that matter, ever existed. Thanks to this bipartisan agreement, we now will. 
   Madam Speaker, we have come a long way over the last few months. We can all agree that the world changed on September 11, 2001. Our Nation faces new threats on new fronts. What we are doing here today is proof that we can come together, Republicans and Democrats, to provide our Nation's intelligence community with the necessary tools to face and fight those threats, while protecting the civil liberties of Americans, and ensuring that the rights guaranteed under the Constitution are not mere words but, rather, solemn ideas that our Nation holds dear. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, I'd just like to read a quote today from The Washington Post on the FISA legislation that we are considering today.  The article is entitled ``A Better Surveillance Law.'' I just want to read one excerpt from it:  
   ``Congress shows it still knows how to reach a compromise in the national interest. Congressional leaders in both parties should be commended for drafting legislation that brings the country's surveillance laws into the 21st century, while protecting civil liberties and preserving important national security prerogatives.''  
   Madam Speaker, it's this type of bipartisanship that I think the American people expect out of Congress. And I believe that, as my colleague from Washington just said, this bill is not perfect. But it is the kind of compromise that people expect from their congressional leaders in a way that protects us, and, at the very same time, ensures that the civil liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, again, are not just mere words but rather strong ideals that we preserve. So, again, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule. With that, I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, we have come a long way over the last few months. We can all agree that the world changed on September 11, 2001. Our Nation faces new threats on new fronts. What we're doing here today is proof that we can come together, Republicans and Democrats, to provide our Nation's Intelligence Community with the necessary tools to fight terrorism while protecting civil liberties of Americans.     
   Again, I commend Majority Leader Hoyer, Minority Leader Blunt, Chairman Reyes and Conyers, and many others who were able to go beyond the partisanship that too often consumes this Chamber and deliver a sensible FISA bill that we can be proud of. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1538, WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule and the underlying bill, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act. 
   Improvements in medical technology over the years allow for more servicemen and -women to survive injuries sustained in battle. During World War II, for every soldier that was killed, two were wounded. Now, this ratio is up to 16 to 1. These incredible medical developments allow many more men and women to return home to their families, but their injuries tend to be much more serious and, in many cases, require additional care for the rest of their lives. 
   Last month, I had the opportunity to visit with wounded soldiers recovering at Walter Reed Medical Center. I met several young men wounded in Iraq, one a constituent of mine from upstate New York. As I stood next to the mother of one of the soldiers, I saw a look of sadness on her face, and at that point it struck me, what if one of my two teenage children were lying in that bed? I know that I would want the absolute best treatment and care for my children, and our brave troops deserve nothing less. 
   Sadly, the administration's mismanagement of the war in Iraq has extended to the home front as well. The selfless men and women who volunteered to defend their country have been callously neglected and were not only sent into battle without adequate resources, they also returned home to inadequate resources. When they asked for help, no one answered. 
   We make a promise to our soldiers to provide for them when they return home from battle, and it is absolutely unacceptable that this promise has been broken. 
   The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act will ensure that more than 25,000 servicemembers who have sustained injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan receive the world-class treatment and care and services they have so bravely earned and deserve. This bill creates an efficient system for the transition of records from the Department of Defense to the Veterans Administration. It establishes a support system of counselors, advocates and case managers to ensure timely, comprehensive care; and it establishes a number to call to report problems in facilities so that when a soldier asks for help someone answers. 
   Mr. Speaker, our men and women in uniform deserve the absolute best care that this Nation has to offer. I urge my colleagues to renew our promise to our veterans by supporting this rule and the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my colleague from Vermont for yielding. I would like to also thank the chairman, Chairman Miller, and Subcommittee Chairman Kildee for this wonderful piece of legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment, which would allow schools to purchase and install renewable energy generation systems. Our amendment would allow schools to choose from a diverse selection of renewable energy sources. But I would like to specifically highlight two that pose significant potential: Geothermal and biomass wood pellet systems. 
   Just last week during the Memorial Day District Work Period, I had an opportunity to tour the Cayuga-Onondaga BOCES in Auburn, New York, and received a firsthand look at a geothermal heating and cooling system in action. The Cayuga-Onondaga BOCES completed installation last July of a closed-loop geothermal system. The system includes 200 wells around the campus, 330 feet deep, that tap into the earth's constant ground temperature at a level of 55 degrees. The system circulates that 55-degree air temperature year round throughout the buildings on the campus.     
   In the winter, the system relies on a boiler to slightly increase the air temperature on the campus to a comfortable level of 68 degrees, requiring substantially less energy than normal, and in the warm summer months, the system needs no additional energy whatsoever to cool the buildings on campus. 
   The New York State Energy Research Development Authority recently conducted a study that found the system to be a remarkable 43 percent more energy efficient than a building built to standard code. While it might be too soon to qualify the actual monthly cost savings, I think it is safe to say that a building 43 percent more energy efficient will realize significant cost savings in the future and allow a school district to spend resources where they are most needed, on better educating our students, hiring more teachers, and to fund underfunded programs like the IDEA. 
   The second component of this amendment I wish to highlight is wood pellet energy. Wood has the potential to meet our Nation's energy needs in a safe and environmentally responsible way. Studies show that commodities can save significant taxpayer funds by switching to wood energy for heating schools. For example, communities can save as much as 50 percent over natural gas, 80 percent over propane, 80 percent over electric heat and 50 percent over oil by switching to wood energy. 
   Especially in the upstate New York district that I represent, with its bountiful forest resources, wood energy such as biomass offers an array of economic environmental benefits compared to traditional fossil fuels. Both geothermal and wood energy systems can be fueled by renewable local resources. This keeps energy dollars circulating in the local and regional economy, instead of flowing to other nations. These systems also aid local budgets by providing lower and more stable fuel costs for our schools. Investments like this benefit the whole community by relieving pressure on local budgets and associated tax rates, leading to healthier communities. Unlike some other renewable energy systems, both geothermal and biomass systems can run continuously and provide a constant level of power throughout the day. 
   Beyond the amendment my colleagues and I are offering today, it is also worth noting the overall benefits of the underlying legislation. Everyone in this Chamber, Republican and Democrat, understands the importance of lowering energy prices. 
   The 21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act represents a trifecta of sound public policy. It improves the education system for our children, it does so in an environmentally friendly way that decreases our dependence on finite fossil fuels, and it creates jobs for hardworking middle class families. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. I thank my friend and colleague from the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I, like so many Americans, have tried to be patient with this administration in extricating us from the difficulties we are in in Iraq. Like so many other Americans, I want to believe that our country is doing the right thing and we are taking the correct steps and doing everything that needs to be done to bring our troops home. But it is very difficult when we see and experience what we have experienced. 
   You know, first they told us that there were weapons of mass destruction. None were found. Yet the American people continued to be patient. 
   Then they told us we were in Iraq to remove a tyrant. We removed Saddam Hussein; our soldiers fought valiantly and well. Yet we are still there at the present time despite the fact that Saddam Hussein has been removed from power and has been executed. 
   Then they told us we were there to fight terrorism, and we have been fighting terrorism, and we continue to fight terrorism, and yet our troops remain there. 
   Now they tell us we are there to make our families safer. Well, I for one don't feel that my family is any safer today than they were when we went into Iraq. In fact, I think that my family is far less safe. 
   This administration tells us that we are there to fight terrorism, that we are there to fight al Qaeda, and yet we hear that al Qaeda is now stronger than it has been since before 9/11. So, again, I ask the question: Why are we in Iraq? Why are we sacrificing American lives? Twenty-six thousand have been injured; 3,600 Americans have been killed. Nearly a half trillion dollars has been spent, and yet still we are in Iraq and still we are no safer than we were before 9/11. 
   People ask me: What are we doing? How are we making our country safer? What are you doing to bring the troops home? And it is very difficult to answer because it is sort of like trying to hit a moving target. Every time that a benchmark is set, every time a question is asked, this administration moves the target. They tell us we are in Iraq on a surge that will tell us in 60 to 90 days where we will be. Then today we hear from this administration we only now can begin the surge because only now are we fully up to speed. Yet we see our Armed Forces at the weakest point they have been in many years. 
   Our National Guard is not where it should be, here State side; rather, our National Guard is overseas. They are not in a position to help should we need them here. Should we have another disaster like Hurricane Katrina, our National Guard is not here. Rather, they are serving overseas. These are the things that this administration has failed the American people on. 
   The violence in Iraq continues. The Iraq government has failed to meet the key benchmarks endorsed by the President in January, and political reconciliation is nonexistent. 
   And yet we as a Nation have not engaged the neighbors of Iraq. We have not gone forward and tried to bring a settlement to this. We have not engaged Iran. We have not engaged Syria. We have just continued to send troops to Iraq. Something has to be done. 
   Today we took the first step to do that. I was proud to be one of the representatives who voted for the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act, as were 223 of my other colleagues here. It is an important step that we have taken. It is an important step for this Congress. 
   You know, I can't help but think, I have two teenaged children. What are we going to tell our children about why we were in Iraq? When our grandchildren read the history books and say to us, ``Members of Congress, what did you do to stop this war,'' what are we going to tell them? Well, today we took one step in telling them that we began the process. We are beginning the process to bring this war to an end and to bring our troops home. It is necessary. It is important. It is our responsibility as Members of Congress.

   Mr. ARCURI. Just a point that I'd like to make on something that you said earlier, if you could comment on that. 
   We talk about money costs, but think of the amount of money that this Congress has had to appropriate for veterans benefits as a result of the staggering injuries, the staggering effects that this war has had on our veterans and on our military personnel, and I just think that that's something that I don't think that this administration thought about when they planned out Iraq. They didn't think about the number of wounded because, while our medical teams get better and better, we save many more lives, but obviously many, many more people receive injuries that they will suffer from the rest of their lives. And it's our duty and our responsibility as a Nation to take care  of those individuals, and the emotional costs to their family and obviously financial cost to this country of taking care of them is great. 
   And I just wanted to add that because that's something else that I don't think anyone thought about before we went into Iraq.

   Let me just say, I hear throughout this debate, victory, victory, victory. The other side constantly talks about victory. But to my way of thinking, victory is long past. 
   What victory means at this time would be bringing as many of our troops home alive and safe as we possibly can. That's what victory means. That's what we should be trying to achieve, and that's what today was all about. I think that really is the most important thing that I think we achieved today.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Chairman, I plan to withdraw my amendment, but before I do I would like to take a few minutes to highlight a few issues facing dairy farmers in our district. 
   First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Chairman Peterson for achieving what many thought was impossible, and that is a sensible, balanced, comprehensive reauthorization of the farm bill. I especially appreciate that the chairman included a 5-year extension of the MILC program, which is so critical to dairy farmers in my district and throughout the Northeast. 
   Unfortunately, with skyrocketing costs of energy and feed, it is becoming increasingly difficult for dairy farmers to stay in business. New York is third in dairy production nationwide and home to 6,200 dairy farms which produce 12 billion pounds of milk a year and generate $2 billion in farm revenue. 
   From 2001 to 2006, however, the cost of gasoline and fuel had increased over 100 percent. The cost of feed has increased nearly 20 percent and the cost of fertilizer has increased over 40 percent, to list just a few of the dairy farmers' expenses. While all the costs of production are based on market prices, the price a dairy farmer can charge for a hundred weight of fluid milk is not. 
   In response, my amendment simply states the sense of Congress that the USDA should use its existing authority when determining the class I milk price mover to factor in increased costs of production like energy and feed. It is patently unfair that Exxon, Conoco, Mobile, and other oil companies can increase the price of their product when costs of production like exploration and labor go up; yet dairy farmers are held hostage to severe price fluctuations and forced to succumb to a process that doesn't always reflect their increased costs in production. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to yield 1 1/2 minutes to my good friend and colleague from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), a cosponsor of my amendment, and a member of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Dairy.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, Americans are outraged with the present course in Iraq. Here we are more than 4 years later with 3,100 of our brave men and women killed, fighting a war that has cost our Nation $370 billion. 
   It has become overwhelmingly clear that the current strategy to secure the peace of Iraq is failing. And yet the administration contends that sending more combat troops into Iraq is somehow a silver bullet that is going to quell the ongoing violence. I couldn't disagree more. 
   The resolution before us today establishes two overwhelmingly clear and concise principles that are supported by a large majority of Americans, and I am confident will garner a great deal of support for many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   First and foremost, we support our brave service men and women. They have done everything that has been asked of them, bravely and honorably; and for that, we in Congress and the people all over America will be forever grateful. 
   Second, and simply, we oppose sending additional troops into Iraq. 
   Madam Speaker, during this debate some of my colleagues have used the term ``victory'' in their remarks. Victory. But no one, not one of my colleagues in this Chamber, nor anyone in this administration, has yet to clearly define what victory in Iraq really means. 
   At one point we were told victory meant getting rid of weapons of mass destruction. Then, of course, we learned there were no weapons of mass destruction. When that didn't work, we  were told victory meant toppling a dictator, and that we would be greeted as heroes. We toppled the dictator, but of course we were never greeted as heroes. And yet, still no victory. 
   The administration then told us establishing elections would constitute victory. There have been several elections in Iraq, yet still no victory. And all the while, the casualties have continued to rise. 
   Earlier this week, I had an opportunity, for the first time, to visit with wounded soldiers recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital. Seeing firsthand the devastating injuries that some of our brave soldiers have endured has troubled me in a way that I have not known before. As an American who loves his country very much, and as a father of two teenagers, it became crystal clear to me right then and there what exactly victory in Iraq means. I think victory in Iraq means bringing as many of our troops home alive as possible, the way I would want to see my two children brought home, if they were in Iraq. That is what victory is about, is bringing as many Americans home alive as we possibly can. 
   Madam Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had the better part of 3 years to use their position in the majority to change the course in Iraq. They did nothing. No resolutions; few, if any hearings; and no accountability. How many more American lives are worth risking to continue an ill-conceived and poorly planned strategy that is clearly not working? 
   The American people answered that question last November. They have had enough, enough political rhetoric, enough stay the course, and most importantly, enough of the loss of life. 
   Some of my colleagues are trying to mischaracterize this resolution. They say this resolution somehow demonstrates a failure to support our troops. That is ridiculous. 
   Let me be clear, perfectly clear. Everyone in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats alike, support our brave men and women serving in the Armed Forces. Simply because we believe the best way to support our troops is to bring them home does not mean that we don't stand behind them. In fact, I think it means a greater commitment of support to them. 
   Madam Speaker, I was not elected to blindly follow along. I was not elected to accept the status quo, and I was not elected to be a rubber stamp. I was, however, elected to stand up when necessary and say no, I disagree. And that is exactly what we are doing here today, we are standing and saying we disagree. 
   The American people have run out of hope. They are tired of the failed policies of this administration. It is time for a new approach. It is time for a new strategy, and it is time for a new direction

   Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, Americans are paying the price for President Bush's lack of an energy policy. It's this lack of a policy that has produced record prices for consumers and record profits for Big Oil. This President has the authority to send oil into the American market by opening the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an action that would put oil on the market in 13 days and would provide relief at the pump immediately. 
   But instead of providing American drivers with relief from $4-a-gallon gas, the administration has decided instead to give their friends in Big Oil one last gift before they leave office. The President's action to lift the offshore drilling moratorium will do nothing to lower prices at the pump now. In fact, his own Energy Information Administration says opening up new areas for drilling won't lower gas prices for 20 years, and even then by only a couple of pennies. 
   Madam Speaker, deploying some oil from the Reserve would increase the supply of oil and help bring down the cost of gasoline. With so many Americans struggling in today's economy, it's time President Bush stands up for consumers and taps into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3999, NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1344 provides for consideration of H.R. 3999, the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act of 2008 under a structured rule. The rule provides one hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Transportation. The rule makes in order 11 of the amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership in addressing the critical needs of bridges on our Federal highway system. I know that this issue is especially close to home for him, and my other colleagues from Minnesota, because of the tragedy that occurred when the I-35 bridge collapsed in Minneapolis last summer. 
   The staggering truth is that one-fourth of all bridges nationwide are deficient. Half of all of the bridges in use were constructed in the 1960s. It is projected that motorist traffic will double in the next 30 years. In the same time, freight traffic in the U.S. will likely grow 92 percent in order to accommodate forecasted increases in American economic output. Growing demand for the movement of goods and services will place an unprecedented strain on our aging system. 
   Our communities need the resources to ensure that our families and friends don't have to worry about their safety during their morning commute to work, quick trip to the grocery store, or the drive to drop their children off at school. We owe it to the American public to regain their trust in the safety of our bridges and highways. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation this rule provides for consideration will go a long way to regain that trust from the American people. The legislation authorizes an additional $1 billion for bridge repair and replacement, and setting inspection standards for such bridges. It ensures that funds are concentrated on the most pressing bridge safety concerns by mandating that priority bridges be inspected annually and all other bridges biennially. 
   I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge the work of my Republican colleague from Texas (Mr. Conaway) and thank him for the opportunity to work with him and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) on an amendment that we will offer here today related to the rusting and corrosion damage to bridges. Our amendment expresses the sense of Congress that States should prepare corrosion mitigation and prevention plans when planning the construction of new bridges or the rehabilitation of existing bridges. 
   Our amendment calls attention to a serious problem: many of our Nation's bridges are simply rusting away because of corrosion. Many of our bridges have surpassed their initial life expectancy, yet we rely on them to support another 20, 30, 40 years of travel. 
   Corrosion is a significant factor in determining the useful life of a bridge. Without preventative measures, water penetrates and corrodes the steel rebar that reinforces our bridges, causing it to swell and fracture the concrete from the inside out. Weather and salt--especially in the northeast, where we must salt our roads in the winter--cause steel beams to rust and undermine the integrity of the whole structure. 
   But corrosion can be reduced by using widely available technology and construction methods if they are incorporated into the engineering and design phase of the bridge project. Prevention measures range from simple steps like selecting more resistant building materials, or using coated rebar in concrete structures, to complex methods that cause electrical reactions in water to prevent rust from forming. This sounds complicated, but the same technology is commonly used by the shipbuilding industry to prevent corrosion. 
   It is much easier and more cost effective to prevent or limit corrosion and rust at the beginning of a project. Corrosion prevention and mitigation plans can cost as little as a few thousand dollars to prepare during the design phase of a bridge project, but they can save municipalities hundreds of millions of dollars down the road in replacement and repair costs; delaying the need for maintenance by a factor of years. Having these plans up front can extend the life of the bridge, thereby saving both lives and millions of dollars in unnecessary repairs. I am hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the Conaway-Arcuri-Sutton amendment later today.  
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot pass up this opportunity. We rely on bridges too much for everyday activities. Thanks to Chairman Oberstar and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, we can rest a little easier knowing that this legislation will make the bridges on our national highway system much safer. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend and colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Diaz-Balart, for his management of this very important bill. 
   I would like to say that very few things that we do in the House of Representatives are more important than this rule and the underlying bill because while energy is important and so many things we deal with are very important, nothing is more important than the safety of our family and the safety of our children, and that's what this bill is all about.     
   It is about the safety of our roadways, about our bridges. The crisis we face in maintaining safe bridges is just as pressing, if not more, than any of the other issues that we face today. We must act now while we have an opportunity to restore public faith in our bridges and to prevent another tragedy like the collapse of the I-35 bridge last year. 
   In my opening remarks, I mentioned that 1/4 of all bridges nationwide are deficient. The State of New York is in even worse position with well over 6,000 of its 17,000 bridges rated as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. In my upstate district alone, there are over 260 bridges that have been identified by the State Transportation Department as structurally deficient, and 9 of those are in my hometown of Utica, New York. 
   While that reality is troubling, the Congress now has an opportunity to take action to address this problem. Again, the legislation in this rule provides for consideration authorizes an additional $1 billion for Federal bridge programs next year. 
   Again, I thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership and commitment to our Nation's infrastructure and the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. ARCURI. (REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ARCURI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Regional Economic and In Development Act of 2007. 
   I want to thank the distinguished Chairwoman of the Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management Subcommittee, Ms. Norton, the Full Committee Chairman, and the Ranking Members for delivering this legislation which authorizes three new economic development commissions--the Northern Border, Southeast Crescent, and Southwest Border Regional Commissions--and reauthorizes the successful Delta and Northern Great Plains Regional Commissions. These Commissions will help bring economic development to regions of our country that desperately need it. 
   Over the last several decades, Upstate New York has had a consistent pattern of economic distress as a result of substantial losses in the manufacturing sector, coupled with aging infrastructure and lack of opportunities for a skilled workforce. My district alone has seen a staggering loss of more than 14,000 manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2005. However, this isn't an anomaly, it is extremely characteristic of several States in the Northeast. A targeted regional approach can help bring back economic vitality to these regions. 
   This bipartisan legislation creates a Northern Border Regional Commission that will bring much needed job creation and economic development resources to the Northeast region. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Upstate New York will all benefit tremendously from the establishment of this Commission because it will assess and address the very specific needs, assets, and challenges of the region as a whole. 
   The Commission will create a Federal-State partnership where local development districts and other non-profits bring project ideas and priorities to the Commission from the local level to promote economic development  through regional planning, technical assistance, and funding of projects aimed at encouraging economic prosperity. 
   This Northern Border Regional Commission is modeled after the very successful Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) approach, an idea conceived by Chairman Oberstar, over 40 years ago. 
   Simply put, the numbers speak for themselves. Since its creation, the ARC has reduced the number of distressed counties in its region from 219 to 100, cut the poverty rate from 31 percent to 15 percent, and helped 1,400 businesses create 26,000 new jobs. I welcome the creation of similar Commissions with this kind of proven track record. 
   The Northern Border Regional Commission not only will extend benefits to economically distressed counties in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, but will also allow Upstate New York counties like Oneida, Herkimer, Cayuga, and Seneca to enjoy the same benefits their neighboring counties in the Southern Tier enjoy under the Appalachian Regional Commission. 
   We need to act now to ensure that every American has access to job training, employment-related education, and high-tech infrastructure, so that we can retain and grow our global competitive edge. And I am confident the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act will help us achieve that end.
