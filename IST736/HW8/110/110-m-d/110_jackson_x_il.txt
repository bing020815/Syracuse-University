   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I thank you, Chairman Payne, for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2828, a bill to compensate relatives of U.S. citizens killed in the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. 
   I introduced this bill with Republican Whip ROY BLUNT, and it has solid bipartisan support, including 19 members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   On August 7, 1998, an al Qaeda truck bomb exploded at the American embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and in Nairobi, Kenya. The embassy bombing in Nairobi killed 12 Americans serving their government. The Americans killed in the embassy bombings were, and Mr. Blunt will now join me in calling their names, Sergeant Nathan Aliganga, United States Marine Corps; Consul General Julian Bartley; his son, Jay Bartley; Jean Rose Dalizu; Molly Huckaby Hardy; Staff Sergeant Kenneth Hobson II.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. The State Department was negligent in not responding to concerns raised about the danger and exposure of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi to a vehicle bomb attack. The U.S. intelligence community had been surveilling several al Qaeda associates in Nairobi for 2 years, yet that information was not shared with the diplomats bidding on assignments in Nairobi, Kenya. Prior to the attack, then-U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell warned the State Department about the vulnerability of the Nairobi Embassy and requested more security. 
   Members of al Qaeda were convicted of the bombing in New York Federal District Court in 2001. Government witnesses at the trial testified that intelligence and security reports from several different sources had confirmed the presence of an al Qaeda cell in Nairobi and the likelihood that the location of the embassy exposed the employees to an attack given the proximity of the street, but the State Department failed to act on these intelligence reports. 
   The Accountability Review Board, established to examine the facts and circumstances surrounding the embassy bombings, found that the bombings were the result of a ``collective failure of several administrations and Congresses over the past decade to invest adequate efforts and resources to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. diplomatic missions around the world to terrorist attacks.'' 
   Like the families of those killed on 9/11, the families compensated in H.R. 2828 also suffer a similar heartache and pain from an al Qaeda attack on U.S. soil. Several of the victims' children still suffer from serious emotional problems. However, unlike quick action taken by Congress and the executive branch to respond to the needs of families of 9/11, these families have waited more than 9 years without any meaningful compensation. 
   Former Secretary of State Albright has stated publicly that her administration failed to help the families because the attacks happened thousands of miles away and because the Department failed to respond to the pre-attack intelligence report of the serious threat of the al Qaeda organization in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Mr. Speaker, this bill is the very least that a grateful Nation can do. 
   I would like to thank Republican Whip ROY BLUNT and his staff member, Brian Diffel, for working with us on this bill. I would also like to thank CBC Chairwoman KILPATRICK and her staff member, James Williams; DAN BURTON and his staff member, Brian Fauls, as well as the committee staff of Chairman Lantos, Chairman Payne and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for all the work they did on this bill.  
   I want to recognize the work of Karen Williams, counsel for the Nairobi Embassy families, and especially Consul General Bartley's daughter, Edith, who has brought this issue to the attention of the Congress and has worked tirelessly to get us to where we are today. 
   Mr. Speaker, present with us today in the House are members of the Bartley family, members of Ms. Kavaler's family, and members of the Kirk family. And I understand that it's not appropriate or within House rules to acknowledge specifically their location in the House Chamber, but they are here today on this momentous occasion. 
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the time. I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 2828.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 2764, The State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations bill. I can think of few things we do on an annual basis that are more important and crucial to the success of U.S. foreign policy than passing this bill. 
   I would be remiss if I did not begin my comments by thanking the chairwoman, Congresswoman NITA LOWEY, the first woman to chair this subcommittee and, in a very short time already, its most extraordinary chairman. I also want to thank Ranking Member Wolf and the majority and minority subcommittee staff for helping to produce a great bill. 
   Despite the fact that the allocation for this bill is $700 million below the President's request, this is a well-written, well-measured bill, taking into account the concerns of both the majority and the minority. However, I am worried about the amendments I have seen that want to cut some of the vital programs in this bill in the name of fiscal discipline. 
   I am worried, Mr. Chairman, because yesterday around the world nearly 15,000 to 20,000 people died of extreme poverty. Today around the world 15,000 to 20,000 people will die of extreme poverty. Tomorrow around the world 15,000 to 20,000 people will die of extreme poverty. Extreme poverty like malnutrition and disease are claiming tens of thousands of lives every day. 
   This bill has a real opportunity to reverse these facts. Look at what has been done to date with our foreign aid bill. Smallpox eradication began in the 1960s; control of river blindness in the 1970s; increased child immunizations in the 1980s; initiatives to fight Guinea worm, trachoma, and leprosy in the 1990s; and the effort to end polio in this decade. Measurable results produced with the dollars in this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me point out some of the highlights of this measure. This bill before us today makes significant improvements in our aid package to Colombia, especially for Afro-Colombians, by emphasizing alternative development and rule of law, programs that work. 
   This bill, Mr. Chairman, provides increases for both our multilateral and bilateral peacekeeping obligations. These funds will provide security for trouble spots like the Darfur region of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
   This bill provides increases for global health programs that fight the scourge of HIV, TB, and malaria. This bill provides increases for development assistance programs. Some of these funds are educating children and providing clean drinking water and sanitation around the world. 
   The increases in this bill are the least we can do. I don't understand why some Members plan to offer amendments that cut some of the increases in  key development programs, tearing apart the majority party as tax and spenders. Our former colleague from Illinois, my friend John Porter, used the term ``noblesse oblige,'' the belief that the wealthy and the privileged are obliged to help those who are less fortunate. In Luke chapter 12, verse 48, Jesus simply says, ``To whom much is given, much is expected.'' In Matthew chapter 6, verse 21, Jesus said, ``For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.'' If this verse is true, what does it say about these amendments that want to cut these crucial programs that are improving millions of lives around the world? I have a master's degree in theology from the Chicago Theological Seminary, and I have read my Bible from cover to cover. And nowhere does it say, ``only clothe the naked and feed the poor after you have cut taxes for very wealthy people.'' 
   In 1984, referring to Marxist-ruled Ethiopia, President Ronald Reagan said, ``A hungry child knows no politics.'' All he knows is that he is hungry. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 2764, the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. I hope that Democrats and Republicans will rally behind an extraordinary product created by the chairman of this committee, the ranking member of this committee, and the extraordinary Foreign Operations staff.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
   I rise in strong support of amendment No. 2 and amendment No. 3 to the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008. 
   As a member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I have fought to include overseas humanitarian assistance in these supplemental appropriations bills. I want to thank Chairman Obey for including several of these provisions in amendment No. 3 which truly reflect the will and generosity of the American people. 
   Because of the rising cost and shortage of food, riots and instability have hit Haiti, have hit Egypt and the Philippines. Amendment No. 3 contains a total of $850 million for P.L. 480 Food for Peace Programs, which will be made available as soon as this bill is signed into law. 
   In Sudan, Chad, Kenya, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, thousands of people die each day, not from conflict, but mostly from malnourishment and lack of health care and shelter. Amendment No. 3 includes $200 million for urgent humanitarian disaster assistance, and $300 million for assistance for refugees and internally displaced persons. 
   These funds are desperately needed, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for amendment No. 3.

<DOCNO>Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. (WILLYE B. WHITE POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2025, naming a post office building in the Roseland community of Chicago, Illinois, as the Willye B. White Post Office Building. 
   Willye B. White was born to run. She was a five-time Olympic track and field athlete from Money, Mississippi. She was the best female long jumper of the time. She made Chicago her home in 1960 until her untimely death in February, 2007. 
   She wasn't a household name, but she should have been, especially if your household happens to be one of the millions that includes a female athlete. Or an athlete of color. Or a once or future Olympian. She was better known for her actions than her name, better known for her deeds than her medals. 
   At 16, she competed in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games and became the first American woman to ever medal in the long jump, earning a silver medal. She participated in the next four Olympiads as well, and is the first American to compete on five Olympic track and field teams. She won another silver medal in the 1964 Tokyo Games in the 4-by-100-meter relay. Ms. White competed in more than 150 nations as a member of 39 different international track and field teams. 
   Over the years, White remained active in the field of sports. She represented track and field on the U.S. Olympic Committee, coached athletes in the National Sports Festival in 1979 and 1981, coached and managed at the 1981 World Cup Track and Field Championship Games in Brussels and Rome, and served as the head coach for the 1994 Olympic Sports Festival. 
   Born on December 31, 1939, in Money, Mississippi, and raised by her grandparents, White discovered her talent  for running and jumping at age 10. In 1959, White graduated from Broad Street High School in Greenwood, Mississippi, the same year she set an American record for the long jump, which stood for 6 years. Breaking loose from the poverty of the racially segregated delta, she attended Tennessee State from 1959 to 1962, and achieved national acclaim with the Tigerbelle team that produced Wilma Rudolph. She moved to Chicago in 1960 and began working as a nurse in 1963, first at Chicago's Cook County Hospital and then at the Greenwood Medical Center. In 1965, White became a public health administrator at the Chicago Health Department. She graduated with a B.A. in public health administration from Chicago State University in 1976. 
   White was one of 21 people on President Ford's Commission on Olympic Sports, a panel that restructured the U.S. Olympic movement. She lobbied extensively for Title IX and raised money for the Women's Sports Foundation. She worked for nearly four decades for the City of Chicago, devoting much of her time to children's recreation and creating sports programs for girls. 
   In 1990, White found WBW Hang on Productions, a sports and fitness consultancy. A year later, she founded the Willye B. White Foundation helping children develop self-esteem and become productive citizens through such initiatives as the Robert Taylor Girls Athletic Program. This program taught sports and teamwork to children living in the Nation's largest housing project and provided summer day camp and health care in the form of immunizations and dental and medical checkups. 
   White was the first American to win the world's highest sportsmanship award, the UNESCO Pierre de Coubertin International Fair Play Trophy. She is a member of 11 sports halls of fame, including the National Association of Sport and Physical Education, Black Sports, Women's Sports Foundation, and National Track and Field. She was chosen by Sports Illustrated for Women in 1999 as one of the 100 greatest athletes of the century and by Ebony in 2002 as one of the 10 greatest black female athletes. 
   Ms. White passed away from pancreatic cancer on Tuesday, February 6, 2007. It is with great pleasure that the U.S. House of Representatives acknowledges Willye B. White not only for her outstanding athletic abilities, but for her tireless service to the community and to the young girls on the South Side of Chicago, indeed young women everywhere. 
   Finally, I would like to thank my staff, especially my legislative assistant, Ms. Megan Moore, for her hard work on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me first thank my friend from Georgia (Mr. Bishop) for his remarks and for his leadership in bringing this topic to the attention of our colleagues. I would also like to recognize the timeliness of his comments, as National HIV Testing Day is on June 27. 
   The gravity of this issue cannot be understated, and I hope to work with Mr. Bishop and lend my support to address the veterans who suffer from this interminable disease.  
   Chicago is the epicenter of HIV/AIDS in Illinois. Roughly 70 percent of reported AIDS cases in the State are in Chicago. Minorities account for approximately 69 percent of the city's total population, but represent 81 percent recently diagnosed AIDS cases. Minorities constitute 20 percent of veterans in Illinois; yet the trend of HIV/AIDS among the State population and the higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS among veterans in general demonstrates minority veterans are disproportionately affected by this disease. 
   HIV/AIDS has had a significant impact on veterans across the country. Combating the spread of this disease through testing and education is not only important to our communities, but vital for the health of all Americans. 
   I want to thank the chairman for yielding me the time and thank Mr. Bishop for his leadership.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, let me first begin by congratulating the hardest-working Member of the Congress, Chairwoman ROSA DELAURO, for this outstanding bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, as a new member of the Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee, I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 3161, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Again, I want to congratulate Chairwoman DeLauro and the subcommittee staff for the product here before us today. I also want to thank Ranking Member Kingston of the minority subcommittee staff for working with us to produce this product. 
   Over the past 8 months, I have learned a lot about agriculture policy. When asked why I serve on this subcommittee, considering my largely urban and suburban district, I quickly respond by saying this bill touches the lives of 647,000 residents of the Second District of Illinois. We all eat, we all want safe food, and we all want safe medicines. 
   With the recent passage of the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007, our Nation's agriculture policy and spending reflects our growing investments not only in rural development and commodity programs but in nutrition, conservation, and renewable energy. We want to continue to support our farmers as well as feed the hungry, protect our Nation's food supply, and invest in research. 
   One out of five Americans at some point in time in their lives will participate in at least one domestic food assistance program. Our nutrition programs serve as the first line of defense against combating hunger by helping low-income families purchase food. This bill illustrates Congress's commitment to protecting our country's most vulnerable populations. It accomplishes the following: 
   It increases the Food Stamp Program by $1.7 billion and creates a $3 billion contingency reserve, which helps feed over 26 million people annually. It restores the President's proposed cuts to the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and expands the program that serves over 485,000 people monthly by adding five new States. It appropriates $5.6 billion to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and restores State grants to help administer the program. It supports the expansion of the simplified summer school food program that provides up to two meals a day to children under the age of 18 during the summer. 
   This bill also addresses a wide variety of needs, ranging from increased grants and loans for rural communities to fully funding the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. 
   The increases in this bill are sensible, they are prudent, they reflect our priorities, reinforcing our commitment to feed the hungry, to house the needy, and to protect us all. 
   I recommend that my colleagues vote against any amendments cutting these vital programs, and I strongly urge them to vote for this bill.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 521, naming a post office building in Rock Island, IL, as the Lane Evans Post Office Building. 
   For the past 11 years, I have had the great pleasure and high privilege to serve in the Illinois Congressional delegation with a true American hero, Lane Evans. At a young age, he heroically served our country by joining the Marine Corps after high school to fight in the Vietnam War. He has never forgotten his friends and has fought diligently for the rights of veterans. Lane Evans led the charge to compensate Vietnam veterans for diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure, fought to ensure that children of veterans received government benefits and that women veterans had access to the same services as their male counterparts. 
   A son of a firefighter and a nurse, Lane Evans understood the needs of working families and has been a tireless fighter of protecting American jobs, providing affordable health care for all Americans and increasing the minimum wage. He is a soldier, activist and defender of the underdog and has given a voice to millions of veterans and especially to the good people of the 17th Congressional district of Illinois. 
   I pay tribute to a man that has well served his constituents and has become a trusted colleague and friend. His work on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs will serve as a blueprint for future legislators. He has shown tremendous political courage over the past 24 years in office and will show even more courage as he continues his battle with Parkinson's Disease. 
   At this time our Nation demands fearless leaders that stand up for American families and dedicate their lives for the improvement of others. Lane Evans has committed his life to others as a courageous public servant, a man that deserves the title, ``The Honorable.'' I too was drawn to public service, believing that I can help the people of my district and those outside my district. I have not lost that feeling, and I know Lane Evans has not either. We need more leaders in this institution that constantly remember why we are here--to serve the public shoulder to shoulder. 
   Lane Evans has worked for his district, country and for the freedom of all. His subtle style and modest voice will always reverberate loud in my ears. Congressman Evans, I would like to thank you for your leadership, determination and willingness to fight! Your work in Congress will forever be remembered and your legacy will live on.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I want to thank the Chair for the time. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 4033, the Labor-HHS bill. There is no bill that Congress produces on an annual basis that has such a profound impact on everyday people's lives like this bill. 
   I want to congratulate Chairman Obey and the subcommittee staff on the product that is before us today. I also want to thank Ranking Member Walsh and the minority subcommittee staff working with us to produce this bill. 
   I think former Labor-HHS Chairman Ralph Regula said it best when he described this bill as the ``people's bill.'' And I want to commend the gentleman for his statement in support of this product. 
   This might seem obvious, but your view depends on where you stand. From where I stand, I see an America today where the overall unemployment rate is 4.5 percent. For African Americans it's 8.5 percent. The average life expectancy is 77.6 years. For African Americans it is 69.2. Sixty-three percent of white students graduate from college. For African Americans, it's 43 percent. These numbers represent real problems for real people that need real solutions, not tax cuts and amendments to cut 1 percent and .5 percent across the board. This bill is a solution that illustrates how Congress can solve real problems. 
   We've heard from the other side already language like ``wrong,'' ``fiscally and recklessly irresponsible.'' The entire debate about earmarks is to divert our attention away from these very real problems that this bill seeks to solve. 
   Specifically, this bill includes a $43 million nominal increase for Job Corps, projecting the administration's proposal to cut 4,310 student training slots. The administration's request for CDC would have reduced funding for our primary health activities by $159.4 million, cutting childhood immunizations, State and local public health emergency preparedness, and efforts to combat chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease and emerging infection. 
   Madam Chairman, I encourage Members to look at the facts around this bill and to be supportive.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Reclaiming my time, what the chairman, I believe, and the committee sought to do by adding this language was to create a stop loss that does not prevent cuts, but rather reduces losses to a level that the jurisdiction can absorb in one fiscal year. 
   For example, the San Francisco EMA, which includes San Mateo and Marin Counties, for example, will still receive about a $2.3 million cut. The language caps losses for eligible metropolitan areas like San Francisco at 8.4 percent, misrepresents the 5 percent hold-harmless loss that was agreed to in last year's reauthorization, plus the average loss for all title I jurisdiction, which was 3.4 percent.     
   But I think it is important to note, and then I would be happy to yield if the gentleman would like to respond, here are some of the other jurisdictions that will benefit from the stop loss language which included in the chairman's mark: Hartford, Connecticut, 892,000; New Haven, Connecticut, 712,000; Nassau-Suffolk, New York, 432,000; Puerto Rico, 310,000; Caguas, 286,000; Sacramento, 195,000. And it goes on and on and on. 
   So what we are trying to understand here is how the chairman's language, which seeks to remedy a particular problem, is fundamentally changed by the gentleman's amendment. 
   I would be happy to yield for his response.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I appreciate the gentleman and his analysis. 
   At least as I read page 58, line 21, the gentleman seeks to reduce by $8 million section 501 of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 and section 505 of the Family Support Act of 1988. That reduction the committee fundamentally opposes in part because of Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 and the Family Support Act of 1988 are reputable programs that have provided an enormous benefit to the American taxpayer. That is precisely why it is in the bill. And it is specifically in the section of the bill ``Children and Families Services Programs'' because of its enormous benefit to the American taxpayer. 
   I appreciate the gentleman's effort at fiscal accountability and fiscal responsibility, and the gentleman has clearly led a crusade through every single one of these appropriations bills, but I would encourage Members to oppose the Hensarling amendment.

   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, as I understand Mr. Hensarling's amendment, he goes at the heart of the Administration on Aging, section 204 of the report, and these programs, including supportive service centers, preventive health, are protection for vulnerable and older Americans that are at the heart of the bill. It's clear to me that according to the Health and Human Services budget in brief that consumer empowerment, healthy lifestyles, community living incentives, are a critical part of taking care of families and their caregivers. And I just don't know where the gentleman arrives at the numbers that he seeks to cut in the bill. 
   The committee learned through exhaustive testimony from the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services the importance of funding this program. As the gentleman, Mr. Hensarling knows, the President has sought to fund the program, and the committee has worked in a Republican and Democrat bipartisan way, sought to increase the program, and so we are going to stick with this number. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for yielding me the time. I am encouraging members of the committee to oppose the Hensarling amendment.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Madam Chairman, at the desk, the amendment that the gentleman was speaking to concerned Native Hawaiians, but the gentleman spoke about Alaskans. And I asked the Clerk if he had the amendment that the gentleman was speaking about on Native Alaskans and he said he did not have that amendment. So I'm trying to figure out, are we responding to the Native Hawaiian language for $33,907,000, which is what is at the desk, or the gentleman's argument about Alaskans, which is not at the desk? And that is my inquiry.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., said, ``In a sense we have come to our Nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
   ``It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given us a bad check, and it has come back marked insufficient funds.'' 
   Dr. King went on to say, ``As a nation, we can spend billions of dollars to put a man on the Moon and a war in Vietnam, but we can't put a man on his own two feet right here in America.'' 
   Last week this Congress could not provide money for community health care centers. They couldn't find money for day-care programs, for community policing, for crumbling schools, but this week we found $700 billion to bail out incompetence on Wall Street. For months, President Bush has refused to sign appropriations bills that exceeded his budget request. This week he wants the Treasury, with bipartisan support of the Congress, to give him maybe up to $1 trillion. 
   Stop defaulting on the American Dream. Stop issuing promissory notes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I too have a dream: Let's bail out homeowners and Main Street before Wall Street.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Let me rise in strong opposition to the gentleman from Texas's amendment, and I am hoping that the gentleman might engage me in a brief question.  
   These grants assist in the development of essential community facilities in rural towns of up to 20,000 in population. We talked about them in great detail in a number of hearings on the Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee, and witness after witness suggested that these Federal funds, in conjunction with local funds, made it possible for them to advance the idea of health conversations and broader conversations about fire stations and hospitals and purchasing ambulances and other critical community facilities. 
   I was going to ask the gentleman if he wouldn't mind engaging in just a brief colloquy with me. A brief question: Does the gentleman support the President's budget? 
   I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
   Let's put a face on this program. In Horseshoe Bend, Idaho, no company had invested in providing broadband delivery to the residents until a company called Bitsmart applied for a USDA Community Connect Grant. 770 people live in Horseshoe Bend, Idaho. Now, Bitsmart has established wireless Internet accessibility and availability, an integrated system connecting law enforcement, health care providers and school and government offices. 
   The USDA Rural Development mission is to increase economic opportunity and improve the quality of life for rural residents. To level fund a program that connects rural Americans to the rest of our country would be a moral disgrace. We are under an obligation in this Congress to bring rural communities, where large corporations and medium-sized corporations do not invest in them, into the information age and make them part of our more perfect union. 
   I encourage my colleagues to reject the Hensarling amendment.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I just want to stand in defense of the subcommittee and its work. We tried to be as responsive to members on this committee as possible, given that many members of the committee do not understand the specific details of every congressional district. But this is what Congressman Artur Davis had to say: 
   ``Auburn University is seeking funding to continue research on endemic and emerging pathogens of catfish. Because the prevalence of catfish diseases constitutes $90-100 million in annual losses for catfish farmers, it is important to prevent these diseases to ensure a healthy national food supply and a successful economic development activity. This funding will allow Auburn University to conduct outreach to farmers and ensure that these vaccines make it into the field to protect the food supply of the American people. Earlier research from this project has already led to the commercialization of two vaccines that are now helping in the reduction of these disease losses.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Rogers, and I also want to thank Congressman Artur Davis for looking out for the interests of this vital industry in their State. The committee did its work and honored their request. We should vote down the gentleman's amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman from California for offering his amendment and thus for the opportunity to defend  an important project to the people of the State of Illinois and the Nation. 
   While the gentleman has served two terms in Congress, he has inadvertently entered in a three-decade-old conversation about expanding aviation capacity in Illinois. And his amendment profoundly impacts 12 years of my work in this body. 
   In fact, the development of a new airport to service the Chicago metropolitan area was first advanced by a well-respected Republican governor, Governor Jim Edgar. 
   Nationally, aviation is growing at roughly 4 percent, but in the Chicago region it's growing at only 2 percent. Because of capacity constraints at our existing facilities, Midway's runways are too short and O'Hare Airport reached operational capacity 10 years ago and is subject to annual review of capping the number of operations at this facility. 
   ALNAC is a local airport commission constituted under Illinois State law and comprised of 21 home-rule municipalities in Cook, Will and Kankakee Counties. 
   ALNAC has created an innovative public-private partnership to design, finance, build and operate a new commercial airport for the Chicago region located near University Park, Illinois. 
   ALNAC is a legitimate airport commission. In fact, the Governor of the State of Illinois in his State of the State address said specifically, ``Congressman Jackson's plan to build the Abraham Lincoln National Airport at Peotone will not compete with O'Hare for needed Federal dollars, meaning the Airport Improvement Program, not small business or financial services problems, but the Airport Improvement Program construction funds. 
   His plan to use private investment is both a welcomed and innovative way to build an airport. I strongly support it, and I hope you do too.'' 
   The Illinois Department of Transportation said that ``ALNAC is a local airport authority that was formed through an intergovernmental agreement between its constituent members comprised of 32 Illinois municipalities located in the Chicago region.'' 
   The Illinois Department of Transportation says that ``ALNAC and its provide partners submitted a comprehensive layout plan to the FAA and to IDOT in July of 2004.'' 
   To give you some of the specific examples of the airport layout plan that we submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration that are presently before the FAA for review are under consideration as we await soon a record of decision. 
   And lastly, the Illinois Attorney General, in her most recent opinion, said that ``ALNAC is a legitimate airport commission that only waits for the governor to lease its land to the State of Illinois or to the commission for the purposes of constructing an airport.'' 
   This grant allows ALNAC to partner with local universities and/or small business development centers to conduct a study on how the region can maximize job creation and retention and ensure minority participation for local residents during all phases of the airport project. Specifically, the study will produce recommendations and guidelines and benchmarks to do the following: assure maximum participation for local female, disadvantaged and minority businesses in airport construction and financing operations; identify regional job training needs and relevant job training programs; develop, grow and improve local small business opportunities. Support all aspects of entrepreneurial activities and monitor progress. 
   The gentleman might ask the question, why now? Many communities in the region have 60 people for every one job. Ford Heights, Illinois, according to Money magazine, is ``one of the poorest communities in America'' and it abuts the airport, and they deserve to participate in the economic boom that this project will bring. 
   The Illinois Department of Transportation is in the process of submitting ALNAC's layout plan to the FAA for final approval. IDOT has said that a record of decision could come as quickly as 6 months. If that's true, now is the time to begin planning for local participation in the financing and the construction of this airport. 
   ALNAC's airport plan, Mr. Chairman, also known as the ``Jackson Plan,'' has been repeatedly endorsed by every major newspaper in Chicago, including the Chicago Tribune, the Chicago Sun Times, the Chicago Daily Defender, the Chicago Daily Southtown. Every major newspaper in the Chicago region, through our very transparent process at the local level, fully appreciates the extent to which for the last 12 years we have invested our time in helping solve the Nation's aviation capacity crisis problem by building a third regional airport. 
   A 30-year conversation and a 12-year conversation for which I have almost been solely responsible for leading here in the Congress of the United States. In fact, I've been called a one-issue guy in the 12 years that I've been in Congress, and it's focused around this issue. 
   I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment. I thank the chairman for his consideration of this earmark. I would strongly encourage Members to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.  
   No Need for Greed 
   Since Rep. Jerry Weller (R-Ill.) is mum about his reasons for tacking to a defense appropriations bill an amendment that would give Will County officials a majority stake in running an airport at Peotone and controlling airport contracts, we can only go along with Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.'s view that the move is designed to scare off private investors. 
   If that's indeed the case, then shame on Weller. 
   It's bad enough to be a Johnny-come-lately, but to act as saboteur on a project that could benefit the entire region is simply out of line. When few politicians gave Jackson much of a chance to succeed, he staked his career on building a third airport, even forging partnerships across party lines and finding entrepreneurs willing to do the project. 
   According to Jackson, Will County officials have already been offered five of the nine seats on the commission that would oversee every phase of the airport's development and operation. So what's the problem? 
   Rather than reach a compromise, Weller appears to be turning to political games to give Will County officials something--exactly what hasn't yet been disclosed. But any proposal that would undermine the work done thus far toward building a third airport should be viewed with a great deal of suspicion.   
   Congressman Jackson's Airport Plan Is Far Superior to Will County's 
   On April 12 the Will County airport authority floated its plan for building a South Suburban airport. 
   Eyeing the vast economic benefits and potential profits for businesses near a new facility in its area, Will County leaders made it clear why they want to get into the airport business. 
   Yet a facility to be located at Peotone is a far better idea. It's based on a superior plan, and it would bring 1,000 construction jobs to south Chicagoland by 2006. As envisioned by Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. (D 2nd), thousands of permanent new jobs would be created after construction if his airport plan were adopted. 
   It foresees the first scheduled takeoff for a day early in 2009. Based on a Federal Aviation Administration formula that factors in an airport's size and the number of its airport gates, 15,000 permanent jobs would result from Jackson's proposal. 
   And they would be good, high-paying jobs in industries such as hotels, restaurants, business supply centers an fuel companies. 
   Tuesday Jackson published an analysis of the differences between proposals for a Will County airport and his South Suburban airport concept. The comparisons are persuasive in favor of his South Suburban Airport Commission plan. 
   The Will County authority published no financial plan for investment in an airport. Instead, it would rely on financing from federal and state sources, both of which are experiencing severe budget problems. Beyond those unlikely sources of case, Will County officials are hopeful the airlines themselves, most of which are cash strapped, in bankruptcy, or both, would pay part of the costs. 
   Most objective observers believe that such wishful thinking will end in a simple result: the Will County plan nearly assures its airport will not get built. For one reason, it would compete with O'Hare and Midway airports for federal dollars, a precarious and probably quixotic endeavor, given Mayor Richard Daley's long reach toward Washington money. 
   Jackson's plan is realistic and sound. It calls for financing by private developers. The Congressman, a plain-talking man, made it plain: ``Our plan is wholly financed by private developers, at no cost and at no risk to local taxpayers, federal or state governments, or the airlines.'' 
   Two development companies are signed on. They are companies that have built, financed and operated airports in places like New York, Paris and Vancouver. Jackson says they will use the same models they used in those successful airports at the Abraham Lincoln National Airport that his plan calls for at Peotone. 
   Abraham Lincoln National Airport? 
   The congressman has formally petitioned the F.A.A. for permission to use that as its  name. His plan calls for dedication of the facility in 2009, the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth. 
   Jackson says the issue of shared governance with Will County leaders remains negotiable. 
   But, he says, ``Our plan is far better than Will County's. The concept of a self-financing, public-private partnership that shares revenues with surrounding communities in South Cook, Will and Kankakee counties, and that opens by 2009, is a great one. That is not negotiable.'' 
   We concur with his approach and ask that a house now divided embrace it, for the good of the entire south Chicagoland area.

<DOCNO>Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. (THE NAMING OF EMANCIPATION HALL -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, let me first begin by expressing my support of a suspension bill that was offered to this body by Mr. Clyburn, Mr. Miller and the ranking minority member on education to help provide emergency funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that are seeking some bridge loans for construction projects. 
   I think that my remarks today in the 60 minutes that I have been allotted under the Speaker's announced policy are very consistent with the historical concept and circumstances for which that bill will be passed into law and hopefully signed by the President of the United States. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, we have come to this temple of democracy on this momentous occasion to write a new chapter in the unfolding story of human freedom. Today this body passed H.R. 3315, a bill to name the Visitor Center great hall Emancipation Hall, offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp), and the gentleman from Illinois, myself, Mr. Jackson. 
   The event of emancipation marks one of the most, if not the most significant event in American history, and so too, at least from my perspective, was the passage of this bill. Unfortunately under the rule, it did not afford Members of Congress the opportunity to have a broader discussion about the significance and the importance of this bill. But I do want to take this time to remind the Nation of the importance of this period and to reflect upon it during this Thanksgiving season. 
   Emancipation was more than an act; it was a process. Emancipation was not a date but a period. Emancipation was not an event but the fulfillment of providence that the Arc of history may be long, but it bends towards justice and human freedom. When the American Civil War erupted, both North and South defended their cause as morally just, legally right and constitutionally sound. Northerners and southerners saw themselves as true Americans following in the tradition of the footsteps of the Founding Fathers. North and South used the Constitution as the source of their moral and their legal authority for conducting a war against the other. Both sides saw themselves as standing in the tradition of the American Revolution. Each side contended that it was fighting for freedom and liberty, though certain facts contradicted the beliefs of both. The South said it was fighting to preserve freedom while protecting the institution of slavery. The North said it was fighting for liberty while not initially fighting to grant liberty to the slaves. 
   President Abraham Lincoln, our 16th President's address to the Sanitary Fair in Baltimore on April 18, 1864, summed up the quandary. He said, and I quote, ``We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing. With some the word `liberty' may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labor, while with others, the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other men's labor. Here are two not only different but incompatible things, called by the same name, `liberty.' And it follows that each of these things is, by their respective parties,'' President Lincoln goes on to say, ``called by two different and incompatible names, `liberty' and `tyranny.' '' 
   He then went on to say, ``The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as a liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep was a black one. Plainly the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon the definition of the word `liberty'; and precisely the same difference prevails today among us human creatures, even in the North, and all profess to love liberty.'' 
   Today, women, lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgendered Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and students see in the word ``liberty'' one thing. Today for the Titans of Industry, it still means quite another. For the dispossessed, it means for each person to do with himself as they please. For the Titans it means for them to do as they please with other men and the product of their labor anywhere in the world. 
   As Lincoln said, ``And it follows that each of the things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and incompatible names, `liberty' and `tyranny.' '' 
   That is why efforts to name the great hall Liberty Hall will settle for some but still not settle for others the fundamental question of human freedom in the American historical context. For millions of Americans to pass through Emancipation Hall and not Liberty Hall is an important acknowledgment about the process for attaining human freedom in our context as Americans. 
   Lincoln understood for his time and ours that we must not be confused about the language and the process of human freedom.     
   Much has been said about Lincoln and his ambivalence about emancipation. I believe when placed in the greater context, clarity emerges in Lincoln's calculation of emancipation. In 1862, Lincoln's announced support of colonization, along with his lack of public support for emancipation, was generating sometimes vicious attacks from militant abolitionists, including a ``Prayer for 20 Millions'' editorial urging emancipation that appeared in Horace Greeley's New York Tribune. On August 22, a month after the private announcement to his Cabinet on July 22 that he intended to issue an Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln replied to Greeley's editorial with a masterfully written open letter. Here's what our 16th President had to say: 
   ``If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and it is either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing a single slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all of the slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forebear, I forebear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause.'' 
   Lincoln was reiterating his central thesis, that the purpose of the war was preservation of the Union, but in light of the intransigence of the border States, he was publicly hinting that he might have to do something more, including emancipation to save the Union. In this open letter, Lincoln was saying ``if,'' but he had already concluded in his mind ``that'' the only way to save the Union was to free the slaves.  
   After the emancipation proposal became public, President Lincoln sometimes was ridiculed in public political oratory and newspaper editorials about his Emancipation Proclamation, which would free the slaves only where the President had no power to do so, those States in rebellion, but he preserved the institution of slavery everywhere he did have the power, those border States that chose to stay in the Union. 
   But Lincoln's enemies either misunderstood the President, lacked the understanding of the Constitution, or ignored his politics. On saving the Union, Lincoln had additional flexibility under the Constitution. Politically, he could sometimes get away with violating it by engaging in arbitrary arrests and suspending the writ of habeas corpus. On the question of ending slavery, however, Lincoln saw no such flexibility. His understanding of the Constitution committed him to acting within both it and the law, for neither had yet been changed. Under the Constitution, slavery was still legal in the United States. 
   On the first question, Lincoln and all Republicans of that era agreed that a 13th amendment outlawing slavery must be added to the Constitution. The Senate quickly passed such an amendment; but the House, which had gained 34 Democrats in the 1862 mid-term elections, was opposed. Lincoln understood, if others didn't, that issuing the Emancipation Proclamation would convert a struggling Union Army, trying to hold a Nation together, into an army of liberation to free the slaves. The newly freed slaves could help win the struggle by fighting along the Union forces and soldiers. 
   Of course, the liberation of the slaves would only happen, and only happen if the North won the war. Militant abolitionists still thought the proclamation weak; Southerners thought it an outrage, but most antislavery advocates, both black and white, understood its revolutionary implications. It was the one act that changed the entire character of the war. It gave the war a moral purpose, human freedom, to bolster the political goal of saving the Union, and a purpose with such deep emotional power condemned the Confederacy to sure defeat. 
   The question now was, having transformed the conflict into a war of liberation, would the Northern soldiers still fight? Some said no. ``An Ohio Democrat amended the party's slogan to proclaim, `the Constitution as it is, the Union as it was, the N-I-G-G-E-R-S where they are.' '' But most said yes. ``A Democratic private in the Army of the Potomac whose previous letters railed against abolitionists and blacks now expressed support for putting away any institution if by doing so it will put down the rebellion, for I hold that nothing should stand in the way of the Union, the N-I-G-G-E-R-S, nor anything else.'' 
   With the July 4, 1863, victory at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, Northern hopes rose and Southern spirits sank. The burial at Gettysburg nearly 144 years ago this month was originally planned for October 23, but rescheduled to November 19 because the principal orator, Edward Everett of Massachusetts, could not be ready before then. Lincoln, by comparison was casually invited to attend and make a few remarks. ``No insult was intended. Federal responsibility or participation was not assumed then in State activities. Lincoln took no offense. Though specifically invited to deliver only `a few appropriate remarks' to open the cemetery, he meant to use this opportunity. The partly mythical victory at Gettysburg was important to his administration's war propaganda.'' 
   There are mythical accounts that Lincoln wrote his Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope. Even though the 272-word speech probably took less than 3 minutes to deliver, interrupted with applause five times by 20,000 in attendance, such cavalier preparation would have been totally uncharacteristic of President Lincoln, who took such opportunities seriously and chose his words very carefully. 
   Lincoln intended to use this occasion and this speech to lift the Nation's eyes above the death and the carnage of Gettysburg ``to a level of abstraction that purges it of grosser matter.'' Lincoln did for the whole Civil War what he accomplished for the single 
   battlefield.'' He transformed its meaning and, in doing so, transformed what it meant to be an American. 
   Lincoln mentioned neither slavery nor Gettysburg in the Gettysburg address. He drained his speech of all of the particulars in order to lift up an ideal. Lincoln intended to create something good and new out of this tragic and bloody episode. Both North and South strove to interpret Gettysburg to further their own war interests. Lincoln was after an even bigger victory, winning the ideological as well as the military war, and I believe he succeeded. The Civil War today is, to most Americans, what Lincoln wanted it to mean. Words had to complete the work of the guns. 
   What is it that President Lincoln had to say on that occasion? He said: ``Four score and seven years ago,'' and this is a 3 1/2 minute speech. In fact, Martin Luther King delivered the ``I have a dream speech'' in about 13 1/2 minutes. So my thinking is anytime someone speaks, they should speak between 3 1/2 minutes and 13 minutes. If they give a speech longer than that, well, they are really giving history a fit. Also, if you can't say it between Gettysburg and ``I have a dream,'' it probably shouldn't be said at all. 
   So let's see what Lincoln had to say at Gettysburg, 3 1/2 minutes: ``Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent,'' November 19, 1863, right around the time we are trying to break for Thanksgiving, 144th anniversary, and let's reflect, 144 years ago. ``Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new Nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great Civil War testing whether that Nation, or any Nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those here who gave their lives that the Nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.'' I love this part: ``But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here but it can never forget what they did here.'' That is his message to the future, that we should not forget what happened there. 
   ``It is for us the living, rather, to be here dedicated to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus so far nobly advanced. 
   ``It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us ..... that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain ..... that this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.'' 
   When we wave the flag and celebrate on July 4, Independence Day, we are not so much celebrating our American-ness in terms of our independence from England. We are celebrating the meaning of the flag and America as Lincoln interpreted them in his Gettysburg Address, because July 4, 1776, only white males could vote, and then they had to be landowners. 
   On July 4, 1863, with the Northern victory at Gettysburg and the Northern victory at Vicksburg, Abraham Lincoln saw an opportunity to reinterpret what July 4 would mean for the future. So when we barbecue on July 4, and when we celebrate our Independence Day, when we look at Hillary Clinton running for President; Barack Obama; Mitt Romney, a Mormon running for President, none of this was possible on July 4, 1776. An African American running for President on July 4, 1776, was a different America. A woman running for President on July 4, 1776, was a different America. Barack Obama running for President, Mitt Romney, a Mormon running for President on July 4, 1776, a different America. 
   Abraham Lincoln says this July 4, 1863, is going to yield a new birth of freedom for all Americans and we will never look at July 4 again because July 4 will never be the July 4 that it used to be because we are en route to being a different America. 
   At Gettysburg, Lincoln reinterpreted the Constitution. Looking past slavery  in the Constitution, he appealed to the Declaration of Independence and its claim that all men are created equal. Conservative political heirs to this outrage still attack Lincoln for subverting the Constitution at Gettysburg. 
   Let's see what Garry Wills had to say about this. He said that Lincoln is here not only to sweeten the air at Gettysburg but to clear the infected atmosphere of American history itself, tainted with official sins and inherited guilt. He would cleanse the Constitution, not as William Lloyd Garrison had, by burning an instrument that countenanced slavery. He altered the document from within, by an appeal from its letter to the spirit, subtly changing the recalcitrant stuff that legal compromise, bringing it to its own indictment. By implicitly doing this, he performed one of the most daring acts of open-air sleight-of-hand ever witnessed by the unsuspecting. Everyone in that vast throng of 20,000 people who heard Abraham Lincoln on that day had their intellectual pocket picked. The crowd departed with a new thing in its ideological luggage, that new Constitution Lincoln has substituted for the one they brought there with them. They walked off from those curving graves on that hillside at Gettysburg, under a changed sky, and into a different America. Lincoln has revolutionized the revolution, giving people a new past to live with what would change their future and our future indefinitely. 
   Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was transforming the United States of America from a plural to a singular noun, from the United States ``are'' into the United States ``is'' a free government.     
   According to Gary Wills, Lincoln, by his words and his actions, converted the Union from a mystical hope into a constitutional reality. 
   Looking out over the extraordinary events of 1863, on October 3, 1863, realizing that the North had made substantial progress in Gettysburg and substantial progress in Vicksburg, and Robert E. Lee, the Democrats, troops were on the retreat throughout the South, and he saw an opportunity to make an extraordinary period for which all of us are grateful even to this day. 
   On October 3, 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued the following, Mr. Speaker, proclamation: 
   ``By the President of the United States. 
   ``A proclamation. 
   ``The year that is drawing towards its close,'' and I quote, ``has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and promote their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except the theater of military conflict; while that theater has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle or the ship. The ax has enlarged the boarders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals have yielded,'' this is in spite of a civil war, they have ``yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camps, the siege and the battlefield; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom. No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins has nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and with one voice by the whole American people. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of Thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverance and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become,'' because of the Civil War, ``widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the intervention of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of our Nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility and Union. 
   ``In testimony whereof, I have heretofore set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
   ``Done at the City of Washington, this Third day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States the Eighty-eighth. 
   ``By the President: Abraham Lincoln.'' 
   Thanksgiving has nothing to do with the Pilgrims and the Native Americans. Thanksgiving is looking out over a national disaster, a war over Federalism between the big government in Washington and the States and the fact that the slaves had been freed and the Northern armies were in pursuit through Vicksburg and Gettysburg, and Abraham Lincoln said the Nation is going to be preserved. And we deserve to give the person who is responsible for its preservation the greatest thanks, God, and therefore every third Thursday in November is set aside as a national day of thanks to remember the path that we took to save the Union. That is what Abraham Lincoln was after. 
   I haven't quite figured out yet why national memory has bypassed this event and decided to somehow ascribe it to events that have absolutely nothing to do with Abraham Lincoln's proclamation. The very first Thanksgiving was about the Civil War and about emancipation. 
   The same can be said for the story of our Capitol. From the moment a visitor enters this building, the unfolding process of emancipation, the players in the drama, the actors, the people, the heroes. The ``sheroes'' have been hidden. They have been denied a fair and accurate account of these unfolding events. 
   When you enter the Capitol Rotunda, we look up at the ceiling and we see the story of America, from Columbus all the way around the Rotunda to the Wright Brothers, from Columbus to the Wright Brothers, and not a single African American in the Rotunda's mural of the story of America. From Columbus to the Wright Brothers. 
   In Statuary Hall, the Old House Chamber, emancipation is ignored in Statuary Hall, where there today are status of the honored dead of the Confederacy. President Jefferson Davis is there, the greatest traitor in American history. Confederate Vice President Alexander Hamilton Stephens has his statue there. Confederate General Robert E. Lee is there, in uniform. Confederate Commander Joseph Wheeler is there, in uniform. 
   In that room, Old Statuary Hall, is where States were admitted to the Union, one free and one slave, to keep the balance between the North and the South, so that the House of Representatives and the Senate would never have more Members than any regional faction of the country. 
   Yet for the millions of visitors, Mr. Speaker, who come through our Statuary Hall, we never tell them that story. We would rather talk to the floor and show them that the Chamber has acoustic capabilities that allow us to talk to the floor and watch our voices bounce off the ceiling and arrive somehow on the other side of the room. 
   In the Old Senate Chamber, Charles Sumner got beaten half to death by Preston Brooks, and a book still sits on Charles Sumner's desk, the central story in the Old Senate Chamber.  
   The Old Senate Chamber doubled as the Supreme Court Chamber while the Supreme Court was under construction. It was in the Old Senate Chamber that Plessy v. Ferguson was decided, the Old Supreme Court Chamber. Of all of the decisions made in that room, it is known for two decisions under Justice Taney's leadership: Dred Scott and the Amistad Africans. 
   So whether it is the Rotunda, from Columbus to the Wright Brothers; whether it is Old Statuary Hall where people visit our Capitol and are taught about the acoustics of the building and not about how States were admitted to the Union to keep the balance between North and South or why all the Confederate generals have their statues in Statuary Hall; whether it is the Old Senate Chamber, Charles Sumner getting beaten, caned half to death by Preston Brooks and the Plessy v. Ferguson decision; or whether it is the Old Supreme Court Chamber, where Dred Scott and the Amistad Africans, Joseph Cinque and the others, were told they could go back home, only parts of the story are told, when they are told. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is the emancipation process, process, process, not an event, not a date, not a time, it is the emancipation process that led to the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th Amendments to the Constitution. 
   And as descendants of slaves, we believe that as Americans are better educated on this history, that that process, that American process, that process that we cannot change, it is part of our history, as more Americans are educated about that process, that it will lead to our 28th Amendment, our 29th Amendment, our 30th Amendment: health care for all, education of equal high quality for all, a cleaner environment for all, fixing our Nation's voting system for all, providing equality for all people, especially women. It is our Nation's historical process, and only that process that can provide emancipation for all. Not liberty. Emancipation. 
   Mr. Speaker, interpreting Lincoln's work and his life is extremely important. Recently there have been questions raised as to whether Lincoln should be credited with freeing the slaves. The argument goes, given some of Lincoln's history, his racial attitudes and statements, his moderate views on the subject, his noninterference with slavery where it already existed, his one proposed solution of colonization, his gradualist approach to ending the institution, his hesitancy with respect to issuing the emancipation and using colored troops in the war, his late conversion to voting rights for blacks and more, why should he be given credit for freeing the slaves? 
   Some have even argued that it was the various actions taken by the slaves themselves, including the power given to the Union causes as a result of the moral calls for overturning slavery, plus the actual military role of working and fighting in Union campaigns that actually freed them. By forcing the emancipation issue on to the agenda, first of military officers, then of Congress, and finally of Lincoln, it was their actions that led to freedom. 
   Clearly, just as Congress and Lyndon Johnson would not have been able to sign the civil rights legislation of the 1960s apart from a modern civil rights and human rights movement, so too the military commanders, the Congress and Lincoln, would not have been able to achieve what they did without agitation and movement from the slaves and their allies. On the other hand, the slaves would not have become freed men, apart from what these leaders did. 
   Because historical interpretation has played up the role of white male leaders, while playing down the role of mass movement and leaders of color and women, our understanding of history has been skewed. 
   Some of the current putdown of traditional historical interpretation is legitimate rejection and reaction to this past limited and distorted understanding and interpretation of our history. The search now, it seems to me, should be for more balanced interpretation, which includes striving to put many forces and multiple players into proper balance and perspective. That, I think, is what is at issue with regard to the question that did Lincoln free the slaves. 
   Mr. Speaker, but for Abraham Lincoln and the answers for which he so nobly fought and advanced, we today would be without the capacity of building a more perfect Union for all Americans. The naming of Emancipation Hall is an extraordinary event on behalf of all Americans. We begin the process now of broadening the education of all Americans to make the Union more perfect for all. 
   I would close, Mr. Speaker, by just saying this: I shall never forget the movie ``Roots.'' There was a great scene in the movie ``Roots'' when Kunta Kinte was being told by a slave master that his name was Toby. And he kept saying no, my name is Kunta Kinte. And he said, no, your name is Toby. He said Kunta Kinte. Toby. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Kinte made an extraordinary contribution to saving this Union, to preserving it, and his descendants are making a contribution and making it more perfect. Congratulations to all Members of Congress today who voted to name the great hall Emancipation.

<DOCNO>Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. (PROVIDING THAT THE GREAT HALL OF THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER SHALL BE KNOWN AS EMANCIPATION HALL -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Let me express my great appreciation to the chairman and to the ranking member of this committee. 
   Today we have come to this temple of democracy on this momentous occasion to write a new chapter in the unfolding story of human freedom. The event of emancipation marks one of the most if not the most significant event in American history. 
   Emancipation was more than an act; it was a process. Emancipation was not a date but a period. Emancipation was not an event but the fulfillment of providence that the arc of history may be long but it bends towards justice and human freedom. 
   When the American city war erupted, both North and South defended their causes as morally just, legally right, and constitutionally sound. Northerners and southerners saw themselves as the true Americans following in the tradition and the footsteps of the Founding Fathers. North and South used the Constitution as their source of moral and legal authority for conducting a war against each other. Both sides saw themselves as standing in the tradition of the American Revolution. 
   Each side contended that it was fighting for freedom and liberty, though certain facts contradicted the beliefs of both. The South said it was fighting to preserve the freedom, while owning slaves. The North said it was fighting for liberty, while not initially fighting to grant liberty to the slaves. President Abraham Lincoln's address to the Sanitary Fair in Baltimore on April 18, 1864, summed up the quandary. 
   He said, ``We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word, we do not mean the same thing. With some the word `liberty' may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other men's labor. Here are two not only different but incompatible things called by the same name: liberty. And it follows that each of these things is, by their respective parties, called by two different and incompatible names: liberty and tyranny.'' 
   Today women, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgendered Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and students see in the word ``liberty'' one thing. Today for the Titans of Industry, it still means quite another. For the disposed, it means for each person to do with himself as they please. For the Titans, it means for them to do as they please with other men and the product of other men's labor anywhere in the world. As Lincoln said, ``And it follows that each of the things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and incompatible names: liberty and tyranny.'' 
   That is why the efforts to name the great hall Liberty Hall will settle for some but still not settle for others the fundamental question of human freedom. For millions of Americans to pass through Emancipation Hall and not Liberty Hall is an important acknowledgment about the process for attaining human freedom in the American historical context. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is most appropriate that the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Zach Wamp, offered this amendment, in conjunction with the gentleman from Illinois, to help establish a marker in the Capitol of the United States about the significant role that these Americans, these Africans, played in the process not only in constructing the temple of our democracy but in strengthening America. 
   Madam Chair, it is probably most appropriate that the Emancipation Hall designation be established during this Thanksgiving period, as the first Thanksgiving established by proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln was during the American Civil War when President Lincoln, on October 3, 1863, looked out over a Nation torn by war, ravaged by internecine, intrafamily and interfamily struggles, and concluded that because of the extraordinary efforts of the North and the South, men and women who thought their causes were just, that we needed a national day of thanks. And so on October 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln affixed to a national proclamation a national day of thanks to say thank you for now until eternity for all of the blessings that have been bestowed upon our Nation. 
   Thanksgiving has a lot less to do, Mr. Speaker, with Pilgrims in 1620 and much more to do with the emancipation of human freedom. 
   I thank the gentlewoman for the time.  
   Lincoln understood for his time and ours that we must not be confused about the language and process of human freedom. 
   Much has been said about Lincoln and his ambivalence about emancipation. I believe when placed in context greater clarity emerges in Lincoln's calculation of emancipation. 
   In 1862, Lincoln's announced support of colonization, along with his lack of public support for emancipation, was generating sometimes vicious attacks from militant abolitionists, including a ``Prayer for Twenty Millions'' editorial urging emancipation that appeared in Horace Greeley's New York Tribune. On August 22, a month after the private announcement to his cabinet on July 22 that he intended to issue an Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln replied to Greeley's editorial with a masterfully written open letter:  
   If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause.  
   Lincoln was reiterating his central thesis, that the purpose of the war was preservation of the Union, but in light of the intransigence of the border States, he was publicly hinting that he might have to do something more, including emancipation, to save the Union. In this open letter, Lincoln was saying ``if,'' but he had already concluded in his own mind ``that'' the only way to save the Union was to free the slaves. 
   After the emancipation proposal became public, Lincoln was sometimes ridiculed in political oratory and newspaper editorials about  his Emancipation Proclamation, which would free the slaves only where the president had no power to do so--in the rebel southern States--but preserve the institution everywhere else. But Lincoln's enemies either misunderstood the president, lacked his understanding of the Constitution, or ignored his politics. On saving the Union, Lincoln had additional flexibility under the Constitution. Politically, he could sometimes get away with violating it by engaging in arbitrary arrests and suspending the writ of habeas corpus. On the question of ending slavery, however, Lincoln saw no such flexibility. His understanding of the Constitution committed him to acting within both it and the law, for neither had yet been changed. Under the Constitution, slavery was still legal in the United States. 
   On the first question, Lincoln and all Republicans agreed that a Thirteenth Amendment outlawing slavery must be added to the Constitution. The Senate quickly passed such an amendment, but the House--which had gained thirty-four Democrats in the 1862 midterm elections--was opposed. 
   Lincoln understood, if others didn't, that issuing the Emancipation Proclamation would convert a struggling Union army, trying to hold a Nation together, into a liberation army to free the slaves. The newly freed slaves could help win the struggle by fighting alongside the Union soldiers. Of course, the liberation of slaves would happen only if the North won the war. Militant abolitionists still thought the proclamation weak, southerners thought it an outrage, but most antislavery advocates, both black and white, understood its revolutionary implications. It was the one act that changed the entire character of the war. It gave the war a moral purpose--human freedom--to bolster the political goal of saving the Union. And a purpose with such deep emotional power condemned the Confederacy to sure defeat. 
   The question now was, having transformed the conflict into a war of liberation, would the northern Union soldiers still fight? Some said no. ``An Ohio Democrat amended the party's slogan to proclaim, `the Constitution as it is, the Union as it was, the Niggers where they are.' '' But most said yes! ``A Democratic private in the Army of the Potomac whose previous letters had railed against abolitionists and blacks now expressed support for `putting away any institution if by so doing it will put down the rebellion, for I hold that nothing should stand in the way of the Union--niggers, nor anything else.' '' 
   With the July 4, 1863 victory at Gettysburg and Vicksburg northern hopes rose and southern spirits sank. 
   The burial of the Gettysburg dead was originally planned for October 23 but rescheduled to November 19 because the principal orator, Edward Everett of Massachusetts, could not be ready before then. Lincoln, by comparison, was casually invited to attend and make a few remarks. ``No insult was intended. Federal responsibility or participation was not assumed, then, in state activities. And Lincoln took no offense. Though specifically invited to deliver only `a few appropriate remarks' to open the cemetery, he meant to use this opportunity. The partly mythical victory of Gettysburg was important to his administration's war propaganda.'' 
   There are mythical accounts that Lincoln wrote his Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope. Even though the 272-word speech probably took less than three minutes to deliver--interrupted with applause five times by the twenty thousand in attendance--such cavalier preparation would have been totally uncharacteristic of Lincoln, who took such opportunities very seriously. 
   Lincoln intended to use this occasion and speech to lift the Nation's eyes above the death and carnage of Gettysburg ``to a level of abstraction that purges it of grosser matter ..... Lincoln did for the whole Civil War what he accomplished for the single battlefield.'' He transformed its meaning and in so doing transformed what it meant to be an American. 
   Lincoln mentioned neither slavery nor Gettysburg. He drained his speech of all particulars in order to lift up an ideal. Lincoln intended to create something good and new out of this tragic and bloody episode. Both North and South strove to interpret Gettysburg to further their own war interests. Lincoln was after an even bigger victory--winning the ideological as well as the military war. And he succeeded. ``The Civil War is, to most Americans, what Lincoln wanted it to mean. Words had to complete the word of the guns.'' 
   When we wave the flag and celebrate on July 4, Independence Day, we are not so much celebrating our American-ness in terms of our independence from England. We are celebrating the meaning of the flag and America as Lincoln interpreted them in his Gettysburg Address. At Gettysburg, Lincoln reinterpreted the Constitution. Looking past slavery in the Constitution, he appealed to the Declaration of Independence and its claim that ``all men are created equal.'' Conservative political ``heirs to his outrage still attack Lincoln for subverting the Constitution at Gettysburg.''  
   Lincoln is here not only to sweeten the air at Gettysburg, but to clear the infected atmosphere of American history itself, tainted with official sins and inherited guilt. He would cleanse the Constitution--not, as William Lloyd Garrison had, by burning an instrument that countenanced slavery. He altered the document from within, by appeal from its letter to the spirit, subtly changing the recalcitrant stuff that legal compromise, bringing it to its own indictment. By implicitly doing this, he performed one of the most daring acts of open-air sleight-of-hand ever witnessed by the unsuspecting. Everyone in that vast throng of thousands was having his or her intellectual pocket picked. The crowd departed with a new thing in its ideological luggage, that new Constitution Lincoln has substituted for the one they brought there with them. They walked off, from those curving graves on the hillside, under a changed sky, into a different America. Lincoln has revolutionized the Revolution, giving people a new past to live with that would change their future indefinitely.  
   Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was transforming the United States from a plural to a singular noun--from the United States are into the United States is a free government. 
   According to Garry Wills, Lincoln, by his words and action, converted the Union from a mystical hope into a constitutional reality. 
   July 4, 1776--only white men could vote; July 4, 1863--Gettysburg; July 4, 2007: Barack Obama, an African American, Hillary Clinton, a woman, Mitt Romney, a Mormon, All are candidates for President; America and what it means to be an American today will not be the same definition of what it means to be an American tomorrow. We are all part of the Emancipation process. 
   A bit of trivia, when was the first Thanksgiving? 1620. Why? Landing of Plymouth Rock. Interesting, because the first slaves arrived in Jamestown in 1619. 
   In November 1863, Abraham Lincoln looked out over a Nation ravaged by war, internecine warfare, intra and inter family feuding, and saw light at the end of the tunnel for Northern victory and proclaimed the 3rd Thursday in November as a national day of thanks. Proclamation of Thanksgiving:   
   WASHINGTON, DC, 
   October 3, 1863. 
   This is the proclamation which set the precedent for America's national day of Thanksgiving. During his administration, President Lincoln issued many orders like this. For example, on November 28, 1861, he ordered government departments closed for a local day of thanksgiving. 
   Sarah Josepha Hale, a prominent magazine editor, wrote a letter to Lincoln on November 28, 1863, urging him to have the ``day of our annual Thanksgiving made a National and fixed Union Festival. `` She wrote, ``You may have observed that, for some years past, there has been an increasing interest felt in our land to have the Thanksgiving held on the same day, in all the States; it now needs National recognition and authoritive fixation, only, to become permanently, an American custom and institution. `` The document below sets apart the last Thursday of November ``as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise. `` 
   According to an April 1, 1864, letter from John Nicolay, one of President Lincoln's secretaries, this document was written by Secretary of State William Seward, and the original was in his handwriting. On October 3, 1863, fellow Cabinet member Gideon Welles recorded in his diary that he complimented Seward on his work. A year later the manuscript was sold to benefit Union troops.

<DOCNO>Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. (LIBERIA DESIGNATION EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3123 and want to thank the gentleman from Rhode Island, my friend Congressman KENNEDY, for his leadership and hard work on this issue. This bill provides support and assistance to our ally Liberia, during a critical time in its social and economic reform and recovery. 
   Specifically, this bill extends until October 1, 2008, the designation of Liberians living in this country under Temporary Protected Status, TPS. The Department of Homeland Security estimates that only 3,600 Liberians are currently eligible for TPS. Many of these Liberians have been in the U.S. for more than 16 years, and all of them have been here for a minimum of 5 years. 
   TPS is a temporary immigration status granted to eligible nationals of designated countries. In 1990, as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, Congress established a procedure by which the Attorney General, and now DHS, may provide TPS to people in the United States who are temporarily unable to safely return to their home country because of ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions. During the period for which a country has been designated for TPS, TPS beneficiaries may remain in the United States and may obtain work authorization. However, TPS does not lead to permanent resident status, and TPS holders are not illegal immigrants. 
   Since 1989, Liberia has been ravaged by two brutal civil wars, which have destabilized the region, displaced hundreds of thousands of people, and destroyed the country's economy and infrastructure. In recognition of these conditions, the United States has protected some 3,600 Liberians in the U.S. from having to return to Liberia. 
   Recently, DHS has decided to terminate these temporary protections in light of the fact that Liberia's civil wars have finally ended and in anticipation of the political stability that newly-elected President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf will bring. However, while there is no question that President Johnson Sirleaf has put Liberia on the road to recovery, that road will unfortunately be very long. 
   According to a 2006 United Nations report, Liberia is currently enduring an 85 percent unemployment rate and it continues to be one of the poorest countries in the world. Improvements to the country's infrastructure following the war have come slowly, and it continues to suffer from severe shortages in electricity and running water. The country also lacks adequate medical care, as a mere 26 physicians currently practice medicine for a population of some 3.4 million people. 
   According to Liberian Government officials, their nation is not yet in a position to provide returnees with employment, housing, health services, education services, and other necessary amenities and services. Due to these and other issues, the Liberian Government has stated that the country cannot absorb and provide for the estimated 3,600 Liberians who would be required to return to their homeland. 
   As an aside, Liberians in the U.S. also provide financial assistance, including remittances averaging about $6 million monthly, to the Liberian economy. These transfers constitute a vital source of financial assistance and economic stability during the country's still-nascent period of recovery. 
   President Johnson Sirleaf stated during her address to Congress in March 2006: ``For those unable to come back home now, we must appeal to you to grant them continuing protection status, and residency where appropriate, to put them in a condition to contribute to their country's reform and development.'' 
   For these reasons, and in order to support Liberia as it emerges from two decades of dictatorship and civil war, I strongly support H.R. 3123 and urge its passage.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007, and I want to congratulate my good friend from California, Ms. LEE, on producing the bill before us today. 
   H.R. 180 would put much needed pressure on the Government of Sudan by, (1) prohibiting the U.S. Government from entering into contracts with companies fueling the genocide, (2) authorizing states to divest from the worst offending companies in Sudan, and (3) authorizing states to prohibit contracts with companies fueling the genocide. This bill is necessary because states deserve protection for acting as responsible and moral market participants. Furthermore, this legislation does not affect American companies, and its provisions would expire once the genocide has ended. 
   In 2004, I traveled to Darfur to see this devastation first hand. I was shocked and appalled at the level of human suffering. As the vice-chair of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I have tried to improve conditions in Darfur with humanitarian aid and peacekeeping funds, but more must be done. 
   This bill begins to do the things that our humanitarian aid and our peacekeeping funds can't--address corporate and social responsibility and put additional pressure on the Khartoum government to end the genocide. 
   Again, I congratulate the gentlewoman for her legislation, and I strongly urge an aye vote for H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I was deeply saddened to learn that Henry J. Hyde passed away on Thursday, November 29, 2007. I know I join my colleagues both past and present in thanking this truly remarkable man for his contribution to this country. 
   Former Representative Henry Hyde served his country honorably both in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Representative Hyde was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1975, where he later served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the House International Relations Committee. 
   During his tenure in Congress, Henry Hyde will most be remembered for leading the impeachment proceedings against former President Bill Clinton and for his staunch opposition to abortion rights, both issues on which he and I strongly differed. Despite my opposition, Henry Hyde always took principled stands on issues and legislation and personified what it means to be called ``The Honorable.'' 
   Henry Hyde had always been considerate to me, generous with his time and extremely helpful to me as a legislator. Not long after I was sworn in as a new Member, he acted as a mentor and we became close friends despite our political and ideological differences. I was pleased to work with Henry on ``The Hyde-Jackson Partnership,'' the effort to bring a third airport to the Chicagoland region. On this specific issue, I owe Congressman Hyde a debt of gratitude for his leadership, public service, experience and wisdom. 
   I will miss my good friend and trusted mentor and my deepest condolences go out to his family.

   You have heard from some of my colleagues about the many firsts that Juanita achieved here in the Congress of the United States, including serving as the first African American woman to chair a full committee in the United States House of Representatives. But I just want to take a moment to reflect upon an aspect of her strength that was not readily apparent but clearly on display long before she came to Congress. While some of us have focused on the life that she lived, I want to talk about the Juanita Millender-McDonald who did not believe in self-pity but believed in using what she had to make a difference. 
   While many of my colleagues will come to this mike and talk about the life that she lived and her service to a grateful Nation, Juanita Millender-McDonald taught us something about character in her transition. No self-pity. Not a single Member of Congress knew that Juanita was ailing and that her ailment was terminal. Juanita did not want to walk around the House of Representatives and have Members of Congress feeling pity for her or feeling sad for her or making special speeches or concessions to her. She wanted all of us to recognize that we live our lives as if life is certain and death is uncertain, when in reality it is death that is certain and life that is uncertain. And, therefore, each of us is under an obligation to do the very best that we can with the time that God has given us on this Earth and in this world. 
   The Bible talks about serving this present age. ``O may all my powers be engaged to do my Master's will.'' Clearly the type of ailment that ailed our colleague and our close and dear friend, Juanita Millender-McDonald, was not the kind of ailment that strikes one suddenly. She knew about it for quite some time and chose not to share it with Members of Congress. That is a statement about her dignity. It is a statement about her commitment to public service. It is a statement about character. And it is a statement about her strength under extraordinarily life-threatening odds. 
   Juanita Millender-McDonald was married, she raised five children, and then went to college to launch an impressive and inspiring career at an age when many people start slowing down. She combined higher education with her native Alabama wisdom and she set out to show women and men in life and in death that no matter where you came from, you can go where you want to go. She was a living example of the power of not only keeping your eyes on the prize but putting in the old-fashioned elbow grease to earn it. 
   No self-pity. She didn't want people looking down on her or feeling bad about her or seeing her physical ailments. No self-pity. She possessed the necessary tough-mindedness combined with the tenderheartedness that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. talked about. She understood, and Dr. King wrote, ``There is little hope for us until we become tough-minded enough to break loose from the shackles of prejudice, half-truths and downright ignorance. The shape of the world today does not  permit us the luxury of soft-mindedness. A nation or civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men and women purchases its own spiritual death on an installment plan.'' 
   I am proud to have had the opportunity to serve with Juanita Millender-McDonald, and once again I send my condolences to those who loved her. The House and the Nation have lost a dedicated public servant and someone who in life and death has taught us the meaning of character.

<DOCNO>Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. (PROVIDING TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO PUBLIC LAW 109-116 -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2206, a bill that simply provides technical corrections to Public Law 109-116. 
   This legislation authorizes the Architect of the Capitol to enter into agreement on behalf of the Joint Committee of the Library to acquire a statue of Mrs. Rosa Parks. It also extends the time period for that agreement by 2 years. 
   In 2005, it was my privilege to introduce this very important legislation with Senator John Kerry and Senator Mitch McConnell of the other body to honor the life and work of the late Mrs. Rosa Parks by placing a statue in National Statuary Hall. 
   Everyone knows the story of how Mrs. Parks helped spark the modern civil rights movement when she refused to give up her seat on a legally segregated bus that fateful day, December 1, 1955, leading to the Montgomery bus boycott and the emergence of Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   From the beginning, Mrs. Parks led a life dedicated to social change, becoming an active member of the Montgomery, Alabama, chapter of the NAACP, which in the 1940s and 1950s was considered a dangerous organization. It could cost you your job. It could even cost you your life. 
   In 1943, along with the State president of the NAACP, she mobilized a historic voter registration drive in Montgomery and was later elected NAACP chapter secretary. Mrs. Parks was a courageous woman who possessed the firm and quiet strength necessary to challenge injustice. 
   Following the 1954 Brown Supreme Court decision which provided equal protection under the law's legal framework, her refusal to give up her seat eventually led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the 1968 Open Housing Act, all of which helped make America better for all Americans. 
   Rosa Parks remained a committed activist until the end of her life. In the 1980s, she worked in support of the South Africa anti-apartheid movement. In Detroit with Congressman John Conyers in 1997, she founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, a career counseling center for African American youth. 
   With dignity, with grace and with courage, Rosa Parks inspired generations and helped to make the world a more just and compassionate place. In life she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, the highest honors our Nation bestows on civilians. 
   This placing of a Rosa Parks statue in National Statuary Hall is a testament to the fact that the long arc of history bends towards freedom and justice and equality. When Statuary Hall was created by law in 1864, African Americans could not be citizens of the United States. Indeed, the term ``African Americans'' did not exist. Under that law it was impossible for us to be considered favorite sons or favorite daughters of States. 
   When Rosa Parks takes her place in National Statuary Hall, she takes with her Frederick Douglass. She takes with her the United States coloreds troops. She takes with her Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. She takes them there. Indeed, she takes the legacy and history of redefining what it means to be an American for all Americans as she takes her place among the enormous statues that presently represent the various States within that great Hall. 
   She takes with her countless nameless people of African descent, who from slavery to today, sacrificed for an America many would never live to see. 
   As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose half statue is not in Statuary  Hall, would implore us, Now is the time. 
   I want to thank Senator Feinstein for introducing this bill in the other body. I want to thank Matt McGowan and Khalil Abboud from the Joint Committee on the Library for diligently working to get this extension enacted into law. I want to thank Barbara Wolanin from the Architect of the Capitol's Office for working with all of us to make sure that the goals of my original bill are realized. 
   I want to thank Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Ehlers for their sensitivity on this critical issue at this critical hour. And I want to thank in a special way our late Chair, Juanita Millender-McDonald, who worked with me tirelessly on this effort. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, I might add that in the 13 years I have had the privilege of serving in this body, I have only missed two votes: one vote because my pager died and the battery did not forward my pager the power to let me know to vote; and the other vote was when I was on the other side of the aisle so overwhelmed by the number of Republicans who were willing to sign onto a Rosa Parks statue in Statuary Hall that the Democratic clerks could not find me to tell me to vote. I was overwhelmed by that occasion. 
   I am hoping, Mr. Speaker, that today Members of Congress will once again vote ``aye'' on S. 2206. I know of no American more worthy of an honor than the late Mrs. Rosa Parks.

<DOCNO>Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of our national security, in support of our troops, and in favor of this resolution. 
   This measure is a first and important step in preventing the President's ill-conceived escalation plan; reversing our present, perilous course; and ultimately bringing our brave troops home from Iraq. 
   Mr. President, when in a deep hole, stop digging. 
   But rather than searching for a way out, the President proposes to dig down deeper, plunging further into a dark abyss. Blinded by ideology and steeped in delusion, the administration's answer to the chaos in Iraq is to send an additional 21,500 troops into the middle of it. 
   I do not support the President's shortsighted, wrong-headed, reckless approach. And on behalf of the American people, this House must act now to stop the continuation of an ambiguous, constantly changing, open-ended engagement in Iraq.  
   During the last 4 years, our men and women in uniform have answered the call of duty. They have demonstrated true courage and bravery and honor. They have served our Nation valiantly, even as many civilian leaders have failed them. 
   I mourn the loss of 3,100 Americans who died, 95 of whom are from my home State of Illinois. I pray for the thousands who have been seriously wounded and permanently disabled. And I have voted again and again to ensure that our troops in Iraq had the body armor and the equipment that they need to protect their lives and discharge their duties. 
   Tragically, the war in Iraq is a case study in ``mission creep.'' And the fact is no amount of troops can successfully complete a mission that is unclear, that is ill-defined, that is muddled and mutable. 
   During the run-up to the first gulf war, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell, put forth eight criteria to be met for military action. Among the critical questions posed by the Powell doctrine were the following: Do we have a clear attainable objective? Is there a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement? Have the consequences of our actions been fully considered? 
   The answer to each question when applied to Iraq today is the same as it has been since the start of this war: no, no, and no.     
   With the help of its author, the Powell Doctrine was shredded to bits and the mission in Iraq is adrift. 
   Consider this: On September 12, 2002, President Bush challenged world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly session to confront the grave and gathering danger posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. However, no weapons of mass destruction were found there. 
   Then President Bush shifted his justification, arguing that the war was about liberating Iraqis from a brutal dictator. But in December 2003, 4 years ago, Saddam Hussein was found and captured. He has since been tried and hanged for crimes against humanity. 
   After Saddam was taken into custody, President Bush claimed that the mission was to spread democracy throughout the Middle East. Yet Iraq has deteriorated into sectarian violence erupting into a bloody civil war. 
   Now, with the violence increasing, the President says our mission is to confront the terrorists in Iraq so we don't have to face them here at home. However, according to government intelligence, the war in Iraq has helped recruit more terrorists, not vanquish them. 
   Madam Speaker, now is not the time to close our eyes, cross our fingers and stay the course. We cannot continue to engage in the same action and expect a different result. We should not send more of our soldiers to the desert on a mission that shifts like the sands beneath their boots. 
   The President's plan attempts to impose a half-baked, unworkable military solution, when Iraq needs a political one. Rather than a military escalation, this situation in Iraq requires a diplomatic and political intensification. The American military must stand down, so the Iraqi people can stand up and seek a political settlement and assume responsibility for their own future. The Iraqi government must engage in negotiations and compromises that balance the power of provincial and central governments, share oil revenues and protect the rights of every Iraqi citizen. 
   The Iraq Study Group, co-chaired by James Baker and Lee Hamilton, released a report in December stating the same. They said the security situation cannot improve unless leaders act in support of national reconciliation. There is no action the American military can take by itself that can bring about success in Iraq. 
   As Democrats, we support our troops, but we don't support the Commander in Chief squandering billions of our tax dollars and recklessly putting our brave soldiers in the cross-hairs of someone else's civil war. I believe our domestic national security rests on redeploying our military forces from Iraq in order to build more consensus in the Middle East. 
   To conclude, Madam Speaker, I support this resolution opposing President Bush's failed policy of escalation. It is time to bring a responsible end to this war, to bring our troops home, and to bring them home right now.

<DOCNO>Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   We have just provided $2.863 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq's diplomatic operations and reconstruction. As the gentleman has accurately noted in committee, the funding in this supplemental is tied up d ue to benchmarks; benchmarks that reflect the will of the American people and the Congress; benchmarks that presumably reflect the President's concurrence, as he signed them into law; benchmarks that can be argued are in the best interest of Iraq in becoming a stable democracy.     
   Furthermore, I believe the gentleman' s argument is not valid, as the $2.863 billion we just provided will be available long before this bill comes back from the President's desk signed. Additionally, while I believe we provided sufficient funds for Iraq, I want to point out that the administration should substantially expend the funds that we have provided before Congress provides additional funding for the exact same purposes. Besides, Congress provided an extension of the authority to deobligate and then to reobligate prior-year appropriatio ns to the Iraq Relief Construction Fund, which, as of May 1, 2007, had $3.119 billion in unexpended balances. 
   In the committee, the gentleman raised the issue of visible support, as my last colleague raised in his remarks. I take a little bit of offense to that, because I think that every day our troops, our diplomats and aid workers are in harm's way, we show the greatest levels of support. What's more, none of the funding in the gentleman's amendment would go towards providing a safer environment for our men and women serving in the country of Iraq. We just provided $2.863 billion. 
   So let's take the gentleman's amendment apart for a moment and be clear on what we are considering. This amendment is requesting $140 million in additional funding for democracy, rule of law and governance programs. The supplemental provides $250 million for democracy activities; $67.6 million for civil society, and $57.4 million targeted for development, $125 million in governance programs, and $150 million in rule of la w activities. 
   On page 58, line 18, the amendment is requesting $16 million in additional funding for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, and demining activities. I want to make a couple of points about that. 
   The recently passed supplemental provided $7 million for demining in Iraq. We do not appropriate nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining-related program accounts by country. We appropriate this account by program to allow the administration the flexibility to adjust to emerging priorities and o pportunities. This amendment would seek to change that and radically affects how the President performs his duties. 
   Additionally, this bill, and I want to emphasize this, this bill for the first time fully funds the President's request for NADR, something I would note that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle could not claim when they were in the majority. The humanitarian demining account is funded at the President's requested level of $56.5 million. It does not need further funding. 
   On pag e 63, line 23, of the gentleman's amendment, where he requests an additional $2 million, the amendment is requesting this $2 million for foreign language training of Iraqi Security Forces. To date, we have provided $18 billion in training for the Iraqi Security Forces. $2 million. Where does this figure come from? We have provided $18 billion, and, now the distinguished ranking member seeks an additional $2 million. 
   We have provided sufficient funding. Most of these accounts and numbers are unexpended. The administration should substantially expend those funds we have provided before Congress  provides additional funding for the exact same purposes, Mr. Chairman. 
   Lastly, what is more, none of the funding in the gentleman's amendment would go toward providing a safer environment for our men and women serving in the country of Iraq. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Lowey) for yielding.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairwoman for yielding me the time. 
   The question here is one of unexpended balances. The amendment is requesting an additional $140 million for rule of law democracy-related programs, but the supplemental that is still warm on the President's desk provide d $250 million for those democracy activities, and they have not been expended; $67.6 million for civil society and $57.4 million targeted for development for $125 million in governance programs, and they still haven't been expended; $150 million in rule of law activities that have not been expended as we move forward with the surge. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, it is premature to request $140 million additional dollars, page 40, line 26 of the gentleman's amendment, for moneys that have not been expended that the Congress just voted on in this particular bill. The same can be said of the gentleman's request on page 58, line 18, and page 63, line 23, $2 million. We have $18 billion to date appropriated for Iraqi Security  Forces. Where does the figure $2 million come from? It comes from nowhere, Mr. Chairman. 
   Support the chairwoman's request to defeat this amendment.

Is this a funding in addition to that funding?

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, let me be clear, we are in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. I understand that the gentleman is going to withdraw his amendment, but let me be clear, the various international organizations for which this account is designated and the dues that we pay not only to the U.N. but to other member or ganizations that our country is a part of, believe me when I tell you, the State Department has made it very clear in each of those organizations that we are in a global war on terror and our contributions to those organizations, part of our mandatory obligations to those organizations for which the gentleman seeks to cut funding, would quite frankly undermine our ability to maintain our own status within those international organizations as we try to direct the global war on terror. 
   The spirit of the g entleman's amendment, some aspects of it are actually covered in the supplemental bill and some aspects of it are obviously covered in our bill, is something that is very difficult to argue against, an additional $20 million for demining activities. Part of this amendment was offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) in his amendment, and it is something in principle that we can support. 
   Sufficient in this bill are the resources to advance democracy activities and demining activities, but b y cutting aid to international organizations and contributions, cutting our contribution, our mandatory contribution to those organizations, is something that I believe the chairman and the majority would reject.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, the language in the bill provides the President flexibility, not mandates. The gentleman's amendment seems to be more interested in bean-count ing than saving and treating those with HIV/AIDS. Is it more important to make sure that 33 cents out of every dollar, according to the gentleman's amendment, go to abstinence or that we give the President some flexibility if, that is if, he needs it? 
   We all know that HIV/AIDS prevention programs must be targeted to the group that we are seeking to influence and when abstinence programs may be appropriate for some groups, including the very young. I want to raise to my colleagues' attention that the und erlying language in the bill that provides flexibility enjoys broad support from groups that are working on the ground. 
   I have a letter from the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatrics AIDS Foundation urging a ``no'' vote on the Pitts amendment. 
   I have a letter from CARE, one of the world's leading NGOs providing AIDS care and prevention services, urging a ``no'' vote on the Pitts amendment. 
   I have a letter from the General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church urging a ``no'' vote on t he Pitts amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues and their counsel and to vote ``no'' on the Pitts amendment. 
   In fact, Mr. Chairman, I would like to quote the distinguished ranking Republican member who said this on the floor last night: 
   ``I believe this bill has the potential to do a lot of good, and I want to say that this bill will help save a lot of lives not only here but around the world. This is the work of the Lord. And I know Members are going to come down here and they're going to be against t his bill. And I hope that we can change some of the things to prevent a veto, but this bill eventually when it passes, and it will pass, assuming it will be vetoed, is really about feeding the poor, the hungry, the naked and the sick. Almost a better title would be the Matthew 25 bill. So it has the potential to do a lot of good and I hope to work with the chairwoman to ensure the State Department has what it needs to do these things.'' 
   Matthew 25 is very clear, Mr. Chairman: 
   Then the king will say to those on his right, ``Come you who are blessed by my father, take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came after me.'' 
   Then the righteous will answer him, ``Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see a stranger and invite you in? Or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison or did we go visit you?'' 
   The king will reply, ``I will tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these, my brethren, you did it unto me.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, the people need medicine, not self-righteousness. Reject the Pitts amendment.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I thank the ranking member for yielding. 
   I think that clearly the ranking member is one of the extraordinary Members of this Congress, who has enormous credibility across a wide range of issues. But I think, given that the ranking member's arguments in committee are so substantive and so sound, I want to make it clear, at least for Members, about the context of the debate. And if the chairman would correct me if I'm wrong. 
   Many of the NGOs that we are talking about are also the same NGOs that provide primary care in many of these villages for which the language is directed. If we provide them with Child Survival funds, are these medicines fungible for the same NGOs? In many of these villages in the Third World, it's not that there are three or four doctors in the village, it's the same doctor. There is a shortage of doctors and nurses. It's the same doctors being sponsored by the same NGOs on the ground in these villages. They're either providing primary care, preventive care, making recommendations to people within the village on how they should behave and/or what are necessary to address their primary care issues. 
   If we provide them with AIDS treatments, are those same AIDS treatments fungible? And how is it that we can sit here and argue, at least from Washington, a different reality that is taking place on the ground where these issues are taking place? If the chairman would respond. I ask for the committee's indulgence.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. I don't plan to use all of the 2 minutes. 
   This amendment jeopardizes greatly the national security of the United States. It devastates program increases in key diplomatic functions that the Secretary of State has requested, in particular in the State Department. 
   This bill is already $700 million below the President of the United States' request. And for the gentleman to offer an amendment to cut this bill $2.9 billion across the board has profound implications for the committee product.  
   I would encourage Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to reject this amendment.

   Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   While talking about how we arrived at this deficit for new Members who are joining the body can be long and drawn out, but the number of tax decreases that we have voted on in this Congress under their leadership which greatly contributed to the enormous deficit that we presently confront, it would require several hours of discussion and probably pull some scabs off of some wounds that aren't worthy of discussion. 
   I do want to talk about the implications, however, of this particular cut on this bill. 
   This bill is already $700 million beneath the President's request. The last I checked, the President of the United States is not from the majority party. The President of the United States is from the minority party. He is already suggesting that the bill itself is beneath the funding levels that he is requesting for the national security of the United States. 
   But don't believe me. Believe the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Wolf, who said last night that he believes this is a good bill, that this bill has the potential to do a lot of good. 
   I quote him: ``And I want to say that this bill will help save a lot of lives, not only here but around the world. This is the work of the Lord. And I know Members are going to come down here, and here they come, and they are going to be against this bill. And I hope that we can change some of the things to prevent a veto. But this bill eventually, when it passes,'' as the ranking member said, ``assuming it will be vetoed, is really about feeding the poor, about the hungry, the naked and the sick. Almost a better title would be the Matthew 25 bill. So it is has the potential to do a lot of good, and I hope to work with Chairwoman Lowey to ensure that the State Department has what it needs to do these things, the war on terror, to provide humanitarian assistance to the most needy, and to improve human rights around the world.'' 
   And the gentleman offers a cut to the ranking member's acknowledgment of how important this product is. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, if this is the Matthew 25 bill, according to Matthew 25, which I repeated earlier, and these gentleman who obviously have come down here at the 11th hour to message on this bill, they missed this part of the statement when I read it earlier, but I will be happy to read it again: 
   Then the king will say to those on the right: ``Come you who are blessed by my father. Take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you invited me in. I needed clothes and you clothed me. I was sick and you looked after me. I was in prison and you came to visit me.'' 
   Then the righteous will answer him: ``Lord, when did we see you hungry and  feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in? Or needing clothes to clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison go to visit you?'' 
   The king will reply: ``I tell you, whatever you have done for the least of these, my brethren, you have done it unto me.'' 
   Reject the gentleman's amendment. The gentleman's amendment goes to the heart of this bill, which is designed to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and liberate the captive.
