   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, tonight we do something different, something out of the ordinary. The American people are accustomed to tuning into C-SPAN and watching Democrats yelling at Republicans and Republicans yelling at Democrats. There is a Democratic Special Order and there is a Republican Special Order. C-SPAN has become a channel that requires a parental advisory before kids are able to watch. It has become unsafe because of all the screaming and yelling. 
   Tonight we do something different. Tonight we have a bipartisan Special Order. Tonight Democrats and Republicans will spend some time not focusing on our disagreements, not fighting with one another, not talking about the left and the right, although this is a place where there should be discussion about left and right, but focusing on moving forward, focusing on specific solutions and ideas with respect to Iraq that will move us forward. 
   The plain fact is that Democrats and Republicans are are going to disagree on some fundamental issues. Maybe we are going to disagree on 60 or 70 percent of the issues, but we do agree on the 30 to 40 percent that is left. The problem is that we have allowed ourselves to be paralyzed on our agreements because we are so busy disagreeing with one another. 
   Well, 2 years ago we found the Center Aisle Caucus, a bipartisan group of 50 Democrats and Republicans who meet routinely not to talk about our disagreements, we know where we are going to disagree, but to see if we can carve out areas of agreement. To talk not about the left or the right, but to talk about the way forward. 
   We have convened a series of meetings specifically pertaining to Iraq. Tonight I am joined by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest), a Marine veteran who has been involved in those meetings and talked about bipartisanship and finding common ground and important solutions. 
   I am joined by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson) who has become very active, a leader in the Center  Aisle Caucus, who also understands the importance of engaging one another and talking about moving forward rather than left and right. 
   We will be joined by other colleagues. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent) who has been proposing with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) that we integrate the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group into policy as we move forward. 
   I will be talking about two bipartisan solutions that I have been submitting. One, directing that the President submit a status of forces agreement to the Government of Iraq as a signal that we are not in Iraq to stay, to occupy, but that Iraq is a sovereign government responsible for its security. I believe that status of forces agreement, which we have in almost every country where we have a military presence, would be a very important signal to the Iraqi people and to our own forces. 
   Secondly, I will be talking about bipartisan legislation that I have introduced with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) to expedite the process of bringing a variety of Iraqi refugees to the United States, those refugees who have served coalition forces as interpreters, as translators, who have risked their lives and now have to go through a bureaucratic nightmare to leave Iraq and come here. We will talk about that as well. 
   The final point I want to make before I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson) is this: yesterday I visited the Walter Reed Army Hospital. I visited with about seven soldiers who have sustained some very serious wounds in Iraq. I visited with one of my constituents who had his foot amputated. I visited with another Long Islander who found it very difficult to talk, very difficult to breathe. I visited with a soldier who was being discharged yesterday afternoon and will now begin outpatient treatment. 
   Ultimately, I believe and the Members who will join me this evening believe that our obligation is to them. It is not to the left or to the right. It is to them. They do not want the United States Congress to be engaged in partisan paralysis and bickering. That will not end the war. They want us to try and find common ground. I am under no illusions that whatever we discuss tonight, and the gentleman from Maryland and the gentleman from Texas and the other Members and myself, will end the war tomorrow. I wish we could end the war tomorrow. 
   The fact of the matter is that for as long as we are here together on the floor of the House, we have an obligation to try and work with one another on areas where we can agree. We can fight honorably, we can disagree respectfully on all matters of policy; but we have an obligation to move forward on areas where there is agreement. That is what the Center Aisle Caucus was formed to do. 
   One of our members from Texas served for many years in this distinguished Chamber and has returned to the Congress after a 2-year hiatus. He is somebody who personifies bipartisanship, who has been a leader in this body, whose constituents also expect him to be working hard to move forward rather than left or right, and I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson).

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and I can assure him that he will have ample time this evening to elaborate on his views. 
   We have been joined by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent) who I know is going to speak on some of his priorities and his efforts to bridge the gap between both parties. 
   I would like to yield to one of the most distinguished Members of this House, as I said before, a veteran, someone who I've come to know only recently. I've served in this House for nearly 8 years, and the gentleman from Maryland and I got to know each other only recently with respect to trying to reduce the polarization of this debate. We've had dinner. We met in my office some 2 weeks ago, and I want to commend him for his leadership and his bipartisanship and his desire also to find a way forward rather than right or left, and with that, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest).

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Maryland and I want to underscore the point that he's making. 
   The center aisle is right here, right here in front of me. Those on my side of the center aisle can scream at those on the other side and those on the other side can scream at my side. That's not going to end the war. Again, this is a place, this is a House where we encourage debate and even dissent and disagreement, but the screaming and the vitriol and the partisan attacks will not bring this war to an end. 
   Those of us who are here this evening would prefer to spend our time engaging with one another, disagreeing respectfully on some issues but trying to find that common ground, trying to build that consensus that will bring the war to an end. 
   One of our colleagues who's here, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent), has been working very, very hard on a proposal to integrate the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group into current policy. That was a perfect example of an advanced and high plane of bipartisan dialogue. Members from both parties, experts from around the country, convened in that Iraq Study Group, made recommendations to the administration and to Congress. Many of those recommendations received widespread praise and support but have not been implemented, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania has been working to attempt to take those recommendations and move them forward, take them off the shelf and move them forward in our policy. 
   I yield to my good friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).

   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentleman. 
   Let me focus on just one very specific bipartisan solution that the Center Aisle Caucus has proposed. The gentleman from Pennsylvania alluded to it. It's a status of forces agreement. 
   At the end of the cold war, the United States had permanent status of forces agreements with about 40 countries. Today the number has grown to more than 90, which means that the United States Government has status of forces agreements with nearly half of the countries comprising the world community. Now, what is a status of forces agreement? 
   A status of forces agreement is essentially a negotiated document between the United States Government and a host government where we have a military presence that governs the relationship between the military and that government. It governs our criminal justice issues. It governs a variety of diplomatic and protocol issues. 
   Now, I have been told on my visits to Iraq and in my conversations with Iraqi officials here at home and with American officials that one of the concerns that the population of Iraq has is that we are going to be there forever, that we want to occupy Iraq forever. 
   We don't want to occupy Iraq forever. We don't want to be there one day longer than we need to be. If I had my way, we would be out tomorrow. The fact of the matter is that if the Iraqi people believe that we are there running the place and that they are not a sovereign government, they will never have the capability to stand up their own ministries, to take care of their own security. 
   I have proposed on a bipartisan basis a resolution that asks the President to begin negotiating a status of forces agreement with the sovereign Iraqi Government. 
   You can't expect a government to have a capability if we can't even negotiate an agreement between that government and our government with respect to the presence of military forces. 
   Iraq is a sovereign entity. One of the very important signals that we can send to the Iraqi people and to our population at home is the negotiation of the status of forces agreement. 
   Now, one of the great levels of frustration that I have is that whenever I raise this issue, I am told that we are pushing up against an open door. I am told that mostly everybody agrees that we should have a status of forces agreement in Iraq. 
   In fact, the Jones Commission, which was constituted as a group of highly expert military people assessing the condition of Iraqi security, when they made their recommendations, the number two recommendation in the Jones Commission report was, in fact, the submission of, and I will read directly from the report: ``The second recommendation the Commission wishes to offer is that consideration be given to pursuing an agreement akin to a status of forces agreement with the Government of Iraq. Appropriately drawn, it would have the effect of codifying our relationship with the host nation, reinforcing its sovereignty and independence, and would be consistent with other such agreements we enjoy with many nations where we have a military presence.'' 
   So here you have yet another bipartisan commission recommending yet another idea that everybody can agree on, the Iraqis can agree to it, we can agree to it, Republicans and Democrats can agree to it, except that nobody is making it happen. 
   So I have proposed, as I said before, a resolution, a bipartisan resolution, that simply tells the President to submit a status of forces agreement to negotiation with the Iraqi Government. It begins this process. It signals the Iraqi people that we have no intention of owning Iraq. We are guests there, and they are the host government. 
   This is just one simple move in the right direction, a bipartisan move in the right direction; and I am hoping that the administration will listen to it and vigorously negotiate a status of forces agreement with Iraq. 
   I want to thank my friend from Pennsylvania, who has been active with me on that resolution, for his assistance, and would yield to him if he wants to comment further on it.

   Mr. ISRAEL. I would like to raise another very specific solution, bipartisan solution that the Center Aisle Caucus has with respect to Iraq. 
   Last week, and I know my colleagues may be shocked to hear this, or perhaps they won't be shocked, perhaps they have had the same experience I have, but last week I met with an Iraqi refugee and his family. This individual was a translator for coalition forces, risked his life as a translator. 
   The work that he was doing was saving the lives of our forces, of our military people. He has a wife, a son and a disabled daughter. He decided that Iraq was no longer a safe place for his family. Why? Not just because of the war, but because of the service that he performed for the American military. So he applied for a 
   special immigrant visa, and this is what he was told: 
   First you have to find a general to sign the form. He said, well, I don't know many generals who can sign this form. 
   Can I find someone else? He was told, no, the regulation is that you have to find a general. Well, he found a general who signed, who vouched for his credibility. 
   Then he was told, well, you can't apply for a special immigrant visa here in Iraq. You actually have to leave Iraq, go to another country and apply. 
   Well, that's just mind-boggling. Again, this is somebody who risked his life translating for American forces, and they have saved their lives, when they have translated what the bad guys were saying and what they were planning, and he was told, you have to leave Iraq to submit your visa application. So he found his way with his family to Amman, Jordan. 
   Then he was told, by the way, when you apply for this special immigrant visa, you have got to pay fees, hundreds and hundreds of dollars. This young man didn't have that kind of money. Can you imagine, he was, again, interpreting for our military and then told to leave the country and perhaps save his life; he had to pay a fee for himself, his wife, his son, his disabled daughter. Guess what, he came up with the money. Then he sat for a year in Jordan and waited for them to process the application. 
   I want to make sure that you understand the point that I am making. We are not saying we should open the doors for every single refugee, let them in without being properly vetted, without the proper security checks, without the background checks; but certainly someone who is providing services to the United States military, who had already been vetted by the military, who was saving lives, deserves better than, you have got to leave the country, you have got to find a general to sign the form, you have to pay hundreds of dollars for the form, you have to wait for a year, and then we will see if we can let you in. 
   To top it off, when he finally arrived here, this individual, who has critical military skills, the ability to read and understand what our enemies may be saying about us, was told, well, you have got to find a job somewhere, maybe you can drive a taxi. I think the State Department and Department of Defense ought to be rolling out the red carpet for this individual. 
   One of the most glaring deficiencies we have in our military right now is an inability to translate documents, to hear what our enemies are saying about us. We ought to be hiring these people at whatever salary we can afford to pay them. 
   Then to add insult to injury, when he came here, he asked, well, how do I get various documents? There was no one area to give him some information, nothing. 
   So Frank Wolf, who was the ranking Republican of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee on which I now serve, and I have introduced legislation that would make this system a little easier for people who have already established that they can help the United States. 
   Number one, we would allow our Ambassador in Iraq to have more authority so that he can vouch for the credibility of those who assisted U.S. efforts. 
   Number two, we allow those people to apply for visas at the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate in Iraq. We don't force them to go to another country, Jordan or elsewhere. 
   Number three, we waive fees for those who have demonstrated their support for U.S. forces, their assistance, who have been properly vetted. We help find translators find work in the United States in the military and State Department, and we broaden relocation benefits. 
   Now, who can be against somebody who helped our Armed Forces by translating for them? I can't think of a single person who would say, no, they risked their lives, but we have to make them stay there. We have to make it harder for them and suggest this is another area of bipartisan agreement that we can agree on. 
   I am hopeful that the Israel-Wolf resolution will be passed by the House, passed by the Senate, and signed by the President. 
   I don't know whether any of my colleagues would like to comment on that particular legislation or share some of their thoughts, but I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Maryland.

   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to follow up on one point that the gentleman made, and then I'm going to yield to the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
   Madam Speaker, the gentleman talked about the importance of having a dialogue here on the floor of the House, and I agree. I don't know how we can expect Sunni and Shia and Kurd to reconcile their differences when we seem to be incapable of reconciling our differences. I think we should lead by example. 
   But in addition to engaging one another on the floor of the House, I believe that leadership also involves bringing communities together. And one of the unique things that the Center Aisle Caucus will be doing under the leadership of the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Cramer) and the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Emerson) is to have town hall meetings in each others' districts on Iraq so that we can listen together to the broad range of opinions that are in our districts and bring that back in a bipartisan fashion. 
   And I'm very pleased, Madam Speaker, to have learned that our first bipartisan town hall meeting will be in the district of the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. Cramer from Alabama, Mrs. Emerson from Missouri and I will be traveling to the gentleman's district in Maryland to have a bipartisan town hall that he is convening, and I'm very much looking forward to engaging in that dialogue, and hoping that the gentleman will be educated by what my constituents believe, and that I will be educated by what his constituents believe. 
   With that, I will yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. ISRAEL. And before I yield to the gentleman, I do want to point out that one of the proudest achievements that I believe this Congress has had is that we passed the largest single increase in veterans health care in the 77-year history of the VA. We did that several months ago. I think that's another shining example of bipartisan cooperation that puts the interests of our troops first and subjugates any partisan interests that sometimes occur here.

   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank my friend. 
   Madam Speaker, our time is drawing to a close; so I would like to summarize some of the points that we have made and some of the very specific solutions that the Center Aisle Caucus is pursuing. 
   Number one, we have a bipartisan resolution that would direct the President to submit and negotiate a status of forces agreement with the sovereign government of Iraq. 
   Number two, we believe that if you are a refugee who was providing a critical lifesaving service for U.S. forces as a translator, as an interpreter, or some related position and that you have received death threats and that you want to get your family out of harm's way that we shouldn't make it almost impossible for you to do so, that a compassionate nation would reward you rather than building roadblocks. So we have proposed legislation cosponsored by Mr. Wolf from Virginia and me that would make it a little bit easier for those who have provided a service to the United States military to seek special immigrant status here. 
   Number three, we believe that the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group report ought to be incorporated into policy and not just sit on a shelf, the recommendations for a diplomatic surge and all the other recommendations. Now, we may not agree on every single one of these elements, and we may not agree on every single one of the bills that the Center Aisle Caucus has put forward, but we are trying to build that critical mass and develop consensus on some clear directions. 
   Next, the Center Aisle Caucus will be visiting one another's districts to hold bipartisan town hall meetings because we may not have all of the ideas here. Our jobs are Members of Congress, but we are representatives. We are supposed to represent the views that we hear. So we will be going out on a bipartisan basis to one another's districts to hear those views. 
   One other thing that I didn't have an opportunity to mention and we will mention it in the future is that our colleagues from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper) and from Pennsylvania (Mr. English) are working on a bipartisan Center Aisle assessment of the War Powers Act. As our colleague from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper) said at one of our dinners, ``I fear that one day we as Members of Congress will wake up and find out that we have just launched World War Three and we are reading about it in the newspaper.'' He is very concerned, as is Mr. English, that the War Powers Act needs to be assessed. We want to make sure that we are exercising our constitutional oversight responsibility and that we don't find ourselves in a war without that proper congressional authority and oversight. So they will be convening an assessment of the War Powers Act and making some legislative recommendations. 
   I want to conclude by reiterating something that I said when we opened up, Madam Speaker. We are not going to end the war tomorrow through the Center Aisle Caucus. None of these resolutions will end the war tomorrow as  much as many of us would like to end the war tomorrow and may vote to end the war tomorrow. But we have had enough screaming at one another from both sides of the aisle, and that has not ended the war up to now. We have an obligation to the people that I saw yesterday, that my colleagues Mr. Dent and Mr. Lampson and Mr. Gilchrest have been visiting at our military hospitals and at funerals. They don't want us to harp on left and right. They want us to figure out a way forward. They want us to put aside disagreements that have paralyzed us and move forward on what we can agree to. That is exactly what we intend to continue focusing on. 
   I thank my colleagues for spending time on this very late evening, and I hope, Madam Speaker, that the American people understand the importance of this engagement, this reconciliation, this dialogue to move not left or right but forward. 
   Did the gentleman want to close?

<DOCNO>Mr. ISRAEL. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank my distinguished chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I have listened very carefully to my friends from the other side suggest that this bill is just too expensive, that it needs to be cut. Well, let me tell you what's far more expensive. 
   Thirty years ago, President Carter told the American people that we were going to declare the moral equivalent of war on foreign oil. And the only thing we've managed to do in the 30 years since then is double our imports of oil from the Middle East and cut investments in renewable research and development by about 80 percent. So we tried it your way. We cut those investments 80 percent in the past 30 years. And what's the result? We've  doubled our imports of foreign oil from the Persian Gulf. 
   You want to know why this is so expensive a problem? It is a military vulnerability. Two years ago, the Department of Defense spent $10.6 billion on basic energy costs because of this dependence on foreign oil. $10.6 billion paid for by the taxpayer. Of that, the Air Force spent half, $4.7 billion, on one thing: buying fuel, which is also paid for by the American taxpayer. 
   Now, I believe, as many of my friends do, in robust military budgets. I am a very strong supporter of our military and I believe we need to spend what it takes to defend freedom, and my friends would agree. The problem is this: Because of the fact that we tried it their way and our dependence on foreign oil has actually increased, we're in a position right now where we are borrowing money from China to fund our military budgets to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to fuel our military to protect us from China and the Persian Gulf. A $550 billion military budget and we have to borrow the money from our adversaries. And, guess what, our taxpayers have to pay the interest on the money that we're borrowing from our adversaries to fuel our military to protect us from our adversaries. It makes no sense whatsoever. We've tried it their way, Mr. Chairman, and it hasn't worked. 
   I don't believe any one of my colleagues would suggest that we should cut the Department of Defense budget. We all believe in national security, and I'm with my colleagues on that.     
   But as a matter of national security, we should not cut this budget either, because this budget is a national security budget, because it is not acceptable that a Stryker combat vehicle that is ferrying our troops into some very dangerous environments gets between 5 and 10 miles to the gallon, sounds like a 1957 Buick and is a loud, moving target. It is not acceptable that our C-17s burn 3,000 gallons of fuel an hour and that we have to rely on our adversaries to fuel those systems. 
   I would appeal to my colleagues on the other side that just as they are strong supporters of the Department of Defense and would never think to suggest just a 1 or 2 percent reduction in military budgets, the same should hold true on this. 
   I would add one other thing, if I may, Mr. Chairman. One of the things that worries all of us, and worries our military planners, is not just the threats that we see in Iran, and we passed a resolution earlier today that I supported that would take a hard line on Iran and its development, attempted development on nuclear weapons, not just those things, but loose nukes. But the fact that there is a tremendous quantity of nuclear materials proliferating around the world that we have to find, identify and secure, because we don't want a rogue nation packing those loose nukes into a suitcase and bringing them across our borders. 
   Well, this bill contains funding for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, whose mission is to locate, secure and remove and facilitate disposal of high-risk vulnerable nuclear material and equipment locations. It does increase the President's funding level. I think the American people would want us to find the money to secure those loose nukes. Now, maybe that means there is a little less money to go to Halliburton and no-bid contracts. 
   My final point is this: the other side continues to say that this is a tax increase. It is not a tax increase. It will not be a tax increase. The other side is not accurately explaining this to the American people, is the most diplomatic way I can put it. 
   I will say this, it does require different priorities. The other side has no problem allowing big corporations to register themselves in offshore P.O. boxes so that they can avoid paying their fair share of taxes. The other side has no problem funding and bull-dozing money to Halliburton in no-bid contracts. The other side had no problem shoveling tax cuts to the richest oil company executives on Earth. 
   If the money was there for that, the money is there for this bill. Maybe we need to take the money from those priorities and put them into this priority. 
   For America's energy security, for a strong future, and to get our troops out of those Stryker combat vehicles that are loud gas guzzlers and put them on something safer. This bill makes those investments. Those investments are, ultimately, in our national security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I thank my distinguished chairwoman and my wonderful partner in the New York delegation for her wonderful leadership. I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Wolf, for producing a bill that says to adversaries and allies alike that politics can stop at the water's edge here in the United States Congress, that when it comes to foreign policy, Republicans and Democrats work together and strive to work together because we understand that a strong, muscular, fair foreign policy is in the best national security interests of our country, that where we can produce and facilitate stability and the conditions of peace, that we won't have to exert military force. 
   I want to thank the chairwoman and the ranking member for supporting three very specific provisions that I sought. One the chairwoman had mentioned, and that is asking the Export-Import Bank to dedicate part of their export authority to green exports, to renewable energy investments. 
   The Ex-Im Bank has supported $400 billion of U.S. exports in the past 70 years. That is job creation here in the United States. It is the formation of capital that supports businesses right here. I support the Ex-Im Bank. But we are hoping that they will focus on new efforts to create green jobs, green manufacturing jobs to reduce global warming, which is a national security issue. And the provision that Congressman Schiff and I requested would require the Ex-Im Bank to dedicate some of its export authority to those green technologies and could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional exports in 2008, encouraging the use of renewable energy worldwide. 
   The second provision that I am very proud of concerns Libya and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. It is a matter of fact that in 1988 Libyan-backed terrorists killed 270 people, including 189 Americans, by bombing Pan Am Flight 103. They made an agreement. They agreed to a settlement that would provide payment to those families. That settlement, those promises have not been kept. I am very proud of language that we added that says that the government of Libya, if it wants to be part of the international community, if Libya wants to be part of the community of nations, they need to keep their  promises, and funds for diplomatic relations to Libya will not be expended unless those promises are kept. 
   Kara Weipz, as the President of Victims of Pan Am Fight 103, said that they are deeply encouraged by this important step by Congress to hold Libya accountable before it is rewarded with diplomatic relations, and that this settlement represents a promise to the families, an acknowledgement of the victims, and some form of punishment to the perpetrators. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairwoman and ranking member for their steadfast support against the genocide in Darfur. As we debate this bill tonight and tomorrow, a genocide is being perpetrated in our midst. We have said to other genocides, never again. This bill turns that statement into action. 
   I want to thank the gentlewoman and the gentleman for their commitment to make sure that never again means never again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, tonight we do something different. Tonight we may do something that may even be unprecedented. Tonight I am joined on the floor of the House by my distinguished gentleman and my partner from Long Island, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop) and we will be joined by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest) and perhaps others. 
   Tonight, for the first time that I know of, Republicans and Democrats take to the floor of the House to discuss Iraq, but not to criticize one another about Iraq, not to beat each other up about Iraq, not to cast aspersions and blame about Iraq, not to talk about what divides us on Iraq, but to find ways to come together on Iraq. 
   I don't think that's happened before on this floor, but I do believe that the American people have an unquenchable thirst for Democrats and Republicans not to take the time of this Congress for sloganeering and name calling and the impugning of motives, but to take the time of this Congress to have an intellectual debate over those issues, to take the time of Congress to really honor those troops and our veterans, and to discuss not what is left and what is right, but to discuss the way forward. 
   The gentleman from New York knows that every time the people from our districts and the American people tune into C-SPAN, what they see are Republicans and Democrats arguing and fighting and criticizing, attacking each other's ideas, impugning each other's patriotism, impugning each other's motives. Tonight is different, because we are not going to discuss what separates us and divides us, but we are going to discuss what, in fact, can unite us. 
   War in Iraq has caused an outbreak of war on floor of the House of Representatives, and tonight we declare a ceasefire. For me, this is not just a professional obligation, but, for me, it is personal, for two reasons. 
   The first is that several days ago I made a phone call to the father of Matthew Baylis. He was killed in Iraq last week. It was small arms fire in Baghdad. I have no idea whether Matthew Baylis or Matthew Baylis himself was a Democrat or a Republican or an independent or perhaps not registered to vote.     
   I don't care. I do believe that Matthew Baylis would want Republicans and Democrats to come together to talk about the way forward; that Matthew Baylis and those like him, who died in the service of his country, would want us to spend more of our time talking about moving our country forward than moving our country to the left or the right. 
   And the second reason that this is personal for me, Mr. Speaker, is because it's being organized by the House Center Aisle Caucus, which is a bipartisan group of 50 Democrats and Republicans who have come together, based on certain propositions. The first proposition is, we can disagree agreeably; that we can state our differences without calling each other names; that we can debate the issues without having this Chamber sound like a fourth grade elementary school auditorium that's run amok. 
   And the other premise of the Center Aisle Caucus, Mr. Speaker, is that Democrats and Republicans will disagree on perhaps as much as 70 percent of the issues, which means we have a fundamental obligation to agree on the 30 percent that's left. 
   The problem is that even when we agree we haven't moved forward, because we've allowed our disagreements to paralyze areas where we, in fact, have consensus. And so the Center Aisle Caucus, which was sponsored, actually which was founded by the gentleman from Illinois, Congressman TIM JOHNSON, and me and the gentlewoman from Missouri, Congresswoman JO ANN EMERSON, and the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moore), the Center Aisle Caucus has been meeting on an ongoing basis to find areas of agreement. We recently met with the ambassador from Iraq to the United States, and he gave us some ideas. 
   Before I yield time to my friend from New York, I just want to focus on some of the principles that we do agree on. 
   If you would listen to the debate here on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, you would think that there are actually Members of Congress who want us to lose in Iraq. There's not a single Member of Congress who wants us to lose in Iraq. 
   If you listen to the debate on the floor of the House, Mr. Speaker, you would think that there are actually Members of Congress who do not care about the lives lost in Iraq. There is not a single Member of Congress who has a callous disregard for the lives lost in Iraq. 
   You would think that there are two types of Members of Congress, either Members of Congress who want defeat or Members of Congress who want to be in Iraq forever. I don't know of a single Member of Congress who supports either option. 
   The fact of the matter is we are not the enemies, Democrats and Republicans. Americans aren't the enemies. The enemies are the people that we're fighting, and we need to focus on this. 
   And the Center Aisle Caucus has gathered and has endorsed several principles that we're going to discuss tonight, and I'll run through them quickly and then yield my time to the gentleman from New York. 
   Here are the shared principles that Democrats and Republicans who are interested in finding common ground have articulated: 
   Number one, we support our Armed Forces. We want to make sure they have adequate force protection. We want to make sure they have everything they need to keep them safe and keep them sound, and we want to bring them home as fast as possible.  
   Number two, we want to take care of our veterans. And I am so proud to announce on this floor tonight that earlier today the Appropriations Committee, which I have the privilege of serving on, unanimously, Republicans and Democrats, Democrats and Republicans, passed a $109.2 billion package that addresses the critical health care and housing needs for our veterans. $18 billion above last year's level and $4 billion more than the President requested, and I hope that he will not veto that bill. 
   Our bill includes $87.7 billion in crucial funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is a $6.7 billion increase in discretionary funding over last year's level. That is the largest single increase in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration. 
   Our bill addresses the backlog in claims by adding 1,000 new claims processors, and that's going to help veterans who now wait an average of 177 days for the benefits they deserve. I am very proud that Democrats and Republicans today in the Appropriations Committee voted to take care of our veterans. 
   We agree that we need to secure Iraq's borders because there are too many reports that Syria and Iran are sending fighters and equipment and technology over those borders to make the situation in Iraq even worse, not resisting Iraq's sovereignty, and threatening our troops and Iraqi civilians. 
   We agree that we need to stand up Iraqi security forces because we cannot be there for a prolonged period of time. I would imagine that we all agree that we've all been there too long already, and so we need to find ways to stand up Iraq security forces, and we're going to discuss that tonight. 
   We agree that there's a need for regional change. We agree that the Middle East is a very dangerous place in the world, and we need to transform it, using all the tools in our toolbox, from a place where children are taught how to blow things up to a place where children are taught how to put things together. 
   We agree that Iran needs to be responsible, and we need to engage Iran with the carrot and the stick. And we're pleased that the administration, which had resisted having any talks with Iran with respect to what is happening in Iraq, in fact, held those talks recently. 
   And, finally, we want to defeat al Qaeda, and we are prepared to use all the tools in our toolbox to do that. Because it was al Qaeda in Afghanistan that launched the attacks on the United States which killed hundreds of Long Islanders, those represented by myself and those represented by the distinguished gentleman from Long Island, from New York's First Congressional District, Mr. Bishop. 
   And on that I would be privileged to yield time to my colleague, the gentleman from New York.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentleman, and I appreciate his raising this issue of one for one, because I think it's a perfect example of Members of this body having different ideas that may make sense, trying to offer those ideas in the spirit of some compromise and reasonableness. Let's go into the basis of that one for one and explore it as a possible, not a way out, because Iraq is certainly complex and complicated, but at least one measure of improvement. 
   The President has said that, in the past, and has stated this publicly, that for every Iraqi that stands up, an American will come home or be redeployed. And he has said that on several occasions. On other occasions, we've heard that there are between 250,000 and 300,000 Iraqis that have been stood up. Well, the gentleman can help me do the math. If in fact there are between 250,000 and 300,000 Iraqis that have been stood up and if for every one that stands up an American is going to redeploy, how come 250,000 to 300,000 have not redeployed?     
   The answer is in how you define ``training'' and what it means to say ``stand up.'' In fact, go you take a look at the textbook definition of ``training'' in military terms, combat proficiency is what is important, and there are different levels of combat proficiency. If you are trained at level one combat proficiency, you are capable of fighting and winning convincingly anywhere in the world and you don't need any U.S. support. If you are trained at level two combat proficiency, you can fight and win almost anywhere in the world, but you need some measure of U.S. support, maybe some intel, maybe some reconnaissance assistance, maybe some logistics support. So if you take a look at the numbers of Iraqi forces that are actually trained at level one or level two combat proficiency, you will find that it is not 250,000 to 300,000 but far less. And the numbers ought not be repeated in a public forum, but far less than 250,000 to 300,000. 
   So the idea that we came up with was why don't we ask the President to report to the Congress on a monthly basis how many Iraqis have actually been trained at level one or level two combat proficiency, certify that to the Congress, and then we will redeploy an equivalent amount. Now, I am not suggesting that we withdraw that number necessarily. We might redeploy them to the borders so we can prevent Iran and Syria from inflaming the situation in Iraq. 
   The point is, Congressman Bishop, that I don't claim to have all the answers and I know that this isn't the perfect answer, but it is an idea that we have tried to set forward.

   And the true value of the Center Aisle Caucus and this kind of dialogue, this unprecedented dialogue, and civil dialogue between Members on both sides is that we all have good ideas and we have all been trying to advance those ideas. And it is so refreshing to be joined by three members of the other side of the Center Aisle Caucus who have been extremely constructive, who have been true leaders in trying to forge bipartisan alliances in order to move the country and the debate not to the left, not to the right, but forward. And I am very proud that we are joined by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays), and I know the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest) has joined us as well.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman. 
   Before yielding to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland, just to clarify on the issue of Status of Forces Agreement, Mr. Dent was kind enough to join the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, Ambassador Sumaydi, and me and other members of the Center Aisle Caucus for a dinner where the ambassador himself talked about the importance of a Status of Forces Agreement. 
   Will it end the war tomorrow? Absolutely not. Will it end it next week? No. Is it one good, reasonable idea that will lower the temperature in Iraq, that will reduce the animosities that are flaming out of control there? I believe it will. And I am appreciative that the gentleman from Pennsylvania has cosponsored a bipartisan resolution that asks the President to submit a Status of Forces Agreement to the Iraqi government, not conclude one because it has got to be negotiated, but at least submit one to send a signal and a message that we don't want to own the place; that we are there and we will leave when the Iraqi government wishes us to. 
   With that, I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland for his bipartisan leadership and his great measure of thoughtfulness on issues with respect to Iraq, and I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest).

   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentleman. 
   Before recognizing Mr. Bishop, I want to follow up on a very important point that the gentleman made about the lessons that history teaches us with respect to the importance of having a dialogue with our adversaries. I wish we understood those lessons here in the United States Congress. Because if you take a look at those lessons of history, the Cold War, The Space Raid, World War II, all of the great challenges that confronted Congresses in the past have been solved with bipartisan dialogue. Think about the Cold War. It was the bipartisanship, the bipartisan approach of a John F. Kennedy and a Richard Nixon and that helped end the Cold War. Think about World War II. It was the political leadership of FDR and Harry Truman and the military leadership of Dwight D. Eisenhower. There was always great bipartisanship with respect to enormous foreign policy challenges in our country. Democrats and Republicans found ways to talk to one another. I guess there was a saying that ``politics stops at the water's edge.'' One of the concerns I have is that we have kind of lost that sense, that we have made foreign policy and made issues of war and peace partisan issues. And what we are trying to do here in the Center Aisle Caucus, with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent) is bring Democrats and Republicans back to the water's edge in the Center Aisle. 
   And with that, I will yield to Mr. Bishop.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Well, I thank the gentleman. I think it is a very sound idea. The Iraq Study Group proved its value as an independent entity. And I have the highest regard for General Petraeus. In fact, he was in my office the day that the President announced the surge. And I was skeptical about the surge, personally I did not support the surge, but I thought it was important to reach out to General Petraeus and at least give him an opportunity to explain it to me. 
   I think he is the best we have. I have a very high regard for him. I think his report is going to be indispensable. I think it would be extremely useful to send the Iraqi Study Group back to take a look so that, like President Reagan said, ``trust but verify.'' I think that verification would be extremely useful.

   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentleman. 
   I will close by thanking each of our colleagues to join with us this evening. Of the American people are accustomed to tuning into these so-called special orders and seeing a Democratic hour, which is usually spent beating up Republicans, and a Republican hour, which is usually spent beating up Democrats. 
   Tonight they saw something different. They saw Mr. Dent talk about a status of forces agreement, which Democrats can agree with. They saw Mr. Bishop talk about the one-for-one agreement, which has bipartisan support. They saw Mr. Shays discuss an idea to have the Iraq Study Group reassess conditions, which has Democratic support. And they heard the historic perspective of Mr. Gilchrest, a perspective that only a Marine that was wounded in Vietnam can properly give to the United States Congress. 
   The point is that I believe that without sounding overly enthusiastic, that in the past hour there was more bipartisan, reasoned, rational discussion of ideas to move us forward rather than left or right than has happened on the floor of this House over the past 4 years. That is precisely what the Center Aisle Caucus was created to generate. 
   Tonight we close by sharing our principles: That we support our Armed Forces. We will take care of our veterans. More assistance passed in today's appropriations bill to veterans than at any time in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration, passed unanimously by the Appropriations Committee today. We will secure Iraq's border. We want to stand up Iraq's security forces. We understand the need for regional change. We will push for that. We understand the threat of Iran. And we want to defeat al Qaeda. 
   Today's discussion was not about left or right, it was about moving forward. I know the gentleman talked about the servicemember that he represents who was lost in Iraq. Again, I would ask the American people to continue to support our Armed Forces. 
   I can think of no better evening and no better person to inspire this special order than Matthew Baylis, who we lost in Iraq last week, and I believe he would be very proud of what we are doing this evening. As I said before, I don't know whether he was a Democrat or a Republican. I have no idea whether his family are Republicans or Democrats. I do know that they would be proud that this evening, Democrats and Republicans joined together to talk about a way forward, without a single one of us calling another one a name.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. 
   Is this the perfect solution? No. But how can there be a perfect solution to a war so imperfectly devised, so catastrophically planned, so horribly managed by the Bush administration? 
   This resolution turns in a better direction. It provides health care to our veterans. 
   It provides support to our warfighters. 
   It demands accountability from our President. 
   And it creates the process to redeploy our troops. 
   I voted for the use of force in Iraq, Mr. Speaker. I believed then, as I believe now, that the Middle East is an exceedingly dangerous region on the brink of an eruption that threatens global security. 
   But the war in Iraq did not stabilize the Middle East. It has destabilized it. 
   Before the war in Iraq, Iran was concerned about Israel. Today, Israel is concerned about Iran. 
   Before the war in Iraq, there was no such thing as ``Al Queda in Iraq''. Today, there is. 
   Before the war in Iraq, our military was capable of swiftly and decisively responding to multiple threats, foreign and domestic. Just yesterday, the New York National Guard reported to my office that it has only 37 percent of the mission critical transportation it needs to respond to a homeland security emergency in my state: whether it's a terrorist attack or a severe hurricane. 
   This resolution reinvests in the priorities we need. And it says to both the Iraqi government and the Bush Administration: 
   ``No more blank checks. No more endless commitments.'' 
   Many are troubled with the inclusion of a strategic withdrawal of our troops between December of this year and August of next. Mr. Speaker. 
   And I must be honest. I have struggled with this as well. The decision should be hard. It should be contentious. It should torment us all. Because no matter what we do, the stakes are high. The consequences are great. 
   If you lean to the right, an August 2008 redeployment is way too soon. 
   If you lean to the left, an August 2008 redeployment is way too long. 
   I reached my own judgment a few months ago. Based not on polls, not on politics, not on the convenience of sound-bytes on either side of the aisle and not on righteous absolutism that can only be formulated in a vacuum. I formed it after listening to the Commanding General of CENTCOM testify to the Armed Services Committee that we had until the middle of this year before Baghdad spins out of control. Shortly after that, the Iraq Study Group, after months of non-partisan work and study, reached the judgment that: ``By the first quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected developments in the security situation on the ground, all combat brigades not necessary for force protection could be out of Iraq.'' 
   The middle of this year to the middle of next year. 
   Those are the benchmarks, Mr. Speaker. Those are the nonpartisan, nonpolitical, balanced and reasoned benchmarks. 
   And those benchmarks are contained in this resolution. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say this: Today Republicans and Democrats will disagree. Fair enough. But it's time to stop thinking about our disagreements and begin working together on our agreements. 
   Last week, several members of the House Center Aisle Caucus, which I have the privilege of co-chairing, met to discuss cooperating on several Iraq initiatives. This week. I introduced the first of these bipartisan measures with the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. DAVIS), the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARNEY), the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  BOUSTANY). Our resolution requires the President to submit a Status Of Forces Agreement to the Iraq government, just as we have with other governments where we have a military presence. This will send the message that we are not occupiers of Iraq. And we follow the rule of law. 
   I mention this now, Mr. Speaker, in the hopes that my colleagues who wish to join us in constructive ways forward will join us. That the debate will turn from left and right to forward. 
   That is what our troops want. That is what our constituents want. That is our obligation.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, last week, despite the best efforts of the Democratic majority and about 44 Republicans, we were unable to override the President's veto of health insurance for the children of poor and working families. Now, I listened to the argument that we can't afford providing health care for our children, despite the fact that our SCHIP program was entirely paid for. 
   Look, Madam Speaker, I believe that a strong Nation can do both. You can be fiscally responsible and you can take care of your children. Good families manage to be fiscally responsible and take care of their children. It is just a matter of priorities. I will say, Madam Speaker, that I was struck by some of the mispriorities that I heard about. The same people who said that we can't afford health insurance for our children increased spending 7 percent a year since 2001 and voted to increase our debt limit 4 out of the past 5 years. The difference is that they spent on the wrong things. No spending? We can't afford health care for children but billions of dollars in tax cuts for the most profitable oil companies on Earth? We can't afford spending for health insurance for our children but billions of dollars in spending in no-bid contracts for Halliburton? We have increased the debt. We are putting it on our kids' shoulders, and now we are telling our kids we can't afford to help them with the x-rays.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, as we debate this rule and debate how we are going to debate this rule, an F-16 is burning 25 gallons of fuel every minute. A Stryker combat vehicle on which our troops travel is traveling at the rate of about 7 miles per gallon. I was on a C-17 recently. It is burning 3,000 gallons an hour. 
   Energy is a national security issue. It is a vital national security issue. And we can't afford to continue to debate the debate to adjourn this House. The decision before to ask this House to adjourn, I think, is emblematic of failed energy policies. There is no more debating or delaying. It is time to act. 
   Last year the Department of Defense spent $10.6 billion on basic energy costs. Of that, the Air Force spent $4.7 billion on one thing, buying fuel for its planes. 
   Now, I believe in a robust defense. We have got some significant challenges in the world. China is a significant challenge. Iran is a significant challenge. But the policies on energy that we have had for the past 6 years have put us in the position where we are borrowing money from China to fund our defense budgets, to fuel our military, which requires buying oil from the Persian Gulf to protect us from China and the Persian Gulf. How does that make sense? It makes no sense. 
   I was in China just several weeks ago. They are going to reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent and keep growing, and increase their use of renewables, while we continue to rely on our adversaries to power our military to protect us from our adversaries. 
   This dependence on foreign oil, Mr. Speaker, is as glaring a threat to our national security as Sputnik was, as the Cold War was, as the space race was. And our answer to those threats was, we will research and develop and manufacture and engineer and land men on the Moon by the end of the decade. We confronted those threats and beat those threats. 
   It is time to quit debating and quit delaying and quit stalling. It is time to put the protection of our troops ahead of the profits of the big oil companies. It is time to understand that this is a critical national security issue that has been tried and debated and delayed for 30 years. It is time to act now.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISRAEL. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by setting the record straight. I have heard my friends on the other side talk about this resolution as calling for withdrawal, as calling for retreat. There is nothing in this resolution that says withdraw; there is nothing in this resolution that says retreat; there is nothing in this resolution that says exit. 
   What this resolution says is that we support our troops, and we do not believe that it is a good idea to add 20,000 more troops to a policy that has not worked. 
   In October of 2002, I voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq. I believed then, as I believe now, that the Middle East is a dangerous place and that you have to use a combination of hard power and soft power to help change the trajectory of the Middle East from a place that teaches kids how to blow things up to a place that teaches kids how to put things together. 
   In January of 2005, I visited our troops in Iraq, and I remember sitting with General Casey and asking him, How many foreign fighters are here and how many insurgents? And at that point, January 2005, the General said, Congressman, there are about 500 foreign fighters and there are about 5,000 insurgents. And so what to do? We committed more force to try and solve that problem. 
   And then I went back to Iraq in April of 2006, 15 months later, and I asked General Casey, How many foreign fighters are there and how many insurgents? And General Casey said, Congressman, there are 5,000 foreign fighters, there used to be 500, now 5,000; there used to be 5,000 insurgents, now there are 20,000 insurgents. And so what did we do? We threw in more force. 
   And now a year after that we stand here debating a resolution on whether we should commit another 20,000 troops to a mission that is poorly planned, from a military that has been strained by that poor planning and that is ill conceived. 
   Now, I want to be very clear, Mr. Speaker. If the President of the United States asked me to support additional troops into Afghanistan tonight to find Osama bin Laden, who by the way was the one who killed over 100 of my constituents, or to stop the resurgence of the Taliban, which by the way was the group of people who really gave aid and comfort to the enemy, I would vote for that tonight. I absolutely would vote for that tonight. But this decision by the President to put 20,000 more people into Iraq is the wrong number at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
   Mr. Speaker, during this debate I have heard my colleagues talk about the messages that we are sending our troops and how it will affect their morale, and I have an obligation as somebody who supports our military to suggest that if we had given our troops up-armor for their Humvees, Kevlar for their vests, night-vision goggles that work, and consistent rotations, their morale would be much better. 
   Our troops are not afraid of democracy being waged on the floor of the House of Representatives. And, in fact, on the chance that our enemies are listening to this debate, let me suggest that this debate doesn't give aid and comfort to our enemies. It tells our enemies what democracy is about. So for our enemies who may be listening: welcome to democracy. This is what it sounds like, this is what it looks like, and this is what we are willing to fight for. 
   What our servicemembers deserve to hear is the truth. What they deserve is a government that confronts reality rather than simply hoping for the best. So here is the truth, Mr. Speaker: somewhere between those who believe that we can stay the course in Iraq indefinitely and those who believe that we should leave Iraq tomorrow is the painful truth. The truth is that neither of those options will work. 
   Now, if you agree with me that that is the painful reality, then you are left with a hard choice: add 20,000 troops to continue the administration's ineffective plan, or try something different. 20,000 additional troops to Iraq, or rebuild our readiness here at home to deal with the growing challenges of Iran or naval expansion in China or genocide in Darfur or the other dangers in the world. Hold the Iraqi Government accountable for accelerating the training of their troops, or continue hoping for the best while putting the burden on the backs of 20,000 more U.S. troops. 
   Let me make two other points. The gentleman who preceded me, my friend from California, said, what do you have to offer? We have offered ideas; we have offered ideas from day one. The problem has been the stubborn resistance by the administration to listen to our ideas. 
   I have been advocating with my friend from California (Mrs. Tauscher) a status of forces agreement in Iraq, so that we would send the message that we are not occupiers, that we don't want to be there for one day longer than we need to be. The administration has rejected that. 
   I have been advocating with my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Carney) a one-for-one resolution. I and others have been advocating a formula, a one-for-one formula that says that for every Iraqi security force that stands up an American will be redeployed. 
   So we have provided ideas. And I want to once again offer a bipartisan invitation to my colleagues to work with us, because whether this resolution passes or not, the war is not going to end the next day. We still have many challenges ahead, and we are going to have to work together. 
   And, finally, Mr. Speaker, let me make a point about some of the characterizations that we have been listening to. As a Democrat, I know that there is not a single Republican who wakes up in the morning wanting this war to last for one day longer than it has to last. And in the same spirit, I am offended by anyone who would suggest that there is a Democrat who gives aid and comfort to the enemy, who wants us to be defeated, who wants us to lose. That is not what we are about. 
   We need to end the sound bites and the partisanship and the war rooms off the floor of the House that tell people what to say, and begin formulating effective policy for the troops that are listening to us tonight. 
   I visited my VA hospital yesterday, and I saw men and women in wheelchairs and gurneys. It didn't say Republican or Democrat on those wheelchairs and gurneys. When the time came, they went to fight for us. Our obligation is to stand by them, not with sound bites, not with policies that haven't worked before, but with new ideas for a stronger country.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISRAEL. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank my good friend for his leadership in the Blue Dogs, his leadership in the Congress, and my good friend from Georgia who, as he noted, cochairs with me the Democratic Study Group on National Security, which is intended to ensure that this Congress and Democrats in Congress continue to lead the fight on behalf of our troops, to lead the fight on behalf of our national security. We were founded in the acknowledgement that we need a robust, muscular military to protect us from the threats that are out there. 
   I think this topic is critically important, the topic of war profiteering. And who pays the price for war profiteering? Our taxpayers pay the price, our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world pay the price. But there is another group that is paying the price, and I would like to address that this evening, our National Guard units at home. 
   This morning there was a report in the National Journal's Congress Daily. It was headlined, National Guard May Lack Needed Gear to Deal With Domestic Crisis, GAO Says. And the report raises questions about whether the State-run National Guard units have adequate supplies to respond to disasters and emergencies on U.S. soil. It says it will remain unclear whether the Guard is equipped to respond effectively to the consequences of a large-scale terrorist attack or natural disaster. 
   The article in the National Journal states, ``Over the last several months, many State Guard leaders have complained that their unit took their best equipment with them when they deployed to Iraq, leaving the personnel at home short of trucks, radios and other equipment needed for domestic missions. Indeed, Lieutenant General Steven Blum, chief of the Pentagon's National Guard Bureau, told Congress last year that at least two-thirds of his units in the United States are not combat ready.'' 
   Now this, to me, is just incredible that Halliburton made money, that these contractors made money. In my view, they gouged the military, gouged our taxpayers, marked up the services they provided, and National Guard units at home are short of the equipment they need. 
   I represent a district on Long Island. The World Trade Center was 40 miles from my hometown. We know what terrorism is like. We needed our emergency responders when that happened. We are likely to need them again, the gentleman from Georgia knows that very well. But when two-thirds of their equipment is sitting in Iraq, that creates a very serious problem. That is the cost of war profiteering. 
   Now, I understand the exigencies of war and I understand that when you go to war, you know, you have to make sure that your troops have everything they need, and there are all sorts of funding issues; but my goodness, Secretary Rumsfeld said, You go to war not with the Army you want but with the Army you have. You have got to budget for that Army. You never send people into war unequipped, underfunded, underequipped without the right number of coagulant bandages, without the right number of night vision goggles and up-armored Humvees. 
   If they found the money to pay these contractors that ripped us off, they can find the money to make sure that our National Guard units have the equipment they need. If they found the money to pay the excessive bills of these contractors so that they could raise their bottom lines, they could find the money to raise the equipment that the National Guard needs for the mission-critical equipment that will be required--not just in an act of terrorism, by the way, but when we have a major hurricane as we did with Katrina. 
   Long Island stands a very good chance of suffering a Category 3 hurricane or more. And it is going to be very difficult for me to explain to my constituents that they didn't have the National Guard equipment resources that they were depending on to respond to a Category 3 hurricane because that equipment was in Iraq; but Halliburton got what it wanted, its CEO got the salary increase he needed. 
   This isn't very complicated. We are short-funding our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; we are undersupplying our National Guard units at home. The big corporations who are contracted as part of this war are making more money than ever. And there are still companies in the United States that can register their international headquarters at a P.O. Box in Bermuda so they can avoid their fair share of taxes at home. That is a disgrace. 
   It is time for accountability. It is time for oversight. It is time to put our money where our mouths are. It is time to quit talking about funding our  troops here and abroad and then not giving them the resources they need. 
   The Blue Dogs believe in fiscal accountability. We take second place to nobody when it comes to supporting our troops and supporting our military, to nobody. But we also understand that you can't say you are doing that; you have got to actually do it. You can't fight a war abroad, short-fund our troops there and be left with degraded National Guard units at home. It is time for accountability, for oversight. It is time for a different direction, and that is precisely what the Blue Dogs are going to insist on. 
   I thank the gentleman for recognizing me.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I would just close with one point. 
   I want to echo what the gentleman from Georgia has said. This soldier comes first. If you go into fight a global war on terror you better make sure the fighters have everything they need. Do not ask them to stand in line behind the corporate executives at Halliburton. Do not ask them to stand in line behind the CEO of Exxon Mobil who got a huge tax cut on top of his bonus, on top of his huge salary. Do not ask them to stand in line behind the big pharmaceutical companies that also got a windfall from the government in the Medicare part D program, despite their record-breaking profits. 
   The gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman from Arkansas and I believe more than anything else that our primary obligation in this place, in this House, is to support our Armed Forces and to keep this Nation safe. That takes the right priorities. 
   In the past, the priorities have been wrong. How do I know? Two-thirds of our National Guard units do not have the equipment they need to respond to an emergency or an act of terrorism at home because the equipment is sitting in Iraq because we did not fund the war fight properly. 
   It is time to put our soldiers first, not just in our rhetoric but in our budgets; and to do that, you need accountability.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, we are all so proud on both sides of the aisle of the work that our servicemembers are doing in military theaters abroad, in Iraq and Afghanistan and so many places around the world. And we should be just as proud of the work they do when they come home. 
   I rise today to share with my colleagues the extraordinary heroism of Brian James Ivory. Mr. Ivory was a very proud member of the United States Marine Corps. He served in Iraq. He crewed aircraft flying in and out of some very dangerous places. 
   He was also stationed in North Carolina where he assisted in search and rescue missions, and he came home to Long Island when his deployment ended. 
   On December 17, he was driving home from work at night and he saw a vehicle in front of him hit a utility pole and erupt into flames. This young man, who had already served and sacrificed for his country, who had already paid his dues, rather than driving on and just calling the police, stopped his car, called the authorities and then pulled the driver out of the car, risking his life one more time, not in Iraq, but on the Long Island Expressway. 
   I want to commend this gentleman for his heroism. This is a story that I know is not unique. The point here is that we not simply celebrate the sacrifices and the heroism of our servicemembers when they go abroad to fight our battles, but we also keep in mind their bravery, their courage, their commitment, their dedication, their loyalty to protecting human life when they return home.

   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank my friend from West Virginia. 
   Mr. Speaker, if I were a football coach and I had been calling a play for 7 years and I actually lost yardage, I'd change the play. 
   Our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, they don't want to change the play. They want to keep the same plays that have been losing yards and money for the American people for the past 7 years. 
   In the spring of 2001, Vice President Cheney had this meeting with the oil and gas industry to create a new energy policy for America. Then, the cost of a barrel of oil was $23. Now the cost of a barrel of oil is $139. The policy did not work. 
   Then, the average price of gasoline was $1.46 a gallon. Today, the average price of a gallon of gasoline on Long Island is $4.31 a gallon. It tripled. 
   The policy didn't work. In all that time, oil and gas companies could have drilled on the properties which they have leases to. They didn't do it.

So what we are saying to the oil companies is use it or lose it. Drill what you have the right to drill, explore where you have the right to explore, and if you're not willing to do that, we will find somebody who can. 
   It's time to put the sound bites aside and give real relief to the American people. The fact of the matter is that the policies that have been tried, have failed. I am not saying that anybody has committed wrongdoing, I am just saying that they have pursued the wrong policies. 
   The right policy is to put the American people's pocketbooks ahead of the oil company profits. Use it or lose it. That's what we are doing today.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, here is today's energy Facts versus Fiction, Volume II. 
   According to Gal Luft of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, at $137 per barrel of oil, OPEC could potentially buy the Bank of America within 5 weeks of production revenues; Apple Computer within 12 days; General Motors within 5 days, and it would take 2.5 years for OPEC to buy a 20 percent blocking vote in every S&P 500 company. 
   Fact: The administration's budget slashes $467 million from energy efficiency and renewable energy accounts. The House Appropriations Committee added $1.2 billion. It is a much better investment, Madam Speaker, to add $1.2 billion than to give away the Bank of America, Apple Computer and General Motors to the Saudis. 
   We need an energy policy that invests in American ingenuity, not Saudi Arabia oil profits.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Hobson for a very strong bill that reflects wonderful bipartisan consensus. I especially want to thank them as a new member of this subcommittee for allowing all of the members to have more input into this bill than I thought was possible. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am a new member of this subcommittee, and I joined this subcommittee to fight for sensible and critical investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Before joining this subcommittee, I served for 4 years on the House Armed Services Committee and came to the conclusion that every military challenge that we confront as a Nation is exacerbated by one fact and, that is, that we have to rely on our adversaries to sell us the fuel to power our military to protect us from our adversaries. 
   Now, this has been a 30-year problem. Thirty years ago, President Carter addressed the Nation, declared the moral equivalent of war on foreign oil, and the only thing we've been able to do in the past 30 years since then is to double the amount of our oil imports from the Middle East and cut renewable energy investments by 80 percent. We've had 30 years of missteps, backsteps, and half steps. 
   This bill is the most important step forward in correcting that course that we have seen in 30 years. It puts us back on course. It increases investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy by $638 million over the administration request. It inserts language that I requested to create a new Federal advisory council on investment and finance so that we can unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of the investment community in helping us to solve this problem. It invests an additional $70 million in biomass and biorefinery. It invests an additional $51.6 million in solar. Mr. Chairman, we are now behind Germany and Japan in solar. This will help us leap ahead. It invests an additional $17 million in wind. Mr. Chairman, of the top 10 wind manufacturers in the world, only one is American. This will push us ahead. 
   It invests an additional $59.7 million in vehicle technologies. Mr. Chairman, we are now falling behind Japan in the development and manufacturing of an advanced battery capable of deploying plug-in hybrids. This will give us an important boost. It provides $60 million in new investments in green buildings. We are now falling behind China in the development of green-building technologies. This will put us ahead. It invests an additional $101 million in weatherization, a critically important program for energy efficiency. 
   This solves a fundamental military problem that we have confronted and that problem is this: we are now borrowing money from China to fund our military, to buy oil from the Persian Gulf, to fuel our Air Force to protect us from China and the Persian Gulf. This is not just an environmental or an energy problem. This is a fundamental national security problem. This bill puts us where we need to be, not only protecting ourselves from our adversaries, not only strengthening our military capabilities which need strengthening but creating the next generation of green jobs, creating a new generation of manufacturing jobs that will put us ahead of our economic competitors in these new and critically growing technologies. 
   So I want to again thank Mr. Visclosky and Mr. Hobson for their bipartisan leadership, thank them for involving all of their members in this debate, and urge my colleagues to support this bill which is one of the most important investments that we can make and will change that 30-year record of half steps, missteps and backsteps into a giant leap forward for humankind.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, this is like a soap opera. It doesn't matter when the American people tune it in, turn it on, it's the same script, the same characters, the same plot, the dialogue. 
   Every week this small group of Members tries to offer these amendments, and every week they're defeated, defeated by the members of their own caucus. 
   This appropriations bill was passed by the Appropriations Committee on a bipartisan basis. Democrats and Republicans supported this bill because it has the right investments for the American family. 
   They support the notion that we should make sure that we have children in car seats that are safe. The gentleman's amendment would cut funding for car seat safety for our children. 
   They support the notion that we should make sure that our highways are safe. The gentleman's amendment would cut funding for highway safety. 
   They support the notion, Republicans and Democrats alike, that when you go to the airport, there should be enough inspectors to make sure that your plane is safe. The gentleman's amendment would cut the number of inspectors for airlines and increase delays at airports. 
   Republicans and Democrats on the Appropriations Committee alike agreed with the notion that elderly people who worked hard, raised their families, paid their dues should have a chance, a better chance, to get decent housing. The gentleman's amendment would cut that chance of decent housing for the elderly. 
   And Republicans and Democrats alike, who share commonsense values and compassion, also agree that if you're disabled, you should have a chance to get some decent housing. The gentleman's amendment would cut the chance of getting decent housing if you are disabled. 
   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman talked about the common family and the values that they have. Let me suggest to the gentleman one thing, and then I will close. 
   This isn't really about the argument that the gentleman uses that we should cut spending. With all due respect, the gentleman was nowhere around when we spent and spent and spent and borrowed and borrowed and borrowed for special interests. I will talk about the typical American family. 
   This morning on the front page of the newspaper there was a story about how  huge tax breaks that some on the other side supported for the largest multinational corporations on Earth, that were promised to create jobs, did the opposite. Two years ago, according to the newspaper, when companies received a big tax break to bring home their offshore profits, the President and Congress justified it as a one-time tax amnesty that would create American jobs, but the companies did not create many jobs in return. Instead, since 2005, the American drug industry has laid off tens of thousands of workers in this country. 
   And so let's close by returning to that family. The gentleman may have a family in his district, a Jones family. Mr. Jones worked for one of those big multinational corporations that have a P.O. box in Bermuda to escape their fair share of taxes at home. Mr. Jones thought that that tax break to that big company was going to save his job. The company got the tax breaks. He got a pink slip. 
   Now, if that's not bad enough, the gentleman would propose that Mr. Jones, when he goes on the highway to try and find another job, that he's less safe; that Mrs. Jones, who's working at the Wal-Mart, when she straps her daughter into a car seat, that that car seat be less safe because of the cuts to those programs; if the Joneses have enough money to scrimp and save and maybe visit their parents or grandparents in another State, that they wait even longer to get on the plane, and that the plane not have the inspection as quickly as it needs to; and that if Mr. Jones' and Mrs. Jones' parents or grandparents want to have a decent roof over their heads, that they have to wait longer, in fact may not even qualify, because of the cuts in housing assistance for the elderly and the disabled. 
   The difference between us is that we want to invest in the American family, and the other side, not everybody on the other side, Republicans and Democrats alike, on a bipartisan basis, passed this bill to invest in the American family. 
   The sponsor of this amendment wants to continue giving giveaways to the richest special interests. We believe those funds are better spent with the American family. 
   That's what this is about, and that's why I'm so proud that Republicans and Democrats alike supported this bill in the Appropriations Committee and will defeat this amendment when it comes to the floor later. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank my good friend and colleague and neighbor, Mr. Ackerman. 
   Madam Speaker, 7 years ago, they say, changed everything. There were more funerals than we thought were imaginable, more tears, more despair, more a sense of loss. But there were also more flags in this country than ever, more pride and more unity. 
   I remember how the people of my congressional district responded. I remember the vigil at Heckscher Park in Huntington, the elementary students at the Idle Hour School in Oakdale planting a garden, the thousands of people who converged on Cow Harbor Park in Northport, the candlelight vigils in Commack including one that will be held this evening. I remember attending a recovery workers conference several months after the attacks on 9/11 and speaking to a gentleman who in very painful breaths and labored breathing said to me, ``Congressman, I'm not sure I am going to survive what I did. Will you take care of my family?'' I remember the Viggianos and the Downeys and the Murphys and over a hundred other families who lost somebody on that day. 
   It is important to remember these things, but it's also important to act. They need not only our commemoration, they need our health care. They need our continued moral support. They need our continued support in every sense of the word. 
   We remember these things, and we also remember those who did us great harm that day. Those who continue to live in caves in Pakistan and Afghanistan. We will not forget them either, and we support the courage and the bravery of those in the military who continue to pursue them. 
   Madam Speaker, I would make one other point, and that is this: Earlier today we assembled as Republicans and Democrats on the steps of the Capitol and sang ``God Bless America.'' We did the same thing on 9/11 hours after the attack. I hope that we will remember the unity that we displayed on that dreadful day and the unity that we displayed several hours ago and continue to work together to move our country forward, not just in the memory of those who perished and those who suffered on 9/11, but to make this country a better place for them. 
   God bless them. God bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I understand that there is a legitimate debate on the question of earmarks. I understand it is a fair topic to be debated on the floor of the House. I understand, Mr. Chairman, that the other side would be defensive about this issue in that their abuses of the earmark process, and their bulldozing to passage of these earmarks resulted in so much excoriation by the press, and a lost election and the incarceration of their Members.     
   But, Mr. Chairman, there is a time and a place for debate on these issues, and this bill is not the time or the place. This is the Homeland Security appropriation, Mr. Chairman. This is the last bill that ought to be politicized. 
   Mr. Chairman, my congressional district lost over 100 people on September 11. Over 100 people. I went to more funerals than I thought was possible. My district is about 40 miles from where the Twin Towers used to stand. When my constituents go to New York City these days, they can't see the Twin Towers because we had no homeland security in 2001. When they go to New York City, it is without the people that they loved and knew. All they have left are the memories. 
   Mr. Chairman, what I believe is happening today is that the Members from the other side are dishonoring those memories and, in fact, compromising our homeland security by using this critical bill to keep us safe and sound and strong to score political points on and to delay on. 
   That is simply not acceptable. They are putting politics, Mr. Chairman, ahead of our homeland security. They are putting politics, Mr. Chairman, ahead of our national security. They are putting politics, Mr. Chairman, ahead of the memory of those who lost their lives on 9/11. 
   Now, I was in Pakistan just some time ago with the Appropriations Committee. I stood on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan and learned that the Taliban is getting stronger, al Qaeda is resurging, Ansar al Islam is getting stronger and Jamah Islamayah is getting better. What is the other side doing over the past 48 hours? Spending 8 hours debating cuts to the General Counsel's Office in the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Al Qaeda and the Taliban are planning, plotting, and strategizing our demise; and the other side, Mr. Chairman, is spending 8 hours debating a cut in the costs of the General Counsel's Office in the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Mr. Chairman, forgive me if I sound frustrated. But I don't know how I can go back to my district in New York and explain to my constituents who attended funerals that instead of figuring out how to strengthen our borders, we spent 8 hours debating the General Counsel's Office in the Department of Homeland Security; that while our enemies are planning to destroy us, the other side offered eight separate motions to rise yesterday; that while our enemies are figuring out how to plan our demise, the other side is figuring out how to delay the response. How can I possibly explain that to the families that I represent? 
   I don't begrudge the other side their right to debate earmarks. But not on this bill. This is the wrong bill. It is at the wrong time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to return all of us to that very dark day. Many of the gentlemen and the gentlewomen who are spending all of this time consumed in a debate over earmarks in a bill that has no earmarks, who are consumed on procedural motions, held hands on 9/11 that night on the steps of this building and pledged never again. We would never let this happen again. We will do what must be done. We will bear any burden and pay any price in the defense of liberty and freedom. 
   What has happened in the years since then? We are not willing to pay the price. We are not willing to bear the burden. The only burden is that we are going to be here through the weekend debating more motions to rise, more amendments that are nothing but, in my view, political cheap shots. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is not the time and the place. We need to pass this bill to strengthen America, not compromise America's security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill does, in fact, combine various other appropriations measures. But those measures in their totality clearly reflect the top priorities of the American people. In fact, every one of those bills separately passed with significant Republican support by significant bipartisan majorities in this House. 
   The reason that this bill in its totality makes sense and should, with all due respect, attract the support of my friends from the other side of the aisle is because it does, in fact, fund the global war on terror. It funds our defense. It funds military construction. But it also funds America's other priorities. It funds our troops but it also takes care of our veterans, the largest increase in veterans health care in the 77-year history of the VA. It funds our defense with a robust military. But it also funds the war on cancer with increased investments in the NCI and the NIH.     
   It funds our military so that we can achieve global stability, but it also gives working families and middle-class taxpayers a little bit of a break, actually, more than a little bit of a break, a significant break on their college expenses so that our kids can compete in a globally competitive environment. 
   I would conclude, Madam Speaker, by suggesting that the differences between where the administration is and where we are should not be minimized. They are significant. As the chairman said, this administration is arguing over a $22 billion increased investment with one hand, and, on the other hand, telling the American people they have to come up with another $200 billion for Iraq. We are spending $12 billion a month in Iraq. The difference between where the administration is and where we are on these other priorities is 2 months in Iraq. 
   We want $880 million in increased investment for LIHEAP so that senior citizens don't have to shiver in the cold because their heating costs are too high. That is 2 1/2 days in Iraq, that $880 million. If we want to invest $1 billion in medical research for people with  cancer, with Alzheimer's, with Parkinson's, that's 3 days in Iraq. 
   Our $1 billion investment covers an entire year. The administration's strategy covers 3 days in Iraq. We want $1.4 billion for the entire year for improved health care access. With this administration, the equivalent cost is 4 days in Iraq. We want $1.8 billion in increased investments to keep American streets safe with additional law enforcement and additional police. The administration says we can't afford to keep America's streets safe but is willing to spend an equivalent amount over 5 days in Iraq. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill reflects the priorities of the American people. Separately, the components passed with overwhelming Republican support. This should be a bipartisan effort. It should be a bipartisan effort because, number one, it supports our troops, provides for robust defense, and takes care of our priorities here at home as well.

We have heard that the appropriations process is not moving fast enough, despite the fact that under the leadership of Chairman Obey in the House, we passed every single one of our appropriations bills, I believe in record time. We are hearing that the appropriations process isn't moving fast enough on the one hand, and now we have a motion to instruct the conferees to actually slow it down, to take pieces out of this bill, to stop it. You can't have it both ways. We are trying to get things done. We are trying to move our priorities forward. 
   Now, I understand that some of my friends don't want to deal with the labor, health and human services aspects of this bill, and they are concerned with the President's argument that we have plenty of money to fund Iraq but can't afford veterans health care here at home and educational priorities here at home and low-income heating for the elderly here at home. 
   I understand those arguments, but let me suggest to my colleagues that they read a study that was just released yesterday by Harvard Medical School. That study shows there is, in fact, a critical connection between the VA pieces of this bill and the health and human services aspects of this bill. The two should be considered together. That study found that, today, there are 2 million veterans who have no health insurance. And they aren't eligible for  VA benefits. Not eligible for VA benefits and too poor to afford health insurance. The number of uninsured veterans jumped to 1.8 million in 2004, and the population of uninsured veterans is increasing at twice the rate of the general population. 
   Now, the Labor-H aspects of this bill provides $1.4 billion above the President's request for programs to improve health care access. So taken in its totality, this bill, without segregating the human services components, taken in its totality, this bill protects our troops in the field and also provides access to veterans at home who may not qualify for veterans benefits. As has been stated before, our veterans are a whole. They come back from the war, the last thing they should worry about is not having health insurance. It's the labor, health and human services aspects of this bill that could provide additional access to health care, and that is why this bill ought to be considered as it is. 
   I would make one other point. We have already considered these bills separately. Each of these components were, in fact, debated, deliberated and passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the Appropriations Committee and then debated again, deliberated again and passed with significant Republican support on the floor of the House. 
   There is no reason to move backwards. There is no reason to delay. There is no reason to stop this process. We want to get these bills to the President. We should do so.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I was watching this debate on my television in the office. I am not sure whether I was watching C-SPAN or the Twilight Zone. 
   When I hear some of our colleagues come to the floor and express their concern over earmarks, my question is, what is so important? I will yield to anyone on the other side. What is so important about any specific earmark that you have that it has to be rushed to passage tonight, that it cannot stand the scrutiny of this body? 
   If you can tell us what specific earmark you have requested that should not be studied, if my colleagues will remember, the problem was not that we studied earmarks; the problem is that they were bulldozed to passage without proper scrutiny, without proper vetting. 
   Well, guess what, we are running an intervention here. We are going to save you from yourselves. We are not going to allow you to continue to bulldoze these earmarks.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISRAEL. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Chairman, I come to the floor today to compliment the Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill, Mr. Obey, on preparing an excellent and well-balanced appropriations bill. The large number of meritorious programs included in this bill creates difficult choices and the Chairman has done a great job balancing the competing interests and preparing a good bill for consideration in the full House. 
   However, on behalf of my constituents I feel compelled to express one concern with regard to language in the bill that would require NIH funded scientists to submit to the NIH their peer-reviewed manuscripts approved for journal publication. While I believe it is important to expand access to articles on government sponsored research, my concern is that such a mandatory policy could harm some nonprofit scientific societies that depend largely on income generated by their journal publications. 
   A mandatory policy like this could harm journal publishers who make substantial private-sector investments in the peer review, publishing, dissemination and archiving of these research articles. Scientific societies foster and promote our Nation's scientific endeavor, and these societies and their contributions to science should be protected. 
   I have a substantial scientific publishing organization, the American Institute of Physics, in my district, in Melville, New York. The American Institute of Physics, AlP, was established in 1931 for the purpose of promoting physics and its application to human welfare. AlP is a 501(c)(3) membership corporation of ten physical science and astronomy societies serving a combined membership of more than 125,000 scientists, engineers and students. AlP is a large publisher of physics journals and produces publications of more than 25 scientific and engineering societies through its New York-based publishing division. My concerns on this issue are to protect and support our Nation's scientific infrastructure and a viable export industry. The issue has been highlighted for me by my constituents in Melville, NY. 
   I also want to voice concerns with the rescission of $335 million from unexpended Workforce Investment Act, WIA, funds included in the bill. I fully support increasing funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Act, IDEA, the program this rescinded WIA funding was redirected towards in an amendment during full committee consideration of the bill. I've advocated for increasing funding for IDEA since I first came to Congress in 2000. However, I am concerned about the use of WIA as an offset. 
   Unexpended WIA funding is not actually ``unspent carryover.'' It is either obligated for services, such as training, or set aside to respond to mass layoffs and other unpredictable economic events. And the Government Accountability Office, in a study on WIA expenditures, found that WIA funds are spent ``much faster than required under the law.'' WIA regulations give local governments three years to spend Title I-B Adult and two years to spend Youth and Dedicated Worker funds. Local governments have been complying with the law. 
   Further, carryover was an intentional spending strategy built into WIA as a planned management strategy to assure proper and consistent operation of the workforce system. Since the WIA system must respond to unforeseen economic events such as plant closings, mass layoffs or disaster relief, some funds must be held in reserve to enable immediate response. 
   This rescission could impact the local workforce system and their ability to train workers. It is estimated that my state's share of the national rescission would be nearly $28 million. 
   I recognize the tough choices we need to make in a difficult budget environment and believe the Chairman prepared an excellent bill which I was proud to support in committee and I am proud to support today on the floor. And again, I fully support an increase in funding for IDEA. However, I wanted to express this concern regarding WIA rescissions and highlight the impact it can have on states like mine.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISRAEL. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, this amendment solves a critical deficiency in our warfighting and our peacekeeping capabilities by strengthening the Arab language capabilities in the Department of Defense and Department of State. There are literally hundreds of Iraqis in the United States who supported our military units as translators in Iraq. They risked their lives, they risked their families' lives. They went on patrol in very dangerous areas, told our servicemembers what the enemy was saying, what was being said. 
   Then they came here to escape persecution, and when they got here, they wanted to continue providing those critical linguistic abilities and they were told there was no place for them to work. Many of them today are working in Safeways and working in Home Depots and working in restaurants, instead of providing the linguistic capabilities that we desperately need in the military theater. 
   Study after study after study, including the Quadrennial Defense Review, points to the critical deficiency we have in understanding the cultures and languages that we are fighting in. Our Nation now has hundreds of people who grew up in those cultures, speak those languages, pass background checks, risk their lives, and what do we do, even though we need their skills? We let them bag groceries at a Safeway. It doesn't make any sense. 
   This amendment would help solve that problem by instructing DOD and the Department of State to create a temporary program that would offer employment as translators, interpreters, or culture awareness instructors in Iraq, who meet certain rigid criteria. One, they must be here legally. Two, they must have worked for at least the last 12 months as translators in Iraq since 2003 for our troops or for another U.S. Government agency. 
   This amendment is endorsed by the Episcopal Church, Veterans for Common Sense, the International Rescue Committee, Church World Service, which works very hard on it, and many additional groups.     
   I would like to read into the Record, Mr. Chairman, a statement by Major Andrew Morton, U.S. Army Active Service, a former Director of Strategic Communications for Multinational Forces in Iraq, where he says, ``Representative's Israel's proposed amendment is a critically needed program to assist these many Iraqis who have put themselves and their families in harm's way to assist our joint operations in Iraq.'' 
   This is a very important amendment in helping those who were protecting us, and I urge its passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the distinguished gentleman, my very good friend from North Carolina, who has always been a tenacious advocate for the needs of the military and military families at Fort Bragg. I don't reside in North Carolina, but I do know from our friendship and our many conversations that no one fights harder and more effectively to represent the interests of those who are at Fort Bragg, including many of my constituents, who are there now waiting to deploy to Afghanistan. 
   I am very proud to stand here as a sponsor of this bill to honor New York's 69th Infantry Regiment, known as the Fighting 69th, once fought as part of the Irish Brigade. 
   I also want to acknowledge my cosponsor, Congressman PETER KING, the gentleman from New York, one of the earliest Republican sponsors of this measure which I have drafted. 
   Soon we will celebrate St. Patrick's day. That is a day when we will commemorate the enduring contributions of Irish Americans to the founding and development of this Nation. 
   In fact, if you read a book by Tom Cahill called ``How the Irish Saved Civilization,'' you would know that not only have the Irish made an enduring contribution to the founding and development of our country, but that their contribution transcends our country. When the world was a dark place, when the Roman Empire fell, when barbarians ruled, they tore down libraries, they destroyed all literature. 
   But it was the Irish who built monasteries. It was the Irish who brought scribes in who literally copied all of the great works of civilization. They preserved it. They handed it down from one generation to the next so that we would have it today. 
   In fact, it was Irish who did save civilization and similarly, it is the Fighting Irish, the 69th Infantry, that has saved America time after time after time and always answered their country's call. 
   Tonight, we put aside whatever political differences many of us have had in the past with respect to whether we should go to war in Iraq or not have gone to war in Iraq. That's not what this is about. Because, together, every Member of this House, Democrats and Republicans, support those who are fighting for our country and have answered the country's call. 
   We support men and women when they are in battle. We support them when they come home. I have always said thank God we live in a country that gives us the right to agree with the decision to go to war, the right to disagree with that decision, the right to remain silent. But no one has any right at all to forget the contributions that servicemembers make when they are called into duty. That is what this resolution is about. 
   Tonight there are a group of men who are in my friend from North Carolina's district who are at Fort Bragg. They are waiting to deploy to Afghanistan with the Fighting 69th. They are continuing the proudest traditions of being deployed to some of the most dangerous places around the world. 
   In the French campaigns of World War I, the island-hopping battles of World War II, in Iraq. That has been the history of the Fighting 69th since 1851.     
   In fact, it is safe to say that it was the 69th that saved the Union during the Civil War. And I would say, with apologies to my friend from North Carolina, the fact of the matter is that those of us on the north side of the Mason-Dixon Line recognize the fact that had it not been for the Fighting 69th, that we might have lost. Why is that? Because in 1861 there was a rumor that the British were going to assist and aid the Confederacy because the British needed cotton and textiles. Had they done that, that would have tilted the balance. That would have ended the cause for those of us north of the Mason-Dixon Line. 
   But you know what? President Lincoln did something very, very smart. Knowing that we could not afford for that to happen, he rallied the Irish boys. He went into New York City, and he mobilized many brand-new Irish American citizens in New York City and asked them to fight for freedom and to fight for the Union. And they fought. They fought at Malvern Hill in Virginia, not very far away from here. They fought against the dreaded and omnipotent Louisiana Tigers. And they won that battle. It was one of the first battles that the Union won. We were getting beaten in many of the early battles. And when Robert E. Lee asked his staff, Who beat us? Who did we just fight? His staff said, General, it was the 69th New York, to which Robert E. Lee, said, Ah, the Fighting 69th. And that is how they got their name, and they have carried that tradition with them ever since, through four wars and a fight to come in Afghanistan, 19 campaigns, six medals of honor. 
   On 9/11, many of them went to the Lexington Avenue Armory. I was there just a few weeks ago. And then they went to Ground Zero. One lost his life, Firefighter Gerard Batpees, a first lieutenant in the 69th. And then they went to Iraq, men like Chris Daniels from Centerport, Lou Delapizi from Bay Shore, and Col. Charles T. Crosby, the commander of the 69th in New York City. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to wrap up by telling my colleagues that a few weeks ago I visited with men of the Fighting 69th at the Bay Shore Armory on Long Island, and we had some good old New York pizza together, and I plan to visit with them in Afghanistan this July. 
   Many of us marched in St. Patrick's Day parades last week. Many of us will march again in St. Patrick's Day parades this weekend. And as we do, I hope we will remember the marches of the Fighting 69th, on Malvern Hill, in France, on Okinawa, where Private Ruiz won a Congressional Medal of Honor for single handedly destroying a Japanese pillbox. Private Ruiz, not exactly an Irish name, but the courage was Irish. On Route Irish in Baghdad, in Kabul and Jalalabad within weeks, that is where they marched and will continue to march. When they visit Afghanistan, they will be on some high mountains and in some very rainy and windy places, and I know we will think of them and apply to them this Irish blessing: 
   ``May you always have walls for the wind,  
   a roof for the rain, 
   tea beside the fire, 
   laughter to cheer you on, 
   those you love near you, 
   and all your heart may desire.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, may they come home soon to a country safer and sounder because of their courage. 
   I want to again thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his leadership. I also want to thank Major John Mark Pierre, an Army Fellow assigned to my office. He understood how important this bill was to me and his assistance was invaluable. I want to also thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for allowing this resolution to come to this floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee, and I rise in support of this very important resolution. 
   I want to thank the sponsor of this resolution, the gentlewoman from California, not only for authoring it, but for working with me several weeks ago on an amendment that passed by a bipartisan margin in the House of Representatives to send a message to the leaders of Sudan that we will not tolerate genocide and in fact we will explore the upgrade of the Abeche airbase, which is located 100 miles from the border in Chad. 
   This is a very important resolution. I rise in support of this resolution today because too few people rose in support of those from my faith who were victimized by a holocaust in the 1930s and 1940s. 
   When I came to this body, Mr. Speaker, I made a vow that I would stand up and oppose and fight against and speak out against any genocide, and speak out against any power that was wittingly or unwittingly empowering or assisting in a genocide, which is what brings me to the floor today. 
   I was recently in China just 2 months ago engaging the Chinese government on a broad range of energy security issues. China has one of the world's fastest growing economies, arguably the world's fastest growing economy. By the year 2030, it will have more cars on its roads than we have on our roads. It is expanding its defense budget. China can be an important partner with the United States in leading the world, but with that role in leading the world comes a responsibility not to empower, not to assist any kind of genocide. It is time for the leadership of China to stand up with our democracy and say no to the genocide that is occurring in Darfur, and China has a critical opportunity to do that. They purchase 70 percent of Sudan's oil. They invested over $10 million in the Sudanese energy sector over the last two decades. They are the main supplier of arms to Sudan with $83 million exported there in 2005. 
   Mr. Speaker, we want to work with China. We want to engage China. We want to work with China to lead the world in a constructive way on stability and peace and economic development and environmental stewardship, but China needs to show the world that it is willing to engage those who are perpetrating a genocide, to draw the line and say it will not be tolerated. That is precisely what this resolution does. I am very pleased and proud to support it. 
   I thank the gentlewoman from California again for her leadership, and I will continue, with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis, to stand up and speak out when genocide is committed, or against those who assist in the commission of a genocide.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISRAEL. (REINVESTING TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will vote to reinvest taxpayer subsidies from the most profitable oil companies in the world to the American people in the form of lower gas prices, lower home heating oil costs, and new jobs in clean, renewab le technologies. 
   For 6 years under Republican management, we attempted a strategy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to lower gas prices. The strategy was to provide $14 billion in industry subsidies to the largest oil companies in the world, the most profitable oil companies in the world. So $14 billion to them, and at the same time the Bush administration submitted budgets to this Congress that actually reduced funding for renewable energies, for energy efficiency, for weatherization, for sol ar, for hydrogen, for other renewable technologies.  
   And so what was the result? The result was this: Gas prices doubled; home heating oil prices tripled; oil company profits quadrupled, but the average American was now faced with an additional $1,500 in gas prices. And at the same time as oil company profits went up and as pocketbooks got lower and lower, the wallets of the American people lost more and more value, we actually increased our dependence on foreign oil. This year we are actually imp orting 1.6 million barrels of oil a day more than we were before the energy policy that the prior Congress passed and that the President signed.     
   So we're actually more dependent on foreign oil, and the American people are less well off. Oil companies did very, very well. But we did nothing to reduce our dependence on fo reign oil, and the American people lost $1,500 in the process. 
   Well, we're going to change that. We have the opportunity to change that this week. We're going to pass, I hope on a bipartisan basis, a new approach, a new strategy, a fundamental change in energy policy. And we're going to redirect those subsidies from oil companies to the pocketbooks of the American people. We're going to create as many as 3 million jobs in renewable technologies. We're going to invest those subsidies in the creation of n ew green jobs in solar and hydrogen and wind and geothermal. We're going to create those new jobs and regain our manufacturing capacity and capabilities. 
   Mr. Speaker, it troubles me that here we are, the country that defeated the most monumental threat of the 20th century in Nazi Germany and Japan, and we're now behind Germany and Japan in solar technologies. Of the top 10 wind companies on Earth, only one is American. Iceland, Denmark, now making great strides in geothermal and wind. We're not. Seven o ut of every 10 cars in Brazil are fuel flexible. We're not. 
   We can regain our capacities. We can regain our skills, we can regain our competitive edge in the world. We can regain our manufacturing strength in the world by leapfrogging ahead of them in renewable technologies. To do that, we've got to make investments in the American people, not the bottom line profits of oil companies. 
   When we gave those oil companies the opportunity to make those investments in the American people, what did they do? They made those investments in the oil companies' CEOs. One cashed out with about $60 million. 
   We believe that it's time to make those investments in the American people, in American jobs, in renewable energy. And by doing so, we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
   We have created a paradigm, Mr. Speaker, where, with a $9 trillion debt, we are borrowing money from China to fund our defense budgets to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to fuel our military to protect us from China and the Persian G ulf. It makes no sense. 
   This week, we have the opportunity to take a giant leap for common sense: reinvest in the American people, reinvest in American jobs, reinvest in our defense, reinvest in our competitive edge, reinvest in our human capital, reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And that's precisely what we will do by passing this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Thank you. I would like to thank my friend and dear colleague, Mr. Ackerman, for the time. 
   I actually rise to demand equal time, Mr. McNulty. The gentlewoman from New York talked about having Chinese food for dinner from time to time. The gentlemen from New York--Mr. Ackerman, Mike McNulty and I--have shared some Italian food also at various Italian restaurants in Washington, D.C., and I think that they deserve as much time as Chinese food. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a rule, a practice, a custom, and a tradition of this Chamber that we refer to each other as the ``gentleman'' or as the ``gentlewoman.'' No Member of this body more deserves the title of ``gentleman'' than the gentleman from New York, Mike McNulty. He is a gentleman in every true sense of the word. 
   Mike and Gary Ackerman and I often sit together on the floor of this Chamber during votes. Sitting with Mike is like sitting on an island of civility and of decency in turbulent and shark-infested waters. That's not to say that Mike doesn't fight for his principles. He fights for his principles but not by shoving people out of the way and not with sharp elbows but with a quiet and respected determination. He has been doing that for 20 years. 
   Now, some Members of this body, having been here for 20 years, might grow jaded. They may begin to take it for granted. They may start to forget just what a glorious place this is but not Mike. He was recently quoted in the Congressional Quarterly as saying, ``Especially at night when the Capitol is lit up, I still pinch myself. It is an honor to serve here.'' 
   Nothing makes Mike McNulty prouder than serving here in this Capitol except for maybe one thing, and that is his family. I've had the privilege of meeting members of his family here in Washington and when I visited Albany. When he introduces them to any of his colleagues, I can't think of anybody prouder than Mike McNulty. 
   With always a gentle smile, with always a glint in his eye, his constituents have had a remarkable treasure representing them in Washington. I know they will miss him in Washington, but they gain him and his leadership at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of my favorite poets in the world is Rudyard Kipling, and one of my favorite poems of Kipling's is ``If.'' In that poem, he writes: 
   ``If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you ..... '' and then he goes on, ``If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; if all men count with you but none too much, if you can fill the unforgiving minute with 60-seconds' worth of distance run, yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, and--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!'' 
   We all know that Mike McNulty is a great man, but more than that, Mr. Speaker, he is a gentleman who still pinches himself even late at night, under a gloriously lit dome, that has been made better and brighter for his presence here and for the work he will continue to do for our country.

   Responding to the gentleman's suggestion that we not do this because we may have a vice president one day, we may have a vice president one day, but that vice president will admit to being vice president. The current Vice President refuses to admit that he is Vice President.     
   Now, we have heard in Washington flimflam and rope-a-dopes and evasions and half truths. This one takes the cake. This turns the theory of plausible deniability into undeniable irrationality. The Vice President is part of the executive branch. If he is going to state that he is not part of the executive branch, he should act accordingly.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISRAEL. (RUSH LIMBAUGH OWES OUR SOLDIERS AN APOLOGY -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I have always believed firmly in the qualities of civility in this House, and bipartisanship and constructive dialogue and engagement and respect for one another's disagreements. In fact, last night I spent an hour on this floor with Members on both sides of the aisle talking constructively in a bipartisan Center Aisle Caucus Special Order on Iraq. And we managed to put our political differences aside and talk not about left or right, but moving forward. And so civility is critically important to me and has been since coming here nearly 8 years ago. 
   But I must say, Mr. Speaker, that when I heard of the comments of Rush Limbaugh, when I heard him impugn the integrity of our soldiers, when I heard him call them phonies, I had just about had it. How dare he attack our soldiers. How dare he impugn their integrity. How dare he attack their credibility. There is no place in America for anyone to attack our soldiers while they are fighting in combat or when they have come home. I don't care what the reason, Mr. Speaker. There is no place in America for that, particularly coming from someone who believes that he is the ``gold standard'' of patriotism, who believes he has a monopoly on patriotism, who has accused anyone who dissents with a particular policy with which he disagrees as a traitor. What is patriotic, Mr. Speaker, about calling American soldiers phonies? What is patriotic about that? 
   If ever there was anything that suggested to me a dissent beyond the line, I would never call it traitorous, but I can't think of a better example of giving aid and comfort to our enemies than somebody who would call our soldiers phony while they're fighting, who would attack them while they're defending us. 
   He crossed the line, he crossed the line of fair play, he crossed the line of hypocrisy. This standard-barer of patriotism attacking American forces, it is unacceptable. It is unacceptable. Not only because it is hypocritical and not only because it is an attack on our Armed Forces, Mr. Speaker, but because it comes from somebody who never fought for our country, unless you consider being a disk jockey to be worthy of combat pay. Mr. Speaker, the American people are sick and tired of this kind of hypocrisy and this kind of attack. 
   I went to Walter Reed Army Hospital yesterday, and maybe that's why I'm so fired up, Mr. Speaker. I visited Walter Reed Army Hospital yesterday and with young men whose limbs have been amputated, whose futures have been changed. How dare anybody suggest that because one of them may disagree with a policy that that person is a phony. Thank God we live in a country that gives us the right to agree with a policy to go to war. You have the right to disagree, you even have the right to remain silent, but no one has the right in this country to call any member of our Armed Forces ``phony,'' and Rush Limbaugh owes them an apology.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in great concern over the ongoing Qassam attacks on the southern city of Sderot, Israel. Sderot is a community that has been plagued with frequent and intense firing on its inhabitants and infrastructure since Hamas's takeover of Gaza. These Palestinian militants are attempting to destroy an entire population and bring everyday life there to a halt. 
   Even today, two Qassam rockets landed in the vicinity of Sderot. One of these rockets was aimed at and landed near a kindergarten, on the first week of the new school year. Imagine the dilemma parents in this region face--they don't know if their children on any given day are safer at school, or at home given the continued rocket firings. 
   These homemade rockets cannot aim solely at military targets because they do not have any degree of precision. They are primitive, short-range, home-made rockets that do not have the technical capability to be guided, and consequently, strike innocent civilians. They have indiscriminately destroyed the economy and physically and psychologically devastated family life. 
   The current situation is unacceptable--the terror organization Hamas is clearly violating Israel's sovereignty and overriding Israel's right over its land and people. 
   A city of no more than 24,000, Sderot is less than a mile from the border with Gaza, where Israel withdrew its troops in the summer of 2005. Since then, thousands of these rockets pummeled this city and terrorized men, women and children on a daily basis. Sderot citizens are unable to go about their normal lives and should not be expected to live under this permanent threat. 
   Israel has shown considerable restraint and patience in dealing with those terrorist firing, despite the severity of the situation and the casualties and injuries they have taken. However, Israel has the complete right to defend itself against these intolerable attacks. No belief, however misguided, can justify the victimization of innocent people. 
   I would like to express my solidarity not only with the citizens of Sderot, but with victims of terrorism around the world. We need to do everything we can to bring an end to this unjust situation and help create a lasting peace so that the citizens of Sderot can go about their lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISRAEL. (THE TIME IS NOW TO SUPPORT HEROES OF 9/11 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend and partner in this critically important project, and I thank her for her leadership on this legislation. I know that she has been so dedicated and so devoted to this cause. 
   Mr. Speaker, on September 11, the President of the United States spoke to the Nation, and here is what he said: ``The American people have faced other grave crises in their history--with American courage, and with American resolution. They will do no less today.'' 
   I am not talking about President Bush saying those words on September 11. Believe it or not, Mr. Speaker, I am talking about President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who said those words on September 11, 1941, 60 years before the attacks on our Nation. 
   We have witnessed that resolution and that courage all around us since September 11. We witness it almost every day in our own interactions with the rescue workers, with the first responders, with those who could have fled and gone in another direction, but instead showed up and said that they wanted to help. 
   I know of an ironworker, Mr. Speaker, his name is John Sferazo. John Sferazo went to Ground Zero to help. He refused to leave. Today, John Sferazo's voice sounds like gravel. His breathing is labored. His chest hurts him. I know that my friend is well aware of John Sferazo. 
   John Sferazo contracted some very serious medical problems at Ground Zero. He probably knew then that he would have these problems. But still he didn't leave. He stayed there. And as a result of his courage and his commitment, his resolution and his determination, today his breathing is labored, it is difficult for him to speak. Our obligation to John Sferazo is to make sure we take care of him, to monitor his health, to improve his quality of life, to take care of him, because when the time came, he was there to take care of us. 
   I know of another worker, Mr. Speaker. I met him at a Ground Zero workers conference in my congressional district at the State University of New York at Farmingdale. I met him about a year ago. 
   I was a speaker at that conference; and as I was leaving, he stopped me in the lobby, and this is what he said. He said, Congressman, I am not sure I am going to be here next year. I am embarrassed to say, Mr. Speaker, that I thought he was saying that he wasn't  sure he could attend the conference next year. 
   I said, Well, I am sure that you will be able to come back. He said, No, you don't understand. I'm not sure I am going to be alive next year, is what he said. He said, What I am supposed to do with my family? Who is going to take care of them? 
   It may sound melodramatic, Mr. Speaker, but these are real people. Can you imagine doing what you thought was the best thing you could do, serving your country, serving your colleagues, going to Ground Zero, sacrificing yourself, and now you are not sure you are going to be around a year from now? 
   What is our obligation to these people? Our obligation is to take care of them and to take care of their families. Our obligation is to make sure that they get the health care that they need. Our obligation is to let them know that we will not forget them. 
   I will close by suggesting that next week many of us in Congress will attend 9/11 ceremonies. I plan after votes to fly home to be at Commack High School in my district for a 9/11 vigil. We are going to light the candles, and we are going to talk about what a grievous day that was and our commitment to having a strong Nation. 
   But, really, we should not think about these people just on 9/11. This should not be an anniversary commemoration. The legislation that the gentlewoman has introduced with my friends from New York will make sure that this is not just an annual commemoration, but that every single day, those workers who were there on 9/11 at Ground Zero get the health care that they need and that we are securing their future. 
   We had faced a crisis that day, a national crisis. They face a crisis every day, a personal crisis; and it is up to us to help and to secure their future. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman again for her leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, in the closing days of this session, we are going to debate our key priorities, whether we should invest more in researching illness and disease or whether we should cut funding. 
   I hope we will learn the lessons about the right priorities from a group of high school students in my congressional district at Northport High School. Two of their teachers, Mr. Pendergast and Mr. Deutsch, were afflicted by ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS strips people of their ability to speak, to swallow, to walk, and in many cases to breathe independently. 
   Now, these students could have ignored their plight. These students could have said we have other priorities. These students could have said it's not my problem, not our problem. Here's what they did: They raised over $400,000 on their own for ALS research and advocacy. They didn't just turn away from this problem; they became part of the solution. On January 16 they are going to gather at their Midwinter Night's Dream and raise even more money. 
   These students have become our teachers. I hope that we will learn their lessons about investing in the right priorities, about caring and showing compassion for those who need help. They have taught us a critical lesson, and I hope that we will listen carefully to the students of Northport High School.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have drafted this amendment with the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) to send a clear and unequivocal message to the Government of Sudan that we will proactively explore every option and bear the burdens necessary to help stop the genocide in Darfur. 
   400,000 innocent people have been murdered in Darfur, 2 million refugees, and through it all, the Government of Sudan tests the will and the patience of the United States, the United Nations and the entire world. This amendment says that we have the will and we are running out of patience. 
   One hundred miles from Darfur in Chad is the Abeche Air Base. If diplomacy fails, if Sudan continues to defy the world and perpetuate this genocide, that air base can be used for potential NATO operations. It can be used for a possible U.N. peacekeeping force. It can be used for humanitarian missions. 
   Our amendment expresses the will of Congress to make the upgrades necessary to that air base and requires the Department of Defense to report within 90 days on specifically what upgrades may be necessary and what the costs will be. 
   It says to Sudan, we will not turn our backs, we will not close our eyes, we will prepare. 
   I urge passage of this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   After the Holocaust, the world embraced the slogan, ``Never Again.'' What this resolution does is say that we will explore every option to keep our promise to that slogan so that it is not just words. 
   I also want to point out that the resolution, in addition to having the support of the distinguished ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, Republicans and Democrats, also was supported by Citizens for Global Slogans, Enough, the Project to Abolish Genocide and Mass Atrocities, the Genocide Intervention Network, the Save Darfur Coalition and the Truman National Security Project.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, one of the greatest financial assaults on America's middle class is the alternative minimum tax. Originally, it was meant to ensure that several dozen of the richest families in America paid their fair share of taxes, but it wasn't indexed for inflation, so it's robbing middle class taxpayers, like our union members, our cops, firefighters, teachers and nurses. Now, after too long, finally a real effort at reform is developing. 
   The Ways and Means Committee majority has unveiled a repeal of the AMT. Now, it's too early for me to say that I agree with every single element of this proposal. I am convening a panel of experts to assess it. But I am pleased that finally we are seriously addressing this middle-class rip-off. I want to thank Chairman Rangel. I hope to work closely with him in achieving real reform and real relief for America's working families and middle-class taxpayers.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I have finally figured it out. I have finally figured out why this administration and many of its Republican allies refuse to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and all they want to do is drill, drill, drill, drill. I've figured it out. 
   Every time oil has been released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the price of oil has fallen, each and every time. This administration has refused our demands that it do the same now, when we are in an emergency and has said, I would rather drill. 
   But its own Department of Energy analysis said, and I quote, ``Drilling would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030.'' 
   I figured it out. In 8 years, this administration has enabled oil company profits to go from $39 billion to $116 billion. Think about what those profits will go to in the next 22 years. That is what this is about. 
   This administration wants to give oil companies more time to reap larger profits, and refuse to give the American people the price relief they need by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and reducing the price of gas now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentleman for his leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, not to quibble over a rule, but to get to the heart of this very important legislation, in 1957 the American people were terrorized when Sputnik orbited the Earth, and it looked like the Soviet Union had beat us into outer space. What we did then, in the face of that very grave threat to our national security, was to launch a new generation of engineers and scientists. 
   What we did then was went into our classrooms and nurtured a new generation of people who could engineer, research, develop, manufacture and mobilize. That generation of engineers landed us on the Moon. 
   People say that NASA landed man on the Moon. I have a very high regard for NASA, but NASA didn't land us on the Moon. The Grumman Corporation landed us on the Moon. NASA provided the incentives and the support and acted as a catalyst to help mobilize that generation of engineers that figured out how to get us to the Moon. We won the Cold War with that generation. 
   I believe that today our dependence on foreign oil is just as grave a threat as Sputnik was; just as grave a threat to our security, and my children's security, as the Cold War was. We need to engineer again, to research and develop, to mobilize and motivate and inspire a new generation of engineers who can develop plug-in hybrids and fuel cells, hydrogen fuel cells and batteries and cellulosic ethanol. 
   I was in China just 2 months ago on an energy security congressional delegation. The seventh wealthiest person in China is manufacturing solar panels in China and selling them to Germany; not here, but selling them to Germany. 
   In Brazil, seven out of every 10 cars is running on flex fuel. We beat Germany and Japan in World War II. They are now ahead of us in solar energy. 
   If we could win the Cold War and World War II, if we could defeat Germany and Japan in World War II, we should be able to get ahead of them in solar energy. If Brazil can do it, we can do it. It starts in the classroom. It starts with our schools. It starts with that generation. 
   We can no longer afford to turn our backs on the future. It is time to harness that energy so that generation can provide us with the energy and security we need. It is time to stop borrowing money from China in order to fund our military, to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to fuel our weapons to protect us from China and the Persian Gulf. 
   This is a national security issue, and it's time for us to treat it as that and invest in that next generation of engineers and scientists. That is what this bill does, and that is why I am so proud to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I would like to rise in support of language I included in the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act. 
    I have consistently fought for boating safety for the last three years in memory of my constituent Brianna Lieneck who died in August of 2005. Her parents came to me after losing their daughter. They have made it their mission to fight for boating safety and to make the water safer for others. 
   Their daughter Brianna an 11-year-old girl from my district who was tragically taken from us three years ago during a boating accident on the Great South Bay. The accident occurred on August 17, 2005 when a boat collided with their own. The operator of the other boat was reckless and there was poor visibility from the lack of lighting on the water that late at night. 
   While we can't bring back Brianna I have made it a priority to fight or mandatory boater education. And I want to commend Brianna's parents for taking this horrible tragedy and using it to fuel such a worthy cause. 
    This year the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act will include language mandating that the Coast Guard find the best and most feasible ways to establish mandatory boater education for all states and report back to Congress within 6 months. This is an important first step in boating safety because education directly translates to safer waters. The Coast Guard estimates that 70 percent of reported fatalities occur when a boat operator has not received boating safety instruction. 
    So many careless accidents can be avoided by taking one simple course and being more informed on the water. 
    Boating accidents claimed 710 lives in 2006 and caused 3,474 injuries. Of that, 14 deaths and 100 injuries occurred in New York State in 2006. There were a total of 152 boating accidents in the state of New York. 
    There has been no significant decrease in the number of boating deaths since 1996 and the number increased between 2003 and 2006. This is unacceptable. If one simple course will decrease the number of deaths and injuries on the water, it is so important that we do everything in our power to require mandatory boater education. 
    You must take a driving test before you are able to operate a car. You should, at the very least, be required to take an education course to operate a boat. 
    And we owe it to the memory of Brianna and other victims in the Nation to do all we can to prevent future fatalities on the water. 
    I would like to thank Chairman OBERSTAR and Ranking Member MICA for allowing this language to be included in the bill.

The bad news is the study by Harvard Medical School that there  are 2 million veterans who don't have health insurance and are not eligible for veterans care, 2 million veterans. What makes it worse is that President Bush is banning 273,000 veterans from receiving VA care because they are not income eligible. So he is balancing the budget on the backs of middle-class and working veterans. 
   The good news is that this Democratic majority passed the largest increase in VA health care in the 77-year history of the VA. We are going to add 1,800 new claims processors to make the long lines a little shorter and the wait shorter as well. 
   Now, we have to go even further. I'm urging my colleagues to sign a letter that I've sent to the President demanding that he reverse the policy of denying health care to 273,000 veterans and not means-test them. We didn't means-test when we asked them to fight our battles. We should not means-test them when they have to come home for health care.

We have eliminated over 200 programs in this project. The real issue is not cutting versus spending; it's priorities. Mr. Chairman, the American people understand priorities. 
   The other side had no problem finding the money to give Halliburton, in no-bid contracts, unlimited amounts of money to big corporations like Halliburton in no-bid contracts. What we're saying is let's instead invest that money in the Clean Air Act. 
   The other side had no problem bulldozing to passage billions and billions of dollars in tax cuts for the richest oil company executives on the face of the planet who have made more profits than any company has ever made in the course of human history. What we're saying is let's prioritize differently. Instead of using that money for tax cuts to oil company executives, let's invest it in the Clean Water Act. Let's invest it in the Environmental Protection Agency. 
   So this isn't just about cutting and spending. This is about priorities that the American people want us to pursue. The same choices that they make at their kitchen tables, in their living rooms, in their dining rooms, in their small businesses are the choices that we're suggesting. Instead of the wasteful spending on the special interests, the pharmaceutical companies, the big oil companies, we're saying let's return some of that money in investments on clean air and clean water.

   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was able to add $10 million for the Long Island Sound. That's $8.6 million more than last year's budget. It's more than $9.5 million of the administration's request of $500,000. 
   This is not a local issue, this is a national imperative. Twenty million Americans live within 50 miles of the shores of the Long Island Sound. The Sound contributes $5 billion to our regional economy. The Sound is an essential part of our history. 
   The chairman of the Armed Services Committee is with us this morning. He knows that Nathan Hale crossed the Long Island Sound to infiltrate the British. Generations of commercial fishing families have plied its waters. 
   Sadly, the Long Island Sound has fallen on hard times as a result of development pressures, nitrogen loading and run-off. This $10 million literally helps turn the tides of the Long Island Sound. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it, and I urge the other body to match that $10 million figure.

   In the spring of 2001, Vice President Cheney met with oil industry executives to develop a national energy policy. Then, before their policy was enacted the average price of a barrel of  oil was about $23. This morning, the price of a barrel of oil is almost $138. The policy did not work. 
   Then, before their policy was enacted, the average price of a gallon of gas was about $1.46. This morning, at the Commack Mobil station in my district, the price of a gallon of regular gas is almost $4.29, almost tripled. The policy did not work. 
   I am not saying that anybody is committing wrongdoing. I am just saying that people have pursued policies that have not worked. 
   Today we will try again to get to the President's desk Congressman Bart Stupak's anti-price gouging bill. Today we present another solution, a different idea, a better way to bring down gas prices. I urge my colleagues to support it on a bipartisan basis, I urge the other body to support it, get it to the President's desk, and let's start protecting pocketbooks rather than oil company profits.

For that we are a socialist government, Mr. Chairman.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, before I reserve the balance of my time, I just remind the gentleman who accused us of being socialists that I think just about every Republican, including very conservative members of the Appropriations Committee, supported this bill. I don't believe they would appreciate being called socialists because they believe in cops on the street and more resources for the FBI. They are not socialists; neither are we. We are commonsense, mainstream Members of Congress who want to protect America's neighborhoods.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I will just make a brief point and then yield to the gentleman from Ohio. 
   With the deepest respect to the gentlewoman, no one is implying that there is not concern by every Member of this body for those who have drug problems, for those whose lives are being ruined by meth. But you can't just wish these problems away. Somebody's got to take responsibility for working to end those problems. 
   Just like you can't wish them away, you can't expect that they are going to be dealt with by cutting investments in antidrug programs or even cutting the rate of increase, if you want to use the other side's terms. 
   We've put $40 million in this bill for mobile enforcement teams for antidrug programs; not mobile enforcement teams in Iraq, mobile enforcement teams right here at home to help the gentlewoman's constituents with those problems, to provide for a better future. We're investing in that future. We can't just wish these problems away. You've got to respond to them, and that's what we are trying to do. 
   Now, if the other side made the argument that we could cut giveaways to big oil companies and cut offshore tax corporate giveaways and cut all this corporate welfare and then cut these important criminal justice programs, then their arguments would have more credibility. Their arguments lack credibility because they're saying we can afford all these corporate giveaways, but we can't afford enforcement teams on drug abuse, we can't afford more cops on the street while crime is increasing, we can't afford counterterrorism initiatives and extra agents at the FBI while al Qaeda is planning against us. 
   This is just a difference in priorities, Mr. Chairman. We are strong on crime. We also understand that if you're going to be strong on crime, you can't just say it, you've got to do it, and frankly, it takes investments to do it. 
   That's what this bill does, and that's why every Republican on the committee supported this bill when it was in the committee, and that's why this amendment will be defeated by Republicans and Democrats alike. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, it warms my heart to know that the gentlewoman in her district visits schools and talks to local schoolchildren, and emphasizes those values of civility and tolerance and mutual understanding in our classrooms, and doesn't try to separate people by Democrats and Republicans. 
   I hope that the next time the gentlewoman goes into those schools and talks to those schoolchildren, and they ask her, Mr. Chairman, ``What are you doing to keep us safe from al Qaeda and the terrorists who are planning against us,'' that she will say to them, ``My proudest moment, young children, is that I cut the FBI budget by 0.05 percent, while approving tax cuts of $14 billion to the biggest oil companies on Earth.'' 
   I think those children would rather be investing in the FBI to keep them safe than be giving away those billions and billions of dollars in tax cuts to the biggest oil companies in the America.

The gentleman did not support attempts to cut or shave the $90 billion in tax shelters that allow offshore companies to shelter their profits, open up P.O. boxes in Bermuda so that they don't have to pay their fair share of taxes. We invest a fraction of that $90 billion tax shelter, $693 million, to add 2,800 cops to the streets of neighborhoods. We want to make neighborhoods safer by adding more cops.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Well, here we go again. We've been here week after week after week and entertained amendment after amendment after amendment. I respect my colleagues for trying. Unfortunately, a majority of their caucus disagrees with them, as does a majority of Congress. These amendments keep coming up, and they keep getting defeated, and there's good reason for that, particularly with this bill. 
   Let me share some statistics with you, Mr. Chairman. I alluded to them before. Violent crime is increasing in the United States today for the first time in 15 years. In 2005, violent crimes increased 2.3 percent. 2006, violent crimes increased another 1.3 percent. From 2002 to 2005, Mr. Chairman, there were an additional 100,000 new meth users over the age of 12. 
   Now, there is a dangerous correlation, because at the same time these violent crimes are increasing, Federal investments in safe communities have been cut. From 2001 to 2006, funding for local law enforcement grants was cut 42 percent. This isn't just a cut in the rate of increase, this is a wholesale cut in Federal support for anticrime programs, 42 percent, from $4.4 billion to $2.5 billion. And not only is crime going up as a result of these Federal cuts, but local taxes, which in many cases are the most regressive form of taxation, are going up as well. Because the fact of the matter is that when you cut Federal law enforcement resources, the criminals don't go away. They stay on the streets. They keep robbing banks. They keep beating people up. They keep stealing. They keep conspiring. And so while the Federal Government has abandoned its commitment to keeping our streets safe, it's the local governments who are now responsible for trying to keep those streets safe. And so all this Federal cut is is a transfer of the obligation to local taxpayers. So what sounds like a cut on the Federal level ends up costing taxpayers even more and more to protect their communities. 
   Mr. Chairman, let's analyze some of these cuts while crime increases. Safe communities. This small group of Members, who disagree with every Republican on the Appropriations Committee who supported this bill, had no problem supporting a $90 billion tax shelter for the biggest offshore companies on Earth to protect their profits. We in this bill invest a fraction of that, $693 million, to add 2,800 police officers to our streets to protect our neighborhoods. 
   The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. We can have differences on how to protect our borders. We all want to keep our borders safe, but if someone crosses our borders here illegally and then commits a felony, or several misdemeanors, and is arrested and incarcerated, most of us believe that the Federal Government ought to assume the financial obligation for incarcerating those people. 
   This small group of Members had no problem spending $14 billion on tax cuts for the biggest oil companies on Earth in the history of profit-making. We invest a fraction of that, $405 million, to reimburse local taxpayers for the costs of the incarceration of criminal aliens. What makes more sense to America? 
   The war on drugs. We learned in Iraq that you can't win a war when you underfund the troops. Well, guess what, Mr. Chairman. You can't win a war on drugs when you underfund cops on the streets. This small group had no problem spending billions and billions of dollars on Vice President Cheney's no-bid contracts. We invest a fraction of that, $40 million, to fight illegal drugs with mobile enforcement teams; not mobile enforcement teams in Iraq, Mr. Chairman, mobile enforcement teams here at home. 
   Child exploitation. We fund 93 additional positions in U.S. attorneys' offices to fight child exploitation and enforce obscenity laws; 38 new positions in U.S. attorneys' offices to fight gang crimes. Gang crimes are proliferating. Gangs are a national problem. They cross not only State borders, they cross town lines and county lines and village lines. It requires a national investment to stop these gangs from preying on our children. We invest in stopping those gangs. This small group says, let's cut gang enforcement by 3 percent. 
   Domestic violence. We invest $430 million for the Violence Against Women Act for prosecutions. This small group says, we can protect the profits of big drug companies, we can protect the profits of corporations that register themselves at P.O. boxes in Bermuda, but we have to save the investment in protecting women from domestic violence? 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, and this is the real kicker, to coin a phrase by my friend from Ohio several days ago, the war on terror. For the past 7 years, the FBI counterterrorist caseload has increased more than 100 percent, from 1,150 to nearly 2,400. How do they make the argument, Mr. Chairman, that as the counterterrorist caseload is going up 100 percent, we should shave resources by 3 percent to the FBI? I think most Americans understand that they can't go out and investigate terrorists, that that's the job of the FBI. We want the FBI to have those resources. 
   If there is money for oil companies, if there is money for offshore corporations, if there is money for Halliburton, how is it that we can't afford additional resources for the FBI in the global war on terror?     
   Mr. Chairman, I'll conclude by suggesting that this really is about priorities. And this is the debate we've had.  The sponsors of this bill have legitimate philosophies, and I understand their philosophies. Their philosophies are wrong. 
   They say government wants more of your money and that you should decide how to spend it. That's not true. They've spent the people's money on tax cuts for oil companies. We want to invest in COPS for neighborhoods. They've spent it on no-bid contracts for big companies. We want to spend it on investigators for the FBI. They spent it on protecting the profits of offshore companies. We want to invest it in protecting the safety of our neighborhoods. 
   That is why, Mr. Chairman, Republicans and Democrats, were united on this bill in the Appropriations Committee. Every Republican on the Appropriations Committee joined Democrats in passing this bill because it was common sense, the right investments, the right priorities. And that's why when this amendment is offered again on the floor for a vote, it will follow the same course and the same fate as every similar amendment before it. It will be defeated, not just by Democrats, but by Democrats and Republicans who understand that America would rather have their neighborhoods patrolled by more cops than have the offshore profits of companies at P.O. boxes in Bermuda protected by this small group of Members. 
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I just want to remind my colleagues of some important facts as we deliberate on these earmarks. I think it is very important to understand that we have reduced the dollar value of earmarks in this bill by 50 percent from the levels that the Republicans had when they were running this House of Representatives. A 50 percent reduction. We have cut 41 wasteful programs from the budget in this appropriations bill. We have saved over $1 billion over last year. 
   So instead of getting involved in the intricacies of one earmark after another, let's keep focused on the facts that count. And the fact that counts is that we reduced this budget and slashed those earmarks in half.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the gentleman's argument. At least his argument is consistent. I appreciate the gentleman's integrity, and I appreciate the principles of his argument. But I must say, sitting here listening to some of the other Members on the other side of the aisle consistently raises issues of inconsistency. 
   The gentleman who's offered this amendment has said we should go back to last year. That's all we're doing is going back to last year so we can hold the line on spending. Why we would want to go back to last year? When last year was there ever an attempt to hold the line on spending? 
   Mr. Chairman, the other side spent and spent and spent and borrowed and borrowed and borrowed. The difference between us is we want to invest in America's families. The other side, Mr. Chairman, decided to spend to give special interest giveaways. We want to spend to make sure that kids can get Pell Grants and go to college and compete in the global economy. They wanted to spend on no-bid contracts to Halliburton. We want to spend to make sure that seniors can heat their homes in the winter because of high oil prices. They wanted to spend on $13 billion in tax cuts for oil company executives who I don't think are eligible for LIHEAP. That's the difference between us. 
   We just had a debate earlier about the propriety of Members of Congress putting their names on projects that are funded by the Federal Government. I would suggest to my good friends that if there were an earmark for a facility called the Congressional Hypocrisy Treatment Foundation, there wouldn't be a plaque large enough for all of their names. 
   Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman just said the things that they are investing in and implying that the Democrats are making these investments. Yes, we are making these investments. They are investments in strengthening American families, making sure kids can go to college, making sure people can afford to heat their homes. 
   I will tell you something else, it's not just us, this bill came out of appropriations with a strong bipartisan majority. The most conservative Members of the other side voted for this bill. It's not that we are making these investments as Democrats, it's that most mainstream Members of Congress, with responsibilities to our districts, are making these investments. 
   Now, maybe there are some who are so far on the other side, so far on the fringe, that they would argue with their own conservative Members that an investment in college education is a bad idea. But the fact of the matter is, they are in a very, very small minority. 
   This bill has strong bipartisan support in the Appropriations Committee. Republicans and Democrats work together despite the opposition from such a fringe minority.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, the differences we have heard in this debate are entirely clear. We want to, with Republicans on the Appropriations Committee, who by a widespread margin supported this bill. We want to continue to invest in America's families and in their future. A very small group of Members on the other side want to continue going to the past where they were spending taxpayer dollars on special interest giveaways. 
   There are people, in all of our districts, who are scratching their heads trying to figure out how they are going to send their kids to college so they can compete in a global economy. The President wants to slash or eliminate college affordability programs for 1.5 million students. 
   Now, that's why Republicans and Democrats on the Appropriations Committee supported investments that will make additional Pell Grants available so that people who are working hard, playing by the rules, and want their kids to advance can send their kids to college. This isn't a radical idea. 
   This was a bipartisan consensus on the Appropriations Committee. But those who are offering these cutbacks don't agree with Republicans and Democrats who believe in making investments so that people who play by the rules and work hard can send their kids to college. 
   There are people in our districts who are trying to figure out how they are going to pay for their skyrocketing home heating oil costs. The President wants to cut home heating oil programs by $379 million and take away assistance to 1.5 million people. 
   That's why Republicans and Democrats on the Appropriations Committee agreed that we should invest a fraction of that, $880 million to make sure that an additional 1 million people can pay their heating oil bills. Republicans and Democrats on the Appropriations Committee, bipartisan, there are a few who say, no, no, we should continue giving tax cuts to big oil company executives rather than giving people the ability, helping people with the ability to pay their home heating oil costs. 
   There are people in our districts who can't figure out what to do if they get cancer, how they are going to have access to health care programs. The President wants to cut medical research at the NIH by $480 million and cut preventive health care services by $220 million. That's why Democrats and Republicans join together on the Appropriations Committee to invest $1.3 billion to improve health care access and help 1 million Americans receive treatment and increase investments in NIH. 
   This is about priorities, bipartisan common-sense priorities. This is about those of us on both sides of the aisle who believe that we should invest in strengthening America's families and a very small group who believe that we should continue to borrow to give away money to the special interests. 
   I want to conclude by reminding my colleagues how we go about making these investments, not by raising taxes. They are going to keep saying it and saying it and saying it. That's not how we do it. We cut 41 programs. We slashed earmarks in half. We saved $1 billion.

Madam Chairman, I would just say to the gentlewoman that in fact she may not be getting calls from people saying that it's harder for their kids to afford college, or that gas prices are getting higher, or that they're worried about their health care. But many Republicans and Democrats are getting those calls, which is why there wasn't a single Republican in the Appropriations Committee who voted against this bill. 
   The gentlewoman also said that we've got to be fiscally responsible. Well, that's why so many Republicans joined us in supporting this bill, because in fact this bill cuts 41 programs that didn't make sense any more, and reduces by half the number the dollar value of earmarks that we had in the past.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Well, Madam Chairman, it is refreshing to hear some candor on the other side in their admission that there is a fringe. And that is, in fact, a matter of fact because there wasn't a single Republican vote against this appropriations bill in committee. 
   Now, those who define themselves on the fringe would suggest that the answer to America's problems is a 1 percent solution. We can rein in our deficit that they built up with a 1 percent cutback. 
   I don't know where they were, and I have a very high regard for their position, but I do feel an obligation to ask where were they in offering amendments to cut $13 billion in giveaways to the richest oil company executives making the largest profits in the history of humankind? Where was the 1 percent cut amendment then? Suddenly we could afford that, but we can't afford additional Pell Grants for the steelworker that the gentleman refers to. 
   Where were they with an amendment for a 1 percent cut in excessive payments to Halliburton, $1.47 billion in payments to Halliburton that have been found by the Federal Government to be fraudulent? Where was the amendment to cut those payments by 1 percent? We could afford excessive and fraudulent payments to Halliburton, but we can't afford additional investments in cancer research and access to health care for the American people. 
   I would respect my colleagues if they showed more consistency. But there has not been that consistency. It is not about spending. It is about spending on the wrong things and the wrong priorities.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Well, another fringe offering. Now we're down to .5 percent. The solution to America's problems is now down to .5 percent. The solution to America's problems is now down to .5 percent, less Pell Grant money so the kids can go to college, higher fuel bills in the winter for people who can't pay their fuel bills. I never saw a .5 percent reduction in funds to Halliburton. I never saw a .5 percent reduction in the $13 billion in giveaways to Big Oil company executives, who are making the world's greatest profits. But now suddenly, when it comes to reducing people's heating bills or reducing their college costs, we want them to have another .5 percent burden because the burden they have just isn't enough. 
   This is d&#233;ja 2 vu all over again. It was a bad idea on the amendment before this. It was a bad idea on the amendment before that. It's still a bad idea, it's just down to a .5 percent bad idea.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Thank you. Reclaiming my time, the gentlewoman's proposal  would impose an across-the-board cut in No Child Left Behind. No Child Left Behind is a Federal program that local school districts must honor. It is a huge unfunded Federal mandate. And I don't know about the gentlewoman's school districts, but I know that my school districts come to me all the time saying, Washington is forcing us to do these programs, but they're not giving us the money that they promised, which means that we have to raise taxes. 
   And so I would respectfully suggest to the gentlewoman that a .5 percent cut in this bill is a .5 percent property increase in her congressional district, because those poor school districts don't have the ability to say yes or no to those programs. They've just got to provide the services and find the money for it. 
   We don't think that local property taxpayers should have to bear that burden. We believe, along with every single Republican in the Appropriations Committee, that the Federal Government should assist in those programs.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Chairman, I reclaim my time. 
   Madam Chairman, I am using the terms the gentlewoman insists on. I am reading directly from the committee report. The committee report states that there is $26,848,000 for adoption opportunities. Because we all want to reduce the number of abortions in the United States, so there is $26,848,000 for adoption opportunities. The gentlewoman's amendment would, as I understand it, reduce by .5 percent the amounts that are in this bill. 
   So, Madam Chairman, I ask the gentlewoman again, and I will yield to her, is she advocating a .5 percent reduction in the committee recommendation of $26,848,000 for adoption opportunities? 
   I will yield to the gentlewoman, since it is her amendment. 
   If she cares not to take the time, I will ask the gentleman. I will yield to the gentleman if he can answer this, Madam Chairman. I would yield to the gentleman, if he would choose to answer this question. 
   The committee report recommends $9.5 million, out of a $2.5 trillion Federal budget, $9.5 million for the adoption incentives programs. I would ask, Madam Chairman, whether the gentleman supports a .5 percent reduction in adoption incentives. 
   I would also ask, Madam Chairman, this: the committee recommends a total level of funding of $141 million for the Community Based Abstinence Education program. That is the level of funding that the committee, on a unanimous basis, Republicans in the mainstream and Democrats in the mainstream, agree on. 
   I will yield to the gentleman, Madam Chairman, if he can say is it the position of the fringe that we should actually cut by .5 percent $141 million for Community Based Abstinence programs. 
   I will yield to the gentleman, Madam Chairman.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 
   I would just state at some point, two plus two has to equal four. It can't equal what you want it to be; it has to equal four. 
   These are the amounts of funding that are in this bill, reported by Republicans and Democrats. Every single mainstream Republican, every conservative Republican on the Appropriations Committee, supported these numbers. The gentlewoman says, no, no, we have to shave .5 percent from these numbers. 
   I am still waiting to hear whether a single Member on that side would publicly say that they want to cut adoption programs, abstinence programs, runaway youth programs, child abuse programs. 
   I will yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Ohio.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Chairman, I appreciate all these donkeys on posters. We won't say anything about the 3 trillion elephants that ought to be on these posters, the $3 trillion in debt that part of this fringe has supported when they wanted to spend more money on Halliburton, more money on tax cuts for big oil companies, didn't see any amendments to cut those amendments. Now we see amendments to cut or reduce the amount of spending and investment in other funds. 
   I would, Madam Chairman, through the Chair, ask the gentleman that if we were, you know, I guess in Washington two plus two can equal whatever you want it to be if you listen to other side, Madam Chairman. But I would like to, using the gentleman's own definition of cuts and no cuts and using his posters, I would ask the gentleman, Madam Chairman, and I'd be happy to yield to him through the Chair. 
   The gentleman seeks a cut, an actual cut, in Abandoned Infants Assistance. Now, this isn't a cut in any increased investment, I would say to the Chair. In fact, funding for Abandoned Infants Assistance is at $11,835,000 for abandoned infants, and if the gentleman would read the report, he would note that it says this amount is the same as the fiscal year 2007 funding level. No increase here. 
   Madam Chairman, I would ask the gentleman through the Chair whether he is standing on this floor advocating an actual cut in the Abandoned Infant Assistance Program match.

   Mr. ISRAEL. I reclaim my time. The gentleman has argued that a cut's really not a cut because the rate of spending is increasing. The rate of spending does not increase in this program, Madam Chairman. It is the same spending as last year, which means that the gentleman's cut is an actual, concrete, specific, documented reduction in Abandoned Infants Assistance from last year. 
   Madam Chairman, I would go on to another program and through the Chair ask the gentleman if he would like to, since he was unable to give me a yes or no answer on the last example, I will provide another one. 
   Madam Chairman, I will yield to the gentleman if he would like. Is the gentleman advocating an actual cut in community-based child abuse prevention? Because the funding for community-based child abuse prevention is not increased in this budget, not by a penny, and so the gentleman's cut actually reduces it below last year's level. 
   Madam Chairman, does the gentleman advocate to his constituents a cut in community-based child abuse prevention? And I would yield to the gentleman if he desires to respond.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Reclaiming my time, I'm suggesting that it was more than a quarter percent when it came to a $13 billion tax cut for the biggest oil company executives on Earth, and it was more than a quarter percent cut when it came to excessive fraudulent payments to Halliburton. 
   But when it comes to runaway youth, domestic violence, law and order, abandoned infants, anti-gang programs, I would rather that the money go to those investments rather than to special interests. 
   So I would ask, again, to the gentleman through the Chair, is the gentleman advocating a cut in adoption opportunities because the adoption opportunities program, Madam Chairman, is funded without an increase at the same level as last year. Would the gentleman agree, Madam Chairman, that the cut that he proposes means an actual cut in the program for adoption opportunities from last year's level? At least can we agree that two plus two equals four or four minus two equals two. Can we at least agree on that, Madam Chairman? 
   And I yield to the gentleman.

We have listed, Madam Chairman, a variety of programs that didn't receive one penny of increase in this budget, in this appropriation, and I've asked the gentleman will the gentleman acknowledge that his amendment is an actual cut on these programs: adoption assistance, abstinence, anti-gang activities, safe and stable families, domestic violence. Is it actually a cut below last year's level? Yes or no, and I would yield to the gentleman for a yes or no answer.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Chairman, we have heard in this debate that the other side is not really cutting programs, they are cutting the rate of growth of programs. But we provided about a dozen programs that get no increase in this budget, that in fact will be cut from last year's. So the fact of the matter is that these cuts are real, and these cuts hurt families. 
   Now, this is all about choices, and it goes back to this. Not a single member of this fringe group who disagrees with their own Republican caucus that supported this bill in the Appropriations Committee came to this floor to argue for a 2 percent cut, a 1 percent cut, a 5 percent, a .5 cut. When it came time to give $13 billion to the big oil companies, then there was plenty of money to go around. 
   But now the argument is we can't afford to give people who want to send their kids to college an increase in Pell Grants. Not a single amendment was offered by this fringe group when it was time to provide Halliburton with dollar after dollar after dollar so that $1.47 billion was found to be fraudulent and excessive. I didn't hear a single one of this fringe group come to the floor and argue for cuts.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, today there is going to be lots of talks about process and procedures and walkouts and delays. The American people don't want us to focus on process. They don't want us to walk out. They want us to move forward. 
   One way we can move forward on both sides of the aisle is to pass an energy bill today as a matter of national security. Because 2 years ago the Department of Defense spent $10.6 billion to fuel itself to protect us. The Air Force spent $4.7 billion on one thing: Fuel. 
   We are in a situation right now where we are borrowing money from China to fund defense budgets to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to protect us from China and the Persian Gulf. 
   This is not the time to delay or walk out. This is the time for us to work together, move America forward, pass an energy bill and make us safer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I fully respect the views of the gentleman from California, but I do get troubled when I hear anybody on this floor questioning the commitment of any other Member of this floor to our troops. 
   I did not suggest for a moment that the other side was not supportive of our troops when they underfunded our troops, when they didn't provide enough up-armor for their Humvees, when they didn't provide enough armor for their vests, when they allowed Water Reed Hospital to deteriorate. 
   When these things happened, I never questioned the commitment of the other side to our troops. And I think we would all appreciate it if we confine our differences to honest policy debate and not suggest that any Member of this body does not support the brave men and women who are fighting for our country. 
   I support this resolution because it is another attempt at good-faith, honest compromise with the President of the United States. Two weeks ago we offered a compromise to the President. We said we will give you everything that you have asked for, for operations in Iraq, and we will give you more for operations in Afghanistan, where the war on terror began. We will give you more money for Walter Reed, for post-traumatic stress disorder, for traumatic brain injuries. And the President  said, no thanks. I want a blank check and I want to be able to spend a blank check eternally. 
   And now we are back offering a new compromise which says we will fund operations in Iraq. We will strengthen our capabilities in Afghanistan. But we want accountability for the first time, Mr. President. And all we are saying is this: report to the United States Congress, certify our progress, and in 2 months we will have a choice. Some people can say the status quo is working fine, progress has been made, the management of the administration is going well, and vote to continue operations in Iraq. And others will have the opportunity to draw a different conclusion and suggest a strategic redeployment. That is a commonsense compromise. And, frankly, if the President of the United States vetoes this compromise, he is saying to the American people I don't want accountability. I don't want oversight. I want it my way. I want it myself. 
   I just want to thank the gentleman for including language that was originated by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) that codified the President's own language that for every Iraqi soldier that reaches combat proficiency, an American is redeployed. The President has been saying that for 4 years. 
   If 378,000 Iraqis have reached combat proficiency, why did we need a surge of 20,000? Why do we need another 13,000 that the President called for? All we are doing is codifying the President's own language: for every Iraqi soldier that is trained, an American is redeployed. 
   I thank the chairman for including that language. I thank the gentleman from Missouri for originating it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Mr. Bishop from Long Island, for asking several of us to pay tribute to Lieutenant Michael Murphy, who received the Medal of Honor. 
   Madam Speaker, I did not know Michael Murphy personally, but I knew of him. I have a love of history, and particularly military history. And I know that every generation of Americans has confronted challenge and threat, grave and great, with the heroism of Michael Murphy. Every generation has produced its Michael Murphys. 
   In August of 1776, in the Battle of New York, there were men like Michael Murphy. They were surrounded by the most powerful navy in the world, the British Navy, And American democracy could have been snuffed out at that point. But men like Michael Murphy took risk, sacrificed their lives, fought on, and replaced British monarchy with American democracy. They fell, Madam Speaker, so that I could stand here in this body, the Congress of the United States, the people's House of the oldest democracy on Earth. 
   There were Mike Murphys in Gettysburg, in the Fighting 69th and other brigades, at Shiloh and Fredericksburg. There were plenty of Union generals who told President Lincoln that they didn't really need to fight the Civil War; you could have slavery on one side of the line and we could have freedom on the other and that would be fine. But there were men like Michael Murphy who understood that slavery in the United States was not an option. They fought on; they refused to retreat. They would not surrender. They would not lose their ground. They fell so that my children could grow up in a country of liberty versus tyranny. 
   Madam Speaker, there were Mike Murphys who grew up on Long Island. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Madam Speaker, stood where you are now and summoned America into the greatest battle of the 20th century, against Nazism and fascism, there were Mike Murphys from Long Island who stood up, who stormed beaches, who leapt hills, who ran through Europe, freed France, liberated concentration camps, went to the Pacific, freed the Pacific and came back, looked at the Moon and said, we could go there, too. Many of those heroes, Madam Speaker, are from Long Island, and we value and thank every one. Only 18 Long Islanders, Madam Speaker, have received the Medal of Honor, Mike Murphy and 17 others. 
   Madam Speaker, Mike Murphy fell in a long and noble tradition of those who made the ultimate sacrifice. He is linked in time with those I mentioned: in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Vietnam, in Korea, in Normandy, and stretching back to the earliest battles and the first battlefield. 
   Let me close, Madam Speaker, with a passage that could have been written about Michael Murphy, although it was uttered almost 2,500 years ago. This is what Pericles said at the funeral of fallen soldiers: 
   ``In the fighting, they thought it more honorable to stand their ground and suffer death than to give in and save their lives. So they fled from the reproaches of men, abiding with life and limb the brunt of battle, and in a small moment of time, the climax of their lives, a culmination of glory, not of fear, they were swept away from us.'' 
   So and such they were, these men, worthy of their city. Madam Speaker, Michael Murphy went to Afghanistan to defend the City of New York, which was attacked out of Afghanistan on 9/11. He joins a proud and noble tradition of history's best. My thoughts, my prayers and my condolences go to him and his family. And he will always be remembered in this Congress as the citadel of freedom in the world, for fighting for that freedom.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. Let me say at the outset, I have the deepest respect for the opinions expressed in this Chamber. I may not agree with them, but I respect them. 
   We are all try to reduce unintended pregnancies. We are all trying to reduce abortion. In contrast to what a prior speaker said, there is nobody here in this Congress, right or left, who doesn't have respect for human life; and that kind of verbiage really ought not to be expressed in this Chamber. 
   I will say, however, that while I respect my opponents' arguments, the arguments do lose some credibility on the issue of fungibility. The fact of the matter is, as has been stated before, not one penny in Mrs. Lowey's bill is spent promoting or providing abortion. It is on in-kind contraceptives. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle have said, whoa, whoa, but that is promoting the funding of abortion, because every single in-kind contraceptive that is donated means that there is more money by that country to fund an abortion. 
   Well, if you are going to apply that argument, my friends, then you better just admit defeat on the global war on terror right now. Because the fact of the matter is that many of the same countries that we are providing in-kind military assistance to to help us in the global war on terror allow for legal abortion. Some even provide abortion services. 
   Here is a map. If you are going to argue the fungibility issue, then in fact every time that we provide funding to Pakistan, we are promoting abortions, because in some cases abortion is legal in Pakistan. 
   Every time we are providing military funding and assistance to India, we are promoting abortions. Australia, Japan, South Korea. When we are providing funding for the Colombian antidrug initiative, we are promoting abortions in Colombia under that argument. Canada. Russia. When we provide military assistance to secure loose nukes in Russia, under your argument that money is fungible. They can take our assistance, secure the loose nukes and then use that money in order to provide and promote abortions. 
   If you use that argument, my friends, you need to go back to your districts today and admit to your constituents that every time you have supported that military aid you have supported abortion, because the money is fungible. 
   The Czech Republic. Many of you support providing military assistance and in-kind assistance to the Czech Republic for the national missile defense system. They permit abortions. Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria, NATO countries, South Africa, the Ukraine. 
   The fact of the matter is that the fungibility argument has no credibility. You can only have fungibility if you have money. There is no money in this bill for abortion services. 
   If we are going to have an honest debate on this issue, let's be honest and let's be consistent. What this language does is say we want to reduce unintended pregnancies. We want to reduce abortions. The way to do it is to allow for in-kind contributions of contraceptives. This is important language. 
   I oppose the amendment, and I urge Members to be consistent.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman. 
   I just cannot let this go. Pile on and pile on and pile on? Let me tell you what has been piled on, $3 trillion in debt, piled on by the other side. 
   Growing government? The other side was in charge for the past many years. Their party ran the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives; and they piled on $3 trillion of debt. 
   And now we hear the unmitigated audacity of suggesting that we are the problem. Mr. Chairman, we are not the problem. We are trying to solve the problem. 
   And I would say with all due respect to the gentlewoman and to those on  the other side who believe that this foreign operations bill is too expensive, is the gentlewoman advocating cutting by 1 percent foreign military financing or international military education and training? Is the gentlewoman suggesting to her constituents that we should slash budgets to professionalize other militaries to assist us in the global war on terror, to make sure that they have the technology and the equipment to help win the global war on terror? 
   Because if you are suggesting a 1 percent cut or 2 percent cut or 3 percent cut in this bill, you are suggesting a cut in our national security. You are suggesting reducing the amount of military assistance, education, and foreign military sales that we are providing to our allies around the world. 
   Mr. Chairman, they are costing their own congressional districts jobs, defense contractors who are part of this Nation's defense. We will lose revenues because of these cuts to foreign military financing. 
   This is not just a foreign operations bill. This is a national security bill. It is a homeland security bill. They go hand in hand, and we should not be advocating slicing off one of those hands while we are fighting a global war on terror surrounded by threats. 
   We Democrats believe that we need a robust ability to meet that threat, not cut defense budgets as the other side is suggesting.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I think that we're all beginning to figure this out now. When this original amendment was offered, it was advertised as a cut to the foreign assistance budget, despite the fact that Democrats already cut the foreign assistance budget. 
   Then we were told, oh, except it doesn't really include Israel. We're exempting Israel. 
   Then we were told, oh, it's Israel, and also, any appropriations that are not required to be appropriated or otherwise made available by a provision of law. 
   And so we start off with a cut, and then we say, well, not really a cut. We're going to void this and ignore that and sequester this and sequester that. 
   We're down to Secretary of State licensed chauffeur, my colleagues. That's what we're down to. We're down to the linens at state dinners. If you want to do a cut, do a cut. If my colleagues want to do a cut, do a cut. But don't try and fool the American people. 
   All we've heard from the other side is we have to ferret out waste, fraud and abuse, except we can't exactly find it, so we'll let you figure out. 
   Well, the American people have figured it out. You said you don't want to hurt national security, and yet this is a cut to foreign military financing. 
   You've said you want to win the global war on terror, and yet this is a cut to international military education and training. 
   You've said you want to cut, but not here, there, or anywhere else. 
   As our distinguished majority leader said previously, the truth is important, and it ought to be tried every once in a while. 
   What we have heard over the past several minutes is nothing but a hoax on the American people, and they're not going to fall for it.

   Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I thank my distinguished chairwoman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this very important amendment to the floor. I think it is a critical reminder to the Palestinian Authority that they need to get their act together and that we are losing patience with them. I want to thank the gentleman for a very constructive dialogue earlier today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I was at the border of Israel and Gaza when the gate fell down. The Israeli people said to the Palestinians, ``You can take this. You can have it. Try and build capability here. Try and build a country here. Try and build peace here.'' 
   Do you know what they did with it? They sent rockets over the border into Israel. They violated every commitment they made. They didn't develop a capability. They developed Qassam rockets. 
   Israel is surrounded by threat in the north with Lebanon, where Hezbollah violated the border, kidnapped Israeli soldiers, rained rockets on the north; in Gaza, which has imploded; has an existential threat from Iran, which is our threat as well. In between all those places, you have people running around with grenades strapped around their bodies blowing up themselves and everybody else they can take with them. 
   Israel has tried to negotiate and negotiate and negotiate, and every time it has negotiated, the result has been an interlocutor that has said, we can't really keep our promises nor can we keep the peace. 
   So the gentleman's amendment is very, very important, and I want to pledge to work with the distinguished chairwoman, who has had these concerns and who has led this Congress in these concerns for as long as she has been in Congress, with Mr. Wolf, the ranking member, who has led the fight on these concerns, and with the gentleman, so that the Palestinian Authority gets the message that we are losing patience and we will not continue to sit by and allow them to pursue a policy of destructiveness.
