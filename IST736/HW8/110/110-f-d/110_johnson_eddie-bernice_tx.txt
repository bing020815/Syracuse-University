<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill. 
   The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant. 
   H. Res. 635 recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace. 
   The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world. 
   During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all. 
   The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security. 
   American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multiculturalism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation. 
   During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is a strong economic driver in the State of Texas and an important national resource. 
   My colleagues and I on the House Committee on Science and Technology have worked on this legislation to reauthorize many of NASA's programs for 1 year. This action will provide a funding bridge until next year, and it will provide important funding for research and programs in the areas of science, aeronautics, exploration, education, space operations, cross-agency support programs and other activities. 
   NASA celebrates 50 years since its establishment. For 50 years, NASA research has enabled scientists to continue to do groundbreaking research in a zero-gravity environment, with untold benefits. For example, one of the many spinoff technologies from the Hubble telescope is the use of its Charge Coupled Device (CCD) chips for digital imaging breast biopsies. 
   The resulting device images tissue more clearly and efficiently than other technologies. The CCD chips can detect the small differences between a malignant or benign tumor, without the need for a surgical biopsy. This saves the patient weeks of recovery time, and the cost for this procedure is hundreds of dollars vs. thousands for a surgical biopsy. With over 500,000 women needing biopsies a year, the economic benefits are tremendous, not to mention the reduction in pain, scarring, radiation exposure, time, and money associated with surgical biopsies. Of course, this is just one of so many examples of NASA research that benefits society with broader applications. 
   H.R. 6063 authorizes $20.21 billion in funding for NASA in fiscal year 2009. I support this legislation and urge NASA to continue its education efforts. A well-educated technical workforce is essential to NASA's success, and it is imperative for the agency to continue to invest in education as well as its other activities. 
   Again, I want to congratulate NASA for 50 years of stellar work.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (AVIATION SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6493--The Aviation Safety Enhancement Act of 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, as many of us know, FAA's stated mission is ``to provide the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world.'' 
   Regrettably, recent aircraft groundings and flight cancellations by our Nation's air carriers to ensure compliance with safety directives calls into question whether or not the principal Agency charged with protecting the flying public is living up to its mission. 
   I think it goes without saying that over the years, the standing of our Nation's aviation system as one of the safest in the world can be directly attributed to the diligent efforts of dedicated inspection and maintenance personnel. 
   However, these respective personnel are only as good as their managerial and operational framework, and according to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel and our own Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Oversight and Investigations staff, serious flaws exist within the management of FAA's safety inspection framework. 
   In a letter dated December 20, 2007, to Department of Transportation Secretary Mary Peters outlining allegations of two FAA inspectors, now known as the whistleblowers, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel states, ``The whistleblowers allege that safety and adherence to regulatory compliance have taken a back seat to personal friendships and favors at the Southwest Certificate Management Office. 
   They have disclosed serious allegations of a compromise of the public safety mission at FAA. ``Even in the face of investigations substantiating wrongdoing and safety breaches [with respect to the ADs] FAA does not appear to have held management and safety inspectors appropriately accountable for their actions and inaction. The information disclosed by [the whistleblowers] reveals a substantial likelihood that serious safety concerns persist in the management and operation of the inspection and maintenance programs at FAA.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this type of behavior is simply unacceptable and warrants a complete overhaul of how the FAA goes about its business of safety inspections and over-reliance on Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Programs. H.R. 6493 is a step in this direction. 
   The bill establishes an Aviation Safety Whistleblower Investigation Office with an independent Director; modifies the Agency's customer service initiative; imposes post-employment on FAA inspectors; restricts the time a principal maintenance inspector may oversee a single carrier; and increases scrutiny of the Agency's air transport oversight system database. 
   When it comes to the proper adherence to safety protocols, FAA should be in the business of zero tolerance. If a plane is out of compliance for whatever reason, it should be grounded until it comes into compliance--period. 
   Yes, the American economy is dependent on the movement of people and goods, but this movement should not and cannot come at the expense of safety. Given the current, delicate nature of the airline industry, I cannot  imagine that there exists a single airline executive in this country that would sanction the operation of a noncompliant or unsafe plane. 
   As I close I want to thank the leadership of the Aviation Subcommittee, in addition to the leadership of the Full Committee for advancing this vital piece of legislation to the floor.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (CLEAN BOATING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2766, the ``Clean Boating Act of 2008,'' which provides a targeted Clean Water Act exemption for discharges incidental to the normal operation of a recreational vessel. 
   This legislation is in response to a 2005 Federal district court decision, which struck down a decades-old exemption for discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. 
   Although the focus of the 2005 court decision was the discharge of ballast water, the implications of this decision are likely to affect the more than 13 million recreational boaters in the United States. 
   The committee believes that the discharge of pollutants from recreational vessels is likely to pose a minimal adverse impact on water quality and the environment, even on a cumulative basis. 
   Accordingly, it is appropriate to reaffirm a limited exclusion from the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, requirements of the Clean Water Act for discharges incidental to the normal operation of a recreational vessel, such as graywater, bilge water, and weather deck runoff.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (CLARIFYING PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN VESSEL DISCHARGES -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3298. 
   The Clean Water Act is clear in its mandate that point source discharges into waters of the United States are subject to regulation. But while the law is clear on this point, the Act is less clear in providing guidance on how to deal with the concerns of mobile sources. 
   Discharges from vessels complicate this matter all the more. First, the sheer numbers of vessels make pollution control and regulation challenging. 
   Second--and very importantly--we are unclear on the effects of many of the discharges that emanate from vessels. 
   Third, efforts to address mobile sources of pollution are inherently more complicated than that of stationary ones. 
   For many years--from 1973 to 2005--the Environmental Protection Agency avoided these vexing issues by decreeing that discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel were exempt from regulation. 
   While a convenient and understandable approach to the challenges of regulating vessels under the Clean Water Act, EPA did nothing to control or even understand the nature of discharges that stemmed from vessels. 
   In 2005, however, a federal court ruled that EPA had acted in excess of its authority in ``exempting an entire category of discharges'' from regulation under the Clean Water Act. As a result of this Court decision, all vessels would be subject to Clean Water Act permitting requirements by September 30th of this year. 
   in both pieces of legislation before us today--in this bill, S. 3298 as well as in the Clean Boating Act--we seek to strike a balance among the various factors that have been central to the issue of minimizing pollution from vessels. And I believe we have been successful in realizing this challenge. 
   Central to S. 3298 is a moratorium of 2 years from regulation for a majority of vessels potentially eligible. 
   During this time, the EPA will do what it has not done enough of before--rigorously study what vessels actually discharge, and what the human health and environmental effects of those discharges might be. 
   This will provide the Congress with additional information that will allow us to properly  address whether, what, and how the discharge of pollutants from vessels should be addressed. 
   Among the vessels that will be subject to the moratorium is much of the Nation's fishing fleet. We recognize the financial margins that fishermen are subject to, and realize it would not be prudent to control their various discharges without better information. 
   However, given the uncertainty related to the types, volumes, and composition of discharges from larger commercial vessels, such as cruise ships and super-tankers, these vessels are excluded from the 2 year moratorium. This is only right. Our Nation's valuable fisheries and coastal areas should not be subject to the discharge of pollutants that enter our Nation's waters in such quantities. 
   Mr. Speaker, S. 3298 strikes an appropriate balance between precaution and commerce, and between aquatic health and pragmatism. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation today.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, let me express my appreciation to the gentleman from Florida for the time. 
   At the outset, I would like also to express my congratulations to our chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and Rail Subcommittee Chairwoman Brown of Florida for their good works on the bill and also the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica). It is a good bill that will have an immediate impact on improving the mobility of Americans all across the country. 
   I would particularly like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Brown for working with me to include a provision that requests the Secretary to examine the feasibility of expanding the South Central Rail Corridor to Houston, Texas. 
   Passenger rail lowers American fuel consumption because it's more energy efficient than both cars and airplanes. Intercity passenger rail consumes 21 percent less energy per passenger mile than automobiles and 17 percent less energy per passenger mile than airlines. Passenger rail also reduces global warming because it cuts in half the carbon dioxide impact per passenger over cars and airplanes, meaning that expanding passenger rail will reduce global warming. 
   The average intercity passenger rail train produces 60 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions per passenger mile than the average automobile and 50 percent lower emissions than the average airplane. This bill is not only good energy policy, it is also good transportation policy. Intercity passenger rail is an increasingly necessary alternative to highway and air travel, as congestion grows in many regions of the country. For example, Amtrak removes 8 million cars from the road each year. 
   At a time when gas prices continue to skyrocket, the demand by commuters and other travelers for cost-efficient public transportation systems, including passenger rail, is growing rapidly. This critical bill will help meet this growing need. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this sound bipartisan piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (HONORING JACK VALENTI -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor today for me to pay tribute to Mr. Jack Valenti. As it has been said, by age 15, he was the youngest high school graduate in Houston. He began work as an office boy with the Humble Oil Company, which is now Exxon Mobil, which is near my congressional district. 
   As a young pilot in the Army Air Corps in World War II, Lieutenant Valenti flew 51 combat missions as the pilot commander of a B-25 attack bomber with the 12th Air Force in Italy. He graduated with a B.A. from the University of Houston and an M.B.A. from Harvard. In 1952, he cofounded the advertising and political consulting agency, Weekly & Valenti, which was in charge of press during President Kennedy's and Vice President Johnson's tragic visit to Texas. He was in the motorcade, six cars behind the President, in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Within an hour of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Mr. Valenti was aboard Air Force One flying back to Washington with the new President as the first newly hired special assistant to President Johnson. 
   Later in his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the MPAA, Mr. Valenti presided over tremendous worldwide change in the industry. New technologies, the arrival of the importance of international markets and the tyranny of piracy radically changed the landscape of the American film and television industry. It was Mr. Valenti's leadership and personal efforts that led the confrontation with these global dangers, problems and opportunities. 
   Mr. Speaker, our communities and our country have always relied on the contributions of those individuals who have the ability to rise above and beyond the call of duty to make a difference in the lives of others, both personally and professionally. Jack Valenti was one of those rare individuals that demonstrated unfailing and tireless commitment to the betterment of the U.S. movie industry and the entire Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, though our community is diminished by his loss, I ask that my  colleagues join me and his friends and his family in celebrating the remarkable life of this man who truly symbolized America at its best, Jack Valenti, a true and loyal Texan.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution to recognize the African American spiritual as a national treasure. 
   Till the passage of the 13th Amendment, African Americn slaves were prevented from speaking their native languages, playing musical instruments they had used in Africa, and practicing their traditional religious beliefs. Despite attempts to strip away the history and identity of these individuals, they relied on a strong oral tradition to pass down stories and family narratives in the form of original songs, now known as spirituals. 
   These African American spirituals came to represent a part of history that many tried to silence through oppression and slavery. These songs are a part of the spirit that could not be destroyed by the institution of slavery. And while the spirituals we know today likely represent only a small portion of the total number, they remain an important link to the past as we teach new generations the meaning of our roots. 
   For African Americans, identifying their history and researching genealogy becomes challenging due to a lack of organized records. Many are left with piecing together records of their ancestors left from former slave owners. Through song we can identify with our past, and the African American spiritual is oe of the few remaining bastions of African American tradition and history though art. 
   I urge my colleagues to honor our history by voting for this importance piece of legislation.

   Mr. Speaker, ``green energy'' is defined as energy that is produced and used in ways that lessen air pollution and other environmental impacts. 
   An investment in green energy education will benefit our Nation in important ways. It is good for the environment, because it reduces environmental impacts of the production and delivery of energy. 
   Green energy also reduces harmful greenhouse emissions. 
   H.R. 1716 directs the Department of Energy to contribute funds to the National Science Foundation for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program. This program is important in supporting graduate education related to green energy projects. 
   The bill also supports energy technology research and development for high tech buildings and for educational activities to teach students how to improve building design that is not harmful to the environment.

   This legislation, offered by my colleague, Representative DeGette, specifies that it is illegal to utilize cloning technology for unethical purposes. 
   The bill text defines human cloning as the implantation of the product of human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology into a uterus.

   The members of the ``Mercury 13'' include Myrtle Cagle, Geraldyn ``Jerrie'' Cobb, Jan Dietrich, Marion Dietrich, Mary Wallace ``Wally'' Funk, Jane Briggs Hart, Jean Hixson, Gene Nora Stumbough Jessen, Irene Leverton, Sarah Lee Gorelick Ratley, Bernice Trimble Steadman, Geraldine ``Jerri'' Sloan Truhill, and Rhea Hurrle Allison Woltman. 
   The ``Mercury 13'' women successfully passed the same physical and psychological tests as those of their male counterparts, the ``Mercury 7.'' 
   Just before leaving for the next phase of training at the Naval Aviation Center in Pensacola, Florida, they were told not to come. 
   In 1961, their efforts marked a milestone in American history and these women paved the way for those who would follow in their footsteps. 
   The Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas has been the leading NASA center for more than 40 years and continues to encourage women to participate in the area of space exploration. 
   H. Res. 421 is an important way to help young women understand the importance of space and science. 
   As of today, there have been 34 women in space, and although this is a great accomplishment, there should be more. 
   It is my hope that this resolution encourages girls to pursue what they may feel is impossible. 
   The ``Mercury 13'' continue to inspire women of all ages to go above and beyond, so that they can fulfill their dreams. The sacrifices of these women deserve to be honored.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, as taxpayers filed their income tax this week, many were probably wondering just how much of their individual taxes would be invested in Iraq instead of here in the U.S. at home. Consider that every single second, the Bush administration is spending $4,000 in Iraq. That means that income taxes paid by the average taxpayer would not even cover the cost of one second of this war. 
   This country is already facing difficult economic times. We cannot afford to continue spending $339 million a day on a war that has no strategy for victory. If we invested one day of this sum in America instead, we could give 2.6 million American children access to medical and dental care, or we could hire more than 2,000 more border patrol agents to protect our borders. And we could send 18,000 more students to college.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, let me say thanks to Mr. Payne and Ms. Lee for bringing this forth. 
   I rise today in support of this resolution to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. 
   This anniversary marks a significant moment in not only American history but the history of the world. For 300 years the transatlantic slave trade represented one of the most horrific periods in the history of human events. During this time, 12 million Africans were captured and brought to America as slaves. Millions more did not survive this horrific trip overseas, which could have lasted as long as 3 months. These individuals forcibly gave their lives and freedom to build the economic future of America, which includes this Capitol. 
   While nothing can replace lives or freedom, it is important to acknowledge that the consequences of slavery still exist. While 200 years may have passed since the end of the transatlantic slave trade, the legacy of racism still persists. Today we take a step forward in healing those wounds by recognizing the past and acknowledging the impact it still has on our Nation. 
   I would like to thank Representative Lee for writing this and bringing it forth. Because all too often, we think nobody remembers but us, those who still suffer from this horrific period in our history.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. 
   My amendment is focused on the education activities at NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Specifically, the amendment designates $70.7 million of NASA's $220.3 million for education appropriations for the minority workforce preparation. 
   This program has been in action before. It was a good program, but because of the cuts that NASA did suffer, it was defunded actually, as they rearranged the funding. I thank the committee for the increase that they did make and commend their recognition of the importance of education funding for NASA. 
   All of us know that this is the focus of education, now, trying to make sure we have workforce available so that we can maintain the competitive edge. 
   NASA had proposed to spend about $40 million, or 27 percent, of its education budget on minority university research and education programs, commonly called the Hispanic-Serving Institutions, as well as the Historically Black Institutions. 
   So the program includes Partnership Awards for Integration of Research, the Space Science Collaboration, the Math Science Teacher and Curriculum Enhancement Program, the Undergraduate Scholars program, Network  Resource and Training Sites, Model Institutes for Excellence and the Earth Science Collaborations program. 
   I think that since only 2 percent of our Nation's engineers are African American and Hispanic, we really do need to encourage them to be in this part of the workforce. It's critically important to support these Federal programs. 
   I urge adoption, although I would like to have a colloquy with the chairman.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, thanks to the chairman of our committee. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. 
   This essential legislation reauthorizes the Federal grant program for capitalizing State revolving funds at $14 billion over the next 4 years, while providing States with additional flexibility in the types of projects they finance. 
   The bill also provides States with increased flexibility in the financing packages they can offer to cities and local communities, including principal forgiveness, negative interest loans, or whatever other financing mechanism might be necessary to assist communities in meeting their water quality infrastructure goals. 
   The flexibility afforded by this bill will go a long way in helping many of our communities that are least able to afford necessary improvements to their water infrastructure systems. 
   This legislation also encourages communities to consider innovative and alternative technologies for addressing ongoing water quality concerns, including the so-called ``green infrastructure,'' and provides financial incentives for implementing these technologies that may result in greater long-term environmental benefits. 
   In my State, few Federal programs have proven as effective as the Texas Clean Water State Revolving Fund program in realizing congressional goals for all citizens. The key to its success has been the partnership between the Texas and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency working together in blending State and Federal resources to provide sustainable funding sources. 
   This funding source provides a significant financial incentive for communities to construct, rehabilitate, and enhance wastewater systems that support the goals of the Clean Water Act. 
   Since its inception in 1987, the State revolving fund has successfully awarded communities approximately $4.3 billion in low-interest loans to finance 472 water infrastructure projects across the State. 
   These projects, which serve approximately one-half of the Texas population and treat about 2.1 billion gallons per day of wastewater, provide direct environmental and public health benefits by protecting our water resources through the reduction of pollutants entering the water. 
   The projects are made economically viable because Texas customers realize a direct cost savings by assessing the State revolving funds at rates below market rates. 
   Madam Chairman, it has been 20 years since Congress last authorized appropriations for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, and almost 10 years since the Committee on Transportation Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources first investigated the growing need for it.  
   Fortunately, we have overcome one hurdle that has prevented this legislation from coming to the floor over the past 8 years, and I applaud the leadership of the Chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. Oberstar, as well as the committee staff for their good works in moving this legislation out of Committee and on to the House floor. 
   Now, Madam Chairman, it is past time for this Congress to complete its task in sending this legislation to the President. 
   I urge my colleagues to strongly support this legislation; it's time we make our domestic infrastructure programs a priority again.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I strongly oppose the Baker-King amendment. I am from a working family, and I stand  with the American workers. The amendment would strip the prevailing wages protection from the bill. 
   Since 1931, the Davis-Bacon Act has provided a living wage for American workers, and as the authors of the Davis-Bacon Act knew then and as we continue to know today, the greatest way to improve the quality of life for our Nation's workers is for the Nation as a whole to provide workers with an honest living for an honest day's work. 
   We save nothing when we give people little pay or we pay it through other sources, by more taxes, more welfare rolls. I would much rather have people working. 
   It has been well documented by this committee that every $1 billion invested in transportation and water infrastructure creates 40,000 jobs. As of today, 31 States have enacted their own prevailing wage laws of publicly funded construction projects. And you check this with me: Those States that are against it have more poor people than the ones that have it. In some of these States, prevailing wage laws result in even higher wages to workers than if the Federal Davis-Bacon were alone, in effect. Studies have shown that the prevailing wage protections offered by Davis-Bacon in fact attracts better workers with more experience and training who are more productive than the less experienced, less trained workers. So it really saves money in the long run. 
   We need not to interfere with the Davis-Bacon provision. I support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, before I begin, I would like to commend the gentleman from Washington and Chairman Dicks and the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt) for their good work on this underlying bill. 
   The amendment I offered today stems directly from concerns I have over a recently proposed rule by the Environmental Protection Agency that could radically alter the current interpretation of the Clean Air Act and adversely impact public health. 
   On December 21 last year, 4 days before Christmas, EPA introduced a cleverly timed proposal that would essentially weaken hazardous air pollutant emission standards for major sources of pollution as defined by section 112 of the Clean Air Act. My amendment would prohibit the use of fiscal year 2008 funds by EPA to promulgate this ill-advised and environmentally dangerous proposal. 
   Currently, major sources, major source polluters, facilities that emit 10 tons per year of a single air toxin or 25 tons per year of any combination of toxic pollutants are required to comply with the Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards, called MACT, permanently, a policy adopted in 1995 known as Once In, Always In.'' 
   MACT standards are technology-based area emission standards established under title 3 of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendment. Compliance with MACT standards can require facility owners and operators to meet emission limits, install emission control technologies, monitor emissions and/or operating parameters and use specified work practices. 
   These public safeguard standards have proven most effective in reducing  toxic, harmful, cancer-causing eye pollutants such as mercury, chlorine, benzene, methanol and asbestos. If EPA's proposed rule were to take effect, industrial facilities could emit hazardous air pollutants at levels just below 10/25 major source thresholds and not be subject to the MACT standards. 
   This move has been criticized by the State clean air agencies, our regional officers, our major metropolitan leaders, as well as the county leaders and environmental groups. A majority of EPA's own regional offices initially excluded from viewing and providing input on the proposed policy have been highly critical of the proposed rule citing health and emission concerns. 
   EPA has done very little to justify such a dramatic shift in congressional intent or the agency's own long-standing interpretation. Moreover, the Agency has performed very little, if any, substantive emissions analysis, and they have performed no public health analysis for any industrial sector. In my view the Agency's proposed rule represents another installment of regulatory attacks designed to gut the Clean Air Act. 
   The public health of this Nation should not be forced to take the back seat to the interest of big polluters. The congressional authorities captured in section 112 of Clean Air Act are intended to ensure that major source emitters of hazardous air pollutants are required to comply with MACT standards permanently to ensure that the elimination of air toxics are achieved and maintained in the interest of public health. 
   In 1995, upon adoption of the ``once in, always in'' policy, EPA stated the following: 
   ``EPA believes that this once in, always in policy follows most naturally from the language and structure of the [Clean Air Act] statute. In many cases, application of MACT will reduce a major emitter's emissions to levels substantially below the major thresholds. 
   ``Without a once in, always in policy, these facilities could 'backslide' from MACT control levels by obtaining potential-to-emit limits, escaping applicability of the MACT standard, and increasing emissions to the major source threshold. 
   ``Thus, the maximum achievable emission reductions that Congress mandated from major sources would not be achieved. 
   ``A once in, always in policy ensures that MACT emission reductions are permanent, and that the health and environment protection provided by MACT standards is not undermined.'' 
   In the Federal Register, the Agency raged on and on about how great the proposed rule is for major source polluters, because it will create incentives for industry to reduce emissions. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman's time has expired.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. When it comes to quantifying the implications of this proposal on the environment and public health of this Nation, the Agency is silent. 
   The burden of proof regarding soundness of this proposed rule rests squarely on the shoulders of EPA. Thus far, the Agency has failed, at best, to make even a lackluster case. 
   My constituents in Dallas and the surrounding area are already burdened by the scarlet letter of nonattainment. I refuse to let their public health be subject to another further deterioration from a proposal laced with tortured assumptions. This is an unsound policy that should be stopped. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting clean air, a healthy environment, and a strong Clean Air Act. Vote ``yes'' on the Johnson amendment and the Interior and the Environment Appropriations bill.  
   While I appreciate the vigor of the opposing side's view on this matter, it is my respectful view that they are simply wrong on this matter. 
   I would like to amplify an area of concern raised by EPA's own regional offices regarding enforcement should the once in, always in policy be negated. 
   In a 2005 Regional Memorandum to EPA Headquarters, the regions assert the following:   
   A related concern with regard to the draft changes as written is that a facility, by changing from a major source to an area source, and back again, could virtually avoid regulation and greatly complicate any enforcement against them. 
   Take, for example, a facility that is covered by a MACT standard, and has 3 years from the date the rule is promulgated to come into compliance. Three years go by, and just before the end of that time period, the facility announces its area source status. 
   If an area source regulation exists, there may also be some equivalent waiting period before the facility is required to comply with the area source requirements. 
   If the facility later announces that it is after all, a major source, then it may again enter a grace period, possibly up to another 3 years, before it is subject to the MACT standard requirements. 
   Thus, by continually going back and forth between major and area source status, a facility could be a major source [polluter] for most of its operating life and never have to comply with the MACT standard requirements.   
   Again Mr. Chairman, these are not my words but those of EPA's own regional offices. 
   Mr. Chairman, my congressional district lies within the heart of EPA Region 6. Throughout Region 6 there are approximately 3,000 major source polluters according to EPA data. 
   If EPA's rule were to take effect, based on the guidance of EPA's own regional offices I just referenced, 3,000 major source polluters could continually backslide on a public health safeguard meant to minimize my constituent's exposure to toxic, cancer causing air pollutants. 
   Clearly, this was not the intent of Congress as reflected in Section 112 of the Clean Air Act.  
   Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record a memorandum dated December 13, 2005, from Michael S. Bandrowski, Chief, Air Toxics, Radiation and Indoor Air Office, Region IX, of the Environmental Protection Agency.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, Creating Long-Term Energy Alternative for the Nation, also known as the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. 
   This bill closes up the tax loopholes that have enabled energy companies to reap huge profits in recent years, as the prices of oil and gas have risen exponentially. 
   It also rolls back a 2005 Energy Bill tax break for geological and geophysical expenditures, and it repeals provisions that have enabled energy companies to duck out on paying taxes on these profits. 
   One provision that especially appeals to me is the creation of a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. 
   The Reserve will be used to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and it would accelerate the use of alternative fuel sources and renewable energy. In addition, it will encourage energy-efficiency and conservation of our resources. The provision will also ultimately fund research to produce better renewable energy technologies. 
   The House Science Committee, of which I am a member, has had hearings and markups on renewable energy research strategies, and it is clear that we should push harder toward renewable energy. 
   Energy research and development are the keys to lessening our dependence on foreign oil and to lessening our dependence on fossil fuels. The federal government should continue to support energy research and also provide incentives to encourage the American public and businesses to buy hybrid cars and support renewable fuels. 
   We must take the lead in supporting energy policies that are good for the environment and help reduce our dependence on foreign oil.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support designating the post office located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street, INndianapolis, IN, as the Julia M. Carson Post Office Building.  
   This past December, my friend and colleague, Julia Carson, lost her battle with cancer. She had devoted her life to public service and her loss is still felt greatly. Congresswoman Carson was an extraordinary person, and a woman of principle who unabashedly championed the issues in which she believed. Her constituents and the Nation have lost a great legislator and an outstanding leader. 
   Congresswoman Carson made history in 1996 by becoming the first woman and the first African-American Indianapolis has ever sent to Congress. And she came to Congress with one mission--to improve the lives of the people of her community. Even as she rose to a position of prominence in this body, she never forgot the people she was sent here to serve. She truly dedicated her career to them--and for that, earned the respect and gratitude of all Americans. 
   Since her days in the Indiana State Senate, Congresswoman Carson was committed to helping seniors live with independence and dignity as they age. Throughout her career, she has provided exceptional leadership and devoted service to America's senior citizens. 
   Congresswoman Carson was also a strong proponent of civil rights movement, scaling the barriers imposed by poverty and sexism. She was a leader in advocating for voting rights, and worked diligently for the health and income needs of people experiencing homelessness and families at risk of homelessness. 
   Today her grandson continues her legacy here within the House of Representatives. I know that this honor is very meaningful to the Carson family and to her constituents in the 7th District of Indiana, and I'm certain if Julia were here today she would be touched as well. This post office designation is a fitting honor for a woman so dedicated to public service, and I fully support this resolution.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, during the first ever AmeriCorps week I would like to extend my support to the oranization and all of the great things that its members have done. Since AmeriCorps was created in 1994, Texas has benefited from over 22,000 young people serving a year or more in our communities. 
   Nearly 72 AmeriCorps volunteers have tutored 691 youths in the State of Texas including the Dallas Habitat for Humanities and the YMCA of Dallas Oak Cliff Branch. 
   In Texas, as in other States, AmeriCorps volunteers provide a host of services including building affordable housing, teaching computer skills to youth and seniors, and managing after-school programs aimed at youngsters who might otherwise drop out of school. Through programs such as the ``National Civilian Community Corps'' or ``City Year,'' AmeriCorps volunteers address critical Texas needs in education, public safety, disaster response and recovery, and environment preservation. 
   These programs serve an important role as they provide an outlet for people to serve their country in a manner that they previously had not be afforded. The AmeriCorps program has done great things for Texas and the country as a whole, as the Corps members promise to do in the pledge they take every day, they ``get things done.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we will not find common ground or reach higher ground if we turn national service into a partisan playground.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mine is a simple concurrent resolution honoring the life of Dr. Percy Lavon Julian. Dr. Julian was an outstanding chemist and, as a black man, overcame countless obstacles to achieve international recognition for his scientific accomplishments. 
   He spent his youth in Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama. When he decided to leave home to go to college to DePauw University in Indiana, his entire family came to see him off at the train station, including his 99-year-old grandmother, a former slave, and his grandfather who was also there. 
   His grandfather's right hand was two fingers short. The fingers had been cut off for violating the code forbidding slaves to learn to read and write. 
   At DePauw University, Julian worked in the attic of a fraternity house. His support and tuition came  from his earnings as a waiter. Often he worked as a ditch digger during the day and attended classes in the evening. 
   Though at the top of his class in college, he was discouraged from pursuing graduate studies because of potential racial sentiment on the part of future coworkers and employers. 
   Madam Speaker, I firmly believe that no one should be discouraged from pursuing their dreams. Nancy Pelosi, our first female Speaker of the House, is a prime example of someone who ignored the words of naysayers. We must hold these people up as examples. Let them light the paths of others. 
   Dr. Julian earned a fellowship to study chemistry at Harvard University, where he received his master's degree; and in 1931, he earned his Ph.D. from the University of Vienna. 
   Dr. Julian synthesized a chemical treatment for glaucoma, and he synthesized cortisone for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. He is also noted for inventing a foam used during World War II to extinguish gasoline and oil; and over the course of his career, he acquired more than 100 patents. 
   Percy Julian received wide recognition by the scientific community for his research and was elected into the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. He was a bright, talented individual who excelled in science in the face of overwhelming challenges. 
   My bill, House Concurrent Resolution 34, honors his life. We have 12 cosponsors, as well as partnership with the other body from the gentleman from Illinois. I am pleased that the leadership has chosen to pass a bill celebrating the success of an African American. He is a role model, and we want our young people to know that you can make it even in spite of some of the hardships that you have. 
   So for future generations coming along, the minority students, I feel it important to uplift women and minorities to excel in math, science and engineering. I hope the House leadership will consider substantial policies to encourage more women and minorities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. They need more help than what is currently being provided. 
   But, again, I thank Chairman Gordon and my colleagues for their support of this resolution. It is a good start, and I hope a bellwether for future legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6052, the Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act.  
   At the onset I want to commend the bipartisan leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their efforts in getting this measure to the floor. The legislation before us is a good bill; one that will provide a much needed hand up to our Nation's transit agencies as they work to meet record demands for public transportation services. 
   Dallas Area Rapid Transit Agency, or DART, headquartered in my congressional district and one of the best transit agencies in the country, fully supports this bill. Similar to other agencies around the country, DART ridership is setting records, as more north Texans recognize the immense value transit offers. 
   In May, DART had its busiest month ever, providing 10.3 million trips. North Texans are flocking to transport by rail in record numbers as ridership by light and commuter rail is up 5.4 percent and 7.1 percent respectively over 2007 numbers. During the first 7 months of 2008, DART has witnessed a dramatic 33.8 percent increase in its vanpool ridership. 
   The agency has acted aggressively to accommodate the increased demand. The agency is utilizing a new super light rail vehicle to increase passenger capacity. 
   The agency now has a record 145 vans in operation for vanpool commuters and has reached its budget maximum. My transit agency could benefit immediately from the tools provided under H.R. 6052. 
   H.R. 6052 will help transit agencies expand services and reach more people as it authorizes $1.7 billion dollars for capital and operating funds for transit agencies; increases the Federal cost share for alternative fuel transit buses; extends transit benefits to all Federal employees; establishes a vanpool pilot program; and increases the Federal cost share for commuter parking facilities so more people may have access to commuter stations. 
   Madam Chairman, without question, there is a need for an overall expansion of transit programs across this country. However, in order for this to happen, there must be a realignment of infrastructure investment priorities and increased support at the local, State, and Federal levels. H.R. 6052 is a step in the right direction as it highlights importance of transit expansion across the Nation. 
   Public transit takes drivers off the road; uses one-half the fuel of private automobiles; and saves working families billions annually in transportation costs. Studies show transportation costs are the second largest household expense behind housing costs. 
   Nationally, for every dollar a working family saves on housing, it spends 77 cents more on transportation costs. 
   While public transit remains an option for some--for poor and working families, public transit exists as a means for economic survival. 
   So with that said Madam Chairman, I would merely like to reiterate my strong support for H.R. 6052 and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' in giving transit agencies across the country, and the millions of people they service, a hand up today. This sound, bipartisan piece of legislation is deserving of passage.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1315, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
   NASA has made a major impact on our national competitiveness in space and aeronautics research. 
   Since the Sputnik era of the late 1950s, the United States has established world leadership in space flight. Along with that accomplishment, our Nation's investments in NASA have created a strong aeronautics and engineering workforce. This intelligent, talented, well-prepared workforce is one of NASA's most powerful legacies. 
   NASA is of great economic importance to Texas. Johnson Space Center employs 15,000 civil servants and contractors. An untold number of small spin-off companies have been formed as a result of good ideas from the brain power at NASA. 
   Research discoveries from our time in space have also greatly benefited our populace. 
   Each year since 1976, NASA has published a list of every commercialized technology and product linked to its research. 
   The NASA journal ``Spinoff'' highlights these products, which have included things like improved pacemakers, state-of-the-art exercise machines and satellite radio. 
   All of these everyday products have stemmed from NASA-funded research: Invisible braces; scratch-resistant lenses; memory foam; the ear thermometer; shoe insoles; long-distance telecommunications; adjustable smoke detectors; cordless tools; and water filters. 
   During my 15 years on the House Committee on Science and Technology, I have proudly advocated for strong support of NASA. 
   Its education activities, particularly its efforts to encourage under-represented minorities to pursue engineering and science careers, are exemplary. 
   I want to congratulate the great work that NASA has done in its 50 years of existence to conduct research that benefits all members of our society. 
   May the next 50 years be as productive and as successful as the first.

   It is my understanding that a recent decision by Indiana state regulators will allow the British Petroleum company to dump more ammonia and suspended solids daily into Lake Michigan. Although I do agree that our country needs to work on finding additional materials and sources for energy, and we do need to create jobs to help our economy, I do not believe British Petroleum's plan takes our nation in the right direction. As a society, we need to protect our already endangered waters, for they provide means to run our businesses, fulfill daily chores, and relax. 
   Improving the state of the Great Lakes is not an antiquated policy goal from the last century; rather, we still fight today to improve these waters. The House Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, which I chair, continues to pursue the problems of invasive species, low water levels, and pollutants entering the Lakes on a regular basis. We do not need to add additional waste to our struggling, yet essential, waters. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me and vote in favor of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and to pay tribute to the many achievements and honor the countless unique contributions to the United States made by Asian Pacific Americans across our Nation. 
   May 7, 1843 marked the first arrival of Japanese immigrants to the United States and May 10, 1869 signaled the completion of the transcontinental railroad which is greatly credited to the labor of the Chinese immigrants. Therefore, it is appropriate that during this month we recognize the contributions and sacrifices made by Asian Pacific Americans. 
   Today, there are over 14 million Asian Pacific Americans living in the United States, representing 5 percent of the population. The rich history associated with the Asian Pacific American has left a lasting imprint on our country. 
   Over the years, the Asian Pacific American communities have made significant contributions to Texas's diverse culture. In my district, Dallas, TX, I am privileged to have the largest Asian American Chamber in the United States with more than 1,200 members. I believe that we all can learn from those who come from different backgrounds and cultures, and I can truly say that I have learned a great deal from my Asian Pacific friends and constituents. 
   I would also like to offer my deepest condolence to the families and friends of those who perished from recent tragedies in China and Myanmar. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this resolution and the Asian Pacific American communities in North Texas and across the United States.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as a psychiatric nurse with 15 years of hands-on patient care experience, I strongly support mental health parity. All health insurers should provide coverage for mental and behavioral care. 
   An overwhelming body of evidence links mental- and emotional well-being to physical well-being. Simply put, the two go hand-in-hand. 
   For too long, too many health insurance companies have cut corners, when it comes to providing mental health benefits. Left to the ``free market system,'' many insurers have opted not to cover mental health care, claiming that it is not medically necessary, or simply ignoring the issue and forcing patients to absorb the costs. 
   For too long, patients have suffered unfair expenses or delayed getting care, and the economic impact to our society has been large. Suicides, missed work due to depression, and other mental health issues have been the result of private industry's refusal to offer mental health benefits. 
   It is time that we put this harmful practice to a stop. I want to commend Representatives Patrick Kennedy, Jim Ramstad, and Senators Ted Kennedy and Pete Domenici for their tireless work to develop this legislation. 
   While I strongly support mental health parity, I believe that the Senate bill has been better tested by the stakeholder and business communities. The House version contains a provision, intended to help pay for the mental health benefit, that would result in reduced spending for physician-owned hospitals. 
   Baylor cardiovascular hospital, in my district in Dallas, would be affected by the provision. In order to collect future Medicaid reimbursements, the hospital would need to reduce its percentage of physician ownership; and growth of the hospital could be severely restricted. 
   It is my belief that Dallas residents are best served with as many options of affordable  health care as possible--including mental health care. I hope that the House and Senate can resolve differences in the final legislation that will not harm local hospitals, yet pay for the benefits without increasing the Federal deficit. 
   For me, the bottom line is this: mental health parity should have existed from the onset of our modern health insurance system. Mental wellness is just as important as physical wellness. The two are the foundation for a life of wholeness and satisfaction. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues, stakeholder groups, and members of the Other Body for their hard work on such a critical issue.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, as we acknowledge the anniversary of 9/11, we ask God to bless America. And when we go home to our congressional districts this weekend, we should all ask our constituents one question: Are you better off today than you were 8 years ago when President Bush came to Washington? 
   An overwhelming majority of Americans believe they are worse off today than back in 2000. And no wonder. Let's consider the record of overseeing our Nation's economy. 
   Over the last 8 years, the median household income has fallen by $1,000; 3.4 million more Americans are unemployed; 5.7 million more Americans are living in poverty; and, foreclosure rates are at a record high, with 2.5 million homes projected to enter foreclosure this year. 
   Madam Speaker, the Republican policies led to this economic condition that Americans face today. And rather than being sympathetic, the Republican Presidential candidate is accusing Americans of being whiners. How  can we expect any help if this man is elected to the White House?

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND RESTORATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 6532, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore the Highway Trust Fund balance. 
   As an original cosponsor of H.R. 6532 I am delighted our colleagues from the other body finally decided to act on this vital piece of legislation. Moreover, I was delighted to learn that the White House has now reversed its position on vetoing this important bill. 
   Our Nation's highway trust fund serves as the lifeblood for funding our Nation's transportation infrastructure. 
   Regrettably, the fund is facing an imminent shortfall due to decreased revenue into the fund. This shortfall comes at a most inopportune time as many States across the country are struggling to provide funding just for adequate highway maintenance--let alone new construction. 
   I feel it is important that while many observers have attempted to frame discussions of the highway trust fund in terms of a ``bail out'' by the general fund, H.R. 6532 is not a bail out. The measure essentially restores $8 billion that was transferred out of the account in a 1998 budget reduction arrangement. 
   Ensuring the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund is important to my home State, as Texas has one of the most extensive surface transportation networks in the world. 
   Texas has more than 10,000 miles of rail track; more than 300,000 miles of roadway and more than 50,000 bridges--more than any other State in the Nation. Our transportation network is bursting at the seams, and failure to enact this bill will render a significant blow to transportation construction and maintenance jobs across my State. 
   We simply cannot allow this to happen. In the absence of passage of H.R. 6532, the State of Texas stands to lose $859 million in funding and a projected loss of 30,000 good-paying jobs. 
   The State has identified a funding gap of $86 billion between available resources and what is needed to achieve an acceptable level of mobility by 2030. By the year 2030, TXDOT predicts the State's population is expected to increase by 64 percent. My State cannot afford a lapse in receiving its share of federal highway funding made available by SAFETEA-LU. 
   In the absence of bold and decisive action by this body in the next highway bill authorization, stagnant transportation policy and inadequate funding will cripple our country. It is past time for government at all levels to make investment in transportation infrastructure an urgent priority. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this important piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Congressman Al Green's Resolution to honor Black History Month. 
   Founded in 1926 by Carter G. Woodson, Black History Month serves as a time to recognize and celebrate the contributions of African-Americans in shaping our Nation. It brings to life a rich and vibrant history that was all too often untold. 
   The fact is that until there was a Black History Month, prominent African-Americans were virtually left out of our Nation's school books. Often, the only mention of African-Americans would reference the institution of slavery. This is simply unacceptable. Black history is not an anonymous footnote, and expands well beyond the institution of slavery. We have great leaders who fought to overcome the oppression of slavery and that of Jim Crow. We have great scientific minds and inventors. We have extraordinary novelists, poets, and musicians. These are not nameless, faceless individuals, but people who have helped shape our Nation. 
   Because of Black History Month we have expanded our schoolchildren's curriculum. Our children now learn about Frederick Douglas, Thurgood Marshall, Malcolm X and Toni Morrison. These are names and stories that our children otherwise may not have known. With Black History Month we are preserving our abundant history for future generations. 
   I commend Congressman Green for bringing this important Resolution to the floor and I strongly urge my colleagues' support.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, my constituents are justifiably anxious about the threats this financial chaos poses to their savings, their children's future and their retirement security. I share their outrage that this administration and its supporters in Congress failed to prevent this foreseeable crisis and punish those responsible. I appreciate their anger and their opposition to using their tax dollars to bailout the executives of corporations who profited from the lax oversight of the past 8 years. 
   I have been told that this crisis is called an economic Pearl Harbor. In those war days, American credit, which is necessary for all commerce, had stalled. Investors were pulling record amounts of money from even the safest investments, which meant that money for the short-term loans that businesses use every day were either unavailable or cost three to four times more than they had cost just a few days prior. 
   If allowed to continue, the result would have been catastrophic for individuals and businesses alike. The war-time government developed a plan to have the government buy the troublesome securities on the books of financial institutions in order to rescue our Nation's and world's economy. 
   Since the Reagan administration, deregulation has spiraled out of control. Executive compensation and buyout packages have outraged millions of Americans, and rightfully so. We cannot continue with the path we currently are on. This measure is aimed to do that. 
   Madam Speaker, I truly understand that the cost of this rescue package may also limit discretionary spending. Federal spending also might be hampered by the much larger commitments that the government has made for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. 
   Regional economies, such as ours in north Texas, may have to fight even harder for scarce Federal dollars for roads, bridges and sewer projects. Creative solutions will be needed to find pragmatic ways to fund these needs. 
   We need credit in order for this country to operate economically. 
   Madam Speaker, state and local governments rely on their ability to borrow to finance special projects. Think of how new schools get built: a district issues bonds through a bond house, the bonds are sold to raise money, the money is paid back over time with interest. It's like a mortgage. 
   Texas companies rely on free-flowing credit to finance both day-to-day operations and long-term needs. Credit is tighter for businesses across the region at the moment, something of particular concern to manufacturers. And individuals rely on credit to buy homes, cars, and to pay for college. 
   In a troubled economy, now made more difficult by the credit crisis, it is more important than ever to work together to nurture job growth in north Texas. From worker training to transit to luring new business to helping existing businesses expand, a lot is at stake right now. 
   If this really is our economic Pearl Harbor, then the way we, as a nation and as individuals, act in the coming days will be the measure of whether we meet the challenge with the same resolve as our parents and grandparents. 
   For that, I intend to vote for this measure.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   National Public Works Week is celebrated yearly during the third week of May. The week has been designated by a variety of organizations to celebrate our public works professionals and the critical work that they do to keep our infrastructure and transportation systems working efficiently and economically. House Resolution 352 pays tribute to these professionals, recognizing their work the week of May 20 through 26, 2007. 
   ``Public works'' are loosely defined as projects that are carried out for the public good, aptly named because they enable the public to complete its work. Hazardous materials, pipelines, municipal infrastructure such as water supply infrastructure and sewage and refuge disposal systems, and transportation systems, such as rail, highways, airports and public transit, all fall under the public works umbrella. 
   Our public works are vital to our Nation. Our commerce depends on the shipment of goods through rail, on our roads and through the air. Public transportation provides many with a cost-effective way of travel, while also reducing harmful effects on our environment. 
   Our public health depends on our water supply infrastructure as well as our sewage and disposal systems. According to a U.S. Geological survey, one person uses an average of 150 gallons of water per day. Although running water is expected in most homes in our Nation, many developing countries still consider this a luxury. Globally, 50 percent of the world's hospital beds are filled with patients suffering from water-borne illnesses, with one child killed every 8 seconds due to water-related sickness. 
   People in more developed nations, such as the United States, use up to 10 times more water than those in the underdeveloped poor countries. And we do take it for granted. For the importance that they play in our daily lives, our transportation and infrastructure systems and facilities often get the bad end of the deal, that is, although public works are depended on consistently, they receive no glory or praise when accomplishing the job. Rather, many only pay tribute and attention to these public works when they fail, such as sewage line breaks that flood our basements, or levee failures that result in flooded communities. 
   This legislative session the House has passed several key bills that will improve our water and wastewater infrastructure to further reduce facility and system failure. H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act of 2007, amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize appropriations for sewer overflow control grants. H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007, amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to extend the pilot program for alternative water source projects. 
   H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007, amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize appropriations for State water pollution control revolving funds. 
   And lastly, H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act, authorizes water projects and U.S. Corps of Engineers policy changes. 
   It has been more than 6 years since a water resources bill was signed into law. And although water resource legislation is expected to be signed into law every 2 years, President Clinton was the last White House occupant to take an active role in our country's water and public health needs. 
   I recognize the importance of public works for our communities and our country, and I am grateful for the administrators, engineers and servicemen who continue to utilize their skills and provide hours of service and dedication to ensure these necessary facilities and systems work for our Nation. 
   I support this resolution and urge my colleagues to support it as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the COPS Improvements Act of 2007. 
   As violent crime continues to rise, we must address the needs of our Nation's law enforcement professionals. Law enforcement presence remains one of the greatest assets against crime. I have witnessed firsthand the importance of this program where our community cops simply work with our young people, help to break up gangs, helping them with tutoring in the evening when they are on duty in those communities. So in addition to this bill just allowing the 50,000 cops to be hired, it also allows for the increase in funding to improve technology for our police agencies. And it may be used to update police stations and cars for providing the latest technology in crime fighting. 
   I am delighted to see that it is being considered, and I strongly support and recommend the approval.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and the subcommittee Chair, Mr. DeFazio, and the ranking member, Mr. Duncan. I am very pleased to join them in support of this bill. 
   As you know, Texas shares a longer border with Mexico than any other border State. In 2004, at Texas border ports of entry, there were 3 million commercial crossings. 
   The safety and congestion impacts of this pilot program will be felt the most by Texas drivers, roads and businesses. The impact will be felt particularly by my constituents as Interstates 20, 30, 35 and 45 all converge in the heart of my congressional district. 
   I agree with the chairman of the committee when he says we must not bolster trade with Mexico at the expense of the safety of American drivers. This bill requires that Federal motor carriers complete all safety inspections on the Mexican side of the border. The bill also mandates that safety can be assured before Mexican trucks enter our country under this program. 
   We in Congress cannot afford to be soft in our oversight of this matter. Passing a safety inspection in Mexico, even one administered by Federal motor carriers, is not a guarantee to Mexican trucks and drivers that they will have free rein over our roads. 
   In the event that this program proves successful, it is important for this body to give adequate guidance and assistance to border States like Texas to address the burden of increased freight traffic, including congestion, air quality, and wear and tear on our roads. The Department of Transportation cannot use Texas and other border States as guinea pigs and not give them the support they need. 
   In closing, I fully support this bill. It removes much of the uncertainty regarding safety that this committee found in the Department of Transportation's proposed pilot program.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1036 authorizes the Administrator of General Services to convey a parcel of real property to the Alaska Railroad Corporation. Subject to certain requirements, but not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the bill, the Administrator shall convey to the Alaska Railroad Corporation a parcel of real property known as GSA Fleet Management Center. 
   The GSA Fleet Management Center is a parcel located at the intersection of 2nd Avenue and Christensen Avenue in Anchorage, Alaska, consisting of approximately 78,000 square feet of land. The Alaska Railroad Corporation, in exchange for the land, will either provide a replacement facility for the GSA Fleet Management Center to be conveyed or the Alaska Railroad Corporation will pay the Administrator for the fair market value of the GSA Fleet Management Center based on its highest and best use as determined by an independent appraisal commissioned by the Administrator and paid by the Alaska Railroad Corporation. All proceeds derived from the possible sale of the GSA Fleet Management Center would be deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund. 
   I support this bill to transfer this property, Mr. Speaker, from the GSA inventory to the Alaska Railroad Corporation and particularly want to note, consistent with Transportation and Infrastructure Committee policy and guidance on these transfer matters, that the bill protects the Federal interest. 
   H.R. 1036 requires either the GSA is provided with a replacement facility or the railroad corporation will pay the fair market value for the building based on an appraisal of the highest and best use. Further, if the building is bought by the railroad, the proceeds will be deposited into the Federal Buildings Fund.

Let me thank our chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Ms. Kilpatrick, and Mr. Scott, our colleagues, for their unwavering support for the development of the CBC alternative budget that encompasses progressive and visionary funding motivated by principle and compassion. 
   I also would like to thank all of the members of the CBC and their staffs for helping to complete this very important task. I appreciate and applaud their efforts on issues important to all of us. 
   Madam Chairman, the CBC alternative budget understands that our Nation's transportation system is the backbone of our economy and our way of life. We could not afford to shortchange our transportation system, nor ignore the need for greater competitiveness in science and technology. 
   As a senior member of the Science Committee, I feel the CBC budget supports these initiatives to invest in our children's future, our future, our Nation's future. Federal entitlements such as NASA and the National Science Foundation need funding to inspire today's youth so that we can have a future in research and competitiveness. The science budget funds our scientific and engineering workforce, supports teacher enrichment programs and helps inspire future generations of researchers. 
   Our Nation's future depends more and more on the quality of our innovative ideas. The fruits of these investments meet vital national needs and improve the quality of life for all Americans. The CBC alternative budget also provides funding for the minority health initiatives, health insurance for the uninsured, child nutrition programs, job creation programs, the SBA, and the extension of unemployment insurance benefits and the elimination of the disabled veterans tax. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this budget, and don't listen to the rhetoric of taxes being raised. We have different priorities.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in celebration of February as Black History Month, I offer this resolution to celebrate the accomplishments of four outstanding inventors. 
   The first, Garrett Augustus Morgan, lived from 1877 to 1963 and was a son of former slaves. He grew up in Kentucky on the family farm, but as an adolescent, he worked as a handyman for a wealthy Cincinnati landowner. Surely that early experience, as well as his education, influenced and shaped his interest as an inventor. 
   Among his inventions, Garrett Morgan designed a traffic signal that greatly improved public safety. In the early 1900s, bicycles, animal-powered carts, and motor vehicles shared the roads with pedestrians. Accidents frequently occurred between the vehicles. After witnessing a collision between an automobile and a horse-driven carriage, Morgan was convinced that something should be done to improve traffic safety. He was the first to be granted a patent for a traffic signal containing the caution provision. 
   Prior to Morgan's invention, most of the traffic signals in use featured only two positions: stop and go. Because the manually operated traffic signals of the day allowed no interval between the ``stop'' and ``go'' commands, collisions at busy intersections were common during the transition moving from one street to another. Morgan's traffic signal, as well as others, such as a safety hood and smoke protector, contributed greatly to public safety. Such a simple innovation, yet a major impact. 
   The second innovator mentioned in this resolution is Ernest Everett Just, who lived from 1883 to 1941. He grew up in Charleston, South Carolina, and was the son of a dock builder. He dedicated his life to cell biology research and earned a Ph.D at the University of Chicago. He studied the fundamental role of the cell surface in the development of organisms. He performed his research in the District of Columbia, Chicago, and Massachusetts, as well as in Italy, Germany, and France. 
   Ernest Just was truly a trailblazer during the time when African American researchers were rare and underappreciated. 
   The third individual to be honored is Archibald Alphonso Alexander, who lived from 1888 to 1958. Born in Iowa, the son of a janitor, Alexander was the first African American to graduate from the University of Iowa. He studied bridge design in London, England, and founded his own business in the 1920s. He and his partners designed and constructed many roads and bridges, including the Whitehurst Freeway, the Tidal Basin Bridge and an extension to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. 
   He designed the Tuskegee Airfield and the Iowa State University heating and cooling system. He was truly a Renaissance man. He excelled in football, designed highway infrastructure, and served as Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
   Finally, my resolution honors David Nelson Crosthwait, Jr., who lived from 1898 to 1976. He was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. After graduating from Purdue University in 1913 where he studied mechanical engineering, he took a job with the C.A. Dunham Company. 
   During his 40 years with the company, he became an expert on heat transfer, air ventilation, and central air-conditioning. He authored a manual on heating and cooling with water. He also wrote guides and standards as well as codes that dealt with heating, ventilation, refrigeration, and air-conditioning systems. 
   During the 1920s and 1930s, he invented an improved boiler, a new thermostat control, and a new differential vacuum pump, which were all more effective for the heating systems in larger buildings. He also held numerous patents and designed the heating systems for Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. 
   These four individuals and so many others overcame the tremendous personal challenges to excel in their careers and benefit society. 
   The National Society of Black Engineers has chosen to lift up these  innovators, and I thank the society for its helpful input in designing this resolution to honor these exceptional men. 
   Let their light shine as an example to the thousands of African American young students across the Nation. The message of their lives, that of Black History Month, and that of this resolution: with challenge comes perseverance, with perseverance comes endurance, with endurance comes strength, and with strength comes success. 
   It is my goal to wish success to all students of color who aspire to future careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

    Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I would like to express my support for H. Res. 917, supporting the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week. 
   Engineers are important to Texas. 
   The petrochemical, space, high-tech and transportation industries are integral to Texans' livelihoods. 
   In fact, Texas ranks first in the nation in industries such as petrochemical, computer, and organic chemical manufacturing. Engineers have contributed to that success. 
   As a Member of the House Committee on Science and Technology, I am glad to see my colleague, Mr. Lipinski, offer this resolution. It is important to acknowledge engineers for the valuable work that they do. The Texas Society of Professional Engineers works to foster a diverse and skilled workforce. 
   I want to commend the Society for its work to empower students by educating them about careers in engineering, providing materials for use in classrooms, participating in after-school programs, disseminating scholarship information, and holding math and science competitions. 
   I would also like to thank the Chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology, Chairman Gordon, for his leadership on issues of national competitiveness. 
   I support this resolution and urge my colleagues to support it also.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on its 99th Anniversary. 
   In 1909 the founders of the NAACP came together with the purpose of promoting the rights guaranteed under the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. 
   Today, the NAACP works to ensure that all individuals have equal rights and to end racial hatred and discrimination. 
   The NAACP has influenced some of the greatest civil rights victories of the last century, including: the integration of our nation's schools and the Brown v. Board decision; the Voting Rights Act; striking down segregation; and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. 
   Despite the advancements of the past 99 years under the leadership of the NAACP, there is still much work to be done. 
   The NAACP continues to promote new ideas and leadership in the fields of: educational and employment opportunities, ending health care disparities, and economic empowerment. 
   The NAACP instilled in America a sense of consciousness, and it continues to do so today. 
   I commend the NAACP on this anniversary and the thousands of individuals who continue to fight for equality and justice.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, there is a reason that the American people are demanding real change this year. Nearly 8 years ago, this administration inherited a Nation that was well respected abroad, fiscally sound and economically stable. 
   Today, thanks to misguided policies and arrogance, President Bush has left our Nation's security in a more precarious and dangerous position. On the budget front, President Bush and congressional Republicans have turned a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion into a projected 10-year deficit of $3.4 trillion. 
   On the economic side, home foreclosures are at record highs, wages are stagnant. More than 600,000 jobs have been lost this year alone, and Wall Street is in crisis thanks to this administration looking the other way for 8 years. 
   The administration is now looking for a $700 billion recovery package with absolutely no strings attached. While they are trying to recast themselves as the agents of change, we know better. They have built a record of failure over the last 8 years, and America cannot afford more of the same.

   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4140 is a bill to designate the Federal building located at 138 West First Street, Port Angeles, Washington, as the Richard B. Anderson Federal Building. 
   Private First Class Richard Anderson was born in 1921 in Tacoma, Washington. He joined the Marine Corps on July 6, 1942, and received his Marine Corps training in San Diego, California. 
   He died at the young age of 22 during World War II and on Roi Island, part of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. He was awarded the Purple Heart and the Medal of Honor. His heroism is marked by his actions on Roi Island when he hurled himself on a live grenade in a shell hole to save the lives of many people. He was severely injured and died of his injuries on February 1, 1944. He was buried at sea with full military honors. 
   In 1945, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Richard B. Anderson was named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Anderson. 
   It is both fitting and proper to honor the life and courageous actions of Richard B. Anderson in this designation. I support this bill.

   I'm pleased to support H.R. 3913, a bill to make a needed technical amendment to the International Center Act, P.L. 90-553. 
   H.R. 3913 authorizes the Department of State to lease land to Intelsat at the International Center, which is located on Connecticut Avenue at Van Ness Street in northwest Washington. 
   The amendment clarifies and ensures that Intelsat's long-term lease of the land, on which its headquarters is located, is consistent with the International Center Act. 
   Intelsat was originally established in the early 1900s as an international organization. In 2000, Congress passed legislation which essentially required Intelsat to become a private company. 
   Unfortunately, at that time, Congress overlooked a change in the ICA that would be necessary when Intelsat completed its transition to a private company, and this bill corrects that omission. 
   I support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Texas Water Development Board was created in 1957 with the mission ``to provide leadership, planning, financial assistance, information and education for the conservation and responsible development of water for Texas.'' Additionally, the Texas Water Development Board provides water planning, data collection and dissemination, financial assistance, and technical assistance services to the citizens of the State. 
   The Texas Water Development Board was selected this past November as a recipient of the Environmental Protection Agency's 2007 Performance and Innovation in the Clean Water State Revolving Fund Creating Environmental Success Award at the Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities annual conference in Denver, Colorado. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is extraordinary for Texas because normally we get on the other end of things of this sort. But the Texas Water Development Board provides loans and grants to local governments and entities for various projects. 
   The financial assistance programs are funded through State-backed bonds, a combination of State bond proceeds and Federal grant funds, or limited appropriated funds. 
   To date, the Texas Water Development Board has successfully awarded communities approximately $4.3 billion in low-interest loans to finance 472 water infrastructure projects across the State of Texas. 
   The State of Texas currently administers the second largest Clean Water State Revolving Fund in the Nation, second only to New York. In 2007 alone, the Texas Water Development Board made 32 loan commitments through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, for a total of $692 million. 
   Of the 32 total commitments made out of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund in 2007, approximately 8 percent of the funds were committed to disadvantaged communities, and 10 percent were committed to small communities with populations consisting of less than 10,000 residents. 
   The Texas Water Development Board is working with the EPA to strengthen the program, including the ability to offer extended term financing up to 30 years to help communities that may need more time to repay the loan. Additionally, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program is being proactively marketed to ensure that all Texas communities are aware of the benefits offered by this program. And, Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be able to honor such a vital organization in the State of Texas. It's sometimes a rare occasion.  
   The Texas Water Development Board is recognized as a leader in the State water planning and water-related infrastructure financing. I would like to thank my colleagues from the Texas delegation for joining me in this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I rise today with an amendment to restore funding for the State grants portion of the Safe Drug and Preschool and Communities program to the fiscal year 2007 level. 
   These grants are an essential part of drug prevention and funds essential in effective services, including peer resistance and social skills training, parent education, student assistance, and education about emerging drug needs. This program serves 97 percent of our Nation's schools, and it is the only program that provides funding for universal prevention of all of our Nation's school-aged youth. 
   The success of this program has been documented by numerous States and local agencies. It is extremely effective and has contributed to a 23 percent decline in drug use among youth over the past 5 years. It is important to keep drug prevention as a priority. Historically, when funding for drug prevention is cut, drug use amongst youth surges. This program also provides coordinated school and community-based efforts to target emerging drug trends among community members. 
   As a result, this program has made significant contributions to reducing methamphetamine and black tar heroin use among school-aged youth in many States throughout the country. Over the past 2 years, in Dallas, Texas, we have had 23 teens die from overdoses of a black tar heroin mixture that is called cheese with Tylenol PM, and we work with DEA and local merchants and all around trying to get some handle on it. But through the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program, local antidrug coalitions have partnered with schools throughout to hold prevention conferences in order to combat this growing epidemic.     
   They have targeted both students and parents to raise awareness surrounding this issue and have also held town hall meetings for teenagers. I have held one myself. 
   Without the infrastructure provided by this program, the antidrug coalitions would have little if any access to these students and parents, and the heroin problem would have undoubtedly increased. 
   This issue of emerging drug trends is not isolated. And while drug use among school-age children has declined, emerging drug trends continue to rise. We've recently seen new drugs aimed at our children, such as the candy-flavored meth and cocaine in many States, including Texas, California, Arkansas, Nevada, and Alabama. Without strong and effective prevention programs, these growing epidemics will have a devastating impact on the educational performance of students nationwide. 
   As you're aware, drug prevention is critical to ensuring the overall academic success of our youth. Studies have found that lower reading and math scores are linked to peer substance abuse. Our Nation cannot afford to see alcohol and drug use or violence rise above their current levels. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment to restore the funding for the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Program to the 2007 level. $46.5 million was reduced, and, Madam Chairman, I do have an offset. The offset for the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Program will come from the Reading First program. 
   The Reading First program has been mired by allegations of financial conflicts of interest and cronyism and is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice. The Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Department of Education have found numerous legal and ethical violations in how Reading First has steered funds toward favored programs. There has been also conflicts of interest in hiring and the promotion of commercial reading materials. This mismanagement has already resulted in the program being cut by more than 60 percent of fiscal year 2008. 
   Just a few examples of this mismanagement include the Office of Inspector General found that the program administrator had improperly promoted commercial reading programs potentially in violation of Federal law. The Office of Inspector General analyzed hundreds of e-mails and concluded that the Department's program officials failed to maintain a controlled environment that exemplified management integrity and accountability. 
   They found that the Madison School District in Wisconsin had substantial data.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Let me say to the gentleman who objected, I truly understand his objection on the reading program. However, statistics have shown that if these young people are under the influence of drugs, that's where they fall. And if we could prevent this drug usage, it probably will let some of the ability come through. 
   I know that it's difficult, but this is a very serious problem, and these cuts will hurt very severely in areas, primarily in school districts where we've had even young people having the ability to sell drugs to another young person. Obviously, it's coming from somewhere else. 
   But in Dallas, we have not found a single child that has experimented with this ``cheese'' that has survived. And we do have parents involved. We'll have to discontinue this program if we don't have these funds. And I would just plead with you to help find these funds somewhere, if you have a severe objection to it coming from this area. 
   But I felt that if the area's funding was not being handled correctly, it could be placed in a program that's going very well, that has influenced the decrease of 23 percent drug usage among our youth in the last 5 years. And I have grave concern about allowing this to go on without the assistance that's needed. 
   As I said earlier, I have worked with the FBI. They're working with merchants to try to get some of the Tylenol PM and the other off the market in these areas. It is a serious undertaking in the area. And all of our law enforcement people are involved. 
   But our schools cannot continue this without the funding. And that's the reason why I plead for understanding for this funding.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, last week the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation held its 2007 Annual Legislative Conference. 
   Each year, I have convened the Science and Technology Braintrust. The Braintrust is a discussion forum aimed at bringing together America's brightest minds to share idea on how to diversify our science and technology workforce. 
   I have remained committed to hosting this Braintrust each year, because I believe that engaging young people in the fields of science and technology is one of the most important things we can do for the future success of America. 
   With India and China producing more than five times the number of engineers, computer scientists and information technology professions in 2005 than we did, our nation is losing its competitive edge. 
   The Sciene Committee ushered through a $33.6 billion package of Innovation policies that are designed to help early career researchers, better train math and science teachers, and encourage industry and universities to partner with local high schools to improve science instruction. 
   Having a dialogue with students and with the science education community is another way to exchange ideas and assess the needs of our population. 
   My Braintrust consisted of two panels. The first panel consisted of high-level individuals who have risen to great heights in technology and engineering fields. They provided an executive perspective of the educational experiences that are needed for tomorrow's high-tech graduate to be globally competitive. 
   Panel 2 featured bright, innovative minds from individuals who work with technology in unique ways. The goal was to convince everyone here that a career in math, science or engineering can be fulfilling, challenging and fun. 
   Madam Speaker, more than 150 local, African American high school students attended my Braintrust, and many of them participated in the discussion by interacting directly with the panelists. 
   It is my feeling that a few hearts and minds were changed that day, in the Science Committee hearing room. If only one student was influenced toward a career in science, technology, engineering or mathematics, I will be satisfied. This focus has been a major goal of my work as an elected official. 
   In the 1990s, we responded to the digital age with breakthroughs in computer science and information technology. 
   Tomorrow's greatest challenge will be to meet the needs of the Innovation Age. We must compete at a global level.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Illinois for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   On Monday of this week, millions of people worldwide recognized Workers Memorial Day. I introduced H. Res. 1154 because each year this country has thousands of workers who are killed due to workplace-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die of occupational illnesses. It is staggering to think that each day an average of 16 workers are killed due to injuries on the job. Worldwide, more than 2 million workers die of occupational illness and injuries annually. That means more people are killed on the job each year than in wars. 
   The bottom line is that everyone deserves a safe and healthy workplace. Many of us may take this basic right for granted. But for millions of Americans, the threat of being permanently disabled or even killed on the job is very real. 
   Workers Memorial Day not only recognizes and honors those who have been killed or injured on the job, it also reminds us of the overwhelming need to improve health and safety standards in our Nation's workplaces. 
   It has been 38 years since the creation of OSHA, and over this time worker health and safety standards have vastly improved. However, there is still work to be done, as evidenced by the Sago mine disaster and the recent combustible dust explosion at the Imperial Sugar refinery in Georgia that killed 12 workers. 
   Today we will take a step toward improving those safety standards by considering the Worker Protection Against Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Act. This bill represents a pressing need for OSHA standards to prevent combustible dust explosions which have killed more than 100 workers since 1980. That's 100 workers who went to work in the morning but never returned home to their families and loved ones. Workers Memorial Day remembers those workers who gave their lives and the families they left behind. 
   I would like to thank House leadership and Chairman Miller for his support in bringing this resolution to the floor today; and, of course, Mr. Davis. I would also like to thank the House Labor and Working Families Caucus, and in particular Congresswoman LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ, for their assistance in bringing this resolution forward.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank my colleague from Georgia Mr. John Lewis for introducing this resolution which honors the life and legacy of one of America's greatest citizens, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   Today, nearly 40 years after he was tragically taken from us, we are still striving to create a society of equal opportunity which he so eloquently called for. We still have a long way to go before his goals will be achieved, but at least he left for us a beacon of hope toward which we can all strive. 
   I am privileged to represent the Thirtieth District of Texas in the Congress and would note that there are many in North Texas who have endeavored to maintain the legacy of Dr. King. Indeed, in their everyday actions, the clergy, elected officials, students and community in the district strive to implement Dr. King's philosophy. 
   In 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other non-violent means. 
   It is ironic that his life was taken so prematurely at the hands of violence as he visited Memphis, Tennessee to help lead sanitation workers in a protest over black workers being sent home with no pay because of bad weather when white workers remained on the job. This tragic incident happened the day after he gave his ``I've been to the Mountaintop'' speech during which he seemed to almost prophetically foreshadow his impending death. 
   Dr. King stood for the common man and for social and political justice in every facet and echelon of life. As a man of vision and determination to do God's will, King was truly destined to lead the people to the ``promised land.'' 
   Sadly, like Moses, Dr. King was not able to go into the promised land of opportunities with those he led so far through the wilderness of injustice, hatred, and bigotry. Still today, there are many that have been left to rough their way through the thicket of discrimination and racism. Therefore, it is our responsibility to carry on the beacon he left for us that lights the way to true equality and justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can honor Dr. King by bowing our heads in memory of him, but only for a moment. For we must then lift our heads, hold each other hands, look ahead, heads high, and continue the fight for his sacrifice for this Nation which was freedom, equality and opportunity for all.

   In American we have more than 2-million people in prison. Of these, over 600-thousand are released each year. 
   Very few of these individuals are prepared to return to their communities or receive support services to ease their transition. 
   These ex-offenders face serious impediments in obtaining employment, and often have serious mental or physical ailments that remain unaddressed. 
   Today, approximately half of all black men are jobless. Amongst ex-offenders this number is even higher. 
   There is revolving door of ex-offenders into many of our neighborhoods.  
   With few opportunities two-thirds of all ex-offenders are arrested for new crimes within a few years of their release. 
   We must give these individuals the opportunity to become productive citizens. 
   The Second Chance Act will go a long way towards this goal by providing transitional assistance to ex-offenders reentering their communities. 
   It will work to reunite families and provide the appropriate training and rehabilitation for these individuals.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me thank these two distinguished gentlemen on the floor, Mr. Davis of Illinois and Mr. Duncan of Tennessee, for helping us with this today. 
   I rise today to honor the life and accomplishments of Lady Bird Johnson. I would like to thank my colleagues Mr. Hall, Mr. Barton and Mr. Ortiz for their sponsorship, and the entire Texas delegation for joining me in sponsoring and honoring Mrs. Johnson. 
   Mrs. Johnson was known as a woman of class and integrity. She was strong in spirit and always represented herself with dignity and grace. 
   For decades Lady Bird Johnson served with honor and dedication as the wife of President Lyndon Baines Johnson, throughout his service as a staffer to Representative Kleberg, as he served in the U.S. House of Representatives, as a U.S. Senator, as Vice President, and as President of the United States. She served as President Johnson's personal adviser throughout his career and was known for expanding the position of the First Lady by taking a visible role in President Johnson's administration. 
   Lady Bird Johnson dedicated much of her life to the preservation of our environment. Perhaps she could be considered the first environmentalist in this era. This passion led her to create the Capital Beautification Project to improve physical conditions in Washington, DC, both for residents and tourists. Her efforts inspired similar programs throughout the country. She also played a major role in the passage of the 1965 Highway Beautification Act. This was the first legislative campaign begun by a First Lady. The trees and flowers we see along our American highways today are a testament to her work and her dedication. 
   After leaving Washington, President and Mrs. Johnson moved back to Austin, Texas, where Mrs. Johnson continued to work for environmental causes. And that is, perhaps, the most environmentally sensitive city in Texas right now. Today we can all admire her legacy through the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, Texas. 
   Mrs. Johnson died on July 11, 2007, at the age of 94 at her home in Austin, and was survived by her two daughters, seven grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren. 
   I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the Johnson family. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor Lady Bird Johnson's incredible life and legacy.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE-BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my colleagues from the Women's Caucus to support this increase to the federal minimum wage. 
   Nearly two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women. 
   And it's women that represent the majority of working poor in this country. 
   The working poor are Americans who work 40 hours or more a week, but can't afford basic necessities. 
   Each day, the working poor are faced with the decision of having to choose between: food, clothing, shelter, medicine, and utility bills. 
   No American who works hard for a living should have to make these types of choices. 
   Mr. Speaker, more than 9 million women will benefit from this proposed increase to the minimum wage. 
   These aren't just teenagers working part-time either. 
   Most of these workers are actually hard-working disadvantaged adults. Four million are parents. 
   This isn't simply an economic issue, it's an ethical and moral issue. 
   We cannot continue to look away while hard working Americans linger in poverty. 
   I urge my colleagues to support these hardworking women and men by raising the federal minimum wage.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this month Democrats will take action on a bold agenda that includes all Americans. During our first 100 hours of legislative work, we are going to expand economic opportunities to millions of Americans who have been left standing in need for 6 years at least. 
   Hardworking middle class Americans feel like they have been left behind. While CEOs see millions of dollars in bonuses and large pay increases, middle class workers have faced stagnant wages for well over 5 years. And while their wages remain virtually the same, they are trying to stretch every paycheck to better afford increasing education and health care costs. 
   This month, Congress will give these families some much-needed help. For families trying to afford a college education for their children, we are going to cut student loan interest rates in half, which should save the average borrower about $5,000 over the life of the loan. 
   For seniors struggling to pay for high price prescription drug costs, we are going to lessen the burden by giving the Federal Government the ability to actually negotiate for lower drug prices. 
   Today we will give working Americans a minimum wage increase.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the College Student Relief Act, as it will give financial assistance to millions of student borrowers. 
   In order to remain competitive in a global economy, students are taking out more loans and falling further into debt. The College Student Relief Act will go a long way towards making college more affordable and accessible. H.R. 5 will cut interest rates in half on certain federally subsidized student loans over the next 5 years. These cuts will particularly impact low- and middle-income students saving the typical borrower approximately $4,400 over the life of their loan. These interest rate cuts will help more than 5.5 million undergraduate students once they are fully phased in. 
   With the cost of higher education continuing to skyrocket, this is an important first step in easing the financial burden for millions of students and their families. It's estimate that around 200,000 students delay or completely forgo going to college due to the associated costs. This is simply unacceptable. We will not be able to continue to compete in the global economy if we continue to throw hurdles in front of our young people. Today's vote to ease the debt burden for millions of students will go a long way toward increasing access to higher education. 
   If Americans fail to address these issues now, we will default on our traditional commitment to a better future for our children. We owe it to our young people to provide the opportunities that will allow them to become successful and productive adults. 
   I would like to commend the Democratic Leadership for their dedication to this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the life  of activist and humanitarian Muhammad Ali on his 65th birthday. Muhammad Ali is not only recognized for his boxing career but also for his dedication to reaching out to lesser developed countries. His involvement in social causes, diplomacy and politics has served as a shining example of courage, strength and dignity. 
   Muhammad Ali was once one of the world's greatest and most flamboyant boxers, and during the course of his long career, he also became known as an eloquent statesman for peace, as well as, a generous man who devoted much of his considerable earnings to charity. 
   Born Cassius Clay in Louisville, Kentucky in 1942, Ali learned at a very young age that determination and dedication would take him to greater places. After winning the gold medal in the 1960 Olympics, Muhammad Ali became actively involved in the Civil Rights Movement with Malcolm X. At a time when race and politics permeated the public stage, Ali represented a well known figure not afraid to speak his mind and fight against oppression imposed by Jim Crow. Never had a sport figure encouraged so many people to fight against social oppression. 
   After he retired from boxing he continued working to better the lives of others through his involvement with the Jimmy Carter Campaign in 1980. Through his humanitarian work Ali has founded WORLD, the World Organization for Right, Liberty, and Dignity, and the Ali Center. WORLD, an organization that fights for human rights against exploitation and slavery, and the Ali Center serve as international and cultural centers to explore the greatness and the drive that lies within all of us and to inspire everyone to pursue their highest potential. 
   In spite of the fact that Muhammad Ali has been suffering from Parkinson's disease in the past two decades, he still remains an advocate of children and war victims. Inspiring millions has been an arduous work in progress till this day for Muhammad Ali. He continues to be a leader and revolutionary to this day.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the financial crisis on Wall Street did not happen overnight. For 8 years, this Bush administration refused to regulate the very financial institutions that they are now asking American taxpayers to bail out. 
   Congressional Democrats want to work in a bipartisan fashion to clean up this mess and to insulate Main Street from Wall Street. We will not be pressured into approving a $700 billion blank check for Wall Street that does not include any safeguards or any independent oversight. 
   We simply cannot hand over $700 billion of the American taxpayers' money to the Department of Treasury and hope for the best. Any bailout package needs to ensure that the actions of the administration are being watched by an independent observer who can report back to both Congress and the American taxpayer. 
   We also need to include some protections for homeowners who are in danger of losing their homes and some reasonable limits to the executive compensation for CEOs and top executives.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, today we are here to recognize Dr. King's legacy and the millions of men and women who have fought for freedom and justice for all Americans. 
   It is rare that one person can change the fate of our Nation; however Dr. King was able to do just that. Dr. King relied on his relationship with God and his faith in justice to articulate his vision for America in a way that touched the hearts and minds of the American public. 
   Dr. King called on all of us to no longer stand alone in silence, but to stand up together as a voice against injustice. He inspired us to fight for change through nonviolent means, and paved the road for us to continue that fight even after his death. 
   Dr. King once said ``All progress is precarious, and the solution of one problem brings us face to face with another problem.'' This statement was not meant to be a deterrent, but rather to remind us that we need to remain diligent, and prepare for the long road ahead. If we become apathetic we will regress. We have not, and must not forget the fight is not over. 
   This is the first year that we'll recognize Martin Luther King Day since the death of Mrs. Coretta Scott King. Mrs. King and I were friends and confidants for many years. She was an incredible woman--graceful and dignified--who showed strength in the face of indignation and tragedy. 
   Following Dr. King's assassination, she continued his legacy promoting social and economic justice for all. Mrs. King was determined to make his dream a reality. And we would not be celebrating the legacy of Dr. King today without her contributions. 
   There are many young people who may not have experienced Dr. King's battle towards equality. That is why it is so important to familiarize them with our history and struggles. It is imperative we recognize the history of our nation, because we cannot look towards the future without applying the lessons we have learned from the past. 
   Today's Martin Luther King Day is as much about the past as it is about the future. Dr. King's dream is truly timeless, and I hope that all the young people will find inspiration in his faith and vision.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to women by supporting the goals of International Women's Day. As a woman, I recognize and honor all the women who have fought and struggled for the equality of women. 
   Women from all parts of the world are divided by ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic and political differences. This day will allow for the differences to be overshadowed by the similarities. This day will enable them to look back to a tradition that represents decades of struggle for equality, justice, peace, and development. 
   International Women's Day recognizes the importance of securing peace and allowing social progress by identifying the rights of women to equal opportunity and freedom. Women are being given the opportunity to participate in the workforce and contribute to international peace and security; this is an extraordinary advancement. 
   As Members of Congress, we need to reaffirm the commitment of ending discrimination and violence against women and girls. We must continue to encourage the President to affirm his commitment to pursue policies to protect human rights and civil liberties. 
   Madam Speaker, the key fact remains: women themselves have the right to live in dignity. Let us rededicate ourselves to making that a reality by honoring International Women's Day. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of International Women's Day.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation to name the Department of Education Building in honor of President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
   President Johnson believed that everyone should have the right to a free and adequate education regardless of their gender, race or economic status. President Johnson fought for opportunity and access for all Americans, and I can truly think of no one better person for whom to name the Department of Education building. 
   President Johnson's first job was as a Texas elementary school teacher and principal at a segregated school attended by only Mexican-Americans. He held that experience with him, and continually fought for education and equality for all Americans. President Johnson recognized that education meant opportunity for millions of Americans who would otherwise never be able to achieve the American dream.  
   The strides made for educational equality and fairness under the Johnson administration were truly remarkable. Under President Johnson, we adopted many landmark education policies including the Early and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for Humanities, and the Higher Education Act of 1965. Perhaps no other President has ever overseen so many pioneering changes to the way that we educate our Nation's children. 
   I fully support Congressman GENE GREEN's effort to name the U.S. Department of Education building in honor of President Lyndon B. Johnson, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was a little over 2 years ago that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita tore through the gulf coast leaving a trail of tragedy and despair in their wake. 
   Endless news reports documented the disaster, the catastrophe, the misfortune and the heartbreak of the affected communities. Even some of our colleagues lost their homes. Many wondered how they could help these victims, whose homes, families and livelihoods were destroyed in a matter of hours. 
   Washington may be geographically far from Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Texas, but it gives us no excuse to dismiss the travails of those States. We cannot merely look at these events through protective glass, ruling on the fates of these communities from far away. We must be on the ground, planning recovery and reconstruction to ensure the devastation experienced never happens again. 
   Most of us have traveled to New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina to try and understand what needs to be done to help the region prepare for the future.  I have seen firsthand the devastation faced by the citizens of New Orleans and the surrounding region. 
   On September 15, 2005, President Bush stood in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the dark of the night and stated, ``Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as it takes, to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives.'' 
   How is vetoing the Water Resources Development Act consistent with this pledge? We need to change how we deal with these events. 
   Our Federal emergency planning should not consist of after-the-fact recovery. We must institute prevention. We cannot simply wait for tragedy after tragedy and then hastily truck in meals ready to eat or trucks of bottles of water. We need to truck in reform now. 
   Prior to the hurricanes, the gulf coast had but a patchwork of protection. The wetlands had disappeared. The buffer that could have reduced the wrath of the winds and storm surge of Katrina and Rita had been vanishing. This legislation authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to begin to replenish the water coastline. 
   WRDA 2007 also closes the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, commonly known as ``Mr. Go,'' taking a proactive step to help the people and the businesses of Louisiana, Mississippi and the entire Gulf Coast States. The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet was authorized to provide a shorter shipping channel from the Gulf of Mexico to New Orleans; yet the projected traffic for this corridor never materialized. Unfortunately, the outlet may have substantially contributed to the severe flooding of the City of New Orleans and the lower Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina. 
   WRDA 2007 is also essential to fulfill the President's commitment to rebuild New Orleans even better and stronger than before the storm. Unfortunately, by vetoing this legislation, the President is turning his back on the commitment to rebuild this great city, vetoing the authorization for the Corps to raise enhanced flood protection levees surrounding the City of New Orleans and to achieve a 100-year level of protection. 
   Some may think that investment in our Nation's infrastructure should have a cost ceiling. We will never be able to contain this cost until we do some of the work. That investment in our Nation's future should only cost so much. Well, for those who make this argument concerning this bill, I urge them to study the recent past of this legislative body. 
   This bill is not new. As many times as we don't finish it, cost goes up. WRDA 2007 contains water resource projects that have been pending in the halls of this Chamber for far too long. Water resources legislation is most effective when authorized every 2 years. Even the executive branch department indicated that we need $19 billion every other year to bring this, all the infrastructure, up to par. This hasn't happened. 
   The last bill was signed in 2000 by President Clinton. This bill clears a 7-year logjam. A larger bill is necessary to carry a larger load. 
   When President Bush states that this bill is too costly, he is not considering the time lag. This debate is not about whether this legislation could cost $14 billion or $15 billion, but about whether this legislation authorizes projects that reinvest in the Nation's crumbling infrastructure. 
   We do right by this country when we invest in its infrastructure. Regrettably, we are falling miserably behind. China spends 9 percent of its gross domestic product on infrastructure. India spends 3.5 percent and the U.S. spends a meager .93 percent. We must do better. 
   We don't want a situation where our beaches remain contaminated with open sewage or other contaminants. We passed this particular conference report on August 1, 2007, the same day that the highway bridge I-35 collapsed in Minnesota. We stood on this floor considering investment in infrastructure at the same time that emergency personnel were working the wreckage of a structure that unexpectedly is unstable. Our country cannot continue to put an arbitrary cost ceiling on investment in our public works. 
   If we do this on a regular basis, we won't have to do that. 
   Simply put, this legislation is about meeting our commitments to the Nation on protecting lives and livelihoods, ensuring economic competitiveness in the global marketplace, and restoring the Nation's ecological treasures. 
   For example, WRDA 2007 authorizes the first three projects in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, the Picayune Strand, Indian River Lagoon, and the Site 1 Impoundment Project. 
   Since 2000, all 15 components of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan have been delayed. Costs have decreased, and even in my paper this weekend, there was an article on how the Everglades were disappearing. 
   Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve and Everglades National Park continue to be listed in the directories of our country's most endangered parks. As the population of the State of Florida has boomed, land management has not kept pace. This bill begins the journey to a better Florida. 
   If safety and human protection are not good enough reasons to secure the passage of this legislation, I urge the President to consider our industry. WRDA 2007 seeks to improve our waters for our industry and our environment. This bill authorizes seven locks and dams in the Upper Mississippi River, as well as the ecosystem restoration projects in the Midwest region.     
   This bill doesn't just address large water resources projects. Many smaller projects are contained within this legislation, seeking to improve cities and small towns across the Nation. We'd like very much for drinking bottled water to continue to be a selection and a choice, rather than a necessity. 
   These projects do not make national headlines, but they make a difference in the quality of life for those who live in these vicinities. Without these projects, many communities would be without necessary flood control, ecosystem restoration, and economic and public health necessities. 
   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I'd be remiss if I failed to mention the flood control needs of my district in Dallas. The Dallas Floodway accepts 1,600 square miles of Trinity River watershed runoff and safely moves the flood waters through the City of Dallas by virtue of levees that form both sides of the 2,000 foot-wide floodway. The flooding has been projected to flood the downtown area where all of the basis of our economy is. The floodway levees protect the downtown Dallas vicinity from a potential flood damage loss to property and infrastructure of $8 billion or more. 
   The 23 miles of levees for the Dallas Floodway were originally constructed by local interests in 1932 and reconstructed by the Corps in 1960. Since 1960, the upstream watershed has experienced the exploding population growth, which has significantly increased run-off, overwhelmed our antiquated interior drainage pumps, and greatly reduced the flood protection afforded by the levee system. 
   My district's flood control needs are great; and like other communities across the Nation, they are anxiously anticipating the resumption of a predictable, consistent and 2-year WRDA cycle. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that this Congress send a message to the American people today that we intend to make our Nation's infrastructure a priority. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me and vote ``yes'' in making our infrastructure a priority, vote ``yes'' for your districts, and vote ``yes'' to override the ill-advised veto. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, so I rise to close. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Oberstar for his tremendous leadership, Mr. Young, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Baker, and, of course, Mr. Mica. We have worked together for the last 6 years, actually, a little longer, 7 years, on a bill to try to address these infrastructure problems throughout our Nation. This is the first opportunity that we have really had to begin to address the many massive problems that we do have. 
   It gives no one pleasure to override any President because I was always taught to listen to both sides. This time, Mr. Speaker, I believe it's a necessity. We simply must begin to address these many, many problems that we are facing. If we had done what the executive branch had recommended, we would have had at least $19 billion in 2001; another $19 billion in 2003; and another $19 billion in 2005; then the $19 billion due this year. As it is, $23 billion is short $55 billion. 
   So we are not addressing every problem, but we are trying our best to prioritize; and hopefully we can get back on schedule and address these problems every 2 years so that we won't have to deal with more floods like Katrina and Rita; we won't have to do without our Everglades as they begin to disappear. 
   So thank you very much to the staff, to all of the Members, both minority and majority, because we have all been one or the other. We have been majority and we have been minority. We still work together. This bill hasn't changed that much, no matter who was in the majority or no matter who was in the minority, because we know that problems of this sort are really simply not Democrat or Republican; these are people's problems and we simply have the responsibility to address them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask everyone to vote to override this veto.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Let me express my appreciation to Mr. Gordon and Mr. Hall, Dr. Gingrey, Dr. EHLERS and others who have been active on the other side and shown interest, not just recently, but over the years. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I in the Science and Technology Committee have held numerous hearings and markups to prepare the legislation that is before us today in the form of a conference report. Today this bill authorizes $33 billion over fiscal years 2008-2010. 
   You know, I grew up with my father saying nothing is free, and you get what you pay for. If you invest, you will get a return, and that's just where we are. We are in need of stimulating our teachers and our students to specialize in these areas so that we can be competitive in the world. 
   We have allowed ourselves to get behind, we are investing less than almost any other developed country, and we must step up to the plate now, the time has come. It will help to prepare thousands of new teachers and provide teachers with better materials and skills through our expanded Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and through the Math and Science Partnerships Program. 
   In my district are the number one and number two public schools in the Nation, as Newsweek says. Texas Instruments has invested numerous dollars, thousands, in that school, and it is very good. We put out some of the best students in the Nation from our schools, but it only has about 20 to 25 percent of the students that need all of this. It is needed across the Nation. We are not going to get it until we provide for it. We will not get competitive until we do this. 
   So I would say please support the conference committee for H.R. 2272. It only provides what we need, and we cannot get it for free. 
   I know that we have spent a lot of money on this war, a lot more than they are asking for in here; but we have got to take care of this Nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the conference report for H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   I congratulate Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, Mr. Baker, for your work on reaching this agreement in the vital infrastructure investment bill for the Nation's water resources needs. 
   I especially express my appreciation to the staff, to Congressman Young,  Congressman Duncan, and Congressman Costello and other distinguished members of this committee, because we have all worked together in a bipartisan manner. 
   All of us assembled here this evening understand the magnitude of this moment. The clock is working against the infrastructure of our country. The 7 years we have waited to enact a water resources development bill have led to significant increases in cost to adequately address the Nation's deteriorating water resources and flood control infrastructure. 
   As such, I am delighted that we as conferees have come to an agreement on the issues independent of review, environmental issues, environmental infrastructure and individual projects that have, up until now, prevented us from crafting a final conference report. 
   We do right and good by this country when we invest in its infrastructure. I agree with the chairman that enactment of a water resources bill this year is critical to economic prosperity, job creation, protection of the environment and public safety. 
   Since Congress last passed a Water Resources Development Act, we have seen Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita devastate the gulf coast and my home State of Texas, flooding cities, damaging economies and businesses and threatening public health. 
   No water resources bill has been enacted since the year 2000, the entire term of this current administration. While I am fully aware of the veto threat that this administration has issued on the conference report, I want to remind my colleagues that since the start of the Iraq conflict in 2003, nearly $42 billion has been appropriated at the request of the administration for Iraqi reconstruction, one-third of which, or $14 billion, is going towards Iraqi economic infrastructure. 
   I would daresay that if this level of attention is adequate for Iraqi water and road infrastructure, my State, as well as my constituents, who are constantly beleaguered by outdated flood protection, are as equally deserving of the attention afforded by H.R. 1495. I deeply regret that the administration has decided to turn its back on a bill that would put Americans to work with good-paying jobs, protect lives and property and bolster our Nation's infrastructure. 
   A recent report by the Texas Section of Civil Engineers assessed my State's infrastructure and rendered a dismal cumulative grade of below average. The assessment of the State's flood control fared even worse, with the State receiving a failing grade of D minus. 
   Over the past decade, Texas has experienced 15 federally declared disasters, most involving flooding. Moreover, Texas leads the Nation in terms of dollars paid for flood claims, second only to the State of Louisiana. 
   The population of Texas is expected to double in the next 30 to 40 years. Development in and near flood plains can be expected to increase, as developers continue to build near the State's rivers, lakes and coastlines. 
   In my district, the Dallas Floodway accepts 1,600 square miles of Trinity River watershed runoff and safely moves the floodwaters through the City of Dallas by virtue of levees that form both sides of the 2,000-foot-wide Floodway. The Floodway levees protect the downtown vicinity from a potential flood damage loss to properties and infrastructure at a price of $8 billion or more. This is a major economic area. 
   The 23 miles of levees for the Dallas Floodway were originally constructed by local interests in 1932 and reconstructed by the Corps in 1960. But, since 1960, the upstream watershed has experienced exploding population growth, and that was not expected, which has significantly increased runoff, overwhelmed our antiquated drainage pumps, and greatly reduced the flood protection afforded by the Dallas Floodway levees. 
   My district's flood control needs are great; and, like the other communities across this Nation, they are anxiously anticipating the resumption of a predictable, consistent, and 2-year water plan. 
   I am glad our work here today brings us one step closer to this reality. The product before us authorizes a number of studies and projects, particularly for the restoration of coastal Louisiana, the restoration of Florida Everglades and the restoration of the upper Mississippi River and the Illinois Waterway System. 
   Again, we do right by this country when we invest in its infrastructure. Communities across the country have been waiting 7 long years to begin their noteworthy flood control and water infrastructure projects. I am pleased that we have been able to put our heads together and once and for all advance this vitally important and long-overdue legislation for the American people.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  submit into the Record a letter from E.G. Pittman, Chairman of the Texas Water Development Board, strongly supporting the passage of this conference report. 
   The State of Texas has recently completed a nationally recognized comprehensive water plan. Provisions in H.R. 1495 would greatly assist the State in addressing changes in the population, water availability and quality, technological improvements, and promotes increased collaboration with the Corps of Engineers.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Rules Committee leader, Congresswoman Matsui, for yielding. 
   I am pleased to support the rule for the conference report for H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   The bill authorizes water resources projects and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers policy and programmatic changes that our Congress has failed to consider for far too long. Water resources legislation is most effective when it is considered every 2 years. I support this 2-year cycle as it provides stability to the program and assurance to the non-Federal sponsors who support Corps projects.     
   Unfortunately, no Water Resources bill has been enacted since year 2000, the entire term of the current administration. 
   The authorizations in the language are time sensitive, and there should be no surprise that this bill contains a substantial number of provisions. Many of these authorizations have been waiting for action more than 6 years. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule, as well as the underlying conference report, so that we may, once and for all, advance this vitally important legislation for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support this amendment and certainly want to thank the chairman of the committee and other members of the committee. 
   My amendment, as modified, addresses the need for public knowledge and understanding of basic financial principles. It also seeks to reduce our Nation's already enormous consumer debt. My amendment requires that anyone who receives Federal assistance through the affordable housing fund committee attend a financial literacy program. 
   We must educate our Nation's consumers to make informed decisions when managing their personal finances. Many consumers, especially first time homeowners, do not fully understand the complex financial agreements into which they are entering. For most families, their home is their single largest financial investment. 
   Therefore, it is vital to provide working families with the knowledge on how to buy and keep their homes. The number of foreclosures rise every month all over the country. And in the Dallas area, we have one of the highest foreclosure rates in the Nation. 
   My amendment will work to reduce the number of foreclosures and solidify a strong housing market. Education truly is the key to building a strong housing market and strong communities. Homeownership is a dream for many Americans. It represents security and it builds pride in our neighborhoods, and it is essential in creating positive, productive communities. 
   My amendment will help families fully understand their financial commitments and allow them to successfully achieve their part of the American dream. 
   I appreciate the chairman including my amendment en bloc. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) for 10 minutes.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for two essential programs for our children and families--Child Care and Development Block Grants (CCDBG) and Head Start. 
   We know that early investments in our children pay off in the long run. Early childhood education programs increase school readiness and achievement, and improve cognitive and social skills needed for academic success. Investing in Head Start is a good investment, as for every $1 spent we save nearly $9. These benefits include less welfare dependency, lower crime rates, and a reduction in grade repetition and special education services. 
   CCDBG programs also offer a life line for many low income families. By offering subsidies for quality child care parents have broader employment opportunities which result in higher incomes, less turnover, and increased productivity. In addition, these funds are improving the quality, as well as the amount of child care available, to low income families. 
   In Texas, there are nearly 90,000 children enrolled in Head Start. Current proposed funding levels for Head Start in the FY 2009 Presidential Budget will leave this program in peril. If enacted at the President's requested level, 14,000 fewer children will be able to be enrolled in Head Start in 2009. Last year, Congress made many needed improvements to the Head Start program during reauthorization. Many of these improvements will not be enacted without a significant increase in funding. 
   CCDBG faces similar prospects if there is not an increase in funding. Wait lists for CCDBG programs continue to rise. In Texas, there are currently 15,000 children on a waitlist for child care assistance. If funding continues at current levels 300,000 fewer children nationally will receive child care assistance by 2010. Without this much needed assistance, parents will be forced to make increasingly difficult choices. Many will be forced into debt, will choose lower-quality child care, or end up back on welfare rolls. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must increase the resources to these programs. Flat funding for CCDBG and near-flat funding for Head Start over the past decade has left hundreds of thousands of children without needed assistance. Current economic conditions have hit many of our low income families the hardest. Now, more than ever additional assistance is needed. I strongly encourage an increase in funding for these essential programs.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. King's legacy and recognize the innumerous Americans who continue along the path he paved towards justice and liberty for all citizens. 
   It is rare that one person can change the fate of our Nation; however Dr. King was able to do just that. Dr. King relied on his relationship with God and his faith in justice to articulate his vision for America in a way that touched the hearts and minds of the American public. 
   Dr. King called on all of us to no longer stand alone in silence, but to stand up together as a voice against injustice. He inspired us to fight for change through nonviolent means, and paved the road for us to continue that fight even after his death. 
   Few people would sacrifice time and energy for loved ones, fewer for strangers, yet Dr. King humbled himself to do just that. He ultimately sacrificed his life and his family sacrificed their patriarch for the struggle towards political justice for all Americans. Today we pay homage for their selflessness and publicly thank them for their commitments to humanity. 
   Dr. King left us with the challenge to courageously fight and secure the civil rights for all, from the impoverished and disenfranchised underclass to the politically and economically endowed. Although his challenge was issued 40 years ago, we still have not fully realized his noble request. 
   Today's Martin Luther King Day is as much about the past as it is about the future. Dr. King's dream is truly timeless, and I hope that our next generation will find inspiration in his faith and vision.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that will increase the number of highly qualified African American Head Start teachers. Let me hasten to thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member. 
   This program has been successful. I am fortunate enough to have what has been labeled as the number one Head Start program in the country in my district, and what I am attempting to do in this amendment is to create partnerships between our Nation's historically black colleges and universities and Head Start. 
   It does not eliminate anyone else's participation, but we know that by 2013 every Head Start teacher has to have a degree, and it could be parents because one of the secrets to success in these programs is to have lots of involvement of the parents and volunteers in the community. 
   The partnerships will provide an opportunity for Head Start staff and parents of Head Start students to obtain degrees in early childhood education. 
   Now, why must it be in a historically black college? Mr. Chairman, that is important because 30 percent of the total number of children in Head Start are African American. 
   Only 6 percent of our Nation's 3 million teachers are African American and this is far too few, but also the historically black colleges and universities educate more African American teachers than all the other universities put together. 
   So we would like to make this collaboration so that it can reflect the diversity and the need and encouragement of both the parents and the teachers to work together. They can serve as role models, the teachers who know and understand the students that come from their own communities, and this will not only increase the number of qualified African American Head Start teachers, but it will increase the number of role models for millions of children who are at risk of educational failure. 
   So, today, only 6 percent of our Nation's 3 million teachers are African American. It is far too small, but this would offer a unique resource and support for those that are seeking a degree which is going to be necessary to maintain these jobs, and it also will offer I think a very positive role model situation in our Head Start program where appropriate. 
   I would like to move adoption of my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I rise in strong support of H.R. 6627, the Smithsonian Facilities Authorization Act of 2008. This bill has bipartisan support, including support from Congresswoman Matsui, Congressman Becerra, and Congressman Johnson, who are Smithsonian regents. Majority Leader Hoyer and Ranking Member Mica are also in support of authorizing construction funding of these two renowned and vital Smithsonian facilities. 
   The Mathias Research Center located in Edgewater, Maryland, is a global leader in the study of ecosystems in coastal zones. It was established in the 1930s on a dairy farm in Edgewater, Maryland. Nearly one-half of SERC's 146 employees and fellows conduct the majority of their work in trailers. A major part of SERC's mission is research and professional training of the next generation of environmental scientists. 
   The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution requested authority to design and construct laboratory space to accommodate the Mathias Laboratory at SERC. 
   The Board requested authority to upgrade and replace the facility to eliminate unsafe trailers and address substandard, inefficient labs. The facility and its support spaces need to be replaced. 
   The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, located in Mathias Research Center, Panama, is the principal United States organization devoted to research in tropical biology which will advance scientific study and improve human welfare. Ecological catastrophes such as drought, starvation, and flooding caused by deforestation and overpopulation of tropical regions are studied for causes and remedies. 
   This facility is a world-renowned research and education center dedicated to research and analysis of tropical ecosystems. The Board of Regents requested authority to replace current science building structure that is heavily infested with termites. 
   I support these projects and the Board of Regents' request for construction authorization. 
   I urge passage.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (GREAT LAKES LEGACY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 6460 reauthorizes appropriations, at increased levels, for sediment remediation purposes in the Great Lakes' areas of concern. 
   The presence of these contaminated sediments, a toxic legacy of the industrialized past for the Great Lakes basin, have plagued its waters for decades. These sediments have contributed to over 90 percent of the near-shore waters of the lakes being unsafe for fishing, swimming and wildlife habitat. 
   In 2002, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, under the leadership of our current chairman, Congressman Oberstar, and Congressman Vern Ehlers, took action to begin the healing process for the Great Lakes community. 
   In that year, the Great Lakes Legacy Act was signed into law. The 2002 Legacy Act was enacted to encourage greater cooperation and expedited clean-up of the areas of concern. To accomplish this goal, the Legacy Act targeted Federal resources toward the remediation of contaminated sediment within the 31 areas of concern located within the United States or shared with Canada. 
   In many ways, the Legacy Act has been successful in laying the groundwork for addressing the areas of concern, but progress toward addressing and delisting these areas of concern has been very slow. Of the approximately 70 individual sites within the U.S. areas of concern, only four have been completely addressed. This is simply too slow, and the citizens of the Great Lakes basin demand that we take action to accelerate this process. 
   It is my hope that this legislation will set that in motion. Over the past year, my subcommittee has investigated why progress has slowed and has received several recommendations for targeted changes to the Legacy Act from stakeholders closely related with clean-up projects. H.R. 6460 encapsulates many of these recommendations, and it is intended to address the lessons learned as implementation of the Legacy Act program has matured. 
   First, H.R. 6460 significantly increases the authorization of appropriations for sediment remediation projects in the areas of concern, from $50 million to $150 million annually through 2013. The committee strongly believes that the increase in overall authorization and appropriations for this program will accelerate the pace of clean-up of the areas of concern. With full appropriation of the authorized amounts, it is our hope to complete the clean-up of all U.S. areas of concern within the next decade. 
   Second, in order to facilitate better understanding of the types, nature and volume of toxic sediment at contaminated sites, H.R. 6460 authorizes the administrator to carry out a site assessment of eligible projects at Federal expense. 
   This authority should overcome two difficulties identified in the implementation of the Legacy Act, the lack of sufficient information on the extent of the contamination and the identification of potential non-Federal cost-share partners for subsequent phases of remediation projects. 
   The language in H.R. 6460 attempts to replicate the successful model of the Corps of Engineers reconnaissance studies for Great Lakes sediment remediation projects. Again, this important change should accelerate the process of identifying the scope of contamination projects and quickly move projects from the conceptual stage to planning, design and construction phases. 
   Third, H.R. 6460 authorizes Legacy Act funding to be utilized for the restoration of aquatic habitat, provided that this restoration activity is carried out in conjunction with a sediment clean-up project. 
   Oftentimes, contaminated sediment has caused harm to neighboring aquatic habitat, and it is the presence of both contaminated sediment and the degraded aquatic habitat that results in sites being deemed as impaired. By allowing the simultaneous remediation of sediment, along with corresponding aquatic habitat, the Legacy Act should accelerate the process of delisting sites. 
   Finally, H.R. 6460 includes language requiring the administrator to provide assurance that the Environmental Protection Agency has conducted a reasonable inquiry to identify parties that are potentially liable for sediment contamination before a site can proceed under the Legacy Act. The committee believes that this provision is consistent with the intent of the original Legacy Act, as well as the ``polluter pays'' principle. In addition, this provision should help maximize the leveraging potential of contributions from non-Federal sources through the identification and encouraged participation of responsible parties in remediation activities. 
   While some have expressed concern that this provision will require additional time, it should neither present an opportunity to excessively delay clean-up projects, nor to divert additional sites to other Federal and State clean-up authorities. In addition, EPA is encouraged to coordinate this effort with State authorities and, where appropriate, utilize existing State efforts to identify responsible parties as a basis for its responsibilities under this Act. 
   Again, let me congratulate Congressman Ehlers and Congressman Oberstar for moving this important legislation forward. It is my hope that this legislation will mark another turning point in our joint efforts to remediate the Great Lakes areas of concern, and that by the time this legislation is again ripe for reauthorization, we will be within reach of completing the task of remediating the toxic legacy of the Great Lakes' past. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

The House passed this bill on December 7, 2007, and the Senate amended the bill to extend the authorization period from 3 years to 5 years. I support the amendment. 
   The building's 1.5 million square feet on 17 acres have been upgraded, refigured and transformed to more easily and graciously accommodate the center's 2 million annual visitors and patrons. The center is to be commended for giving a commitment not only to the center's programmatic side, but also the more mundane bricks and mortar side that makes up the presidential memorial. The fact is that, first and foremost, this building is a memorial to President John F. Kennedy. 
   I am pleased to support the amended bill, and urge the passage of H.R. 3986 with the Senate amendment.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I just want to comment a bit on his closing statement. The Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act underscores real differences between really the Democrats and Republicans when it comes to energy. 
   The comprehensive Democratic plan is America's own 21st century energy policy that the country has been waiting for. It lowers prices for consumers and protects taxpayers, it expands domestic drilling offshore and on land, it expands renewable sources of energy, increases our security by freeing America from the grip of foreign oil, requires big oil to pay what it owes to the taxpayers, ends the subsidies for the big oil companies and creates good-paying jobs here in America. 
   The Republican bill presented was nothing more than the same Bush-Cheney energy policy, written by and for the energy companies. Big oil gets more land, more oil, more taxpayer dollars and all the record profits, while American families suffer because of the big prices. 
   Members of Congress made a clear choice last night. Some Republicans joined with the Democrats in siding with the American taxpayers and consumers struggling with these energy costs. I am puzzled how any Republican can oppose a policy that will create good-paying American jobs and increase the Nation's security, while it lowers the price for gas for our consumers.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, the American people want a new direction in Iraq and I expect Congress to act accordingly. They really do think that this is a democracy and that this is representative government.     
   It has been almost 4 years since this administration declared the end of major combat in Iraq. He declared mission accomplished. Since this declaration, we have seen more than 3,000 of our military killed in combat, and more than 22,000 injured. 
   We cannot forget that these are not just numbers. These are our sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters. They are now more than 3,000 men and women who will never return home to be with their families. Many are so young, at 18, 19 and 20 years old, their lives have ended before they ever really began. 
   I started my professional career as a psychiatric nurse at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital, and I observed firsthand the physical and psychological trauma that the returning young people faced from the Vietnam war. 
   It is a long-term battle for them and their families as they learn to live with these disabilities. We are in a war with no end in sight, and now we are talking about troop escalation. How many more young lives are we going to lose? How many more soldiers will face long-term disabilities, life-long disabilities? The experts have weighed in on this issue, and they have said we are making a mistake to escalate. 
   The President sent a group of experts to design a new course for Iraq. The President's experts did not recommend additional troops. In fact, they recommended the very opposite. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time to listen to the experts and the commanders on the ground. Our troops are faced with an impossible task of policing a civil war. Each day we hear of sectarian attacks and bombings. Our troops are caught in the middle with no real strategy to end this violence. A great American military cannot be a substitute for a weak Iraqi government. 
   We need to focus on diplomatic solutions and training Iraq's security forces so they can take care of themselves and patrol their own country. With this escalation, we are just compounding the problem. We should concentrate on training the Iraqi security forces. They must know that this is not going to be an open-ended situation. 
   Madam Speaker, my constituents in north Texas continue to grieve the loss of their sons and daughters. They are  concerned for our troop safety and they are demanding answers. The war is costing us too many lives and too much money, $1 billion a week. At an overall cost of $500 billion, we will be paying the cost of this war for decades to come. 
   In my congressional district in Dallas, Texas, our share of the cost will be $1 billion. In Dallas this would have provided 400,000 children with health care or paid for 23,000 additional police officers. For our Nation's 300 million Americans, their share will be $1,300 a piece. 
   Accountability of Iraq war spending has been appalling. Does there exist any accountability? Last week we began the congressional hearings regarding contracting fraud. Apparently there is $12 billion unaccounted for. Contractors were being paid with large bags of cash. 
   This is truly an embarrassment and the height of irresponsibility as thousands of American children go to bed hungry tonight. Many are children of our troops, and now we are talking about spending more money and adding more troops. We need to end this, redeployment needs to start now. 
   Madam Speaker, we have before us a bipartisan resolution opposing the escalation of troops in Iraq. However, this debate is only the first step. The ultimate goal is to bring our troops home safely and swiftly. It is time for the President to listen to the American people and his advisers and refrain from changing the leadership when they disagree with him. 
   The best way to support our troops serving in Iraq is to say ``no'' to the President's escalation of this war. An outstanding general said recently that stubbornness cannot be mistaken as leadership and cliches cannot be called policy. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Ron Brown's legacy is one that will forever be synonymous with the term trailblazer. Ron Brown was the first African American to achieve partner at Patton, Boggs, and Blow in 1981. 
   In 1989, he became the first African-American to head the Democratic National Committee, marking the first time in U.S. history, a African-American had ever lead a major political party. 
   History was made again in 1993, when President William Jefferson Clinton nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Ron Brown as the first African-American to serve as Secretary of Commerce. 
   As alluded to previously, Ron Brown was an astute, bright, and compassionate individual. He was a brilliant lawyer, an effective Secretary of Commerce, but most importantly he was a devoted family man to his wife Alma and their two children, Michael and Tracy. 
   Sadly, death cheated them and this country at a most unexpected hour; however, we all can take great pride in knowing that Ron Brown's legacy shall endure.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Shirley Chisholm U.S.-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act of 2007. I would like to thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee and her continued commitment to the Caribbean and education. This legislation helps bridge the educational gap in the Caribbean by creating an educational exchange program for Caribbean students to study in the United States. 
   Caribbean Nations suffer from high poverty rates, high unemployment rates, and low literacy rates. These conditions have left most Caribbean students faced with the hard choice of education or work; and most are forced to choose work in order to provide for themselves and their families. Educational exchange programs allow Caribbean students to provide opportunities to learn necessary skills for leadership and career success, explore cultural issues, and promotes dialogue of community and/or social relevance. Education is the building block that creates a sound foundation for success and develops strong democratic values. These exchange programs allow students to return to their native homes to contribute to the success of their nation. 
   This bill also creates new programs to improve primary and secondary education through teacher training. Teacher preparedness and education management is vital to any education system. Providing high quality teachers in critical subject areas is the most important components in building a strong educational structure. 
   Many Caribbean leaders have received education in the United States, and have used their education to strengthen Caribbean democracy and community involvement. This legislation will help to continue strengthen U.S.-Caribbean relations, I strongly urge my colleagues support in passage this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (WATER QUALITY INVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Today, the House will consider the first of three bills reported from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure that seek to improve overall water quality of this Nation. 
   The first bill is H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act of 2007, sponsored by a former committee colleague, Mr. Pascrell, as well as Mr. Camp and Mr. Capuano. 
   This legislation authorizes $1.8 billion in Federal grants over the next 5 years to address combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows nationwide. CSOs and SSOs are overflows of untreated waste that can occur during wet weather events as a result of poor maintenance, deteriorating infrastructure, or inadequate incapacity. These overflows are significant concerns for public health and safety because they often result in discharges of raw sewage into neighboring rivers, streets, beaches and basements. 
   In the first year of authorization, H.R. 569 requires the administrator to make grants directly to municipalities on a competitive basis. For fiscal years 2009 and thereafter, the bill directs the administrator to establish a funding formula, after notice and comment, that allocates to each State a proportional share of grant funding based on the total needs of the State to address CSOs and SSOs within its borders. 
   States would be responsible for awarding grants to municipalities using these allocated funds. I applaud the tireless efforts of Congressmen PASCRELL, CAMP and CAPUANO in advocating for increased funding to address CSOs and SSOs. 
   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has twice approved legislation to reauthorize appropriations for this important effort. It is my hope that this year Congress will finally approve legislation and forward it to the President for his signature. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation which is both vital and overdue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price). 
   The amendment confuses the issue of authorization of appropriations and actual funding of these programs through the appropriations process. This amendment would require that any authorization of appropriations be considered with the corresponding offset, regardless of whether the program ever receives any funding. 
   In the example of the sewer overflows grant program, we are considering today a program that I remind my colleagues has never been funded through the appropriations process. This amendment would require the identification of $1.45 billion over the next 5 years in offsets regardless of whether appropriations are ever enacted in this program.     
   During the first few days of the legislative session, the new Democratic majority renewed PAYGO rules to require the identification of offsets of any changes in mandatory spending by legislative initiatives. This important provision expired under the Republican control of the House with no attempt to restore these protections to the Federal budgetary process. 
   As the gentleman is well aware, in the first days of the 110th Congress, the Democratic majority reinstituted PAYGO rules that requires the offsets in Federal receipts resulting from legislative proposals. 
   This bill has no effect on direct spending. In its analysis of the bill, the Congressional Budget Office specifically stated enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or receipts. However, to require offsets for any authorization of appropriations, regardless of its impact on Federal receipts, is beyond the scope of PAYGO and an appropriate limitation of the ability of Congress to address the needs of the Nation. 
   I oppose this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

The amendment imposes conditions for receipt of these funds that are unrelated to the underlying bill.

The amendment is not germane to H.R. 569 and violates clause 7 of rule XVI of the Rules of the House.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
   It has been 45 years since the passage of the landmark Equal Pay Act of 1963, and while pay disparities have narrowed, a strong wage disparity still exists. In fact, according to the U.S. Census Bureau women still make only 77 cents on the dollar to their male counterparts. 
   We cannot deny that this gender disparity exists, and it is essential that we close the loopholes that allow it to continue. The Paycheck Fairness Act helps close these loopholes by increasing enforcement and accountability in cases of discrimination. This bill provides relief for women who face retaliation for standing up for equal pay, and it requires the Department of Labor to increase their effort to end pay disparities. 
   This is not only a bill for women, but a bill for children and families. For the millions of working mothers in America--many of whom are heads of households--it offers financial stability. This wage disparity is costing women between $400,000 and $2 million over a lifetime. 
   Lower wages factor into long-term financial planning. Retirement and Social Security is based on income. Retirement aged women today are far less likely to receive a pension, and rely on Social Security benefits to survive. The wage discrimination women are facing today will continue to follow them well into retirement. 
   We cannot continue to simply accept this disparity, and the Paycheck Fairness Act is a strong statement that this type of discrimination will not be tolerated. I would like to thank Congresswoman DeLauro for offering this important piece of legislation, and commend Chairman Miller and the Democratic leadership for bringing this bill to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise to address my concerns for the 5.4 million Texans who are without health insurance. Nearly 25 percent of Texans are uninsured. That's the highest rate in the entire country. The irony is that Dallas and other cities have great health care networks. 
   The problem is that of access to care. In Dallas, there are many examples of health care excellence, including Parkland Memorial Hospital, Baylor University Medical Center, Methodist Medical Center, UT Southwestern Medical School, the Dallas Veterans Administration Medical Center, and others. 
   However, the price of insurance is robbing Texans of access to the appropriate medical care. Emergency rooms are overcrowded. Only half of Texas children are covered by employment-based insurance. 
   We must fix the problem of the uninsured. Affordable, accessible health care coverage should be available to every American. Health care should not be a cash cow for the insurance companies.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, thank you for our committee leadership. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act. This legislation was based on policy recommendations from the ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report to Congress by the National Academy of Sciences. 
   One of the greatest challenges new researchers face is getting grant funding for their research. In Dallas, the University of Texas Southwest Medical School has four Nobel laureates, where they earned them right there, and UT-Dallas has at least one. Baylor University and others are stellar research institutions, and they compete at the national level for grants and perform award-winning scientific research.     
   These universities depend on Federal research funding. 
   When new faculty are hired at research universities in Texas and elsewhere, they are expected to be able to write grant proposals and successfully win funding from Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and others. 
   According to NIH, the average age at which the investigator first obtains RO1 major grant funding is age 42. If students are earning Ph.D.s in their late twenties, that means there are many years of struggle before they can establish themselves and eventually become full professors at these universities. 
   As a result, many scientists have dropped out of science. It is too hard to get funding. The stress level is too high. 
   Mr. Chairman, grant support targeted at new investigators is an important step toward resolving this problem. If Congress would fund Federal research as vigorously as our competitors overseas are doing, we wouldn't have such a problem. 
   H.R. 363 targets young investigator grant support at the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and other scientific research agencies under the purview of the Committee on Science and technology. 
   This is a good bill and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, let me thank our leaders on the committee. This is a very important bill. It is most especially for me, because for the last 15 years that I have been here, I have been preaching about this. So I rise in strong support of H.R. 362 for 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. 
   The Committee on Science and Technology has worked to produce legislation to act upon the recommendations of the ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report which was published by the National Academy of Sciences. This bill addresses the issues that they recommended to improve the quality and number of math and science teachers across the Nation. 
   Of particular interest to me is the Noyce teacher scholarship program. This program provides grants to universities to give scholarships to math, science and engineering students who become math and science teachers. Original law stated that for every 1 year the scholarship was awarded, new teachers must spend 2 years teaching in a high-needs school. This high-needs school requirement was softened by H.R. 362, but I am pleased that the chairman agreed to modify the bill in conference to restore incentives for teachers to serve in high-need schools. We are losing so many students because they are are from poor communities. 
   The new design will provide more money per scholarship for students who agree to teach in underserved classrooms. This incentive will hopefully entice passionate and high-quality Noyce scholars to share their talents with students most in need. 
   I want to commend the chairman's sensitivity to the great disparities that exist in availability of highly qualified math and science teachers in schools across the country. As a matter of fact, in my district we have the number one high school in the country in this area, but not without a great deal of effort. 
   The subcommittee chair, where I was ranking member for about 6 years, Mr. Baird, and ranking member, Mr. Gingrey, of the Research and Science Education Subcommittee have been great advocates for lessening the achievement gap as well. 
   H.R. 362 also contains a laboratory science partnership pilot program that I have worked on with Mr. Hinojosa from Texas, and he has been a strong advocate because many of these schools don't have equipment. Overall, this legislation is designed to strengthen our Nation's scientific competitiveness by producing thousands of talented and well-educated math and science teachers. That is the only way we are going to remain competitive in this country. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 362.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, let me thank Mr. Gordon, Mr. Hall, and our subcommittee chair as well as the ranking member. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 362. It is an essential measure to world competitiveness for this country. We are in the storm. We cannot accomplish rising above until we invest in our teachers, teachers that are qualified. Many of our teachers love teaching and they are trying hard, but they simply do not have the background needed. A lot of it has to do with pay, because the people who are well-qualified in these areas simply do not come to the classroom because they do not pay enough.     
   I support the Noyce teacher scholarships, and I know that the storm of need is sure and it is now. It takes efforts and investment to deal with this issue. There are now more and more high-need schools which means we have more and more students that need special attention, and we cannot have a positive future until we include them in this education. 
   This is called the investment in America's future. We are depending on the home people to be prepared because the H-1B visas are causing us to brain drain other countries. This is a global need, and we must be ready to prepare our own. We will be left with no possible preparation in this area, and we will move right into a Third World nation. 
   We must remedy this. Implementing the provisions of H.R. 362 will go a long way in remedying this problem, and I firmly believe that with proper resources we know our young people can do it. 
   There is a school in my district with some of the poorest kids, but they are doing it because they have the proper resources.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, members of the Congressional Black Caucus wish to call greater attention upon the disparities that exist in health care. 
   Chilren of color suffer disproportionately from a lack of health insurance. 
   In my State of Texas, the problem is severe. 
   Texas has the highest rate of uninsured children in the Nation, with over 21 percent of children--that's 1.4 million--lacking health care coverage. 
   Across the nation, more than 9 million American children lacked health care coverage in 2005. 
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program, called SCHIP, is critically important to prevent low- and moderate-income minority children from slipping through the cracks of our health care system. 
   One problem is that eligible children are not enrolling in SCHIP. 
   Nearly three-quarters of uninsured children were eligible for health coverage through SCHIP or Medicaid in 2004. 
   A disproportionate number of those eligible, but uninsured, were either Black or Hispanic. 
   Without insurance, children living in poverty are likely to have poorer health compared to children with insurance. 
   Uninsured kids are more likely to lack a regular source of health care, delay or have unmet health care needs, use less preventive care, and receive poorer quality care than children with insurance. 
   I urge my colleagues to remember our uninsured--especially the children--and have compassion on our Nation's most vulnerable.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 781, offered by my colleague, Mr. Ross of Arkansas, to redesignate lock and dam No. 5 of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System as the Colonel Charles D. Maynard Lock and Dam. The bill has the support of the entire Arkansas delegation. 
   Colonel Maynard made an undeniable contribution to the State of Arkansas through his professional duties and social services. Educated at West Point, he was the district engineer of the Little Rock Engineer District for 3 years, where he oversaw the planning, design and construction of the 13 locks and dams on the McClellan-Kerr. At the time, this was the largest civil works project ever undertaken in the State of Arkansas. 
   To this day, the locks and dams provide inland waterway transportation for commerce and well-paying jobs for many of the residents of Arkansas. Billions of dollars in goods move through the State's ports each year. 
   Colonel Maynard was an integral connection between the project and Congress: he provided congressional testimony in support of McClellan-Kerr, and he consistently met the deadlines our body designated for the project. 
   Because of his work promoting waterborne transportation in Arkansas, Colonel Maynard was appointed by three separate Governors to serve on the Arkansas Waterways Commission. He served on the commission for 21 years. 
   His civil roles included a variety of leadership positions for charity groups to better our society and for groups such as the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce to help promote business in his community. 
   Although Colonel Maynard passed away October 22, 2005, he remains a symbol of how best to engineer our  civil works projects for the benefit of all. His memory could also be used to call attention to the vital role inland waterways have for our economy, and remind us of the improvements and necessary maintenance projects needed for our commerce on these rivers to thrive. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting H.R. 781. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   This resolution, as introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland), honors the 100th anniversary of the United Parcel Service and recognizes its role in our global transportation system. 
   Since its founding in 1907 by James E. ``Jim'' Casey and Claude Ryan in Seattle, Washington, with $100 borrowed from a friend, United Parcel Service has grown from a two-person foot and bike messenger service into a worldwide transportation and logistics corporation. Today UPS is the world's largest package delivery company, employing over 427,000 workers, utilizing approximately 92,000 vehicles and operating the world's eighth largest airline. UPS plays an integral role in the movement of goods in the constantly changing global economy, moving over 15 million packages through its network each business day. It is an important spoke in the global transportation wheel, connecting the flow of goods and information in the United States to more than 200 countries. 
   In 1929, UPS became the first package delivery company to provide air service. In 1975, it became the first package delivery company to serve every address in the continental USA. 
   UPS's contributions to our Nation go beyond simply transporting goods or providing logistics to our businesses. It has maintained its role as a leader in good business practices, with a commitment to social responsibility and diversity. It has also made a significant dedication to environmental stewardship through the UPS ``Green Fleet,'' which recently passed the 100 million mark. The company also plays an important philanthropic role in the United States and has made sizable contributions to numerous charitable organizations around the world.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 799, as amended, the Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments of 2007, and thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica for their hard work and leadership in helping to bring this bill to the floor. 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission, the ARC, strives to ensure the people and businesses of the Appalachian region have the knowledge, skills, abilities, and access to services necessary to compete in basic economic activities of the United States. 
   Since its inception in 1965, the commission has been highly effective in meeting the goals of its mission. There is no doubt that it has compiled an impressive record of accomplishment in creating economic opportunity in Appalachia. Just as it has done since its inception, the ARC has proven it provides a fair return, both socially and economically, for the Federal Government's investment in the people of Appalachia. 
   Consistent with the congressional leadership and interest in energy programs, H.R. 799 authorizes the ARC to  provide technical assistance, make grants, enter into contracts, or otherwise provide amounts in the Appalachian region for energy-efficient projects or projects to increase the use of renewable energy resources.     
   This bill also authorizes the creation of at-risk counties, and further outlines the percentage of funds for which these counties are eligible. The authorized amounts build on the funds authorized in Public Law 107-149 and adjust the annual amounts for inflation. The bill authorizes appropriation for the commission's programs and expenses through the fiscal year 2011. 
   H.R. 799, as amended, has strong bipartisan support, which acknowledges the ARC as a well-run and highly effective Federal/State partnership commission. 
   I urge the passage of H.R. 799, as amended. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (RECOGNITION OF WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this coming Monday, April 28, millions of people worldwide will recognize Workers Memorial Day. 
   Each year, in this country, thousands of workers are killed due to workplace related injuries, and tens of thousands more die of occupational illness. It is staggering to think that each day an average of 16 workers are killed due to the injuries on the job. 
   The bottom line is that everyone deserves a safe and healthy workplace. Many of us take this basic right for granted, but for millions of Americans, the threat of being permanently disabled or even killed on a job is very real. 
   Workers Memorial Day not only recognizes and honors those who have been killed or injured on the job, it also reminds us of the overwhelming need to improve health and safety standards in our Nation's workplace. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced a resolution to recognize Workers Memorial Day, and I certainly encourage all my colleagues on Monday to pay respect for those who have lost their lives this past year.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the sad truth is that we have an epidemic of working poor in this country. These are Americans who work 40 to 60 hours a week and sometimes 7 days a week, yet can't afford the basic necessities. At $5.15 per hour, a full-time minimum wage worker makes less than $11,000 a year, which is less than most of us make in a month. These aren't just teenagers working part time. Most minimum-wage workers are actually hardworking disadvantaged adults. Each day these working poor are faced with the impossible decision of having to choose between food, clothing, shelter, medicine and utility bills. No American who works hard for a living should have to make those types of choices. We cannot continue to look away while hardworking Americans linger in poverty. This isn't just an economic issue, it is an ethical and moral issue. 
   I commend the Democratic leadership for their dedication to this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this raise for the millions of Americans who deserve it.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (RECOGNIZING ANN RICHARDS' EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO TEXAS AND AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the legacy of an exceptional public servant, the late Governor Ann Richards. 
   When Governor Richards passed away in September, I not only lost an esteemed colleague, but a dear and trusted friend. I am proud to say that our friendship endured for more than 40 years. 
   First, we are from the same hometown. But I didn't meet her there, I met her in Dallas, Texas when she lived there in the 1960s. And then she moved to Austin, and the first thing that she did, she always helped in everybody's campaign, but the first thing she did in Austin was manage Sarah Weddington's campaign for the Texas House, and we won at the same time. Sarah Weddington is the young lawyer that defended Rowe v. Wade before the Supreme Court. 
   As women in politics, and especially Ann, we shared some of the same views and many of the same colleagues, and I did encourage her that she had come to her time that she can maybe serve in elective office herself. And we knew that Texans were not that supportive of women running for office, but she ran for the County Commissioner's Court and won. 
   She was not afraid to be herself, and she really listened to people and she was supportive of people. Her independent spirit and charm not only won  her votes, but it really generated a great deal of respect. And she often used humor to get her point across, but she did get her point across. People respected her, and they knew that she would work hard on their behalf and there was never a question about that. 
   She took pride in her accomplishments as Governor. First she won as Treasurer, and I had the pleasure of running her campaign in Dallas County during that time. But when she won as Governor, it was a very male-dominated situation, and she right away appointed more women and minorities to important boards than anyone else ever had done in history. 
   For the first time there were women and minorities on the board of regents of Texas universities all over the State and many other women positions that was on the medical examiners board. Those medical examiners didn't know what had taken place. But she was not afraid to do it. 
   She utilized the latest technology as Texas Treasurer. When she came into office there was a big deficit, and she hired a consultant to come down and help, and that consultant was Franklin Raines. That is when I first met him. 
   We did so much together. And when she was in office and was able to see how to get through those many problems, she earned the support of the business community, which was mostly white men of course. Ann broke her way from the mold.  
   I rise today to pay tribute to the legacy of an exceptional public servant, the late Governor Ann Richards. 
   When Governor Richards passed away in September, I not only lost an esteemed colleague, but a dear and trusted friend. 
   I'm proud to say that our friendship endured for more than 40 years. 
   I first met Ann Richards in the sixties when she lived in Dallas and was running for Travis County Commissioner. 
   As women in politics, Ann and I shared many of the same views and also many of the same challenges. 
   Texas in the 1970's wasn't very supportive of women running for political office, so you really had to earn each and every vote. 
   Ann wasn't afraid to be herself, and she compelled people to listen to her. 
   Her independent spirit and charm not only won her votes, but it garnered respect. 
   People respected her, and they knew that she would work hard on their behalf. 
   Ann took pride in her accomplishments in the male dominated Texas politics. She had hoped that her success may serve as inspiration to young women. 
   She certainly served as inspiration to me. 
   In 1982 Ann successfully ran for Texas State Treasurer. 
   As State Treasurer she utilized the latest technology to transform the Texas Treasury into a modern operation. 
   Along the way, Ann earned the respect of the business community who appreciated her foresight and vision. 
   In 1990 Ann became the first woman Governor of Texas elected in her own right. 
   Ann broke away from the mold of previous Governors. She wasn't afraid to shake things up and speak her mind. 
   In her tenure as Governor she was adamant about appointing minorities on state boards and commissions. 
   Ann wanted the Texas Government to reflect the diversity and culture of the people of the State. 
   Ann was a hands-on Governor, and she didn't let much get by her. 
   She did her best to eliminate inefficiency and waste within the government. 
   She demanded that the Texas government fully serve the people, and she did everything in her power to realize that. 
   She had a strong will for justice and fairness for all. 
   Governor Richards was one of the finest of Texans that I've ever known. 
   She dedicated herself to the State and the people of Texas. 
   She broke down barriers for women, and made us believe that anything was possible. 
   She was truly an original, and her absence is immensely felt. 
   The recognition she is receiving today is very well deserved. 
   Her many contributions to the State of Texas and to America will not be forgotten.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for the time. 
   I rise with great sadness to remember my friend, my sorority sister in the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and my colleague, Juanita Millender-McDonald. And I want to extend my deep  condolences to her husband James, her children, friends, and loved ones. 
   I was privileged to serve with her on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and her diligent service is evident in many of California's roads, bridges, and highways. I worked with her when she was cochair of the Congressional Women's Caucus. She did it with such charm, grace, poise, and dignity. This body is diminished and dismayed by her sudden absence, but we were inspired and enriched by her presence. 
   Her spirit will live on. Her work will be felt by those who don't even know she helped. We celebrate her life. It was a wonderful, wonderful life. And we love her and her family.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise with great sadness to remember my friend, my sorority sister and my colleague, JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. I want to extend my deep condolences to her husband, James, her children, friends and loved ones. 
   As chairwoman of the Committee on House Administration, Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD will be recorded in history as the first African-American woman to chair a full committee of the House. 
   Those of us privileged to know and work with her will remember her tireless advocacy for justice and her example of meaningful public service. 
   Throughout her career, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was a friend to women's causes and to young people. Her work to end human trafficking and slow the transmission of AIDS has improved countless lives. 
   The results of her work--improved lives for women and girls worldwide, expanded voting rights for the disenfranchised, greater assistance for the sick and the poor--are a testament to her character. 
   From the beginning, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was a trailblazer: 
   She was the first African-American woman to serve on the Carson, California City Council. 
   In her first term in the California State Assembly, she became the first woman to chair two powerful committees. 
   She was the first African-American woman to give the national Democratic response to President Bush's weekly radio address as well. 
   But for all her firsts, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was also a champion for the least and the last. She fought injustice wherever she found it: Whether in the voting booth, the classroom, the research lab, or the workplace. 
   Congresswoman Millender-McDonald rigorously investigated widespread voting irregularities and disenfranchisement. 
   She was a vocal opponent of genocide around the world and a tireless fighter for human rights. 
   Her Mother-to-Child HIV/AIDS Transmission Act became the President's $15 billion African AIDS initiative. 
   Congresswoman Millender-McDonald also worked to increase diabetes research in minority and female populations; she pushed the Department of Education to improve the dismal dropout rates among minority high school students and secured millions to reduce the backlog of Equal Employment Opportunity complaints. 
   The first time voters in Ohio can feel more confident their votes will count because of Congresswoman Millender-McDonald. 
   The elderly diabetics in her home State of Alabama have a better chance of avoiding amputation because of her. 
   She had a hand in granting diplomas to thousands of Native American students growing up on reservations; and countless girls in Cambodia and Sudan have her to thank for a childhood free from kidnapping and assault. They may never know where to direct their gratitude, but the alleviation of their suffering stands as her lasting legacy. 
   Her influence is also inscribed on the physical landscape of California's 37th district. I was privileged to serve with her on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee and her diligent service is evident in many of California's roads, bridges and highways. 
   Congresswoman Miliender-McDonald's record of exemplary public service includes life memberships in the NAACP and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. 
   She served on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference Board of Directors, and founded the League of African-American Women. 
   Congresswoman Millender-McDonald also founded the Young Advocates to train young people for political leadership. 
   This body is diminished and dismayed by her sudden absence, but we were inspired and enriched by her presence. 
   Her commitment to equal opportunity, civil and human rights will be greatly missed.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to commend Chairman CONYERS and the House Leadership for their diligence in addressing the issue of patent reform, and to express why I unfortunately must oppose this bill in its current form. 
   There is an overwhelming need to move patents through the approval process quickly, fairly, and economically. I commend this bill on many of the positive changes it makes to the reform system, but I remain concerned about provisions that may dramatically restrict damages payable by infringers. It is my fear that this bill will alter the current system in favor of defendants resulting in further backlogs. These changes to the current system would ultimately hurt existing patent owners. 
   In addition, this bill implements a post grant review process that will lead to duplicative challenges, resulting in an increase to the cost of patent ownership and significantly decreasing the enforceability, predictability and value of all patents. 
   Numerous technology firms, both large and small are opposed to this bill, as well as, many universities. These are the people on the forefront of our technological future and their voice and opposition need to be heard. 
   Innovation and advancement are key to the future of America. It is my concern that this bill will tilt the legal balance in favor of patent infringers and discourage innovation and investment in research and development. We must protect our innovators and allow them to pursue concise and necessary action in the court of law.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (NATIONAL NURSES WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Let me thank my colleague and friend of longstanding. I want to also thank the minority side for their assistance, and both Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton. 
   As a registered nurse with a master's degree, it is a privilege and a delight to offer a resolution recognizing National Nurses Week which is May 6 through 12. I have two outstanding colleagues that we have found to have something in common, Congresswoman Lois Capps and Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, who are also nurses and champions of this resolution and of the profession, and I thank them for their efforts to encourage more than 110 congressional colleagues to cosponsor this bill honoring nurses. 
   The Congressional Nursing Caucus was also helpful in promoting the legislation, and I appreciate Members' efforts to rally support for H. Res. 1086. 
   Nurses are a key component of our Nation's health care system. Whether on the battlefield or at sea, in a skilled nursing facility, in a hospital or even in a patient's own home, the care that a nurse provides is very valuable. Nurses are intelligent individuals who must often make quick decisions in an effort to save the life of a patient, even before the physician arrives. Nurses are recognized as the patient's primary advocate and every poll shows that nurses are always very trusted by the patients. They are tasked with closely monitoring even small changes in a patient's health. Nurses are tough, directed, decision-making people who work under stress and in difficult situations. 
   For 15 years I provided hands-on patient care as a psychiatric nurse at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Dallas. The work was challenging but fulfilling. That's why I still remain very interested in quality care for all of our veterans. Although more than 2.5 million nurses work in the United States, our Nation has suffered from a nursing shortage. Those currently in the profession are beginning to retire. There are fewer individuals entering the profession. The nursing shortage is unprecedented in its depth and duration, with a projection of over 1 million new and replacement nurses needed by 2016. 
   Nursing schools need help attracting well-prepared faculty to recruit the best and brightest into their educational programs. Loan forgiveness and educational incentive programs can help, but Congress must do more to encourage bright young minds toward nursing. 
   Nursing is a career that has been valued for a long time, and it is fitting to recognize the Navy Nurse Corps on its 100th anniversary this year. For nearly 100 years before Congress formally established the Navy Nurse Corps in 1908, women worked as nurses aboard Navy ships and in Navy hospitals. As early as the War of 1812, volunteers performed nursing duty in places that were often dangerous and required courage in the face of adversity. Members of the esteemed Navy Nurse Corps care for those brave men and women who fight for our freedoms. They contribute to relief efforts in all corners of the globe. They serve in lead roles as part of a unified health care team. The Navy Nurse Corps practices progressive patient care. It enjoys a rich heritage, accompanied by high-tech training. A registered nurse in the Navy is also a respected officer, serving in modern facilities at home, at sea, around the country and across the globe. 
   I am proud to especially recognize the Navy Nurse Corps for its centuries of outstanding service for our military men and women. 
   Today's resolution honors the good work that all nurses do.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairwoman Kilpatrick, the Congressional Black Caucus and my colleague, Congressman Scott from Virginia, for their leadership and unwavering support for the development of this alternative budget. 
   The CBC alternative budget is filled with progressive and visionary funding that is motivated by principle and compassion. It is a budget that voices the concerns and needs of the poor, the children, and the elderly that have been so easily set aside by this current administration. 
   The CBC alternative budget understands that our Nation's transportation system is the backbone of our economy and our way of life, neither of which we cannot afford to shortchange. 
   Funding included in the CBC budget also supports great competitiveness in science and technology. As a senior member of the House Science Committee, I feel it is important to invest in our children's futures, which is also an investment in our own future. 
   Provisions for the science and technology fields will address access to higher education, enrichment programs in the STEM fields, and spur critical research and development to meet the needs of this country. 
   Our Nation's future depends more and more on the quality of our innovative ideas. The fruits of these investments meet vital national needs and improve the quality of life for all Americans. 
   The CBC alternative budget also provides funding for programs and services crucial to the American people, rather than continuing to provide tax breaks for those who least need it. 
   By repealing several of the tax cuts implemented under the current administration, the CBC budget provides robust funding for much-needed programs and services. Such programs include health care for uninsured children, education, and job training programs, an expanded GI Bill for post-9/11 veterans, as well as increases in benefits and services, juvenile justice prevention and intervention programs, community and regional development, public housing, the Army Corps of Engineers, and homeland security needs.  
   Mr. Chairman, we are in a position to provide funding for long-neglected programs and to advance on our promise for progress. 
   The CBC alternative understands that our Nation's transportation system is the backbone of our economy and our way of life, neither of which we can afford to shortchange.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Let me thank the Chair and the subcommittee chairs of these committees. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Representative Allen in bringing forth this House Concurrent Resolution 337 honoring the Seeds of Peace for its 15th anniversary as an organization. 
   The importance of peace in the world today is often overlooked due to the severity of constant conflict. As a mother and a lawmaker, the reality of war concerns me for the future of our Nation and the world. 
   Seeds of Peace is dedicated to empowering young leaders from regions of conflict with the leadership skills required to advance reconciliation and coexistence. I am proud to say that I worked with them here in Washington and in Dallas, and I have partnered with Congressman Barney Frank at times to host them. 
   Due to its proven impact and success in the Middle East, Seeds of Peace has earned international recognition as an effective model for resolving conflict worldwide, and these are young people who have not been kept away from communication or a part of irritation of Israel. 
   I firmly support Seeds of Peace because I believe peace ultimately depends upon breaking down barriers and mistrust among people from these regions of conflict. Governments negotiate agreements, but only people can define the quality of peace. Innovative people-to-people programs like Seeds of Peace successfully accomplish this goal on a rather modest budget. 
   I am proud to support the passage of this resolution and urge my colleagues to support it. I thank Mr. Payne for allowing me to make these statements.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for millions of American families it is becoming more and more difficult to make ends meet. Our economic outlook is grim in light of the recent housing crisis, fluctuating interest rates, and increasing prices. Working Americans are feeling a serious squeeze on their family finances, because for too long, Republicans and this administration ran up big deficits and ignored priorities here at home. 
   With the economy continuing to decline, African American households are suffering disproportionately. In 2006, African Americans were two times more likely to get high-cost subprime loans. In my district, more than half of loans given to working Americans were subprime; of these loans, 80 percent were African American. One in six resulted in foreclosure; this is unacceptable. 
   In 2007, the Democratic led Congress passed an increase to the minimum wage, but this does not help Americans who cannot find jobs. The African American unemployment rate has climbed from 8 percent this fall to 9.2 percent in January, with 1.6 million African Americans currently looking for work. 
   I applaud the Congressional Democrat Leadership for their rapid agreement on an economic stimulus package to aid families across America. While I feel that this stimulus package is a step in the right direction, I am disappointed that there was no aggressive plan for job training programs such as: adult education and literacy, welfare-to-work, and vocational education.  
   As a senior member of the House Science Committee, I feel it is important to invest in our children's futures. This Congress has led the fight to address access to higher education, enrichment programs in STEM fields, advancement in educational programs for minorities, and spur critical research and development to meet the needs of the country. Education is the foundation to building a better and brighter future for all Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, honest, hard-working men and women are struggling to make a decent living as they go about their daily routines. The economic disparities of African American and other minorities are truly hurting this country. I am hopeful that the President will join this Congress to help find long-term, comprehensive measures as opposed to a temporary bandaid to our economic problems.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, my amendment makes a few technical and clarifying changes to H.R. 2537, as reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on December 12, 2007. 
   First, it makes a technical change to section 5(c)(2) of the bill, substituting the word ``criteria'' for ``guidance'' to remove any potential confusion on the intent of this language. 
   Second, it makes a technical change to section 8 to address potential constitutional concerns raised by the administration on requiring States and local governments to perform certain actions. 
   The manager's amendment shifts the focus from requiring States and local governments to take certain compliance actions to conditioning a percentage of their annual BEACH grant should they choose not to take such actions. 
   And, third, it puts in a statutory deadline of October 1, 2010, for the Environmental Protection Agency to complete its evaluation and validation of ``rapid testing methods'' for the existing coastal recreation water quality criteria. This significant improvement to the bill will ensure that same-day monitoring data will be available before the end of the decade. 
   Finally, the amendment changes the requirement of section 303(i)(2)(A) of the Clean Water Act to ensure uniformity among States in the implementation of water quality criteria and standards. 
   This amendment will ensure that should a State choose not to incorporate potentially new or revised coastal recreational water quality criteria into their own programs, the burden falls on the Environmental Protection Agency to propose regulations for such State setting forth the revised or new water quality standards. This was the structure of the original BEACH Act with respect to the first round of water quality criteria that should be carried forward to subsequent revisions to coastal recreational water quality criteria. 
   The manager's amendment was developed jointly by the majority and minority staffs of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. I am unaware of any opposition to this amendment, and I urge its adoption.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I support this amendment offered by the gentleman from California.  
   First let me commend my colleague from California for working with us to address some of our concerns with the initial draft of this amendment.     
   The amendment calls for the Administrator of EPA to conduct a short-term study to assess the benefits of using molecular testing for monitoring and assessing the quality of coastal recreation waters. 
   This amendment is consistent with other changes made by this legislation to encourage EPA to quickly move on the adoption of rapid testing methodologies for pathogens and pathogen indicators. These studies and changes are essential for shortening the time period between when a water quality sample is taken and when the results of that testing can be made available to the public. As I have stated before, the goal of these changes is to move as close to the same day realtime information on the condition of the Nation's coastal recreation waters as possible. This amendment helps move us closer to our goal. 
   Again, I appreciate the willingness of the gentleman to work with us in crafting this amendment, and I urge its adoption.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of H. Con. Res. 35, in support of the seventh anniversary of goals and ideals of National Blacks HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. 
   This concurrent resolution will raise awareness about HIV/AIDS within the African American community and will point out the devastating impact this disease has on African American communities. 
   This day is a part of a national mobilization effort to get African Americans to learn about the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to the African American community. 
   The National Blacks HIV/AIDS Awareness Day is a day to remember those infected and affected by this epidemic. Since the beginning of this epidemic, 42 percent of all deaths occurred within the African American community. 
   Dallas accounts for one of the top 26 cities where African Americans are disproportionately impacted by AIDS. 
   From 2000 to 2005, more than half of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in 32 states were among African Americans, although African Americans represented only 13 percent of the population of those states. 
   In 2004, black men had the highest rate of HIV/AIDS diagnoses of any racial/ethnic population, approximately seven times the rate among white men and twice the rate among black women. 
   Black women are also severely impacted by HIV. During 2000-2004, approximately 69 percent of women who had HIV/AIDS diagnosed were black. 
   We must take the lead in supporting National Blacks HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. We must continue to educate/prevent and care for our members who have been affected by this atrocious epidemic and continue the fight against HIV/AIDS.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, nearly one in five unemployed Americans have lost their unemployment benefits because it has taken them longer than 26 weeks to find a new job. Obviously, most companies are laying off. Imagine not having a job, losing unemployment benefits, and then trying to pay for gas at the pump and food at the grocery store. 
   This Democratic Congress knows it is tougher to find a job when the economy is not producing them. That is why we passed legislation last week giving these workers an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits. 
   In my home State of Texas, there are more than 45,000 workers who have already exhausted their unemployment insurance and 115,000 more that are expected to exhaust their benefits by March of next year. This legislation would help all of these people. But President Bush and his Republican allies here in the House oppose our efforts, even though the President supported a similar extension back in 2002 when the economic situation is not nearly as bad as it is now. 
   Mr. Speaker, millions of American workers need help from this Congress today. Washington Republicans should reconsider their opposition to this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Second Chance Act, and I thank Mr. Davis for introducing this important piece of legislation. 
   In America we have more than 2 million people in prison. Of these, over 600,000 are released each year. Very few of these individuals are prepared to return to their communities or receive support services to ease their transition. 
   These ex-offenders face serious impediments in obtaining employment, and often have serious mental or physical ailments that remain unaddressed. Today, approximately half of all black men are jobless. Amongst ex-offenders this number is even higher. 
   There is a revolving door of ex-offenders into many of our neighborhoods. With few opportunities, two-thirds of all ex-offenders are arrested for new crimes within a few years of their release. We must give these individuals the opportunity to become productive citizens.  
   The Second Chance Act will go a long way towards this goal by providing transitional assistance to ex-offenders reentering their communities. By focusing on the major impediments that face ex-offenders, the Second Chance Act seeks to reduce recidivism and give those reentering society a new opportunity to turn their lives around. This legislation addresses the need for jobs, housing, and substance abuse/mental health treatment, and it works to reunite families and provide the appropriate training and rehabilitation for these individuals. 
   This bill will increase public safety and give millions of ex-offenders a chance to be positive productive citizens. I strongly urge my colleagues' support.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I thank you for consideration of my amendment to H.R. 2419, the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007. 
   My amendment focuses on Title VII, which is the Research Title of the legislation. 
   Specifically, the amendment adds a section to the end of ``Subtitle B,'' which contains provisions pertaining to the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977. 
   The 1977 Act contains Section 1424, authorizing the ``Human Nutrition Intervention and Health Promotion Research Program.'' 
   This is the nutrition research arm of the Department of Agriculture. The program authorizes the Agriculture Secretary to award research grants for human nutrition intervention and health promotion. 
   The 1977 Act describes the ``Emphasis of the Initiative.'' It goes on to say that research projects should emphasize: 
   Coordinated, longitudinal research assessments of nutritional status; and 
   ``The implementation of unified, innovative intervention strategies to identify and solve problems of nutritional inadequacy and contribute to the maintenance of health, well-being, performance, and productivity of individuals, thereby reducing the need of the individuals to use the health care system and social programs of the United States.'' 
   Madam Chairman, my amendment would add one additional point regarding the emphasis of the nutrition research initiative. 
   Emphasis should also be placed on research proposals that examine the efficacy of current agriculture policies in promoting the health and welfare of economically disadvantaged populations. 
   The working poor suffer disproportionately from obesity and its related disorders: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, joint problems, and others. 
   Nutrition research should include matters relating to public health. My amendment specifies that the scope of human nutrition research include grant proposals that study the effectiveness of current agriculture policies in promoting the health of individuals living in poverty. 
   These groups stand to benefit the most from nutrition research. 
   Taxpayer dollars should be invested wisely, Madam Chairman. An investment in analyzing how well the Federal Government's agriculture policies enable Americans to live healthy lives and make good nutrition choices is money well spent. 
   This amendment directs a sharper focus on nutrition research to help the economically disadvantaged. 
   I thank the Chairman for his acceptance of my amendment and urge my colleagues to support it also.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (PROVIDING REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXPENSES INCURRED BY MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE ON LEVEE SAFETY -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6040, introduced by the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Mica, and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources Environment, Mr. Boozman, makes a technical change to title IX of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   Title IX of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 establishes the framework for the creation of the National Levee Safety Program to enhance the safety of levees and those living in levee-protected areas. 
   In the 3 years since hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Nation has refocused its attention to the safety and reliability of flood-control structures and how lives and livelihoods can be affected by their failure. 
   It is especially evident that to our colleagues from the States of Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois, who have been experiencing the challenges of flooding from the Mississippi River and its tributary system over the past few weeks. The Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment has held numerous hearings on the condition of the Nation's levees and other flood-control structures. 
   Throughout these hearings, one consistent theme was readily apparent, the condition of the Nation's flood control infrastructure is, at best, unknown, and in a few notable instances, is in desperate need for repair and upgrading. The subcommittee received testimony from noted experts in flood control infrastructure that of the thousands of miles of Federal, State, local, and privately owned levees, in this country little is known about the current condition, including whether levees were designed to meet current conditions or whether they have been properly maintained by the non-Federal interests.     
   Although rare, failure of flood control structures, such as levees, does occur, and has become more frequent in recent years, and actually, in the last recent weeks. 
   Levees are typically built in a certain location and to a specified height to provide a certain level of protection. However, the level of protection provided by a levee may change with time, due to natural or manmade changes. Natural changes may include land subsidence, sedimentation, vegetative growth in the floodway, or the potential implications of climate change. 
   Land use changes in an area such as upstream development, and the loss of natural upstream storage capacity, can induce hydrologic changes, including faster runoff that will reduce the level of protection provided by a levee. 
   Given the important flood damage reduction and development opportunities provided by levees, it is important for the Nation to understand the true nature and condition of our flood control infrastructure, as well as to develop a comprehensive national policy to address issues related to the construction, operation and maintenance of projects and other management techniques for flood damage reduction. 
   In that light, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure included language in the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 for the creation of a national Committee on Levee Safety. 
   The committee would be chaired by the Corps of Engineers and would include experts from around the Nation, working towards a short-term recommendation to Congress for the creation of an effective and efficient National Levee Safety Program. 
   The House and Senate conferees on the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 agreed on the importance of soliciting the recommendations of the Nation's leading experts in levee safety to aid in the drafting of a future National Levee Safety Program. Whatever recommendations are made by the Committee on Levee Safety, these recommendations will be referred back to the Congress for enactment in future legislation. 
   It is my understanding that the Corps has been working towards the creation of the committee, including the identification of a broad array of experts in levee safety. Unfortunately, the Corps believes it has hit a roadblock due to the specific wording of the authorization language that has prevented the Corps from utilizing available funding to pay for the travel expenses of the committee members. 
   H.R. 6040 is a simple modification to the existing authorization language to ensure that the Corps can utilize already identified funding to pay these expenses so that the Committee on Levee Safety can formally be assembled and begin its important work. 
   I applaud my colleagues on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Ranking Member Mica, and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment for volunteering to move this legislation through the House. 
   It is my hope that the other body can, also, quickly move this legislation to the President's desk so that the Levee Safety Committee can begin its important work and complete it later this summer. 
   I urge adoption of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge Congress to enact legislation to lower gas prices and invest in alternative energy. 
   In Texas, the price of a gallon of gasoline has risen more than $1.05 in the past year. 
   No one drives more than Texans do. With thousands of miles of highways and cities located far from one another, efficient transportation is frequently on our minds. 
   Nationwide, gas prices have risen from $2.20 per gallon in December 2005 to $4.10 per gallon on June 19, 2008, according to the Energy Information Administration, the entity that collects official energy statistics for the United States Government. 
   Gas prices are hurting our local families. Citizens must make tough economic choices because of the crippling effect that high gas prices is having on their lives. 
   Congress must show leadership and take action to address this problem of high gas prices. 
   Congress should work toward the goals of long-term energy solutions that promote economic and environment stability. 
   We should invest in research to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Wind-, solar-, hydrogen-, nuclear-, and geothermal energy sources are all viable options that should be considered. 
   We should mandate stricter fuel economy standards on all automobiles. 
   We should utilize alternative fuels that are environmentally sustainable. 
   We should incentivize the use of public transportation and improve our transportation infrastructure. 
   We should conduct stronger oversight to determine if gas prices are being artificially inflated. 
   My years on the Transportation and on the Science Committees have heightened my sensitivity to this subject of rising gas prices. 
   I have worked to help these committees pass legislation that: 
   Funds research for environmentally-friendly highway materials; 
   Secures dollars for our local transportation infrastructure; and 
   Supports research on alternative fuels, plug-in hybrid cars, hydrogen, ethanol, and other energy sources. 
   In Texas, we spend a lot of time in our cars. High gas prices are particularly impactful to our economy. 
   There is no simple or quick solution to this problem of gas prices, but Congress must show leadership and take action to address it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about my constituents. They are asking for relief from escalating gas prices, and I want to be proactive. 
   The time to act upon this issue is today.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (RAW SEWAGE OVERFLOW COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2452, the Sewage Overflow Community Right-To-Know Act, offered by my colleague on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. Bishop, is an important commonsense proposal to enhance the monitoring and public notification of sewage spills. 
   I applaud Mr. Bishop's work to raise the public's awareness of sewage spills and for his tenacity in bringing together relevant stakeholders on this issue to work through potential differences and produce the fine product under consideration today. I also applaud the work of our colleague, Mr. LoBiondo, for his efforts in supporting and advocating for H.R. 2452. 
   Public notification of sewage overflows is an important topic that has not received the attention it rightly deserves. During committee hearings on this legislation last summer, the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment received testimony on the overwhelming extent of the problem of sewage overflows. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's own numbers, the frequency and volume of annual sewage overflows is staggering. 
   For combined sewage systems, EPA estimates that 850 billion gallons of raw or partially treated sewage is discharged annually into local waters. For separate sanitary sewer systems, EPA estimates that 23- to 75,000 of these sanitary sewage system overflows occur each year in the United States, discharging a total volume of between 3 and 10 billion gallons annually. 
   Worse still is the fact that these sewage overflows can be laden with potentially harmful chemicals, pathogens, viruses, and bacteria and often wind up in local rivers and streams, city streets, parks, or, in unfortunate cases, directly into people's homes. 
   These statistics further emphasize the importance of investment in our Nation's water-related infrastructure. For too long our communities and citizens have been waiting for us to renew our commitment to meeting the water-related infrastructure needs of this country. While the House of Representatives strongly approved legislation to reinvest and rebuild and replace our failing and outdated waste-water treatment infrastructure and sewers, we have faced continued opposition from this administration investing in our Nation's infrastructure. 
   I remain hopeful that we will be able to send legislation to the President this year that will meet the water-related needs that we all know exist and are necessary to ensure the economic and environmental health of our Nation. 
   However, in the interim, we need to make sure that the public is aware of sewage levels to give the individuals the opportunity to stay out of harm's way. It makes no sense for sewage agencies to know where and when overflows are occurring but to avoid making this information readily available to the public. This type of practice defies common sense. Equally troublesome are agencies that lack sufficient monitoring technologies or programs to alert them to the presence of sewage overflows. 
   The legislation under consideration here today is an essential step in protecting the public's health and environment from the dangers of sewage overflows. H.R. 2452, the Sewage Community Right-to-Know Act, is a commonsense approach to enhance the monitoring and notification of sewage overflows to protect human health and the environment. It is also an approach that can be achieved without significant burden to States and local governments. Monitoring and providing public notification on sewage overflows provides the greatest opportunity to avoid direct contact and potentially harmful pollutants as well. 
   Facilities' rapid responses to overflows in order to minimize the potential harm to the environment, this legislation amends the Clean Water Act to ensure that all publicly owned treatment works incorporate enhanced monitoring notification and reporting requirements into the existing permits for those systems under their operational control. 
   Under this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is given 1 year to issue regulations to define the parameters for monitoring and notification to be carried out by the publicly owned treatment works. Following completion of this rulemaking, all publicly owned treatment works are required within a defined time period to incorporate the monitoring and notification criteria from the rulemaking into the existing clean water permits. 
   However, to help minimize potential paperwork concerns, this legislation allows owners and operators to incorporate the enhanced monitoring provisions in their existing permits as such permits come up for periodic renewal modification. 
   To enhance the availability of public information on sewer overflows, H.R. 2452 requires the enhanced notification requirements to take effect 30 days after completion of the rulemaking. The legislation under consideration today is slightly modified from the version that was reported favorably from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on May 15 to address a few technical and transitional concerns that were unresolved before the committee markup. 
   In addition, the bill under consideration today provides a mechanism for States with active notification programs to petition EPA for the ability to carry out the existing notification programs provided that these programs are determined to be functionally equivalent to the national standard for State notification programs called for in this legislation. 
   I commend the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Boozman, and the ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. Mica, and my Chair, Mr. Oberstar,  for working in a bipartisan fashion to resolve all the outstanding issues related to this important legislation. 
   Let me conclude by thanking the following organizations for their efforts in reaching the compromised language that is under consideration today: The American Rivers, the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, the Water Environment Federation and the California Association of Sanitation Agencies. The hard work and willingness of each of these organizations made it possible to reach this agreement and to bring forward this important bipartisan legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Michigan. 
   I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1293, a bill commemorating the lives of three civil rights activists who were murdered outside Philadelphia, Mississippi by the Ku Klux Klan in June of 1964. 
   In 1964, Mississippi had the lowest percentage of registered African American voters in the country. Rampant fear and intimidation, along with literacy tests and poll taxes, had kept more than 90 percent of the African Americans in Mississippi from registering to vote. In June of 1964, thousands of young people volunteered to go to Mississippi in order to register African American voters and fight educational disparities. 
   What would come to be known as ``Freedom Summer'' ignited backlash and violence against these volunteers and civil rights activists. Many homes and black churches were firebombed or burned down that summer, and more than 1,000 volunteers were arrested. Among these Freedom Summer volunteers were James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, who went to Mississippi to investigate the fire-bombing of the Mount Zion Methodist Church. On June 21, these three men were arrested and held for several hours on alleged traffic violations, but later that evening they were taken from the jail and turned over to the Ku Klux Klan, where they were beaten, shot and killed. 
   These men gave their lives in the name of freedom and justice. The media coverage surrounding their deaths sparked outrage amongst Americans, millions of them all over the country. Their deaths and the activities of Freedom Summer helped set the stage for the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
   I would like very much to thank Congressman Lewis for introducing this resolution, who himself has a closer experience than most of us in this body, and as a matter of fact paved the way for many of us to be here today. 
   I thank you, Congressman Lewis, for the many sacrifices you have made. And it is an honor to serve alongside Congressman Lewis, who coordinated the Student Non-Violence Coordinating Committee's efforts to organize voter registration drives and community action programs during Freedom Summer. 
   I strongly support this resolution to honor the sacrifices of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, and all of the volunteers of the Mississippi Freedom Summer who helped to pave the way of voting rights for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Preservation of Records of Servitude, Emancipation, and Post-Civil War Reconstruction Act. 
   The House of Representatives is truly a body of history. Each day we walk through the Capitol and stand where our Nation's first Members of Congress debated hundreds of years ago. Statues, plaques and paintings remind us of the past and inspire our future. In fact, every day history is recorded on the House floor through the records of our statements. 
   We must not underestimate the importance of our Nation's past and our individual history. For many African Americans identifying their history and researching genealogy becomes challenging due to a lack of organized records. Many African Americans are left with piecing together records of their ancestors left from former slave owners or searching for information from the post-Civil War reconstruction. Many of these records are unorganized, inaccessible and quickly decaying. We need a national effort to preserve these pieces of public and personal history or to make them readily and easily accessible to all Americans. 
   Under this bill the Federal Government will maintain an organized system for preserving the records of servitude, emancipation, and the post-Civil War. These records will include Southern Claims Commission Records, Records of the Freedmen's Bank, Slave Impressments Records, Slave Payroll Records, and Slave Manifests. This will go a long way towards preserving our past, and helping individuals discover their history as well. 
   I urge my colleagues who everyday participate in this Nation's history to extend that dedication to preserving our past to vote for this important piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I am pleased to rise to support H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   This bill authorizes water resources projects and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers policy and programmatic changes that our Congress has failed to consider for far too long. 
   Water resources legislation is most effective when it is considered biennially. I support this 2-year cycle, as it provides stability to the program and assurance to the non-Federal sponsors who support Corps projects. 
   When we let them go, they get to be more costly. And, unfortunately, no water resources bill has been enacted since 2000, the entire term of our current administration. This is a result, in part, of a failure of the current administration to engage in this important legislation, as well as a failure of the Congress to reach agreement. 
   Last year, we came very close to resolving our differences with the other body in conference. However, we ultimately ran out of time. I hope this legislation that we consider today can take us to that point and further, releasing this backlog of authorizations to fix our existing infrastructure and  to authorize new flood control, navigation and environmental restoration projects. 
   We are trying very hard to move a little ahead of the next flooding. We must do that. And they are not going to kick out Democrats or Republicans for flooding, it is going to be whoever is in the way. It is purposeful that we have brought this bill to the floor as early as we have in this session. 
   The authorizations in the language are time sensitive, and there should be no surprise that this bill contains a substantial number of provisions. Many of these authorizations have been waiting for action more than 6 years. 
   Within the 110th Congress, the committee intends to move two water resources bill. This first one contains a logjam of more than 6 years of issues. The second bill will consider new projects and policy changes that we were not able to add to this legislation, that we will consider today. This approach may not be traditional, but it is necessary. 
   Since Congress last passed a Water Resources Development Act, we have seen Hurricanes Katrina and Rita tear up the gulf coast and my home State of Texas, flooding cities, damaging economies and businesses, and threatening public health. 
   The Florida Everglades continue to need attention and restoration to save the unique treasures it brings to the State and our country. 
   This bill also contains smaller projects that may be less publicized but just as vital to communities that rely on various water resources for their livelihood. 
   As in the past, these projects were not considered on a partisan basis, but on individual merit. Their approval should not be considered solely on whether they are Democratic projects or Republican projects; these are human projects. They should be considered on their contributions to public safety and economics. 
   H.R. 1495 authorizes programmatic changes to the Corps of Engineers that previously have passed the House, but have stalled in the failed conference negotiations. During the 109th Congress we came close to resolving these differences with the Senate. I urge my colleagues to once again support these provisions. Everybody who has been here more than 6 years ought to know what everything is in this bill because they have seen it over and over and over again. We must engage the other body and together produce the best package for Corps reform. 
   I would like to acknowledge Chairman Oberstar for his leadership and eloquence in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, as well as the interest and expertise that he shares on water resources issues. 
   I also would like to thank our ranking member, Mr. Mica, and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Baker, for their knowledge and effort and partnership with me, and for their support. 
   I strongly support this legislation. I hope and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its final passage. The time is now.

   The manager's amendment reflects project and policy revisions that have come to the attention of the subcommittee that I chair, and the subcommittee of Water Resources Environment.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the late Lamar Hunt, a tireless contributor to the National Football League, NFL, and to the United States. 
   Originally from El Dorado, Arkansas, Lamar Hunt was educated in Texas at Southern Methodist University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology and served as a 3-year reserve end on the varsity football team. 
   At the young age of 27, Hunt persevered through much criticism and founded the Dallas Texans, now known as the Kansas City Chiefs, and facilitated the creation of the American Football League. By undertaking these two tasks, he paved the way for the expansion of professional football. 
   Hunt's impeccable management skills and keen perception of the game propelled him to spearhead groundbreaking developments in the NFL. These developments include, among many others, the installation of the 2-point conversion option and the inclusion of names on the back of game jerseys. Although known for such contributions to the NFL, Hunt's commitment to the community went far beyond the football field. 
   Hunt was an avid supporter of societal betterment, hosting and sponsoring many philanthropic efforts. He made significant financial contributions to higher learning institutions, the Heart of a Champion foundation, and the fine arts, notably the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Museum of Art. 
   In closing, Lamar Hunt was a very special man who touched the lives of many Americans. I am delighted and honored to recognize such a distinguished, forward thinking gentleman, and I urge my colleagues to join me in saluting this remarkable citizen.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment proposes text changes to section 107 of the bill, the section that deals with improved training for health care professionals, medical care case managers and servicemember advocates on particular conditions of recovering servicemembers. 
   As of March 1 of this year, over 24,000 servicemembers have been wounded in action since the onset of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, according to the Department of Defense. The Government Accountability Office has found that servicemembers injured in combat face an array of medical and financial challenges as they begin their recovery process in the health care systems of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veteran Affairs. A GAO report was recently released on March 5 and entitled ``DoD and Va Health Care, Challenges Encountered By Injured Service Members During Their Recovery Process.'' 
   According to the report, Mr. Chairman, the Department of Defense screens servicemembers for post-traumatic stress disorder, but it does not ensure that further mental health evaluations occur. 
   DoD health care providers review questionnaires, interview servicemembers, and use clinical judgment in determining the need for further mental health evaluation. Sadly, DoD found that only 22 percent of the service members who may have been at risk for developing post-traumatic stress syndrome were actually referred by the Defense Department health care providers for further evaluation. In addition, the Defense Department never identified the factors as health care actually used to determine which servicemembers needed the referrals. 
   Although our wounded warriors may obtain mental health evaluations for treatment for post-traumatic stress through the VA, and the VA may face a challenge in meeting the demand for these services, VA officials estimated that follow-ups for veterans to get treatment for this stress syndrome may be delayed up to 90 days. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, I spent my professional career as a psychiatric nurse with the Veterans Administration. I can tell you that we could save time and money if we had the proper people in place to diagnose early, or at least get a referral. We miss a lot of early symptoms that later causes long-term unemployment, long-term financial stress and long-term hospitalization simply because we have not put the well-trained people in place, professional social workers, professional nurses that would diagnose and know that something needs to be done to prevent further deterioration, and that is my reason for bringing this. 
   My 15 years of hands-on inpatient program care were specialized in mental health. And I have my credentials to show that. And my amendment strengthens this section because I feel that more emphasis needs to be made on adequate training by health care professionals to recognize these signs, including suicidal tendencies, so that the early intervention can come, and it will shorten the recovery period. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 335, introduced by my friend and sorority sister, Ms. Diane Watson from California, is a bill to authorize the use of the Capitol Grounds for the 100th anniversary of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, and this anniversary event is scheduled for July 17, 2008. The event coordinators will work with the office of the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board regarding staging the event with all events on the Capitol Grounds, and will be free and open to the public. 
   This sorority was founded on the campus of Howard University 100 years ago. Ms. Diane Watson is a 50-year member. I'm a 35-year life member. And it was founded by nine visionary young women at the time, Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, Anna Easter Brown, Beulah Burke, Lillie Burke, Marjorie Hill, Margaret Flagg Holmes, Lavinia Norman, Lucy Slowe and Marie Woolfolk Taylor. The Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority is the oldest Greek-letter organization established for African American college-trained women. 
   The formation of the sorority during this moment in American history is significant because it helped jump-start a movement of educated African American women who were resolute and determined to eliminate barriers for African Americans at a time when opportunities were limited for minorities. 
   These courageous young women, one generation removed from slavery, were the forebears of an entity that has progressively evolved into an organization of 200,000 plus members and 975 chapters in both the U.S. and abroad. 
   Today, membership in this organization represents a diverse constituency of women, from educators to heads of state, politicians, lawyers, medical professionals, media personalities, decision-makers of major corporations. 
   Built upon the principle of service, scholarship and sisterhood, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority extensively works to improve social and economic conditions through community partnerships and programs. These cornerstone values of the sorority will be on full display in the coming weeks as members, young and old, from across the globe come to our Nation's capital to honor the organization's 100th anniversary. 
   More than 20,000 members of the sorority will converge upon Washington, DC from July 11 until July 18. Members will participate in a variety of empowerment forums, lectures, workshops, community service activities centered on these principles throughout the length of the convention. 
   During this week-long celebration, members will reflect on 100 years of achievement, enjoy the unbreakable bonds of sisterhood, and look to the future as the organization prepares for the challenges of the next 100 years. 
   As a proud member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, I extend my congratulations and very best wishes to all of my sorors as they gather here in our Nation's Capital, birthplace of our sorority, to pay tribute to 100 years of service, scholarship and sisterhood. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this resolution authorizing the use of Capitol Grounds for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 311 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual Soap Box Derby. As all Members are aware, this is an annual event held here on Capitol Hill. Activities planned for this event will be coordinated with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol and, like all events on Capitol Hill grounds, will be free and open to the public. 
   The 2008 Greater Washington Soap Box Derby will take place on Constitution Avenue between Delaware Avenue and Third Streets, Northwest, on June 22.     
   The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby has been held on the U.S. Capitol Grounds since 1991 and has attracted over 60 youth participants in each of those years. 
   In 2007, for the first time in the 66 year history of the D.C. Soap Box Derby, a local participant won the Masters title in the national competition in Akron, Ohio. The All-American Derby Youth Program is administered by the International Soap Box Derby, Incorporated, an Akron-based nonprofit corporation. This is a family-oriented event and is supported by hundreds of parents and volunteers. 
   I urge support for the resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3712 as amended is a bill to designate the Federal building located at 1716 Spielbusch Avenue in Toledo, Ohio, as the ``James M. Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley United States Courthouse''. 
   The late Congressman and Governor James M. Ashley and former Congressman Thomas W.L. Ashley served their Ohio constituents for over 30 years as Members of Congress and Governor. The Ashley family has served with distinction in public service for a span of almost 100 years in the state of Ohio. 
   James Monroe Ashley served five terms as a Republican Congressman from Ohio. Governor Ashley's best known Congressional achievement was as the primary sponsor of the resolution which is recognized as the antecedent of the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery within the United States and its territories. 
   While in Congress, James Ashley also became the chair of the House Committee on Territories, leading the congressional effort to organize Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, Wyoming, and Montana. 
   As chair of the House Committee on Territories, he wrote the enabling act for Nebraska, Colorado, and Nevada on which he conditioned that a separate vote be held by these potential member States that would prevent them from establishing slavery without the consent and approval of Congress. 
   With this measure, Ashley, an avowed abolitionist, signaled that no new slave States would be admitted to the Union. After serving in Congress, James M. Ashley was appointed Governor of Montana in 1869 by President Ulysses S. Grant. 
   Thomas William Ludlow Ashley was the great-grandson of former Governor and Congressman James M. Ashley. Congressman Thomas Ashley served in the United States Army during the Second World War. He went on to graduate first from Yale University in 1948 and from the Ohio State University Law School in 1951. 
   Congressman Ashley later held several positions as a private lawyer and a member of the media. In 1954 Congressman Ashley was elected as a Democrat to Congress and went on to serve a total of 13 terms in Congress. 
   While in Congress, Congressman Ashley served as chairman of the Select Committee on Energy and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. 
   Congressman Ashley also served as the assistant majority whip for the Democratic Party. Congressman Ashley's most prominent legislative success was PL 89-117 which directed the Federal Government to assist in the provision of housing for low and moderate income families. 
   This law was the precursor to the creation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development which was created later in that same Congress. After leaving Congress in 1981, Ashley went on to found a legal and consulting firm in Washington, DC. Congressman Thomas W.L. Ashley currently resides in the Washington, DC area. 
   James Monroe Ashley and Thomas William Ludlow Ashley will be remembered as distinguished public servants to the great State of Ohio. 
   The Ashley family served as leaders in both the Democratic and Republican Party in Ohio and each served their party well.  
   They will be respected as great Americans whose dedication to public service was passed down through the generations. As such, it is very appropriate that the United States Courthouse in Toledo, Ohio, be designated as the ``James M. Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley United States Courthouse''.  
   I recognize the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for as much time as she may consume.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 5599 is a bill to designate the Federal building in Suitland, Maryland, as the Thomas Jefferson Census Bureau Headquarters Building. The bill has bipartisan support. 
   Although Thomas Jefferson is best remembered as the third President of the United States, as the author of the Declaration of Independence, he also is considered by some to be the first director of the U.S. census. 
   In 1790, while Secretary of State, Jefferson conducted the first national census. Although the practice of performing a census has been in practice for thousands of years, the U.S. census in considered to be the first modern periodic census. Several European countries followed suit shortly after in the early 19th century. 
   Today, the results of the census are used to determine the size of congressional districts, the allocation of seats allotted to each State in the U.S. House of Representatives, as a factor in the allocation of Federal resources, and perhaps most importantly as a research tool to track economic and population trends in the United States. 
   It is most fitting and proper that we support this designation and honor one of Jefferson's numerous contributions to our Nation's history. I support H.R. 5599. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 366, expressing the sense of Congress that increasing American capabilities in science, math and technology education should be a national priority. Our Nation's youth are key to our Nation's future prosperity. 
   And I have schools in my district that are ranking very high; 1, 2, 3 and 4. They've been 1 and 2 and now they're 2 and 4. That's called the Townview Gifted and Talented school, ranked second in the Nation; was considered the best public school last year in the nation. And the Science and Engineer Magnet was ranked fourth this year, and it was number 2 last year by Newsweek magazine. 
   Townview's School of Talented and Gifted was always ranked among the best high schools in America, and this year, by the U.S. News and World Report. 
   In support from the high tech industry such as Texas Instruments in Dallas, as well as other local generous investors which have been critical to setting up the schools for the students' success. Unfortunately, few schools demonstrate the educational excellence of Townview, not even any more in Dallas. Congress must incentivize investments at the local level to help improve the quality of public education. 
   The UTeach Program, which started in Texas and headquartered at the University of Texas in Austin, is a terrific education program that places engaged, highly trained teachers in the classroom. These educators, in turn, inspire their students. Young people are learning that math and science are fun. They're learning that these subjects are important, and that they can lead to fulfilling and profitable careers. 
   UTeach is funded partially by generous investments from the private sector which needs these people for future employment. So we consider it an investment for them. 
   UTeach has tracked the success of its educational model, and it is transforming the quality of math and science education in schools that it touches. Demonstrated methods of success must be supported and expanded, and this is critical for our Nation. 
   Tomorrow's high-tech jobs will require a skilled workforce. Today's students are not being adequately prepared for these jobs, and it is my fear that businesses will increasingly look toward China, Taiwan, Japan and India for their workforce needs. Those nations are investing a greater percentage of their gross national product on the education of scientists, mathematicians and engineers. They're producing a large workforce of bright, young, talented individuals who work for less money than our citizens will. American companies are already hiring them. And the only solution is to produce a better prepared work force. The root of that preparation is education. And it is too serious and too important not to give the utmost attention. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wish that every school could get the support and perform as well as Townview does. But my resolution expresses a sense of Congress that we must make education a much higher national priority. 
   A couple of years ago there was a publication by the National Academies of Science and Medicine and the National Science Foundation entitled the Rising Tide Before the Gathering Storm. Well, the gathering storm of international competition is already here, and so we must reform our public education policies, provide greater challenges to our students and give young people the tools and opportunities that they need to succeed. Our economy in this country depends on this; and we start with well-prepared teachers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 1180, recognizing the efforts and contributions of outstanding women scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians in the United States and around the world. 
   In its 2007 Beyond Bias and Barriers report, the National Academy stated that in order to maintain its scientific and engineering leadership and increasing economic and educational globalization the United States must aggressively pursue the innovative capacity of all of its people, men and women. 
   While women have made substantial progress in some fields, such as the life sciences, they continue to be significantly underrepresented in other STEM fields such as engineering and computer science. The attrition rate remains higher for women than for men at all steps along the STEM pipeline. In fact, studies have shown that girls as young as middle school age are being turned away from many STEM fields. 
   There is no evidence that the gender gap is caused by a lack of female talent or potential. In fact, the top three winners in the highly prestigious 2007 Siemens Competition in Math, Science and Technology and the first prize in the 2008 Intel Talent Search all went to young high school women. 
   We are failing our young girls and women, and neither our colleges and universities nor our industries can afford such a loss of precious human capital in science and engineering. We can't make it with just 50 percent of the Nation's brain power. 
   I applaud the gentleman from Washington for introducing this resolution. It is fitting to recognize the efforts and contributions of outstanding women scientists and engineers and mathematicians in the United States and around the world, and I ask my colleagues to support House Resolution 1180.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have serious reservations about H.R. 4. I am not convinced this provision will do anything to really help lower the price of prescription drugs. I will reluctantly vote for H.R. 4 because it is a priority for the Speaker. 
   I would like to submit an article into the RECORD published yesterday morning in the Washington Post. 
   The article points out the faulty approach in comparing the Veterans Administration with Medicare Part D, when it comes to drug price negotiations. 
   While the V.A. is able to offer significant savings in drug prices, it offers a limited formulary. Also, the VA--by law--receives an automatic 24 percent discount from the average price that wholesalers pay. 
   Comparing Medicare Prescription Drugs to the V.A. system is apples to oranges. I have not seen convincing evidence that the proposal will be effective. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must do better. We must do more. 
   In my opinion, this bill (H.R. 4) leads the seniors to believe that we are doing something for them. If we are serious, we would address the ``donut hole.''

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Johnson-Young amendment to expand higher education opportunities for the children of fallen soldiers. 
   Since the year 2001, more than 4,400 U.S. servicemembers have died during their deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan. Historically, war has cost America the lives of our sons and daughters. However, the soldiers serving today in Iraq and Afghanistan are not just single men; 40 percent of the servicemembers in Iraq are married and 30 percent have children. The soldiers we have lost are not only our sons and daughters, but our husbands and wives and fathers and mothers. 
   As we reflect on the cost of this war, we must realize that many of these brave young men and women have left families and young children behind. These young men and women include Sergeant Paul Sanchez, a native of Irving, Texas, who was killed last January by an IED in Iraq, leaving behind a wife, a 12-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son; and Second Lieutenant John Craver who was killed in October 2006 in Baghdad. A native of McKinney, Texas, he left behind a wife and three children. As well as Specialist Jessica Cawvey, who was killed in Fallujah in 2004. She was a 21-year-old single mother and left behind a 6-year-old daughter. These are just a few of more than 2,100 children who have lost a parent in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The death of a parent is not only emotionally devastating for a child but often creates financial hardships for their family. The Johnson-Young amendment offers financial assistance and access to higher education for children who lost a parent or guardian as a result of this war. It allows the children who have been left behind to have access to a maximum Pell Grant award. Through this Pell Grant award, we can offer a chance for a bright future for the children of those brave young men and women who gave their lives in the name of service for our country.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and thanks to Mr. Skelton, the outstanding Congressman from Missouri. 
   I rise to support H.R. 2956. If we could stop this war today, it would please my constituents. And if we could do it without more violence, I would be picketing to do it. 
   All of us know, that have any common sense, that we cannot bring the troops home today, but we can develop a good strategy to make sure that they get the message in Iraq that we are coming home. We still have 150,336 troops over there. Are we going to stay until they all get killed? 
   We talk about how many have lost lives. I was a nurse in the Veterans' Administration for 15 years, and I saw the damaged lives of these veterans coming home from war. What are we doing for ourselves and the future? This is not a partisan issue, this is an issue that saves America.  
   Mr. Speaker, the most recent report from the Department of Defense, states there are 150,336 brave American troops in the middle of a violent civil war in Iraq. 
   Meanwhile, the President has repeatedly made it clear that nothing will discourage him from pursuing a war that has no end in sight. 
   Congress cannot and should not keep waiting for the President to change course. 
   We must change the course ourselves, 2008 must be a year of transition in Iraq. Iraq has to grow out of the shadow of the United States. 
   Iraq needs to take responsibility for its own decisions, learn from its own mistakes, and find its own solutions to its own problems. 
   Recently, the Iraq Study Group suggested that the time has since passed when one country alone could work alongside the Iraqi leadership to steer Iraq's future. 
   Rather, as the report says, ``the United States should immediately launch a New Diplomatic Offensive to build an international consensus for stability in Iraq and the region.'' 
   This recommendation is perhaps the last- best hope for war weary Iraqis and Americans alike. 
   Mr. Speaker, our brave men and women are serving with great honor in Iraq. Their service has paved the way for a democratic society. 
   It is time for the Iraqi government to stand up, so our troops can begin to stand-down. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act. The GIVE Act will expand the Corporation for National and Community Service which has been instrumental in helping connect Americans to high quality, meaningful service and service-learning opportunities. The GIVE Act will increase the benefits of service available to more participants and more communities, improve program quality, ensure participant diversity, increase the value of the AmeriCorps education award, and reduce the age eligibility for Senior Corps to 55. 
   In the last 14 years more than 500,000 individuals have served through AmeriCorps and have earned education awards worth more than $1.5 billion. Senior Corps members have generated more than 1 billion volunteer service hours, and more than 15 million young people have participated in service-learning initiatives funded by Learn and Serve America. In addition, the national service programs have provided opportunities for growing numbers of Americans to serve our Nation. 
   Since AmeriCorps was created in 1994, Texas has benefited from over 22,000 young people serving for at least 1 year in our communities. Through programs such as the ``National Civilian Community Corps'' and ``City Year,'' AmeriCorps volunteers address critical Texas needs in the areas of education, public safety, disaster response and recovery, and environment preservation. These programs serve the important role of providing an outlet for service to the country in a manner previously not afforded.  
   Mr. Chairman, the AmeriCorps program has done great things for Texas and this Nation as a whole, as is reflected in the AmeriCorps members pledge to ``get things done.'' I am indeed honored to support this wonderful program which represents the very best of the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6532, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore the Highway Trust Fund balance. 
   Our Nation's highway trust fund serves as the lifeblood for funding our Nation's transportation infrastructure. Regrettably, the fund is facing an imminent shortfall due to decreased revenue into the fund. This shortfall comes at a most inopportune time as many states across the country are struggling to provide funding just for adequate highway maintenance--let alone new construction.  
   The bill before us is important to my home State, as Texas has one of the most extensive surface transportation networks in the world. Texas has more than 10,000 miles of rail track; more than 300,000 miles of roadway and more than 50,000 bridges--more than any other state in the Nation. Our transportation network is bursting at the seams, and failure to enact this bill render a significant blow to transportation construction and maintenance jobs across my State. We simply cannot allow this to happen. In the absence of passage of H.R. 6532, the State of Texas stands to lose $859 million in funding and a projected loss of 30,000 good-paying jobs. 
   The state has identified a funding gap of $86 billion between available resources and what is needed to achieve an acceptable level of mobility by 2030. By the year 2030, TXDOT predicts the state's population is expected to increase by 64 percent. My State cannot afford a lapse in receiving its share of Federal highway funding made available by SAFETEA-LU. 
   In the absence of bold and decisive action by this body in the next highway bill authorization, stagnant transportation policy and inadequate funding will cripple our country. It is past time for government at all levels to make investment in transportation infrastructure an urgent priority. 
   Madam Speaker I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3999, the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act. 
   Madam Chairman, I believe it goes without saying that not only the State of Texas, but all of America stood in solidarity with Minnesota on August 1, 2007, after the tragic 1-35 bridge collapse. 
   Since this unfortunate tragedy, our Chairman, Mr. Oberstar, has worked tirelessly to aid his State and the Nation to ensure that priority attention is given to the state of our country's aging transportation infrastructure. 
   Texans are intimately familiar with Interstate 35, as roughly one-third of the overall length of the interstate exists within Texas' borders. 
   The State of Texas--with roughly fifty-thousand bridges--has roughly forty percent more bridges than any other State in the nation. 
   To its credit, the State of Texas has one of the most aggressive bridge programs in the country. As a testament to this aggressiveness, only four percent of the State's bridges are categorized as structurally deficient. In spite of this success, Texas is facing enormous and rapidly increasing transportation needs. 
   Increases in population, trade growth, and travel in state have placed unprecedented demands on an under invested system. 
   Based on Texas's annual Report on Texas Bridges for 2006, Texas has approximately thirty-three thousand on-system bridges. Twenty-one percent of these were built before 1950 and fifty-four percent have been in service for more than three decades. 
   The bridges that are, or will be, structurally deficient, functionally obsolete, or sub-standard for load only in the coming years must also be improved to ensure design standards are current and up to date. 
   According my State Department of Transportation, 282 bridges categorized as structurally deficient are currently being rehabilitated or replaced. Another 1,303 bridges classified as structurally deficient are under development as part of the State's ten-year Unified Transportation Plan. The State's remaining 439 bridges classified as structurally deficient are not currently scheduled for rehabilitation or replacement, and no funding has been identified for them. 
   The need for additional funds and resources for inspections, maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges is desperately needed in Texas and it is my hope this bill is able to assist my State in a measurable way. 
   Recently in my congressional district a 2-foot-by-2-foot hole emerged in an eastern span of the Interstate-30 Bridge in Dallas. According to my State DOT, in addition to the disruption to commuters, the bill just to rectify a 2-foot-by-2-foot hole will cost upwards of $1.4 million dollars. 
   As a country we are falling behind other industrialized nations tremendously in upgrading our Nation's infrastructure. It is imperative that government at all levels begin to make transportation investment an urgent priority. 
   Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation and yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2537, the Beach Protection Act of 2007. This legislation extends the authorization of appropriations for the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act, the BEACH Act, through 2012. First signed into law in October 2000, the BEACH Act has provided States, local governments and tribes vital funding for assessment and public notification programs that monitor our coastal waters. 
   Over the years, the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment has held numerous hearings on EPA's BEACH program. In fact, the history of the BEACH Act goes back to 1990 when Congressman William Hughes of New Jersey first introduced the Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure and Health Act of 1990. I applaud his vision for effective coastal water quality criteria and public notification, as well as the efforts of Congressman Pallone and Congressman Bishop, the primary sponsors of this legislation, to carry forward this legacy. 
   As reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the Beach Protection Act of 2007 increases the annual authorization level for State and local monitoring and notification grants by $10 million and expands the eligible uses for grants under  this program. For example, H.R. 2735 allows States to utilize a portion of their BEACH grant funding to develop and implement pollution source identification and tracking programs for coastal recreation waters, which will enable interested States to locate the likely sources of coastal water contamination. 
   H.R. 2537 also encourages the development and implementation of rapid testing methods for determining where and when coastal recreational waters exceed coastal water quality criteria. These rapid testing methods are designed to ensure that the public is notified of potential harmful recreational waters within a few hours, rather than days as under the current system. This provision will have a significant impact on efforts to protect the public from coming into contact with potentially harmful pollutants and contaminants at their favorite beaches. 
   In addition, H.R. 2537 enhances existing public notification requirements, including making beach warnings and closures available on the Internet. The bill clarifies that the public must be notified within 24 hours of the authority receiving results of contaminated water quality samples. However, because many States utilize a system where two contaminated samples must be identified before a beach is closed, H.R. 2537 also requires that a physical sign must be posted at any beach where the results of a water quality sample demonstrate the likelihood that the water may be contaminated. Again, providing more information and notice on the condition of the Nation's coastal water quality is essential to ensure that the public can avoid contact with potentially harmful pollutants while visiting their favorite beach. 
   The bill also enhances EPA's review of individual States' compliance with the requirement of the BEACH Act by requiring the Administrator to conduct an annual review of implementation of the BEACH Act by State and local governments and to take corrective action if State and local governments are not in compliance with BEACH Act requirements. It also requires the Government Accountability Office to audit EPA's administration of the BEACH Act. 
   Finally, the bill requires EPA to conduct annual compliance reviews of State and local BEACH programs. 
   Later today I plan to offer a bipartisan manager's amendment to the bill to address several technical recommendations made by the Environmental Protection Agency and others that will improve the bill. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the manager's amendment and the underlying legislation that I believe will make significant improvement to EPA's BEACH program. 
   Much of our efforts are to provide additional safeguards for our families to make sure that they do not come into contact with potentially harmful pollutants and contaminants along the Nation's coastlines. I believe this legislation accomplishes what we tried to do. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chairman, this amendment is a proposed solution in search of a problem. The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act, or the BEACH Act, which this legislation amends, was introduced to limit and prevent human exposure to polluted coastal recreation waters, including those along the Great Lakes. 
   The initial BEACH Act authorized $30 million annually to assist States and local governments to implement beach monitoring, assessment and public notification programs. 
   Funds authorized under the initial BEACH Act and under the legislation we consider today go either to the Environmental Protection Agency or are distributed to individual States on a formula basis. 
   Each State receives a portion of annual appropriations which have hovered around $10 million based upon a calculation of the State's variant beach monitoring and notification needs. 
   The committee is aware of the concerns that the current formula utilized by EPA for the distribution of grant funds may not provide for an equitable allocation of funds among States at current appropriation levels. 
   Section 9 of this legislation requires EPA to conduct a study of potential revisions to the formula with a specific focus on base costs to States of developing and maintaining water quality monitoring and notification programs, the State's varied beach monitoring and notification needs, including beach mileage, beach usage and length of beach season and other factors that the administrator determines to be appropriate. 
   None of the funds appropriated under this legislation go out to the States or local communities under a ``congressional earmark.'' 
   This amendment has no bearing on the authorities under the BEACH Act or EPA's beach program. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1154, a resolution to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D. 
   Dr. DeBakey has been a dedicated public servant, especially to veterans. 
   The developments in organ transplant medicine developed by him have enabled millions of people to lead happy and productive lives. 
   Early in life, he volunteered for military service during World War II, joining the Surgeon General's staff and rising to the rank of Colonel and Chief of the Surgical Consultants Division. His recommendations led to advances in mobility military medicine and earned him the Legion of Merit in 1945. 
   His work contributed to the ultimate development of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center System and the establishment of the Commission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National Research Council. 
   Mr. Speaker, I served as Chief Psychiatric Nurse at the V.A. Hospital in Dallas and have 15 years of experience in hands-on patient care. 
   Medical follow-up after active service is extremely important for our veterans. 
   Dr. DeBakey's intelligence, dedication and other talents were directed early in his career to assist men and women serving in our military. 
   For decades, his innovations in cardiovascular medicine revolutionalized the field and have forever changed the way surgery is conducted. 
   Many millions who will never know him have Dr. DeBakey to thank for pioneering surgical techniques that have saved their lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a Texan, I have great pride for our own Dr. Michael DeBakey. It is fitting for the U.S. House of Representatives to honor him in this way. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of America who want a new way forward in Iraq and expect Congress to act accordingly. 
   My constituents in North Texas continue to grieve the loss of their sons and daughters in Iraq and voice their utmost concerns for our troops' safety. They deserve answers from me and from our government regarding the consequence of the monetary and casualty cost of the Iraq war. 
   Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have affected the lives of countless Americans. There are over 3,000 troops from the great state of Texas that have been wounded during duty and many thousands more from across the United States. 
   Despite the struggles our soldiers face both on the field and the home front, they are thankful for the support they have been receiving from their fellow Americans. They share their concerns none of which are for themselves, but of their fellow comrades and families. If given a chance, they are willing to return to the field and fight for this nation. I stand here today, humbled by these men and women. 
   The current administration has recently submitted data reflecting that violence in Iraq has decreased, but this data has been skewed. The data does not reflect the truth. Violence in Iraq has increased. 
   It is our responsibility to care for the best interest of our soldiers. It is our responsibility to protect our troops from unnecessary harm. Our men and women in uniform are owed a debt of gratitude for their courageous efforts. A failure to bring about democracy in Iraq rests solely on the shoulders of the President and his Administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, a great American military cannot be a substitute for a weak Iraqi government. Americans want a new direction in Iraq. The best way to support our troops serving in Iraq is to bring them home.

   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to recognize the goals and ideals of Federal Credit Union Month. Credit unions across the United States have been a vital component to economic growth and empowerment. 
   This month is intended to bring awareness to credit union's impact on the economy and the tremendous service they provide to their members. Our federal credit unions play an important role in the lives of many Americans, my district in Dallas, TX, included. Credit unions offer the chance for its members to participate in their financial lives as owners, rather than just account holders. 
   Credit unions help communities and families achieve their part of the American Dream by offering financial services and banking opportunities that many members would otherwise be denied with a privately owned institution. These opportunities enhance stability and affordability in ownership and security for credit union members. 
   Mr. Speaker, federal credit unions remain an important financial institution for many of our Nation's hard working people. It is important that we as a body continue to articulate support for our Nation's federal credit unions. As a loyal member of a federal credit union I strongly support the goals and ideas this month promotes.

   The financial service industry has an extraordinary impact on the country, including my home district of Dallas, TX. While many industries have successfully created a diverse workplace, the financial service industry has fallen short, creating an unacceptable disparity for minorities and women. As a society, it is our responsibility to promote the diversity in the workplace and ensure confidence in any individual's ability to succeed at all levels. 
   In order to raise awareness and combat these disparities, we must furnish all children a first class education. Education is the vital threshold in expanding opportunities to qualified candidates, regardless of their race or sex. The Financial Services Diversity Initiative enforce fairness and accountability to all educational and employment sectors. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a person of color and a woman, I know first hand the importance of equality and diversity. I strongly support the Financial Services Diversity Initiatives which offers to eliminate the inequality among minorities and women in the financial services industry.

   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007. This important legislation would reauthorize appropriations of $125 million for the EPA's alternative water sources grant program. 
   Mr. Chairman, rapid population growth and development along with an increased awareness of the impact of massive water withdrawals and the threat of global climate change have forced many local communities to explore alternative sources of water. 
   H.R. 700 provides one alternative for meeting these future water needs by encouraging the testing and implementation of technology that reclaim and reuse water from municipal, industrial and agricultural needs. 
   I applaud the efforts of my colleagues on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Congressman McNerney and Congresswoman Tauscher, for their efforts in moving this legislation forward and ensuring that communities are able to meet current and future water needs. 
   This committee approved similar legislation in the 109th Congress, and it is my hope this year Congress will finally approve legislation and forward it to the President for his signature.

<TEXT>
   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price), almost to say the same thing we said yesterday: He has gotten the appropriations mixed up with the authorization. 
   This is an authorization committee, and actual funding of these programs through the appropriations process, which is where this will be more appropriate. A similar manner it was offered yesterday, as we said, to H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act, and was defeated by 166-260. 
   This amendment would require that any authorization of appropriations be considered with corresponding offsets regardless of whether the program ever receives any funding. It is possible that it won't. 
   In the example of the Alternative Water Source pilot program under consideration today, a program that again has never been funded through the appropriations process, this amendment would require the identification of $125 million in offsets, regardless of whether appropriations are ever enacted for this program. 
   During the first few days of the legislative session, the new Democratic majority renewed the PAYGO rules to require the identification of offsets to any changes in direct spending by legislative initiatives. 
   This bill has no effect on direct spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office in its analysis of the bill, enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues. Therefore, the offset requirements of PAYGO are never triggered. 
   I also remind my colleagues that the PAYGO provision was allowed to expire under Republican control of the House, with no attempt by the former Republican leadership to restore its protections to the Federal budgetary process. To now claim to be the champions of fiscal responsibility and attempt to hold Congress to stricter budgetary principles than instituted under their own leadership is a fairly hollow argument. 
   The gentleman's amendment would require offsets for any authorization of appropriations, regardless of its impact on Federal receipts. Were the gentleman's amendment adopted, my expectation is that every authorization of appropriations, whether it be for clean water, safer schools, better health care, or national defense, would require equal offsets. This is an inappropriate limitation on the ability of Congress to address the needs of the Nation. 
   Fiscal responsibility is a noble cause, but not at the cost of hindering Congress's ability to meet the needs of our constituents. 
   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment.
