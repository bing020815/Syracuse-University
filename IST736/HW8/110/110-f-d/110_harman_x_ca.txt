<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership. I also commend many on the other side, including Mr. Hoekstra, for their devotion to getting intelligence right. 
   I hope we have bipartisan agreement on the subject before us. But, Madam Speaker, I feel compelled to correct the record. Last night in his State of the Union address, the President said: ``If Congress does not act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens could be in greater danger.'' 
   As a Member who worries 24/7 about terrorist threats against our country, I strongly object to that statement. It is inaccurate and yet again a bald-faced attempt to play the fear card and to jam Congress into gutting a carefully crafted, three-decades old bipartisan law called FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   FISA, Madam Speaker, does not expire on Friday. Only the hastily cobbled together Protect America Act amendments to FISA expire on Friday. 
   This country will not go dark on Friday. Our government has aggressively used surveillance tools, and in the past year or so secured warrants in compliance with FISA. Those warrants do not expire on Friday. 
   As for the claim that citizens will be in greater danger, in my view actions that fail to follow the laws Congress passes and ignore the requirements of the fourth amendment put our democracy in grave danger. 
   Madam Speaker, security and liberty are not a zero-sum game. 
   In October, the House passed thoughtful legislation, the RESTORE Act, to replace the flawed Protect America Act. Once the Senate acts later this week and the House has had adequate time to review documents concerning activities of telecommunications firms, we should conference our bill. Fifteen days is a good estimate of how long it will take to send a responsible bill to the President. Let's act responsibly. Vote ``aye.''

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I applaud my chairman, the bill's sponsors, and the bill's many supporters on a bipartisan basis for bringing such important legislation to the House floor today. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is personal for me. Both of my parents are part of the statistics; both of them died from lung cancer from smoking. 
   As a mother of four and a grandmother of three so far, I am relentless in urging that they and everyone else's kids and grandkids not acquire this horrible addiction. 
   In California, 138,000 children try a cigarette for the first time each year, and more than one-third of them become regular daily smokers. Some will die as my parents did, slowly and painfully. In my mother's case, though she knew of her dire health prognosis, she never quit smoking. 
   I think this bill sets the right balance. It's probably as much as we can get through Congress--if we can get it through--at this time, though I would support more and will support more in the future. 
   The bill reinstates an FDA rule that restricts tobacco marketing and sales to children. In today's consumer culture, children are most vulnerable to attractive marketing campaigns. Tobacco's campaign has been very successful. 
   The bottom line is we need to put a stop on creating new tobacco users. The bill also requires enhanced labeling of health warnings on product packaging. More effective labeling will better educate the public on the dangerous consequences of tobacco. Given the state of our economy, it is foolhardy to load on health costs that we know--as even the bill's opponents have said--come from those addicted to smoking. 
   California spends almost $10 billion treating tobacco-related diseases each year. This is critical funding that we need elsewhere. 
   With the passage of the legislation today, we can prevent this. I urge an ``aye'' vote.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, while the process has been difficult, this rule is worthy of support, and the underlying bill is a test of our will to solve the cataclysmic challenge of our time: global warming. 
   This rule and this bill give us many tools, from fuel efficiency to alternative fuels to renewable energy standards. They also incorporate thoughtful, thorough appliance efficiency standards reported on a bipartisan basis by the Commerce Committee and previously enacted by this House. 
   As co-author with Fred Upton of the light bulb provisions, let me underscore how important they are. In this bill, we ban, by 2012, the famously inefficient 100-watt incandescent bulb, which emits 10 percent of its energy as light and wastes the remaining 90 percent. Sounds like this House. We phase out remaining inefficient bulbs by 2014, and by 2020 light bulbs will be three times more efficient, paving the way for the use of superefficient LEDs manufactured in the U.S. by 2020. 
   Mr. Speaker, it takes 18 seconds to change a light bulb and even less time to vote ``aye.''  
   Importantly, the bill gives the Department of Energy the authority to craft a rule to give the lighting industry the flexibility to sell a range of bulbs, but there are protections. The rule must save as much energy as a flat requirement that all bulbs be 3 times more efficient than today's bulbs. And if DOE doesn't get its act together, the flat requirement will automatically became law. 
   Though I believe that Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs (CFLs) are an important technology, the intent of these standards is that at no time will CFLs be the only lighting choice available to American consumers. The bill also requires that DOE find ways to minimize the amount of mercury in CFLs and provides incentives for high-efficiency lighting to be manufactured in the United States. 
   I would like to thank Senators Bingaman, Boxer and Congressman Upton (who has been my partner in all things light bulbs) for their tireless work on these provisions. 
   Finally, I'd like to thank Jay Hulings, my Legislative Director and Committee staff--notably John Jimison on the House side, and Deborah Estes on the Senate side--for their long hours and dedication to getting this job done.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Harman-Ehlers amendment and the underlying authorizing legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, I represent the heart of the aerospace industrial base,  and have long called my district the ``satellite center of the universe.'' 
   I have always been mindful of the need for a skilled and diverse industrial base. Simply put, rocket scientists don't grow on trees. 
   Earlier this year, on a visit to a major aerospace firm in my district there was a stark reminder of the crisis facing that industry. Following a briefing on an important satellite program, I asked if any the employees in attendance had anything else to tell me. A 31-year old engineer raised his hand and said, ``all my peers are gone.'' Engineers his age, he explained, are leaving the aerospace industry for other fields, and very few are interested in taking their place. 
   The problem is twofold. More than 60 percent of the aerospace industry workers are over 45, and 26 percent of them are eligible for retirement in 2008. And, as a Nation, we have failed to inspire our kids, particularly girls, to go into STEM fields, science, technology, engineering and math. 
   There just isn't a pool of qualified workers for NASA and others to draw from. The result is a looming demographic cliff that leaves NASA and the industry without the intellectual capital necessary to keep pace with global competitors. 
   But the problem extends beyond NASA. The United States depends on this industrial base to give us the capabilities on the ground, in the air and in space that are essential to the way we wage war, collect intelligence and protect our homeland. This looming workforce shortfall could cripple not only NASA's ability to reach its goals, it could deal a serious blow to our national and our economic security. 
   The Harman-Ehlers amendment expresses the sense of Congress that a skilled workforce is essential to NASA's success, and that NASA should work cooperatively with other government agencies to sustain and expand a diverse workforce. 
   Madam Chairman, almost 50 years ago President Kennedy inspired a whole generation of Americans. American talent and ingenuity put a person on the moon in a decade. We need that kind of ambitious goal to inspire the next generation to be scientists, engineers and astronauts. 
   If we fail to dream big, to ask our kids to imagine a future beyond our humble planet, they will pursue other fields. There will be no one to invent the technologies and programs on which NASA's success and our national security depend. That future, Madam Chairman, is unacceptable. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote for the Harman-Ehlers amendment, and would like to thank my coauthor, VERN EHLERS, a senior member of the Science Committee, who did seminal work in this field, is a true leader in this field, and a valued partner. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Chairman, in closing the debate on this amendment, I would just observe that during my first two terms in Congress, in the last century, I served on the Science Committee. It's a great committee. And I commend the current chairman, Mr. Gordon, for enormous leadership. He is fast and swift, and on his game. And this is probably the most important work we will do for our children and grandchildren. And as a grandmother of three, I want one of those children, like Mr. Feeney's wife, to want to be an aerospace worker.     
   I hope that one of them chooses that occupation. I hope it's there for them. 
   This amendment, the Harman-Ehlers amendment, is our effort to keep this  potential alive, to make sure that our best and brightest kids want to do this work, and then that hopefully our dreams remain big and putting a person on the moon is just a first step to surveying the heavens in ways we can't even imagine. 
   So on behalf of dreamers, on behalf of an extraordinary industrial base, much of it in California's 36th Congressional District, and on behalf of three little grandchildren whom I love dearly, I urge an ``aye'' vote for the Harman-Ehlers amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Chairman, I hope there is no one opposed. I offer this amendment with Mr. Upton, Mr. Lipinski and Mr. Inglis of South Carolina in order to help the government set an example for the rest of the country by purchasing energy-efficient light bulbs. 
   Mr. Chairman, existing law requires Federal agencies to buy products that meet Department of Energy, Energy Star or Federal Energy Management program standards. This amendment adds teeth to that standard, stating that no funds may be used to purchase any light bulb that does not meet it. Identical language has already been adopted in prior appropriations bills. Our intention is to offer this amendment as the Upton-Harman amendment on the next appropriations bill and to continue this until we are through the appropriations cycle. 
   Our bottom line is: The Federal Government must set the example. This is already the law, but it needs to be the practice as well. 
   Let me close with the fact that incandescent bulbs, which are used by most Americans, are 10 percent efficient. This sounds like Congress. I think our goal ought to be much greater efficiency here in this body, and much greater efficiency with respect to the lighting that we use. It takes 18 seconds to change a light bulb. It will take more time than that to change Congress. But it is my hope that this amendment will pass attached to every appropriations bill. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Michigan.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, California is poised to join several other States in requiring its huge pension funds to disinvest in Iran. The decision is bipartisan. I commend my State's Democratic legislature and Republican Governor for this bold move. 
   So, H.R. 1400 too, is a bold bipartisan move, and I urge its passage. It tightens enforcement of U.S. sanctions, which are working; it conditions future nuclear cooperation with Russia on that country's ceasing its nuclear ties with Iran; and it designates Iran's Revolutionary Guards, who have long carried out terrorist acts in Iraq and the region, as a terror organization. 
   Mr. Speaker, Los Angeles, California, is home to over 800,000 Iranian Americans. In fact, it's called sometimes the ``Tehrangeles.'' I understand that, because we have such a large population. Our fight, however, is not with the ``Tehrangelenos,'' and it surely is not with the Iranian people either; but our fight, and we must continue it, is against the threats and the actions of the extreme regime in Iran who threaten our Democratic ally Israel and who threaten the entire world with the prospect of a nuclear bomb. 
   Coercive sanctions are working. H.R. 1400 will add new tools to those sanctions. This is the right way for this country to speak out and the right way for this country to achieve results.

I thank the gentleman for yielding, and commend him for the role that he is playing on a bipartisan basis to assure that existing standards, the ENERGY STAR standards and the Federal Energy Management Program standards are adhered to. This effort that we're making on every appropriations bill will ensure that our practice complies with our law. 
   I agree with him that CFLs offer much more efficiency. There are also LEDs. And hopefully the incandescent bulb makers in America will adjust their own manufacturing so that they produce efficient light bulbs as well. 
   Another bill that we're all cosponsoring that's pending in the Energy Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce will provide incentives to U.S. manufacturers to produce more efficient lighting and set proper goals. 
   Finally, I want to say that bipartisanship has been hailed all morning. It takes 270 Members of Congress and 60 Members of the Senate and hopefully one willing President to change the light bulb policy, and I think we're proceeding that way this morning.

   We are not choosing winners in this effort. But surely, everyone must understand that it takes 18 seconds to change a light bulb. This is something all of us can do quite quickly, except you have to comply with the House procedures that we just heard about.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation and salute the bill's sponsor, BARBARA LEE from California, as a courageous and clear voice in this Congress. 
   It's interesting listening to this debate that there seems to be no disagreement about a resolution that will help build stability in Iraq, as others have said. It will make clear that the U.S. is not an occupying force, and it will deny al Qaeda a key recruiting tool. 
   It is also clear that we are not prohibiting a U.S. presence in the region, even a U.S. temporary presence in Iraq. We have bases in other neighboring countries and the Middle East, and we will have an over-the-horizon force. 
   I'm really surprised that not only is the White House refusing to follow the law, but those senior White House officials with whom I've spoken numerous times about this issue all seem to agree we don't need a permanent military presence, and yet, stubbornly, they refuse to make clear that we won't have one. 
   Pass this resolution. Let's do the right thing. Congress, as an article I body, needs to get this White House to follow the law.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (VIOLENT RADICALIZATION AND HOMEGROWN TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding to me, and I thank my ranking member, Mr. Reichert, for his generous remarks. 
   Madam Speaker, on 9/11 we were attacked by foreigners who had come to this country legally. The next time and, sadly, I believe there will be a next time, my assumption is that many who attack us will already be here, and some will be U.S. citizens. Homegrown terror is a phenomenon many countries are scrambling to understand, including the British, as they are under major threat from it. Theirs is a peculiar kind with a large Pakistani population that is not well assimilated. 
   But America has a problem too, unique in nature, and we fail to understand it at our peril. Far from being immune to the danger of homegrown terror, think Timothy McVeigh or Theodore Kaczynski, the threat today is infinitely greater and more likely to be influenced by events in the Middle East or by the larger struggle against radical Islam. 
   What causes an individual or group to, first, coalesce around a set of radical principles or a charismatic leader, activities permitted by our Bill of Rights, but subsequently to embrace a violent agenda intended to inflict maximum pain and disruption on his neighbors, potential treason, is not well understood. 
   In recent testimony before our Intelligence Subcommittee, some common traits and characteristics emerged. Said RAND Corporation's Bruce Jenkins: ``It is the same age group that is susceptible to being recruited into gangs. These are young men who are going through identity crises, looking to define themselves. If you have a narrative that exalts violence, that attempts to project that violence as a personal obligation, that offers the tantalizing prospect of clandestinity, identity, all of those are appealing to that specific age group.'' 
   Combine that personal adolescent upheaval with the explosion of information technologies and communications tools, tools which American kids are using to broadcast messages from al Qaeda, as Chairman Thompson just said, and there is a road map to terror, a retail outlet for anger and warped aspirations. Link that intent with a trained terrorist operative who has actual capability, and a ``Made in the USA'' suicide bomber is born. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1955 was carefully constructed by DAVE REICHERT and me, as ranking member and chairman of the Homeland Security Intelligence Subcommittee. The bill passed out of subcommittee and full committee unanimously. This bill has strong bipartisan origins. As one who believes that this body's best work is done on a bipartisan basis, I think this bill is a testament. Though not a silver bullet, the legislation will help the Nation develop a better understanding of the forces that lead to homegrown terrorism and the steps we can take to stop it. 
   Madam Speaker, free speech, espousing even very radical beliefs, is protected by our Constitution. But violent behavior is not. Our plan must be to intervene before a person crosses that line separating radical views from violent behavior, to understand the forces at work on the individual and the community, to create an environment that discourages disillusionment and alienation, that instills in young people a sense of belonging and faith in the future. 
   The legislation before us today offers that opportunity. It is, I would suggest, the key to prevention. If we fail to prevent, the best we can do is manage consequences. Prevention is better. I urge an ``aye'' vote.

   My second comment is that a companion bill, the identical text, has been introduced in the Senate, and referred to the Government Affairs Committee, which is the committee of jurisdiction there, and I hope that following passage here, should we be able to pass the bill today, there would be prompt action in the other body and we would have a law to send to the President to sign this fall.

Existing law requires Federal agencies to buy products that meet Department of Energy, Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program standards. This amendment adds teeth and says that no fund shall be expended unless this occurs.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I believe in free and fair trade. Trade creates jobs in the United States and helps build our relationships with countries around the world. 
   But not all trade agreements are created equal. 
   That is why I evaluate trade agreements on a case-by-case basis. I voted against NAFTA in the face of enormous pressure from my own party, and against CAFTA because I felt it suffered from the same flaws as NAFTA. I stand by those votes and believe that subsequent events have proven them to be sound. 
   But on carefully reading the Peru FTA is worth supporting. 
   This FTA makes real strides in protecting workers and the environment, and the key is that core ILO standards and adherence to multilateral environmental agreements are enforceable obligations. For example, this means that Peru cannot violate the Convention on Marine Pollution or allow employers to use temporary contractors to substitute for striking workers. If it does, the United States can bring a case against Peru, and just like the other provisions of the agreement, the case could end with Peru being subjected to sanctions. This gives these provisions real teeth. 
   Chairman Rangel has secured the protections many in my party have demanded. I urge us to take ``yes'' for an answer.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, recklessness on Wall Street and fecklessness in Washington have brought the American economy to the brink of disaster. Mounting corporate debts and collapsing real estate markets have all but frozen the flow of credit that is the life-blood of our system. 
   It is now clear that without immediate and dramatic action, we face an economic calamity--not just for Wall Street, but for small businesses, communities, and families around the country. 
   But while I agree that quick action is necessary, the Treasury Department's original three-page proposal--in essence ``Dear Congress, please send a $700 billion blank check, love, Hank.''--was a nonstarter. 
   We have come a long way in the past week, thanks mostly to tough negotiations by Democrats and the inclusion of improvements demanded by Senator OBAMA, my constituents, and others. The result is legislation that I can support. 
   The bill addresses the concerns of three important groups: families who are struggling to stay in their homes; small businesses and their employees; and taxpayers. 
   First, the legislation requires that the government renegotiate the terms, including principal, interest rates, or duration, of any mortgage owned in whole or in part by the Federal Government to prevent foreclosures and keep people in their homes. These provisions are vitally important. 
   The Government now controls Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together own or back nearly 50 percent of the mortgages in America, and will be purchasing many thousands of new mortgages or shares of mortgages under this bill. The bill requires that the Government use its new market power to rework many of the flawed mortgages that are at the heart of this crisis. Done right, this effort can help families avoid the wrenching experiences of foreclosure and bankruptcy. 
   Second, it will allow all financial entities--big banks, regional banks, and local community banks--to sell off the toxic assets that have crippled the credit markets. 
   It also allows a 1-year write-off of losses stemming from the Government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, removing a major burden from the financial hubs of our communities. 
   This means capital that breathes life into our economy will flow not just to Wall Street, but to Artesia, Sepulveda, and Rosecrans Boulevards. As one of my constituents, a former auto mechanic, puts it: ``If there's no oil in the engine, the car won't run. You have to put the oil in from the top and clean the parts from the bottom.'' 
   Third, the bill includes a number of provisions intended to minimize the costs to taxpayers. It requires that the Government buy assets, rather than merely cover corporate losses. These assets give the Government an equity stake in the companies it helps--like the stake Warren Buffett just bought in Goldman Sachs. Just like Buffett, taxpayers will profit from increases in these companies' stock prices when the economy recovers. 
   The bill includes tough new oversight and transparency provisions, including an oversight board appointed by Congress. It provides funding in installments--$250 billion at first; $100 billion after the President certifies that it's necessary; and the final $350 billion only if Congress allows funding to continue. It limits executive compensation and bans so-called ``golden parachutes'' for companies participating in the program. 
   And, if after 5 years the program has resulted in a loss to the Federal Government, the President must propose a fee on financial services companies to recoup the costs of the program. This means that those whose greed caused the problem will pay for it. 
   The bill is by no means perfect. Among other things, my preference would have been to include provisions that allow bankruptcy judges to rewrite mortgages of primary homes. But as a mother of four and now grandmother of three, I know life requires compromise. 
   Our action today does not mark the end of America's financial peril. Critical next steps must include substantial reform of the financial regulatory system, a task that will be a priority for a Democratic President and a larger Democratic majority in Congress. 
   But passage of this bill, I am now convinced, is urgent and necessary to reassure the American people and global financial markets that our economy is secure and major reforms are coming.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I'm very pleased to resume my service on the Telecom Subcommittee in this Congress. 
   I also rise in strong support of the Truth in Caller ID Act, which will prevent acts of identity theft and billions of dollars in consumer losses each year. 
   I would like to engage the bill's sponsor, Mr. Engel, in a brief colloquy to clarify the effect this bill has on other laws relating to national security and law enforcement. The relevant section reads: ``Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize or prohibit any investigative, protective or intelligence activities performed in connection with official duties, and in accordance with all applicable laws, by a law enforcement agency of the United States, a State or a political subdivision of a State, or by an intelligence agency of the United States.'' 
   I'd like to ask the author what the meaning of this language is.

   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for clarifying that. Lawfully authorized national security and law enforcement activities are critical in this era of terror. Legislation designed to improve our Nation's safety and security, like the Truth in Caller ID Act, should not inadvertently impair them, nor should it expand them. This carefully crafted bill, in my view, strikes the right balance. And I would like to commend the author, Mr. Engel, Mr. Barton, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Upton for their diligent work. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we discuss a short extension of the Protect America Act in order to hammer out a bicameral agreement with the Senate which just passed its bill last night, thousands of intelligence agents are working hard around the world in undisclosed locations, unaccompanied by their families, to prevent and disrupt dangerous threats against our country. Once again, let me say ``thank you'' to them, and let me say that every Member of this Chamber thanks them for their service and prays for their safe return. 
   This debate is not, as some on the other side want to characterize it, about Democrats wanting to coddle terrorists. We emphatically do not. We want to capture or kill them. It is beyond cynical to suggest otherwise. This debate is not about whether we want court orders for foreign-to-foreign communications between terrorists. We do not. Or whether we are opposed to responsible changes to FISA. We all support responsible changes to FISA. 
   This debate is about whether the careful framework in FISA, which has lasted three decades while letting us pursue terrorists while protecting constitutional freedoms, will survive. 
   The bill the Senate passed late yesterday, in my view, is unacceptable. I am mindful that there was a substantial bipartisan majority for it, but some in my party and some in the other party who voted for it tried mightily to improve it and lost. If we have 21 more days, we can consider some of their amendments here and, I would hope, pass them. If we cannot fix the Senate bill, I will oppose it if it comes up for a vote in the House. 
   Yes, I was one of a small group of Members briefed on the terrorist surveillance program between 2003 and 2006. But those briefings, until the program was publicly disclosed in late 2005, were about operational details only. I never learned that the administration was not following FISA, and I think that was wrong. And that is why for 3 years I have worked my heart out to fashion responsible bipartisan agreement on the need for the terrorist surveillance program to comply fully with FISA. This fall, I urged repeatedly for bipartisan negotiations which, sadly, never happened. It may now be too late, but I am ``go'' for one more try. 
   I say to the intelligence officers mentioned at the outset of my remarks, to my colleagues, and to the American people, we need to conduct surveillance of foreign terrorists, but we must do it within the rule of law. With a clear legal framework, they are empowered to do their job better and from that we will all benefit. 
   In August, the House was jammed by the Senate into passing ill-advised legislation. I opposed it, and said we did not want to watch the same movie again in 6 months. Well, here we are for the sequel. But this time we must object, and I do object. We can and must do better.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act, but as a Representative of America's most stunning coastline, I do so with some reservations. 
   There is much to like in this bill. It includes long-sought alternative energy tax credits, which are essential to the continued development of the emerging clean energy industry. 
   It also requires utility companies to generate more power from renewable energy sources (following the lead of my home State of California), creates a reserve to pay for future research and development of clean renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, and requires the adoption of more energy efficient building codes. 
   These are all serious, much-needed answers to our energy crisis--reasoned, carefully crafted, and targeted toward moving us into a new era of clean energy. 
   That is not, unfortunately, the path pursued in other parts of the bill, particularly those that concern off-shore drilling. 
   We've heard a lot about drilling these days. ``Drill, baby, drill,'' or so the chant goes. It's a nice pep rally cheer, a clever soundbite. But it's not serious policy, and everybody knows it. 
   Here are the facts. Oil is traded on a global market, which sets prices based on global supply and global demand. 
   Given the staggering amounts of oil that the world produces and consumes every day, only a staggering amount of new supply will affect price (particularly given the skyrocketing demand for oil in China, India, and the rest of the developing world). 
   The amount of oil off the coasts of the United States is very far from staggering. Paltry is more like it. 
   According to the Bush Administration's own Energy Information Administration, even if we opened the entire Outer Continental Shelf for drilling tomorrow, it would take years (possibly up to 2030) for that oil to hit the market. 
   And then, all that drilling would only increase our domestic production by 200,000 barrels of oil per day. 
   The world consumes around 80 million barrels of oil per day. This new production would be a tiny drop in an ocean of oil. 
   Even the Bush Administration concedes that the impact on oil prices from such a minuscule increase would be, and I quote, ``insignificant.'' 
   And what do we risk for this ``insignificant'' increase in supply? 
   A few oil companies will make a little more money. But we'll also put the (mostly) pristine California coastline--an environmentally fragile yet economically indispensible asset--at the mercies of chance, human fallibility, and the ability of new oil rig technology to withstand the inevitable big quake. 
   That's not a risk that I'm willing to take. 
   Fortunately I'm not alone. Leadership wisely gave states some discretion. The bill would forbid drilling within 50 miles of the coast, and only allow drilling from 50-100 miles if a state ``opts-in'' (affirmatively passes a law allowing drilling). 
   I am confident that California is unlikely to ever ``opt-in.'' 
   My strong preference is to retain the moratorium against off-shore drilling, but we don't have the votes to do that. The Democratic Leadership asserts that this compromise is necessary to avoid the calamity of a drilling free-for-all off our coasts. Many in the environmental community and leading newspaper editorial boards in California and around the country concur. 
   In that case, I can live with it. 
   I wish we could do better. The American public is engaged. The media is devoting front-page articles to energy issues. We have the chance to make a significant difference in the way our country thinks about and uses energy. 
   Portions of this bill take big leaps in that direction, and Leadership should be commended for standing by these priorities. 
   I hope that my three grandchildren will eventually be the beneficiaries of this foresight.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, one need look no further than the chaos in Pakistan or the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan to understand that troop levels in Iraq cannot be maintained--and that the surge, which I have always opposed, has done nothing to achieve political stability. 
   Today, with this bridge funding vote, Congress signals to the White House yet again that enough is enough, that the combat mission in Iraq must end, and that we will force that change. 
   No one in this chamber questions the courage or commitment of our brave women and men in uniform or their willingness to tackle  any challenge put before them. But we have sent them on an ill-defined mission with no apparent end point, and which consumes staggering amounts of our talent and treasure at the expense of countless other priorities. 
   This bill also redresses a glaring loophole in the Military Commissions Act--a bill I strongly opposed. By requiring that all U.S. Government agencies and personnel must adhere to interrogation techniques contained in the Army Field Manual, we send an unmistakable signal to the rest of the world that the United States--the world's oldest functioning democracy--does not permit cruel, inhumane and degrading practices, or torture, and complies fully with Federal law banning torture and our international obligations. 
   The Iraq Troop Redeployment Bill is good policy, and long overdue.

   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his steadfast protection of civil liberties in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, in June, I received the CIA Seal Medal, the Agency's highest  civilian award. As one who lives and breathes security issues, this was a tremendous honor which I share with the courageous women and men of the intelligence community, serving in unaccompanied posts in austere locations around the world. 
   I have visited them and thank them again for their bravery and selfless patriotism. Why do I mention this? Because the issue before us is fundamental to our efforts to track terrorists and to ensure that our freedoms and liberties are protected in the process.     
   Only a handful of us in this House are fully briefed on the Terrorist Surveillance Program, a program which gives those who implement it incredible tools to find people who would harm us or to engage in unprecedented violations of Americans' constitutional rights for improper, ideological, or political purposes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Senate-passed bill punts on the need for a clear legal framework, to check and balance unfettered executive power. In my view, we are drilling down to bedrock principle here, and sadly we in this House appear poised to repeat the Senate's mistake. 
   We can track terrorist communications, and we must, but we must do this without starting down the slippery slope to potential unprecedented abuse of innocent Americans' privacy. This is our challenge, and work starts today on building the bipartisan support necessary to do a crucial course correction by the time this bill sunsets.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, for the last several years, Congress has been unable to pass an intelligence authorization bill. This means that the Intelligence Committee, entrusted with major responsibilities, a committee on which I was proud to serve for 8 years, 4 of those as ranking member, has been prevented from setting the direction for our intelligence community. 
   Finally this year, Mr. Speaker, the House and Senate agreed on a responsible bill and included in that responsible bill language to end the so-called ``CIA loophole'' on interrogations. The President has vetoed that bill and continues to insist irresponsibly, in my view, that Congress shall not impose a legal framework around interrogation policy. I strongly disagree and rise to override his veto. 
   Interrogations are a crucial tool in the effort to prevent and disrupt attacks against America, and Congress should not abdicate our obligation to legislate. Aside from stating the case, the Bush administration has never offered proof that extreme interrogation techniques like waterboarding are effective. I believe Senator JOHN MCCAIN who says that waterboarding is torture, that such techniques do not work. 
   Article I, section 8 of our Constitution requires Congress to ``regulate captures on land and water.'' This is our responsibility. We have seen the erosion of respect for America that comes from scandals like Abu Ghraib and incarceration without end at Guantanamo Bay. The military and FBI conduct interrogations under clear rules. So why can't the CIA? 
   Mr. Speaker, my message to the White House is this: Congress is a coequal branch of government. The Constitution plainly gives us the power to legislate interrogation policy, and we must use it. 
   Vote ``aye.''

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, to paraphrase an old ad, when ELLEN TAUSCHER and IKE SKELTON speak, I listen. They work together carefully on important legislation, and this is a piece of important legislation. 
   I don't know about others in this Chamber, but I am tired. We have been working all day and all night for weeks to try to get to an August recess after accomplishing as much as possible. It is 100 degrees outside. The humidity level is very high, but we are in an air-conditioned place. 
   In contrast to us, over 100,000 American troops, very brave kids, are in 120 degree weather with 40 to 75 pounds of equipment on their backs, bravely defending America. I think as tired as I am, this bill strikes the right tone and says that in order to fulfill our constitutional duty to provide for the common defense, our constitutional duty to provide for the common defense, we have to make sure that we have a ready military. 
   Mr. Speaker, we don't. It is broken. Every expert we have heard from knows that. Our failure to plan adequately for the post-military phase in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere has created a broken military. 
   So I commend the sponsor of this bill and the others who have helped draft it. I am proud to be a cosponsor in the effort to state clearly that the kids we have sent into harm's way should get the rest and training they deserve. 
   I would close by saying there was a lot of conversation this morning about FISA and how we are at heightened risk and we are doing the wrong things. Well, I know what is the right thing to do about FISA, and I know what is the right thing to do about a broken military. Pass this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and commend Chairman Dingell for his enormous work.  
   Regardless of the business before the House, for the past two weeks, a drumbeat of dire predictions has been maintained on this floor about the so-called terrorism gap--the failure of Democrats to fix the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to permit  our intelligence agencies to intercept foreign-to-foreign communications related to international terrorism. The argument is specious on its face. Democrats are just as committed as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to preventing another terrorist attack on the United States. 
   As a member of the Gang of Eight from 2002-2006, I am very familiar with FISA and our Terrorist Surveillance Program. While I agree that some technical adjustments are appropriate, the core principle of FISA and the 4th Amendment--that individualized court warrants are required if the communications of a U.S. person are involved--must be preserved. 
   But my question is, in the context of the CHAMP Act now before us: where is the outrage for the 5 million American kids who have no health insurance and no prospect of getting it unless we pass this bill? 
   What is the real objective of Members who continue to clutter an essential debate on improving health outcomes for our neediest children with alarmist exchanges on the surveillance of potential terrorists? Perhaps it is to jam Democrats and score partisan points before the August recess instead of reaching out to the most vulnerable among us. 
   The CHAMP Act reaches out by providing insurance to 11 million children, covering mental health and dental benefits, and by allowing States to cover pregnant women and family planning. 
   It reauthorizes Title V abstinence education, but requires that it be medically and scientifically accurate, as well as proven effective. I expect every Member agrees that no Federal program should use taxpayer dollars to give inaccurate information to young people. 
   The CHAMP Act makes improvements to the Medicare program, too, providing our most vulnerable seniors with better coverage for cost-saving preventive care and by making it easier to apply for benefits. 
   Let me bring the issue close to home. The Venice Family Clinic, located in my congressional district, is the largest free clinic in the Nation. They know something about reaching out to the most vulnerable in our communities. 
   Clinic staff told me today about an 8-year-old boy and his younger brother. Both of them are on the waiting list for SCHIP because the program is maxed-out--and their working mother doesn't earn enough to buy health insurance. 
   This child suffers epileptic seizures every couple of weeks. He worries constantly about when the next one will occur, when and if he will be able to see a doctor or have access to medication that could help him. These are not things an 8-year-old in a country as rich as ours should be worrying about. 
   Expanding SCHIP will cover these children. It will change their lives, and the lives of 11 million other low income American kids. 
   FISA can, should and will be fixed--and we can fix health insurance for kids, too. Every child deserves the health insurance that my four children and one grandchild have. And I have two more grandchildren on the way. Hopefully, the CHAMP Act will be law before they are born early next year.

   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. She is one of the newest Members of Congress, but she is a very active Member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, succeeding our late colleague, Juanita Millender-McDonald, in that position. I want to commend her for her interest in this issue and for all she does for the Ports of L.A. and Long Beach and for Los Angeles International Airport, LAX, which is near her district, surrounded by my district and represented by Ms. Waters who is a coauthor of this legislation. 
   I rise in strong support of this bill, one that I introduced in the past two Congresses and which, as you heard, has already passed the Senate. 
   Imagine, Mr. Speaker, sitting at a desk trying to memorize a verse or tackle a math problem as jet planes roar overhead every 3 minutes. Let me repeat that. I have been there to see it. Every 3 minutes, a jet plane roars above the little school buildings in Lennox, California, immediately east of LAX.  
   The children of Lennox, a mostly working-class community, manage amazingly well. I'm enormously proud of the fact that they win educational awards despite studying in classrooms that resemble bunkers. And yet Mr. Speaker, for the past 3 years, despite the fact that they reached agreement with LAWA, the Los Angeles World Airport Authority, to receive noise mitigation funds, they've been unable to get those funds because of a technical glitch in the law. 
   That means, Mr. Speaker, that school construction has been stalled in Lennox and in adjacent Inglewood. So we have tried these 3 years to fix that glitch, and that is exactly what this bill will do. 
   I want to point out--I don't think the bill's manager said this--that this bill does not require the expenditure of new funds. All it does is authorize LAWA to release funds it already has. All it does is provide emergency relief to a lot of kids in a working-class part of Los Angeles who have endured the most onerous conditions while trying to learn. 
   I want to thank a lot of people for making possible what I hope will be a victory today: First of all, the leadership of the T&I Committee, Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica; Ms. Richardson; my co-author Ms. Waters; and Senators Boxer and Feinstein, all of whom helped get this bipartisan bill on the consent calendar today. 
   I also want to thank former FAA Administrator Marion Blakley who, while a part of this administration, came to see Lennox, understood what the problems were, and lent her staff to us to help draft this in a way that it would get support from the administration. It has the support of the FAA, it has the support of OMB, it has the support of the Republican side of the aisle; and it's a model, in my view, of the way legislation should be developed and passed in this House. 
   Finally, I want to thank Congressman David Dreier who made sure that we could get the bill to the floor today. He is not here because just a few days ago his mother unexpectedly passed away. I want to send my sympathy to him and his family at a tough time and note that this bill helps kids just like kids in his Southern California district. This bill does good things for education, and this bill does good things for the reputation of this House. 
   I ask for an ``aye'' vote.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me and commend her for her leadership on this legislation, along with Mr. Rohrabacher. In 2 months in Congress, you have hit the ground running, and we're all very proud to serve as your colleagues. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution congratulating the Port of Los Angeles on its 100th anniversary. 
   When I first came to Congress in 1992, the Port of L.A. looked far different than it does today. It wasn't quite the sleepy port of 100 years ago, with mule-driven trains and wooden ships. It was a regional presence. But today it is the largest container port in the United States and part of the fifth busiest container complex in the world. It supports over 250,000 jobs at the port and adjacent communities and nearly 1 million jobs worldwide. It is an economic powerhouse whose importance to Southern California and the Nation cannot be overstated. 
   In recent years, the port has taken great strides to address the challenges that come with being a major port in the 21st century. It has dedicated millions to ensuring the quality of life for the surrounding communities, many of which are located in my congressional district. It has also taken on groundbreaking environmental initiatives to reduce the air pollution that it generates. Maybe most importantly, 100 years ago there was no such thing as a maritime security strategy. Today, the issue is of paramount importance, and the port has been a national leader. 
   In the hours after the September 11 attacks, port officials, the Coast Guard, and local law enforcement executed a pre-approved plan that quickly and efficiently secured the port. The planning, communication and execution we saw that day became the inspiration for many of the security initiatives that have come since, including the SAFE Port Act, which I coauthored with my California colleague, Dan Lungren, and which became law last year. 
   As I mentioned, Congresswoman Richardson deserves enormous appraise for her leadership on an issue that was very timely but which the rest of us had overlooked. I don't think this resolution would have come to the floor without her initiative. And it really is a big deal to the San Pedro community. 
   I look forward to working with her as her partner when we celebrate the next 100 years. We may be feeble, but we will be here. 
   And at this time, I would like to insert into the Record an article from today's edition of the Daily Breeze.  
   Port of Los Angeles Marks 100 Years Since Its Creation  
   San Pedro Bay had been struggling as a port for nearly a half-century, but the mud flats surrounding the inland harbor failed to excite railroad magnate Collis P. Huntington. 
   So rather than run his Southern Pacific Railroad down to San Pedro, Huntington bought more than 200 acres in Santa Monica in the hope of bolstering his vision for a ``Port Los Angeles.'' 
   He built a wharf that extended 4,720 feet into the Pacific Ocean, attracting more than 300 cargo ships during its first year in 1893. 
   ``He wanted people to think his port was close to Los Angeles, when in fact it wasn't,'' said Ernest Marquez of West Hills, who chronicled Huntington's efforts in his 1975 book ``Port Los Angeles: A Phenomenon of the Railroad Era.'' 
   ``If he was successful, then the region's economy would have been at the mercy of Southern Pacific and that would have been disastrous,'' Marquez said. 
   While Huntington tried to get his Santa Monica port recognized as the official harbor for the Los Angeles region, efforts were already under way to bulk up the port in San Pedro. 
   U.S. Sen. Stephen M. White, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and Los Angeles Times Publisher Harrison Gray Otis believed the port should be a city-operated enterprise and pushed efforts to build a ``Port of Los Angeles'' in San Pedro Bay. 
   ``Those men saw potential for the mud flats in San Pedro,'' Marquez said. ``They believed the harbor could be developed by lots of digging and dredging.'' 
   To a lesser extent, interests in Redondo Beach and Playa del Rey had tried to enter the fray, but those efforts quickly fell by the wayside, setting the scene for an epic battle that became known as the ``Free Harbor Contest.'' 
   Congress established the River and Harbor Act of 1896, which created a commission to decide whether federal funds should go to Santa Monica or San Pedro. 
   Three years later, Congress put its money on San Pedro and breakwater construction began a short time afterward. 
   ``There was no way a harbor of this magnitude could have been developed in Santa Monica because there are too many cliffs on the beach, and it was wide open to the ocean,'' Marquez said. ``San Pedro was favored because the harbor went inland and protected ships from the open seas.'' 
   The city of Los Angeles then annexed a 16-mile strip of land to connect to the port in 1906. The communities of San Pedro and Wilmington were annexed three years later. 
   The city's newfound ownership of the port gave rise to a new harbor commission, a three-member panel appointed in 1907 by then-Mayor A.C. Harper. 
   The 100th anniversary of the harbor commission's creation will be marked during a celebration at 4 p.m. Sunday. 
   The bash will include historical displays, refreshments, boat shows and a performance by Taiwan's Evergreen Symphony Orchestra. A fireworks display is set for 7 p.m. 
   The first commissioners--George H. Stewart, Frederick William Braun and T.E. Gibbon--regularly met in downtown Los Angeles and made ``big news'' during the rare occasions they traveled about 20 miles south to San Pedro, according to Geraldine Knatz, executive director for the Port of Los Angeles.  
   The panel didn't have a budget and its members often had to pay for expenses out of their own pockets, she said. 
   ``When the voters approved the annexation and bond improvements for port improvements, the money went to the Board of Public Works, not the harbor commissioners,'' Knatz said. ``It got so bad that all the commissioners resigned in disgust by 1913.'' 
   The first harbor commission faced many of the struggles that persist today, such as building new infrastructure and bolstering regional economic development, Knatz said. 
   ``When you read through the meeting minutes from 100 years ago, you learn that nothing really changes,'' Knatz said. ``There will never be enough money, you'll be lobbied by different interest groups, and you'll always have to deal with residents who live near the port. It's always going to be hard.'' 
   The port has come a long way since those early years, with the arrival of cargo container ships in 1937, the advent of towering gantry cranes during the late 1960s and, more recently, an environmental push aimed at reducing diesel emissions from ships and trucks. 
   About 15.8 million cargo units passed through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach last year, accounting for more than 40 percent of the nation's imports. That number is expected to double by 2020 and nearly triple by 2030, according to local economist John Husing. 
   Additionally, some 500,000 people in Southern California are employed directly and indirectly by port-related businesses, Husing said last month. 
   ``The port is a vital part of our national economy, but it is just as important locally, providing good jobs for generations of local residents,'' said Los Angeles City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, whose 15th District includes the port. 
   To remain competitive, the port must continue to grow while also keeping the environment in mind, Husing said. 
   Several shipping companies operating at the Port of Los Angeles are studying expansion options that call for environmentally friendly accommodations, such as AMP technology that allows container ships to ``plug in'' to a generator and operate on electrical power while docked, rather than idling on their diesel engines. 
   China Shipping was the first company to use the technology at the Port of Los Angeles, resulting in the elimination of 300 tons of pollution-forming nitrogen oxides since 2004, according to port officials. 
   ``Growing green is imperative if any kind of expansion is going to happen,'' Knatz said. ``It's always difficult to be out front on these issues, but we can't afford to be a follower.'' 
   Indeed, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach approved a clean air plan in 2006 aimed at reducing emissions by 50 percent over the next five years. 
   The ports are poised in 2008 to roll out the plan's first provisions, including a so-called Clean Trucks Program that calls for replacing or retrofitting about 16,000 diesel-spewing big rigs with cleaner-burning vehicles by 2012. 
   ``The time has come for us to truly commit to cleaning up our air and limiting emissions from the port,'' Hahn said. ``It is my hope that working together, we can finally have both a productive and efficient port, but also clean and healthy communities.''

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4351, AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, as the only grandmother Blue Dog, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying bill. I strongly support AMT relief for 55,000 taxpayers in my congressional district, and 23 million Americans nationwide. But there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Simply providing relief to this generation while raising taxes on future generations is the wrong way. 
   Put another way, the $50 billion price tag for this AMT vote can either be paid for responsibly, or we can send the bill to our children and grandchildren. 
   In my seven terms in Congress, I have always supported fiscal responsibility and have made scores of votes that are faithful to that principle. Among them was a career-risking vote in 1993 for the Clinton budget; my vote in 1994 to cut $100 billion from Federal spending; my vote in 1997 for a balanced budget; my vote against the Bush tax package which provided unnecessary relief for the top tax brackets; and now these AMT votes. 
   Madam Speaker, I dedicate my vote today to my first grandchild, Lucy, and to her brother and cousin, who will be born early next year.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2082, INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. I thank Chairman Reyes for yielding, and I'm proud to be part of this debate along with him, Ranking Member Pete Hoekstra and other friends from my long service on the committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of this committee for 8 years, the last 4 as ranking member, I remain passionate about intelligence issues and very proud of the thousands of my constituents who comprise the industrial base that builds our intelligence satellites. 
   As we have heard, this is the first intelligence authorization conference report in 3 years. It is the House's main tool for setting directions and conducting oversight of our intelligence community. It includes new tools, record funding, investments in language training, and a provision I have pushed for years: multilevel clearances. 
   I honor and support the work of the brave women and men of our intelligence community around the world. Often their families cannot accompany them on their assignments and in many cases don't even know what they do. I visit them often, and if they are tuning in, let me say thank you again on behalf of a grateful Nation. 
   Two items. First, interrogations policy. For years I have urged a clear legal framework around detention and interrogation policy in the post-9/11 world. The scandal over destruction of the interrogations tapes was avoidable. As ranking member in 2003, I urged in writing that planned destruction of tapes was ill advised. The committee was not advised in 2005 that the tapes  were destroyed, and the thorough hearings now in progress may reveal that the committee was deliberately misled. That would be disgraceful. There should not be a separate interrogations program. That's why I support the Senate language requiring all interrogation procedures to conform to the Army Field Manual.     
   Second, the Iran NIE. I've read it in its entirety, and I'm proud of those who wrote it. They did careful work, and they spoke truth to power. 
   Intelligence is not policy. It is a tool which helps wise policymakers develop policy. Instead of blaming the messenger, policy experts and security experts should use the conclusions in the NIE to support tough sanctions, which we need, and diplomacy, which we lack. They should also understand that this NIE identifies gaps in what we know. 
   This policymaker is wary of Iran's possession of advanced missiles, its work on many dual-use technologies that could be part of a restarted nuclear weapons program, and its ongoing sponsorship of terrorism. 
   Mr. Speaker, on balance, this conference report is responsible and it is needed. Vote ``aye.''

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to serve under Chairman Dingell on the Energy and Commerce Committee and to support this effort to keep the Medicaid safety net intact. That our chairman shepherded this must-pass bill through our committee with unanimous support is testament to his enormous legislative skill and bipartisanship. 
   Unless we pass this bill, Mr. Speaker, public hospitals and the essential services they provide will be at grave risk. A major public hospital in my district, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, is among them. It is the only level 1 trauma center near top terror targets like LAX and the ports of Long Beach and L.A. In the event of an attack, Harbor would be on the front lines. As a teaching hospital, it helps train the next generation of doctors. 
   Mr. Speaker, if all seven Medicaid regulations are implemented, Los Angeles County will lose $240 million in annual funding, the equivalent of closing a public hospital like Harbor. Harbor is already overcrowded. It needs more help, not less. It needs to offer more services, not to close. H.R. 5613 will stop these catastrophic cuts, and it deserves our full support. 
   I urge our colleagues to vote ``aye'' and to join in overriding a White House veto should one occur.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Thank you Mr. Chairman for yielding. 
   The State of Israel and I are about the same age. And the connection has been deep and constant throughout my life. My late father, a refugee from Nazi Germany, spoke fluent Hebrew and fondly remembered his early visit to Israel, then under British mandate. He returned to Israel many times, though never to his childhood home in Germany. 
   I, too, make frequent visits to Israel, two in the past year, and am proud of many friendships and recognition as a passionate advocate for the U.S.-Israel security relationship. Many of our joint security programs with Israel, like the Arrow Missile Defense System, continue to be among my highest priorities in Congress. Just a week ago, Mr. Speaker, Congressman Mark Kirk and I urged full sharing of the U.S.-Israel early warning system to protect Israel from the possibility of incoming Iranian missiles. 
   Sixty years ago, as has been said, President Harry Truman was first to recognize the State of Israel. The United States and Israel have been democratic allies ever since in times of war and fragile peace.  
   Israel has become a technology and economic powerhouse, a beacon for the Jewish diaspora, a protector of the rights of women and its minority Arab population. And yet, according to an excellent State Department report, anti-Semitism and anti-Israel sentiment are growing. Most of Israel's neighbors do not recognize her right to exist, and Iran's leader actively threatens to destroy her. 
   Some of Israel's actions are provocative, to be sure. Halting new settlement construction and easing checkpoints could go a long way to ease tensions. Yet as a recent MiamiHerald.com article points out, a key piece of the Israeli dream remains a mirage. For all their successes, Israelis remain unsure that their country's presence is truly permanent. No other nation on earth faces that fear, and the fear is not unfounded. Israel distributes gas masks and practices bomb shelters drills. This is hardly birthday fare. But 60 years is a milestone and perhaps a miracle. 
   During Passover week, we retell and celebrate the story of the Jews' exile from Egypt and quest to return to Israel.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1.  
   As I have said many times, terrorists won't check our party registration before they blow us up. The American people know this. And they expect us to protect them in spite of many barriers--personal, institutional, and political--that often gridlock the legislative process. 
   Mr. Speaker, keeping America secure is our sworn constitutional duty. This bill, which includes measures considered over the past 2 years by Chairman THOMPSON and the Homeland Security Committee, is important. If it becomes law, it will make us safer. 
   Let me highlight a few items. 
   First, a strengthened Privacy and Civil Liberties Board. Originally created as part of the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, the Board is reestablished as an independent agency with subpoena powers and all five members are subject to Senate confirmation. That is a good thing, and something Speaker PELOSI urged as the Intel Reform bill was written. 
   Second, a greater allocation of Homeland Security grants based primarily on risk, rather than the ``squeaky wheel'' theory. My own District includes portions of LAX and the Port of Los Angeles. But other cities and States are also subject to significant risk--from obvious targets like New York and Washington, to smaller communities with nuclear or chemical facilities. Congress must direct its limited resources where threats are greatest, period. 
   Third, intelligence and information-sharing. I believe reforms at the Federal level are beginning to take hold--though I wish the Intelligence Committees in Congress would get budgetary authority, as the 9/11 Commission recommended. 
   H.R. 1 focuses on providing State and local first responders more of the intelligence tools they need. For example, it requires DHS to deploy officers to border State fusion centers, and permits State and local authorities to send detailees to DHS. 
   It is locals, after all, who will be most likely to know what's wrong in their neighborhoods. And so we must trust and empower them to act. 
   Finally, interoperable communications. I salute our colleague Representative LOWEY for her persistence. Without interoperable communications, we won't have the ability to stop or respond to major attacks. 
   H.R. 1 is aptly numbered. It is this House's first responsibility. Vote ``aye.''

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I commend his service on the Rules Committee and his long service, much of which I shared, on the House Intelligence Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying bill. Many in this House, including me, have worked over years to get surveillance right. This bill does a good job, a far better job than the bill reported last month by the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
   Protecting America from the real threat of additional attacks requires  the strongest possible tools. It also requires a flexible, agile and constitutional set of authorities to guarantee that those who do the surveillance clearly know the rules and obey them and that Americans who may be targeted have appropriate safeguards. 
   This legislation arms our intelligence professionals with the ability to listen to foreign targets, without a warrant, to uncover plots that threaten U.S. national security. 
   The bill also protects the constitutional rights of Americans by requiring the FISA Court, an article III court, to approve procedures to ensure that Americans are not targeted for warrantless surveillance. 
   I have reviewed the changes to this legislation made by the manager's amendment. This amendment makes the bill stronger in two important ways: First, it clarifies that nothing in the bill--repeat, nothing--inhibits the ability to monitor Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, proliferators of weapons of mass destruction or any terror group or individual who threatens our national security. Second, and this is a point that was just addressed by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra), it clarifies that nothing, nothing, in the bill extends any rights to people who are not in the United States legally. Undocumented aliens, people who aren't citizens or have overstayed their visas receive no rights under this bill. Some may try to scare us into thinking otherwise, but they're just wrong. 
   The bill does not change current law, and this is a point that may have been overlooked by the gentleman from Michigan. It does not change current law regarding the surveillance of undocumented aliens. Since 1978, FISA, which was enacted in that year, has extended fourth amendment protections to persons legally in the United States. The Protect America Act, which the Republican minority in this body supported in August and which was enacted into law that month, continues that same definition. The Protect America Act defines the coverage of the bill just the way this legislation does. We're not changing the coverage of U.S. persons as defined in 1978 and since under the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, terrorists won't check our party registration before they blow us up. Security and liberty are not a zero sum game. The RESTORE America Act will protect the American people and defend the Constitution. Vote ``aye.''

   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I think this has been an interesting debate. I have sat through every minute of it. During the debate on the rule, I spoke for this bill and for the rule; and now I speak strongly against this motion to recommit. As you have already heard, it is redundant. We have inserted language in this bill that takes care of the problem. In the manager's amendment, language was added at the request of the Blue Dogs, and I am proud to be a co-chair of the Blue Dog Coalition, and that language specifically refers to terrorist organizations, and the Revolutionary Guards are one such organization. 
   So I would like to say for two reasons there's no need to support this motion to recommit: one, it kills the bill by using the word ``promptly''; number two, it is redundant with excellent language that we added to the bill in the manager's amendment. As I have said before, this is not a zero sum game. We don't get more security and less liberty or more liberty and less security. We either get more of both or less of both. 
   These amendments carefully restore, it's called the RESTORE Act, the balance of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which Congress wisely  passed 20 years ago. Vote for this bill and against the motion to recommit. We will restore that balance.

   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, in my office is a wonderful photograph of JUANITA and I, arms raised in victory, It was taken as I announced my intention to run for Governor of California in 1998. She was right there, and I was clearly buoyed by her presence. Our friendship was forged in that tough campaign, and it remained strong. 
   JUANITA was a popular and highly regarded Member of this House. Those are not easy things to achieve in a very competitive workplace, so it is worth asking how she did it. 
   First, she was a loyal friend. Once she decided to endorse or support you, she never flinched--no matter how hot the heat. And second, she was a pro. She had a clear idea of what legislators can do, and she worked hard. 
   The results are obvious. JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD served California's 37th congressional district well. 
   When she came to Congress, she decided to add ``Millender'' to her name in order to honor her mother. Surely she honored her mother. But she also honored her constituents--and this Congress.

   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I am enjoying my return to the Commerce Committee, where I serve under a great chairman, John Dingell. 
   Our committee has a history of producing strong bipartisan legislation. The regular order works, and we do good work when we follow it. 
   As a grandmother and grandmother-to-be, I watched in horror this summer as millions of toys were pulled off of American store shelves due to lead-tainted paint, detached magnets, and other hazards. I was further dismayed because Mattel, one of the companies responsible, is headquartered in my congressional district and employs 2,000 of my constituents to design and market its toys. I am pleased to say that Mattel has worked hard to fix its problems, though I will continue to recommend that it move some of or all of its manufacturing back to this country, where quality can be carefully monitored. 
   Madam Speaker, for all the reasons my colleagues have mentioned, H.R. 4040 is a landmark bill. It sets a high bar for toy manufacturers like Mattel, and strengthens government scrutiny of industry. H.R. 4040 was written the right way, the bipartisan way, and through the regular order of the House. In terms of process, it is a model for Congress at its best, and grandmothers, grandmothers-to-be, children, and our committee will be better for it. 
   I urge passage of this bill.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have often said that the terrorists won't check our party registration before they blow us up. Security has been my focus since coming to Congress seven terms ago. I have served on almost every security committee here, including 8 years on the Intelligence Committee. 
   Our security policy must not be partisan, and that is why last week's compromise on FISA was so meaningful. And that is why Charlie Black's comments in an upcoming Fortune magazine interview that another terrorist attack on U.S. soil ``certainly would be a big advantage'' to his candidate and that the Bhutto assassination ``helped us'' were so outrageous. 
   Yes, he and Senator McCain have apologized; and they should have. Another attack here or the assassination of a democratic political party leader anywhere harms all of us. 
   Seven years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden is still at large. The Taliban is resurgent in Afghanistan, and young kids still want to be suicide bombers. These are tough challenges, and there is no room for reckless talk.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 3815, the Homeland Security Open Source Enhancement Act of 2008, introduced last year by our subcommittee member, ED PERLMUTTER, who is, by my lights, though a freshman member, an enormously talented contributor to the work of our subcommittee.     
   Regrettably, he couldn't be here for this debate this afternoon. 
   This is an important piece of legislation that will go a long way towards ensuring that the Department offers critical intelligence products that matter to its State, local and tribal partners. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government has, at its disposal, nearly limitless amounts of unclassified, open source information and can share it with key stakeholders, regardless of whether those partners have security clearances. 
   This is crucial because the next attack in the U.S. will not be stopped, as I mentioned earlier, by a bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., it will be the cop on the beat who is familiar with the rhythms and nuances of his or her neighborhood who will find out about that attack. An observant police officer somewhere in America will see something or someone out of place and, guided by timely, accurate and actionable and unclassified, open source information, will connect the dots that will unravel that new potential terrorist plot. 
   The Department, and specifically its Office of Intelligence and Analysis, has pursued a variety of missions without a clear focus. Open source is a case in point. 
   The Department's open source efforts have lagged far behind the rest of the Federal Government. While the DNI and the CIA have both established programs in this area, DHS, the lead Federal agency responsible for sharing terrorism threat and vulnerability information with State and local law enforcement, has yet to articulate a vision for how it will collect, analyze and disseminate it to stakeholders. 
   This legislation directs the Department to jump start its open source program and protect the privacy, civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans in the process. It will help DHS fill a critical gap in information sharing, and, hopefully, provide its primary customers with timely and actionable information. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this important legislation and reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume, and I am prepared to close debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am thinking back to those years on the Intelligence Committee, when I would leave classified briefings dissatisfied with the amount of information I was receiving. I would then go out and read my local newspaper or maybe an article that I had saved for airplane reading, and realize that in open sources there was a huge amount of information directly relevant to the problem that had not been organized in a way that I could quickly access it, and that in fact was probably more useful than the classified briefings I received. This happened not one time, not five times, but often. 
   So the point of Mr. Perlmutter's excellent legislation is to help the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary responsibility for the security of our homeland, make public source information available to those who need it to keep us safe. And those would be our first preventers, police and firefighters in our neighborhoods, and the general public. It sounds obvious, but it doesn't happen. And I appreciate the support of Mr. Bilirakis and the unanimous support of the members of the committee. 
   Again, I want to commend the bill's principal author, Mr. Perlmutter, for offering this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleague and the ranking member of our Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment DAVE REICHERT, introduced H.R. 6098 earlier this year, and it was reported unanimously out of our subcommittee and the full committee. 
   I have to express my personal disappointment that Mr. Reichert is not here for this debate. I know that this is a subject he is passionate about, as am I, as are the first responders, so-called ``first preventers'' who will benefit enormously by its passage. 
   At issue, Mr. Speaker, is how DHS grant recipients can spend their money when it comes to hiring and retaining intelligence analysts at the State and local levels. 
   In the 9/11 Act, we were clear, grant recipients could use up to 50 percent of their State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative funding for personnel costs, without time limitations. 
   The Department of Homeland Security, however, had other ideas. Instead of following the law, it capped allowable personnel costs far below the 50 percent threshold, and it imposed a 2-year limit on how long States could employ intelligence analysts hired with Federal dollars. This has had the absurd result of States and localities firing analysts after 2 years, just to continue to qualify for DHS funding. 
   Think about this. Someone works for you, is providing excellent, accurate and actionable intelligence analysis that will help us track and prevent the next set of threats, and that person gets fired only because he or she has to be fired in order for money to continue to flow. This makes absolutely no sense. 
   DHS' approach, likewise, undermines the culture of constitutionality that Congress intended to foster at fusion centers in the 9/11 Act. 
   Many States and localities want to use DHS grant funds to hire and retain analysts at those centers, which are increasingly becoming the linchpin for information sharing with the Federal Government. To sustain this effort, however, State and locals need money to pay for staff overtime to make fusion centers work, something both Congress and the President, in his National Strategy For Information Sharing, strongly support. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, the Department's grant guidance ignores this, just as it ignores the stringent privacy and civil liberties training requirements that are the centerpiece of the 9/11 Act's funding provision. By forcing States and localities to fire staff every 2 years in order to access Federal funds, DHS is effectively preventing the ``culture of constitutionality'' from taking root. 
   When privacy and civil liberties best practices have no time to develop, abuses, like the Maryland State Police's apparent spying on peace protestors and death penalty opponents, are the inevitable result. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6098 fixes these problems by giving States and localities the flexibility they need to hire and retain the staff to keep our communities safe. That is why the bill has been cosponsored by both Democrats and Republicans, and that is why it was approved on a unanimous basis by both our subcommittee and the full Homeland Security Committee last month. 
   Mr. Speaker, fusion centers, done the right way, are essential for Homeland Security. 
   I therefore urge passage of this critically important legislation, and reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, we have just debated eight bills that come out of the Homeland Security Committee. I think that is a pretty good work product. As I mentioned earlier, four of them, those managed by the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Thompson, I think, are excellent policy. They come from a variety of subcommittees. And I want to thank him again, ranking member KING and the superb bipartisan staff that has helped move us along. I urge their passage by this House. 
   The four bills that I have just managed, and that we debated earlier, one of which, hopefully will reduce the pernicious practice of overclassification and selective declassification, a second, which will reduce the ability to put sensitive but unclassified markings on documents, a third which will promote the dissemination of open source information by the Department of Homeland Security, and the fourth, which will end the absurd practice of having to fire people in order to continue to receive Federal funds, all go in one direction. And what is that direction? That direction is to help our first preventers, police and fire services, who know our neighborhoods best, to get critical information in real time about what to look for and what to do.     
   Without critical information in real time, the cop on the beat could unfortunately miss the plot that is being pursued in the house right in front of him because he or she doesn't know what to look for and what to do. 
   Each of these bills is designed to get information which the Federal Government may have or which may appear in open source materials to that first preventer in real time. And each of these bills also is designed to reduce and hopefully eliminate the excuses that can cause a Federal bureaucrat to decide that to protect his turf or her turf or to protect himself or herself from embarrassment, to say ``Oh, I will just mark this document `classified' or I will just put an SBU marking on this document and that way the person next door won't get to see it.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, that's the wrong impulse, it's the wrong signal, and with passage of these bills, we send a strong message; and more than that, a strong requirement to the Department of Homeland Security that at least the people who work there cannot, any longer, use or abuse the classification and SBU systems in order to protect themselves. 
   I'm hopeful that later this afternoon as we debate some additional bills on the suspension calendar, one of the things we will do is to use this principle of limiting the categories for ``sensitive but unclassified'' and take it government-wide. That is legislation that, as I mentioned, has been reported by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and I believe that will be before us shortly. 
   I want to say that I endorse that idea. I think it makes sense to reduce the SBU categories across the government. I think we can make DHS the gold standard, but hopefully every department of government that can use those stamps to prevent necessary information from being shared will get the same strong message. 
   Let me finally say, as one of the co-authors of the Intelligence Reform bill of 2004, that we recognized, when we enacted that bill, that what has been called a ``need-to-know'' culture that has created stovepipes, so-called stovepipes in our government, had to be changed to a ``need-to-share'' culture if we were ever going to be able to connect the dots to prevent the next attack. 
   Changing a culture from ``need to know'' to ``need to share'' is a very difficult thing to do, but a piece of that is breaking down the ways that individuals prevent information from moving off their desks to the person at the next desk. 
   And with passage of the four bills we have just debated, I think we send the strongest possible signal. And with passage of legislation that Mr. Waxman, I believe, is going to offer strongly, we continue to send that signal out across the government. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the Reichert bill that we have just debated. I urge passage of the four bills that I have been managing during the last hour or so. I call for an ``aye'' vote on the legislation. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank Mr. Bilirakis for his generous comments and for his strong support of this legislation. I think this is landmark legislation. I think our committee will get enormous attention for finally trying to attack this insidious problem of overclassification, and I very much appreciate his personal support. 
   I also want to tell him that I have watched him raise this issue about authorization and appropriation, the need for both actions, by this House. I agree with him. I think we need an authorization of this bill this year. And it is my understanding that all of the individual bills we are debating this afternoon will be included in that authorization bill. So I thank him for pointing out the need for us to act. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, of the bills that I am managing on the floor this afternoon, this is the one that I feel most strongly about. This is the one that will make the biggest difference. If we can get classification right at the Department of Homeland Security, a new department, we can then get it right in the rest of the government. 
   As I mentioned earlier, I am working with Mr. Waxman and others on his committee to see whether we can craft a bill that manages properly all the equities involved in taking this approach governmentwide, but I hope we can work that out. I think this bill sets the right precedent. I urge its passage by the full House. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, only a few of us in this House are fully briefed on the terrorist surveillance program. It gives those who implement it incredible tools to find people who would harm us or to engage in unprecedented violations of Americans' constitutional rights for improper political or ideological reasons. 
   Most of this bill is not in dispute. But the key disagreement is whether a foreign surveillance program with unprecedented reach into the personal communications of terrorists or innocent Americans should be subject to supervision by an article III court. As you have just heard, that review comes in the form of a single warrant approving the contours of the program, called a ``basket warrant.'' Our bill permits time to get that warrant while engaging in surveillance. 
   So a vote for our bill is a vote for sophisticated surveillance tools needed to catch terrorists and a vote to assure that those tools are not abused. I urge its bipartisan support.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him again for his service both on the Rules Committee and ongoing on the Intelligence Committee. 
   It is reassuring that the debate has quieted. As many people have said on both sides, this is a very serious subject. While we were having our break because of a computer glitch, I had the chance to sit on the floor and talk to many colleagues on a bipartisan basis about how this Member who has studied this issue for years sees it. 
   I point out to colleagues that the bill that has been distributed, H.R. 3356, says on page 2, section 105(a), ``a court order is not required for the acquisition of the contents of any communication between persons that are not located within the United States.'' 
   It is the intention of this bill, which will be made in order on the suspension calendar under the rule, to exempt foreign-to-foreign communications, and it is the intention, I believe, of every single person sitting here, several hundred of us, to exempt foreign-to-foreign communications from the warrant requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   What is really at issue, and I hope this will clarify the subject for some who are still wondering what it is, is whether or not we will have a court approve the parameters, the framework of this entire program, or whether we will leave the dimensions of the program and the activities under the program to the Attorney General or perhaps the Attorney General working with the Director of National Intelligence. 
   Some of us know the details of this program. It's a valuable program. It's very complicated, and it has many different parts. I, for one, thought that it was being regulated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act until I learned recently that the administration had chosen not to follow FISA. I think, and I would hope many on the other side would think, that we must have a legal framework around this program. No more blank checks for this Attorney General or for any future Attorneys General. 
   I urge approval of this rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his long service, both on the Intelligence and Rules Committees. 
   I am now the Chair of an Intelligence Subcommittee of Homeland Security. As no one in this Chamber would miss, security is my passion, and I think it is our primary obligation as Members of Congress. 
   I was sitting here listening to the discussion about where is the bill and why aren't we acting on FISA? It seems a little disingenuous, given the fact that the current ranking member on the Intelligence Committee and former chairman, has an article in USA Today in which he says that this move to get the administration to put its surveillance program under FISA ``gives legal protections to foreign enemies who would do us harm.'' 
   Excuse me? FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act passed by a large bipartisan majority in 1978. FISA was passed to assure that Americans, not foreigners, would have their constitutional rights protected when the U.S. engages, as it must, in foreign intelligence surveillance. 
   I don't think there is anyone here, not that I know of, who is against foreign intelligence surveillance. There is no one in this body, I haven't heard one person say that we think that when the U.S. engages in foreign intelligence surveillance, in foreign countries involving communications between foreigners in different foreign countries, that FISA applies. But FISA can and must apply when Americans' constitutional rights are at issue, and that is the issue we will debate a little bit later. 
   I want to say that it surprises me again that all of a sudden no one knows what we might be talking about. There have been intense negotiations, I have been a part of some of them, for months over what we might do to make FISA work better. In the 109th Congress, all nine Democrats on the Intelligence Committee authored legislation to help FISA work better; and in this Congress I'm aware of both closed and open hearings by the Intelligence Committee to carefully consider these issues. 
   So it seems to me quite surprising and disingenuous to hear that, for example, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee doesn't even feel that FISA protects Americans; he thinks that it coddles foreigners. 
   I am happy to yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Conyers for yielding to me and commend him, Chairman Reyes, and others for their work on this bill. 
   Though I no longer serve on the Intelligence Committee, I have followed this issue with intense interest. This bill contains many provisions that I and others authored over recent years. It is a strong bill and I strongly support it. 
   It amends FISA to permit more speed and agility in the effort to conduct surveillance of those who would do us harm, but it also provides more resources in a court-approved framework to assure that the constitutional rights of Americans are protected. 
   I continue to follow the intelligence in my role as Chair of the Homeland Security Intelligence Subcommittee, and threats against our homeland are real. Westerners are training in al Qaeda camps in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Europe, especially Britain, may experience more attacks. Plots have recently been foiled in Denmark and Germany. We helped Britain disrupt the so-called ``liquid bomb plot'' in August of 2006, a plot that could have killed more Americans than were killed on 9/11 as they flew on U.S.-bound airlines from England. 
   Mr. Speaker, all Members want to protect America. All Members want to protect America. So it deeply saddens me that this is yet another partisan debate. It could have been otherwise. 
   For several weeks, Pete Hoekstra, who chaired the Intelligence Committee when I was privileged to serve as ranking member, and I tried to fashion a bipartisan bill. Our list of principles could, I believe, have garnered broad support in both caucuses and led to a veto-proof majority in this House. 
   Americans want Congress on a bipartisan basis to assure we disrupt plots to harm us and protect our Constitution. We could do both and we must do both. This is a strong bill. It does both. Vote ``aye.''

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Harman-Ehlers amendment, and I'm pleased to be here on the House floor once again with my friend Vern Ehlers to call attention to a looming crisis in our aerospace industrial base. 
   I represent the heart of the space industrial base and have long called my district the satellite center of the universe. Most of the intelligence satellites built in the United States are built in my district, and that is why it was such an honor to serve for 8 years on the Intelligence Committee and why I'm so proud of the work the committee is doing. 
   I have always been mindful of the need for a skilled industrial base. Simply put, rocket scientists don't grow on trees. 
   Earlier this year, on a visit to a major aerospace firm in my district, there was a stark reminder of the crisis facing this industry.     
   Following a briefing on an important satellite program, I asked if any of the employees in attendance had anything to tell me. A 31-year-old engineer raised his hand and said, ``All my peers are gone.'' Engineers his age, he explained, are leaving the aerospace industry for other fields, and very few are taking their place. 
   The problem is two-fold. More than 60 percent of aerospace industry workers are over 45, and 26 percent of them are eligible for retirement this year. So the result is a looming demographic cliff that leaves the intelligence community and the industry without the intellectual capital necessary to keep pace with global competitors. There are many reasons for this. Part of it is the training we give kids in secondary school. Part of it is Congress and the Department of Defense, who don't necessarily provide predictable funding streams. 
   We saw the results of our failure in the 1990s, when we declared a peace dividend, cut our procurement budgets, then tried to do defense procurement and satellite manufacturing on the cheap, and guess what happened? Launch failures, performance problems, and engineers abandoning the industry in droves. We have finally managed to regrow some of these specialties just at a time when, again, because of age and because other careers are more sexy, we may lose these people forever. This will hurt our national security. And this is why our amendment  expresses the sense of Congress that a skilled workforce is essential to the intelligence community's success, and that the Director of National Intelligence should work cooperatively with other government agencies to sustain and expand a diverse workforce. 
   Mr. Chairman, before yielding to Mr. Ehlers, I would just like to say that so much in the Intelligence bill before us--like multilevel clearances, like very sensible comments on the National Applications Office, like prohibiting the use of contractors for CIA detainee interrogations, like the requirements for more briefings for more Members of the Intelligence Committee--are ideas that were generated some years back when I had the privilege of being ranking member on the committee. 
   The committee matters. Bipartisanship matters. I want to commend my coauthor for the enormous work he does on this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Chairman, in closing debate on this amendment, I would point out that one of the words in it, one of the things we hope to improve is ``diversity'' in the aerospace industrial base. This matters for lots of reasons. First of all, it reaches the whole talent pool in America, which is something we ought to be doing. But second, it matters because, as we've learned, to our detriment, a lot of the people we should be recruiting and retaining in intelligence fields, in aerospace and elsewhere lack the diversity necessary to penetrate the hard targets. 
   So I would call this a win-win. If America can't produce scientists and engineers to protect our national security, we are at grave risk. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote for this amendment. I urge an ``aye'' vote for the underlying bill and salute both the chairman and ranking member for bringing it to the floor on a bipartisan basis.

   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the chairman for yielding to me, and I commend him and the ranking member for crafting a very good bill. Many parts of this bill that reflect work we did together in  this committee in years past, and it's wonderful that we will act on it later this afternoon. 
   With respect to this amendment, I rise in reluctant opposition which I want to explain. I do understand the point that we should not be engaged in political correctness or censorship. I don't think my opposition is based on either of those things. 
   Former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld once wrote a snowflake which asked, Are we capturing and killing them faster than they are rising up against us? The answer was no, and it's still no. 
   It does matter that we try to win the argument, and not just with the next generation who could become suicide bombers or build the next lethal generation of IEDs, but we win the argument with moderate Muslims, many of whom live in the United States and want to help us. 
   And their guidance has gone into this guidance, published by the Homeland Security Department, which is that we not use language that inflames. 
   To the gentleman from Michigan, there is no prohibition in this to quoting the statements of Osama bin Laden and others who use these hateful words. Why would we want to sensor that? The prohibition is directed at ourselves, words that will inflame the very communities we're trying to convince. 
   I would just close with the observation that if we had thought a little longer about using the phrase ``axis of evil'' we might have, it seems to me, engendered more cooperation on the part of some countries that have, sadly, moved far away from us, and engendered more cooperation on the part of populations which now look at America with disapproval.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hastings for yielding to me and commend him for his continued service both on the Intelligence Committee and on the Rules Committee. 
   As you heard, I served the past 8 years on the Intelligence Committee, the last 4 as ranking member. I loved that opportunity, and I remain passionate about the issues. I believe that there is nothing more central to our roles in Congress than to keep our country safe. And that committee has crucial jurisdiction. 
   I would respectfully disagree with the comments of the last speaker, Mrs. Wilson. I have been briefed longer than she has on how the so-called NSA program operates. I believed then and I believe now that it can and must fully comply with FISA, a law that has been modernized 12 times since 9/11 through changes we have made which I supported in the PATRIOT Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and of H.R. 2082. In my current role as Chair of the Homeland Security Intelligence Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment Subcommittee, I continue to review intelligence reports and to talk to our key security professionals. And, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned. We have surged our intelligence resources into Iraq, where they are necessarily focused on the tactical needs of warfighters. Meanwhile, al Qaeda has gained strength and is inspiring new cells worldwide. We have taken our eye off the ball. That ball is al Qaeda. 
   Mr. Speaker, we should all be worried that terrorist cells are here in the United States, right now, waiting for the right moment to strike. We have yet to develop a truly effective system for sharing time-sensitive intelligence about terror plots with first responders, whom I would like to believe could be first preventers. 
   Even at the Federal level, a variety of data bases, classifications, and pseudo-classification systems could still, 5 1/2 years after 9/11, prevent us from connecting the dots. We have yet to develop an adequate strategy to counter radicalization in our prisons and in our communities. The events at Cherry Hill, New Jersey, earlier this week are the latest example. And we have not yet broken into the inner circle of the senior al Qaeda leadership even though we have been at this for more than 5 years. These problems are urgent as we could be attacked at any time. 
   I recently reviewed the classified annex to this bill and continue to pay special attention to our technical satellite programs. Changes to these programs cannot be discussed in an unclassified setting such as this; but I want to reiterate my long-held view that the women and men who build these systems constitute a major strategic asset of the United States. Rocket scientists do not grow on trees, and we must keep them highly trained and highly motivated. Without their help, we could literally lose our ability to see, hear, and communicate. 
   Finally, I strongly support the effort to develop a National Intelligence Estimate on climate change. Changes in our climate will affect critical resources such as water, food, and arable land, as we are seeing now in Darfur and in many parts of Africa. Droughts affect the stability of governments, and the stability of governments is one of the key things we need to know about through our intelligence. This isn't bugs and bunnies, or even Bugs Bunny. It is survival or destruction. And if we make responsible moves now, our grandchildren will benefit. 
   Mr. Speaker, by supporting this legislation, the Congress stands with the extraordinary women and men of our intelligence community who often serve in austere locations on unaccompanied assignments. I am one of the few here who know these people and know where they serve. I say to them, our Nation owes you our gratitude; hopefully, this bill provides the support and tools you need as well as honors your sacrifice. 
   I urge support of the rule. I urge support of the underlying legislation, and I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.

   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his leadership as chairman of the committee. 
   Madam Chair, I spoke earlier during the rule about the specifics in this bill, a bill I strongly support. But as the debate closes, I thought I might offer just two thoughts from my vantage point as someone who has served on this committee for so long and who passionately cares about the issues. 
   The first is I believe al Qaeda is here and waiting to attack us. I believe America is in danger, and if we don't get our intelligence right both internationally and domestically, we will be attacked. We will fail to prevent or disrupt the harm that is coming our way. That is why it is so critical that we pass the best bill that we can. 
   My second point is that I have never seen, and I have sat through these debates for many years, the kind of partisanship we are now seeing in debate on the intelligence authorization bill. It breaks my heart. 
   And if there is someone out there in an austere, unaccompanied post watching C-SPAN, if C-SPAN is available, and looking at this debate, that person must wonder: Why can't Congress come together and protect America at a time of urgent need? And I have to say, I am wondering, too. It is very disappointing to see the partisanship. It is very disappointing to hear that members I served with are going to oppose this bill. I hope they will reconsider. It is very important to reach consensus and pass the strongest bill possible.

   Tom was eloquent, passionate, insightful, elegant--and fierce in his advocacy. His questions of witnesses before his committee could be withering. He had a point of view and was unblinking in his efforts to communicate it. 
   In personal terms, Tom was a lovely human being--devoted to Annette, his daughters and that enormous crowd of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. But he was also devoted to his colleagues, this institution, to our country, and to achieving peace in the Middle East. 
   At a time of such entrenched partisanship--which he deplored--we desperately need more, not fewer, Toms. Sadly, that is not likely to happen.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Madam Speaker, my phones are ringing off the hook, and my e-mail accounts are full. By the hundreds and hundreds, my constituents are saying, ``don't cave in,'' ``don't toss due process out the window,'' ``no compromise on our civil liberties'' and ``all surveillance of Americans should require a warrant.'' One of the most powerful, ``The U.S. Constitution has been `marked up.' Don't shred it.'' 
   I agree, now and always. The hard part is deciding whether the FISA compromise before us meets my constituents' requirements and my own. 
   After reading every word of it, and after many, many hours working to develop and revise portions of it, I conclude that the compromise replaces bad law, the Protect America Act, with law that actually improves many of the provisions of the underlying FISA law which has served our country well for three decades. 
   Let me highlight three issues. 
   First, this bill makes clear that no president can ignore it ever again. FISA is the exclusive means by which our government can conduct surveillance. In short, no more warrantless surveillance. 
   Second, it expands the circumstances for which individual warrants are required, by including Americans outside the U.S., and it protects Americans from so-called reverse targeting. 
   Third, it requires Federal court review to determine whether communications firms, which assisted in post-9/11 activities, get civil liability protection. If the evidence is inadequate, courts can deny immunity, and immunity does not cover government officials who may have violated the law. 
   I have lived with FISA up close and personal for many years. I am angry about the way the Bush administration abused it and disrespected Congress. My constituents are right to demand that Congress show courage and stand up for the Constitution. Security and liberty are reinforcing values, not a zero-sum gain. This bill, though imperfect, protects both.

   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Chairman, as the majority leader pointed out several minutes ago, yesterday the FBI arrested six men following a 15-month investigation. The charges are that, inspired by al Qaeda, they were bent on taking out as many soldiers as possible at Fort Dix using semiautomatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Three of them were in this country illegally. The other three were American citizens. All lived unremarkable lives and seemed well integrated into their communities. Even their next-door neighbors had no reason to suspect that they were actually the vanguard of a new breed of terrorist. 
   In Torrance, California, in my congressional district, four members of a prison-based jihadist cell await trial on charges of conspiring to wage war against the U.S. Government through terrorism, kill members of the Armed Forces, and murder foreign officials. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is our future. Protecting the homeland, preventing and disrupting the next terrorist attack is the primary responsibility of the Homeland Security Committee, and I congratulate Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King for putting together this authorization bill. 
   The bill strengthens homeland security by expanding on successful ideas like fusion centers and strengthening our infrastructure. 
   Many in this Chamber are focused on our broken Iraq policy. So am I. But I also worry that, while we are consumed with the Iraq debate, al Qaeda and its friends are successfully expanding and adapting in ways that are long-term, global and enormously dangerous. Al Qaeda has proven that the brand is ``portable.'' Its embrace of low-tech, unspectacular operations makes it much harder to stop. 
   Why haven't we been attacked here? Some say al Qaeda is waiting to exceed the lethality of 9/11. But if the U.S. is perceived as weaker and bogged down in Iraq and if terrorists are scaling down attacks, an attack or series of near-simultaneous attacks here seems inevitable. 
   The Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence, which I chair, is focused on the threat of homegrown terrorism and improving ways to disrupt and prevent the next attack. If the terrorists are here, the activities of that subcommittee are critical. 
   This bill helps us build our intelligence competence. It strengthens parts of the budget that are underfunded and authorizes crucial activities. Vote ``aye.''

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2956, RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would point out to our colleagues that the action just described in my view is not necessary. 
   I rise in support of the rule, the underlying bill, and in strong support for ending our combat mission in Iraq and redirecting our efforts towards stability in the region, including Iraq, but also in trouble spots like Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
   Let me make three points. 
   First, based on firsthand experience from my fourth visit to Iraq just weeks ago, Baghdad is not safer. True, we have worked successfully with tribal leaders against al Qaeda in Anbar Province, but the major population center, Baghdad, the focus of our military surge, is not turning around. Progress will not be made by a continuation of our combat mission. 
   Second, the Skelton bill mirrors a companion bill in the other body which has impressive bipartisan support. I urge Republicans to support this measure, and know that some will do so. 
   The message our constituents want to hear is that 290 of us, a veto-proof bipartisan majority, insist on a responsible end to our combat mission in Iraq beginning now with passage of this bill. 
   Third, though I feel Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff's use of the words ``gut feeling'' was unwise, I share  the view that our country could be attacked at any time. Al Qaeda has regrouped in Pakistan and expanded its reach throughout North Africa. Homegrown cells in England and elsewhere are increasing, and our assumption must be that they are here as well. 
   Low-tech, low-scale vehicle-borne attacks are, sadly, not hard to execute. At a minimum, those, and attacks on soft targets like our mass transit systems, may be in our near future. 
   DHS, FBI and our exceptionally talented local police departments are working overtime, though their ranks are depleted and their equipment and they are surged in Iraq. But 100 percent protection is impossible. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is where our attention must be, and our resources. Pass the Skelton bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission has been a passion for me, to honor the memories of those who tragically and needlessly died on that day, to show respect for their amazing families, and to keep our country safe. 
   My roles as coauthor of the intelligence reform legislation and lead House cosponsor with Mr. Hoekstra on its conference was a personal highlight of my service here, and I'm honored to be a conferee on this bill and to stand with Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King in support of it. 
   The report passed the Senate 85-8 last night. Are people seriously going to oppose a bill to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission? 
   Sure, there's more to do. But here are many terrific things in this bill. Number 1, it improves vertical information sharing between the Federal intelligence officials and local first responders, crucial if we're to prevent future attacks, a growing possibility according to the recently released NIE on terrorism. The next attacks could be anywhere. We need our capable first preventers to have accurate and actionable information. 
   Second, it will reform the Visa Waiver Program which, I agree, as it currently operates, is a potential loophole. I worry that a terrorist trained in the Pakistani tribal areas and traveling on a British passport could use that program to come here and to enable a homegrown cell to conduct an effective operation against Americans in America. We need to tighten that program, and this bill does it. 
   There are things that are not in this bill. I still think we need more reorganization of Congress, and I also think that the legislation proposed by all nine Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee last year to provide an expedited emergency warrant process under FISA should be enacted by this House. That's all the reform of FISA we need. We have authority now to listen to foreigners abroad, despite some claims by the other side. The only thing necessary are procedural reforms, and we should enact them promptly.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the Chairman for yielding to me. I spoke on the rule  about the merits of this bill and commended him for the job that he has done leading the Homeland Security committee in this Congress. 
   I rise again to clarify something. It seems a shame to me that this good bill is being disparaged. Claims are being made that we have no ability now, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, to intercept foreign-to-foreign communications. That is false. Foreign-to-foreign communications are not covered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA. We can intercept them, and we should be intercepting them vigorously right now. The question comes up only in circumstances when FISA is triggered because a U.S. person is involved. But in that circumstance, we should still intercept those communications, and we should then be getting emergency warrants, a limited number of individualized emergency warrants when an American is involved. That can happen now under FISA, which has been modernized many times since 9/11. If additional resources are needed to implement the emergency warrant section of FISA, legislation proposed by the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee last year should be enacted.

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker and I thank the gentleman for yielding, and commend our leadership for organizing this very thoughtful and sober 3-day debate on a very serious issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Co-chair of the Blue Dog National Security Working Group, I rise to oppose the surge and to support tough and smart security strategies, including those outlined in H. Res. 97, authored by the Blue Dogs, to end war profiteering, put future war costs on budget, and adopt a Truman Committee to make those who have engaged in fraud and abuse in Iraq accountable for their actions. 
   As we conduct this historic debate, however, I am mindful that, eight time zones away, crouched in a tank somewhere in Baghdad, a 19-year-old private is doing his best to restore order to a city descending into all-out civil war. We owe this soldier, his mates, and their families so much. They volunteered to put their lives on the line to keep this country safe. 
   We in this Chamber also want to keep this country safe, but we do not share those day-to-day risks. Only a handful here have relatives in Iraq living the life of the soldier I described. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we have sadly learned, the intelligence that took us to war was wrong. Some of the most inaccurate claims--that an operational relationship existed between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, that vast WMD stockpiles existed with their locations pinpointed--were presented by the administration as fact, even though the Intelligence Community had discredited them. That was shameful. 
   Most intelligence agencies around the world thought, however, that Saddam Hussein had WMD and the intention to use it against his people and U.S. interests. They believed it, and so did I. But they were wrong, and so was I. 
   The actions taken 4 years ago in Iraq created a failed state. We took out its government and occupied the country, unsuccessfully. About one year later, millions of Iraqis courageously elected a government, but that government barely functions, and we continue to occupy Iraq militarily. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are no good military options left in Iraq. 
   To the soldier currently in harm's way, I say, ``You are a hero. You are doing your best to follow orders and to serve your country.'' But I also say, ``We have given you a mission impossible, and that mission must change.'' 
   We have a moral obligation to leave Iraq in better shape than we found it, and that will not be achieved by surging 21,500 more troops into Baghdad. The surge will not work, and I oppose it. 
   But abandoning Iraq is not a viable alternative. We must invest in strategies to contain and ultimately reduce violence there in order to create stability in Iraq and in the region. That must now be our focus. 
   The Iraq Study Group made important recommendations to do this, including changing the military mission in Iraq; tying future U.S. support to measurable progress on national reconciliation; security and governance; and aggressive diplomatic outreach to Iraq's neighbors--including Syria and Iran. But this administration rejected them. 
   Two weeks ago, a Saban Center report by Daniel Byman and Ken Pollack carefully assessed options to contain the spillover from an Iraqi civil war. They include not trying to pick winners between the Sunnis and Shia; pulling back from population centers; providing support for Iraq's neighbors; and laying down ``red lines'' to Iran. All of these ideas have merit. 
   Further good ideas come from David Schaeffer, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, to put the Iraqi Government on an ``atrocity watch'' and warn its leaders that they can be prosecuted for war crimes if ethnic cleansing occurs. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration has made calamitous mistakes in  prosecuting this war. The surge, I fear, is yet another one. With this resolution, Congress starts action to force a change in strategy and to bring that soldier in downtown Baghdad and his comrades home safely--and soon

<DOCNO>Ms. HARMAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2638, CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HARMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. He is one of the most conscientious Members of this House, and I enjoy being his partner and working together.     
   Mr. Speaker, there is much to admire and support in this Continuing Appropriations Act. As usual, Chairmen Murtha and Edwards have crafted excellent Defense and MilCon-VA appropriations bills. Disaster relief and  LIHEAP funding are critical to support, and I'm aware of many other efforts by Chairman Obey to make this CR help those in need. 
   But the act contains two huge flaws which I would like to speak to this morning. First, the homeland security portion of the bill effectively allows some funding for the hastily erected and legally suspect National Applications Office, or NAO. The NAO is intended to make feed from U.S. defense intelligence satellites, our most powerful spy satellites, available to DHS and, in the future, to State and local law enforcement. The specific capabilities of these satellites are classified, but I can say that their ability to capture detailed visual data about activities on the ground is truly stunning. 
   Before we stand up a new office to turn these powerful satellites toward America, I believe there must be a comprehensive legal framework in place to protect the rights and liberties of Americans. As we speak, that comprehensive framework does not exist. 
   I agree with the GAO, which recently completed a study of the NAO, and concluded that ``DHS has not fully justified its certification that the NAO complies with applicable laws.'' The GAO says there are significant unresolved legal and policy issues regarding the use of satellite images in law enforcement. There are weak management controls to ensure compliance with the law, and unaddressed privacy and civil liberty concerns. 
   Second, on a different topic, Mr. Speaker, I am dismayed, as are many of my constituents, that this act allows the moratorium on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf to lapse. That moratorium has been in place for two decades in Republican and Democratic administrations and Republican and Democratic Congresses. 
   I know that this lapse is not the favored outcome of many in my party, and I recognize that a new President could reverse it, but that doesn't mean we should signal we are ready even now to impose drilling as close as 3 miles off our coasts when a State does not want that drilling. I am aware that the Republican Governor in my State does not want that drilling. 
   According to the Bush administration's own Energy Information Administration, if we open the entire Outer Continental Shelf for drilling tomorrow, we could expect an increased domestic production of 200,000 barrels of oil per day by 2030. The world consumes around 80 million barrels of oil per day today, and so the impact on oil prices from such a minuscule increase would be, and I quote the Bush administration, ``insignificant.'' 
   And what do we risk for this ``insignificant'' increase in supply? Well, we risk thousands of miles of environmentally sensitive and economically indispensable coastline in California, South Carolina, Florida and elsewhere, and we increase our carbon footprint. These are not risks we should take, Mr. Speaker.
