<DOCNO>Mrs. TAUSCHER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today as the Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. Passage of today's legislation will give working Americans a basic right--the ability to choose, unabated, whether to join with their coworkers and bargain for a better life. As Americans strive for fairer treatment at work and greater economic prosperity, it is a right which we must not deny them. There is powerful evidence that America's middle class is stronger when workers join together and bargain for better wages, better working conditions and better benefits. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are thirty percent higher than nonunion workers'. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance. And sixty-eight percent of union workers have a guaranteed pension through a defined benefit pension plan. 
   Contrary to what opponents of the legislation will say, the Employee Free Choice Act does not mandate that workers join a union. It does not abolish the secret ballot election process. And it will not make union organization more vulnerable to fraud and coercion. It will, however, provide American workers with a choice--a choice and a hand in determining their future economic prosperity. This is the least we can do for America's workers. I strongly encourage all my Colleagues to join with me and support H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act.

<DOCNO>Mrs. TAUSCHER. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chair, I want to thank the chairman and Subcommittee Chairwoman Johnson for the opportunity to speak, and for their leadership in support of the Water Quality Financing Act. And as has been said, this legislation will provide $14 billion to deserving communities and water agencies. 
   The State Revolving Fund continues to be one of the most efficient and practical Federal funding programs for water reconstruction and infrastructure projects in local communities. 
   I have been a long supporter of reauthorizing the Clean Water SRF and infusing much-needed funding into our Nation's clean water infrastructure. In the last four Congresses, I have joined with my colleague, former Congresswoman Sue Kelly, to offer legislation to reauthorize the SRF program. Unfortunately, the Republican-controlled Congress never acted on this important legislation. 
   Today's legislation finally gives us the opportunity to do the right thing. It is imperative that Congress continues our partnership with communities to fund Federal clean water mandates in the most cost efficient manner possible. As a loan fund and not a grant program, the Clean Water SRF promotes fiscal responsibility without denying communities the opportunity to refurbish, rehabilitate or rebuild new water infrastructure. Whether used for funding wastewater treatment or non-point source pollution control, the SRF is a useful tool in providing cleaner, safer water in our communities. 
   The EPA has identified billions of dollars in water infrastructure needs. It's time that we act responsibly and reauthorize this important program. As stewards of the Clean Water Act, we have the responsibility to provide for infrastructure necessary to ensure its proper implementation. Today's legislation gets us back on track. 
   Madam Chair, there will be much discussion about the inclusion of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage language in this bill. In my view, the verdict is in. Protecting Davis-Bacon and the prevailing wage laws it supports are a national priority. This is evidenced by over half the States, including mine, California, passing their own prevailing wage laws. And importantly, Madam Chairman, it is clear a majority of the House supports Davis-Bacon. 
   I look forward to joining a bipartisan majority of the House today in taking a strong stand and rejecting any attempt to limit the application of Davis-Bacon protections. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 720.

<DOCNO>Mrs. TAUSCHER. (RECOUNTING REASONS FOR VOTING IN FAVOR OF 2002 RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING USE OF MILITARY FORCE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Speaker, let me first thank my friend and colleague from California for her passion and her presence and for her leadership and also my other colleague BARBARA LEE and for LYNN WOOLSEY and so many of my colleagues who have been indefatigable, unrelenting and brilliant in their insistence that we continue to put pressure on the administration and the President specifically for the litany of mistakes that have been made in Iraq, but at the same time holding deeply in our hearts the fighting men and women that come from all of our neighborhoods, come from all of our communities. For your patriotism, I cannot thank you enough. For your leadership and friendship, I will always be indebted. 
   Madam Speaker, I cannot and will not support putting more American troops on the ground in Iraq. I stand here today more convinced than ever that the President's so-called new plan to send over 21,000 additional American troops to Iraq will only lead to further chaos. 
   My opposition to this troop surge is built upon years of hearings in the House Armed Services Committee, where I serve as subcommittee chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, congressional briefings and five trips to the region, including three to Iraq, witnessing the war firsthand and speaking with our troops and commanders on the ground. 
   Sadly, the President has gotten it very wrong every step of the way. Yet he continues to ask us to trust him. 
   When the Republican-controlled Congress was rushing a vote to authorize the war in the middle of 2002's campaign season, I joined my friend DENNIS KUCINICH to call on the Republican leadership to take the politics out of the vote, take the decision to send our troops into harm's way seriously and postpone the vote until after the election. 
   We wrote to our colleagues in October of 2002: ``It is incumbent upon us to address the matters of national security and decisions through the reasoned and deliberate process afforded us by our Constitution. This becomes particularly important when these decisions could possibly mean putting our young servicemen and women in harm's way. This is not a process that can be rushed for the sake of political expediency.'' 
   Our best attempts failed. Congress was rushed to a vet, and we had no opportunity to sort through what we now know was the Bush administration's personal collection of cherry-picked or just plain false intelligence. 
   The President made it clear that he wanted to rush to invade Iraq and prevent international weapons inspectors from finishing their job. 
   I spoke out at the time saying, ``We must consider every peaceful alternative and contemplate every possible outcome before we turn to force.'' 
   Our warnings were again ignored. In February of 2003, I co-authored legislation that would have required the President to submit a public report to Congress prior to initiating military action in Iraq. 
   Our bill said: ``The United States should not proceed with unilateral or preemptive military action in Iraq, but if we do have to go to war to disarm Saddam, Congress needs to be sure there are sensible plans that will not compromise our ability to prosecute the War on Terror elsewhere or further destabilize an already volatile region.'' 
   That same month, when then-Secretary of State Colin Powell presented the United Nations with the Bush administration's case on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, I again said, ``I continue to believe that the United States should not proceed with unilateral or preemptive military action.'' 
   After the invasion, I remained concerned about the Bush administration's rush to war, and in July 2003 I authored legislation to create a select committee to hold public hearings to investigate several aspects of intelligence, including whether intelligence supported the claim that Iraq was an imminent threat to the United States, questioning the accuracy of intelligence that led the administration to believe Iraq was working with al Qaeda, and questioning the role of the Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon. 
   The Republican-controlled Congress at the time would not allow my bill to see the light of day. 
   In September 2003, the President requested an additional $87 billion to finance the war. In response, I authored legislation calling for explanations, noting that ``President Bush has not yet provided Congress with a 
   detailed plan that outlines the strategic objectives of Operation Iraqi Freedom.'' 
   I have sent dozens of letters to the President, Secretary Rice, Secretary Rumsfeld and others over the past 4 1/2 years urging them to explain our mission and exit strategy for Iraq. I have offered suggestions to stabilize Iraq and bring our troops home sooner. Yet I have received few answers. 
   Last week, I watched the President plead his case to the American people, trying to justify why more troops will save his failed policy. But yet again I was disappointed by the stubbornness exhibited by a President that has failed in Iraq every step of the way. 
   I have stated throughout the timeline of the war that the Commander-in-Chief has the responsibility to define a well-articulated mission that has the support of the American people and an exit strategy to bring our troops home sooner and safer. The President has neither. 
   Top military commanders in Iraq, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and the American people all agree that sending more troops to Iraq will not end the civil war. They understand that we should immediately begin a strategic redeployment of U.S. troops in conjunction with diplomacy that forces Iraq's neighbors to step up as responsible regional partners. 
   Adding additional troops further prevents the Iraqi government from taking responsibility for securing their own country. If the President sidesteps the Congress, he does this at his own peril, and sadly, he does it with the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families paying the highest price. 
   This is why I am an original cosponsor of the Meehan legislation that requires the President to ask Congress  for an up-or-down vote if he plans to raise troop levels in Iraq. 
   I am not advocating cutting funds for the troops while they are in harm's way, but I am an advocate of conditioning all further spending for the Iraq War based on the Iraqis meeting security and political benchmarks and establishing a plan for the redeployment of our troops. 
   I will continue to challenge the President to abandon his flawed troop surge policy, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. We owe it to our troops, to the American people and to our conscience.

<DOCNO>Mrs. TAUSCHER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to lend my strong support to this bipartisan resolution supporting our men and women in uniform and opposing the President's decision to send more troops into Iraq. 
   Last year, Congress united across party lines to say loudly and clearly, the year of 2006 must be a year of significant transition in Iraq. Rather than chart a new course, the President is proposing more of the same. His actions will only deepen America's involvement in Iraq's civil war. 
   Instead of acknowledging the facts on the ground, instead of listening to the combatant commanders and the Iraq Study Group and instead of hearing the American people's call for change, the President has once again chosen to stick to his failed policies, and now he has raised the risk by insisting more U.S. troops head to Iraq. 
   It has been 4 years, Mr. President. The American people have every right to expect a change of course in Iraq, and it is your responsibility to them and our men and women in uniform to stop fighting Iraq's civil war. 
   As General Odom, the former head of the National Security Agency under President Reagan, wrote this weekend, unless Congress speaks up, and I quote, we may be doomed to 2 more years of chasing a mirage in Iraq and possibly widening the war to Iran. We cannot let that happen. Sending more U.S. troops to Iraq will not stabilize it or the region as a whole. As the latest National Intelligence Estimate makes clear, Iraq is becoming more polarized and violent, not less. Sending more American troops to Iraq without stronger Iraqi leadership will only lead to further chaos. 
   My consistent opposition to this troop surge is built upon years of hearings in the House Armed Services Committee, congressional briefings and five trips to the region, including three to Iraq, witnessing the war firsthand and speaking with our troops and commanders on the ground. 
   I have watched the President plead his case to the American people, trying to justify why more troops will save his failed policy; but I am consistently disappointed by the stubbornness exhibited by an administration that has failed every step of the way. 
   I have stated from the beginning of the war that the Commander in Chief has the responsibility to define a well-articulated mission that has the support of the American people and an exit strategy to bring our troops home sooner and safer. He has neither. 
   Top military commanders in Iraq, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and the American people all agree that sending more troops to Iraq will not end the civil war. They understand the Iraqi Government needs to take responsibility for securing their own country, and we should immediately begin a strategic redeployment of U.S. troops in conjunction with diplomacy that forces Iraq's neighbors to step up as regional, responsible partners. 
   If the President sidesteps the Congress, he does so at his own peril; and, sadly, it is the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families who will pay the highest price.     
   I believe it is grossly irresponsible to send more troops to Iraq when only two thirds of our Army's up-armored Humvees in Iraq and Afghanistan have been fitted with the latest anti-IED protective kits. That is over 4,000 Humvees without the right equipment. 
   General Pace has indicated that all armored vehicles will not be up-armored until July, well after the President's surge has occurred. 
   This is why I am an original cosponsor of the Meehan legislation that requires the President to ask Congress for an up-or-down vote if he plans to raise troop levels in Iraq and why I am proud to support this legislation today. 
   I will continue to challenge the President to abandon his flawed troop surge policy, and I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. We owe it to our troops and to our conscience.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. If the gentleman will yield, I just wanted to respond, since you were so nice to quote me. 
   Mr. Speaker, the truth is, as we all know, the Iraq Study Group had a very comprehensive strategy, but it was a radical departure from what the President is proposing today in this surge. I think there was some, you know, 70-plus recommendations in the Iraq Study Group, including shifting the mission to training of the Iraqi Security Forces and a big emphasis on diplomacy. So I don't think it is fair for the gentleman to cherry-pick a paragraph out of what the Iraq Study Group says. 
   But with all due respect, I will tell you what the Iraq Study Group recommended is not what the President is doing now. Frankly, the President has rejected the Iraq Study Group recommendations, and I think that to suggest that he is going along with the Iraq Study Group recommendations is really not correct.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Speaker, at this time I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I was interested in my colleague, the last speaker's questions, the question about why do we have a nonbinding resolution and does it have any significance. I should say, no one should minimize the significance of this resolution. Passage by a bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives of this resolution opposing the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq would be a major turning point in the war debate. 
   Despite the fact that it is nonbinding, passage would have enormous significance. This bipartisan resolution is serving as the basis for the first real debate on the President's flawed Iraq war policy since the war began nearly 4 years ago. Last November, the voters sent President Bush a loud and unmistakable message about Iraq, but the President didn't listen. 
   As his announcement of an escalation of the war showed, passage of this bipartisan resolution is a second  chance for the President to hear a strong, clear message that cannot be ignored. Passage of this bipartisan resolution will send another clear message: No more blank checks for the President on Iraq. 
   In addition, passage of a nonbinding resolution opposing the President's escalation plan is only the first step in the Congress, demanding a changing of course in Iraq. When this resolution containing fewer than 100 words passes, we will take the country in a new direction in Iraq. A vote of disapproval will set the stage for additional legislation, which will be coming to the House floor. 
   Furthermore, what is surprising, as I see my colleagues from the other side trot forward one after another, I have to remind them that in their 12 years in the majority, House Republicans passed hundreds, hundreds of nonbinding resolutions, including in very similar situations. 
   For example, on October 30, 1995, the House Republican leadership brought to the floor and passed H. Res. 247, a nonbinding resolution repudiating President Clinton's pledge to deploy up to 20,000 troops to Bosnia as part of a peacekeeping force. I will remind my colleagues, Kosovo is about to be declared independent because the United States and NATO countries interceded and stopped the genocide there. That is a perfect example of wrongheaded policy that Democrats were able to put forward. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time, I am happy to yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I just want to rise to close this debate from our side and say how impressed I have been by the debate that I have heard today. It has been about 11 hours. We are going to have tomorrow and debate on Friday and Thursday, and this is the first real serious debate we have had about the President's policies in Iraq since the vote in October of 2002. 
   This week the House is considering a bipartisan resolution introduced by Representative IKE SKELTON of Missouri, TOM LANTOS of California, and WALTER JONES of North Carolina, which supports our troops and opposes the President's plan to add 21,500 more combat troops in Iraq. 
   People have talked quite a lot tonight about the size and the scope of the resolution, but it is elegant and it is certainly spare in the fact that it is about 100 words, but it is significant because of what it says. 
   The resolution is very straightforward. It says: 
   ``Resolved by the House of Representatives that: 
   ``(1) Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in Iraq; and 
   ``(2) Congress disapproves of the decision by President George W. Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq.'' 
   Those supporting this bipartisan resolution strongly support our troops and our veterans. Let us be clear on this one fundamental principle. We are honoring the service of our troops by asking the difficult questions about this war. In conducting this debate, we must be ever mindful of the sacrifices our military personnel and their families are making during this war and the toll it is taking on them and their families and our veterans. Each Member must determine for themselves, in a manner worthy of our troop's sacrifice, whether the President's plan will succeed in making Iraq more stable. 
   I, for one, do not believe it will, and I strongly believe and hope that my colleagues will support this resolution and the debate that is coming forth in the next 2 days

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 853, introduced by my good friend and distinguished Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. 
   This resolution honors thousands of volunteers who helped clean up the Bay Area's beaches and wildlife after the harmful oil spill of November 7 of this year. The public's response to 58,000 gallons of fuel polluting the bay typified how the San Francisco Bay community comes together during a crisis. Our Bay Area constituents were eager to volunteer their time and help minimize the negative effects to the Bay Area's fragile ecosystem. For days and days after the spill, they cleaned birds and combed the shoreline for oil residue, and in some cases put their own health at risk in order to protect our bay. 
   In order to coordinate the volunteer efforts, numerous organizations mobilized their members in support of the cleanup, including Save the Bay, the Fishermen's Association and the Crab Boat Owners. I am so proud of our Bay Area constituents, how much energy they showed, how much passion they showed, and such dedication that they showed to the bay during this environmental disaster. These volunteers deserve recognition from the House of Representatives. 
   I strongly support House Resolution 853. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, I want to speak personally from my position as someone who lives in the Bay Area. I live on the east bay in Alamo, California, far from where the spill was. But I have to tell you that of the 8 or 9 million people that live in the Bay Area, not one single one was completely unaffected by what happened on this terrible day of November 7. Many of us are deeply concerned that this was an accident that shouldn't have happened, that this was something that may have been prevented. And I have to commend the Speaker and the delegation from the Bay Area for moving very quickly on a bipartisan basis to begin hearings to be sure that we actually know what exactly happened so that it can be prevented in the future. But today we're really here to celebrate the thousands of Bay Area members that came forward so quickly to volunteer to assist in the cleanup of the bay at a time when it was in great jeopardy, at a time when they put their own health at risk when, for many of them, it was as simple as just going down the road to the beach near their house and attempting to do whatever kind of cleanup they could have. 
   The environmental impact of the spill is still being felt, and certainly for the wildlife of the Bay Area, it is still a question of how many will survive in the long term. When you have this kind of bunker oil, which is pretty toxic stuff, come into the bay and flow on to these wild fowl and other animals, it puts them in great jeopardy. 
   We believe that in San Francisco the bay is a national treasure. We believe it is not only a source of environmental pride, but it is also a place where many thousands of San Franciscans and Bay Area people work. We have obviously a very big crab industry, a big fishing industry; and tourism, of course, is a big part of what we do in the Bay Area. So we are deeply concerned about what happened on November 7. 
   But I think that this is a good time to celebrate the activism and the volunteerism of people of the Bay Area and the San Francisco area. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Saving Energy through Public Transportation Act. 
   My constituents are struggling to pay rising gas prices caused in part by wild speculation in oil markets. By providing greater access to public transportation we can reduce the demand for oil and help lower the price of gasoline. With increased use of public transit, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen the economy by removing congestion from our already crowded roads. 
   I would like to thank Chairman OBERSTAR for including the ``Capital Cost of Contracting'' pilot program in this bill. Congressman MIKE ROGERS and I have long supported this program. 
   The provision makes it easier for employers and communities to offer vanpool services by leveraging their investment with Federal transit funds. By doing this, we can lower the cost of joining a vanpool and increase services nationwide. It is estimated that full adoption of this program could triple vanpooling across the Nation. This would conserve over 500 million gallons of fuel per year and greatly reduce harmful emissions. I appreciate the inclusion of this provision in the bill and applaud Chairman OBERSTAR for his determined efforts to provide public transit to more Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment has been discussed with the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, and I understand it is acceptable to the chairman and the ranking member. 
   Before explaining my amendment, I want to congratulate Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Hobson for the bill before the House today. It is a strong testament to their talents. Among its achievements, the bill provides substantial increases for two broad national priorities that I have long championed, nuclear nonproliferation activities to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the materials and technologies that be can used to create such weapons, and scientific research on technologies to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy and on fossil fuels in general. 
   The committee report takes a series of bold actions involving the Nation's nuclear weapons program, including directing the Department of Energy to reevaluate its plans for modernizing the nuclear weapons complex and demanding rapid consolidation of weapons-usable nuclear material. I want to commend the Energy and Water Subcommittee for their fine work. 
   The bill also provides critical funding increases to a lesser known national priority, the National Ignition Campaign, which is being carried out at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in my district. When the NIF is completed in fiscal year 2009, it will be a scientific tool unlike anything the world has ever seen. 
   The National Ignition Facility will give U.S. scientists unprecedented insight into nuclear weapons phenomena, without nuclear explosions, and thus play a crucial role in the science-based stockpile stewardship program, which ensures the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing. I commend the committee for its support of this critically important program. 
   I do need to mention, however, that the report accompanying the bill includes a few instances where I believe the Appropriations Committee ventured beyond what was authorized in  the weapons activities account by the House Armed Services Committee, where I serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. 
   Directing the relocation of the long-planned Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility, commencing weapons disassembly activities at the Nevada Test site without a feasibility assessment, and initiating a major new construction project at the Idaho National Lab are all examples of actions that would be more appropriately dealt with by the authorizing committee. 
   Separately, by cutting the funds for the mixed oxide fuel facility while demanding improved execution on the project, I believe it sets up an unfair task for the Energy Department. Having said that, Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Hobson, as well as our staff, have been very open to dialogue on these issues, and I truly, truly appreciate that. 
   My amendment modifies the bill to address two actions recommended by the committee report. First, the amendment confirms that the pit facility will be located at the Savannah River site. The site was selected by a former record of decision that was issued in 2000, which was in turn based on the environmental impact statement completed in 1999. 
   And second, the amendment directs that weapons dismantlement activities funded by the bill to be conducted at sites authorized to conduct such activity. 
   I want to sincerely thank the chairman and ranking member for agreeing to accept this amendment. We are very grateful for the spirit of cooperation in which this amendment was achieved. I believe this cooperation is possible because at the end of the day we are in fundamental agreement on most of these issues. 
   I trust that going forward we can continue discussing these projects, as well as others, and work together moving the country forward concerning the future of a nuclear weapons complex. 
   I urge adoption of this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act. This bill flies in the face of decades of American leadership to contain the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The bill does not include all of the safeguards and protections contained in the Henry Hyde Act of 2006. 
   A vote for this bill is a vote to approve a rushed process that has not allowed hearings, debate or amendment to this deal. 
   Most importantly, the India deal would give a country which has a dismal record on nonproliferation all of the benefits of nuclear trade with none of the responsibilities. 
   India has been denied access to the international nuclear market for three decades and for good reason. India is not a signatory of the nonproliferation treaty, and it has never committed to nuclear disarmament nor has it signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. India has misused civilian nuclear technology to produce its first nuclear weapon in 1974, and it continues to manufacture nuclear weapons to this day. 
   This deal will help India expand its nuclear weapons program. For every pound of uranium that India is allowed to import for its power reactors, this deal frees up a pound of uranium for its bomb program. I was in Pakistan this month, and it is clear that this deal will only increase the chances of a nuclear arms race on the subcontinent. 
   For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and to promote a stronger relationship with India that does not come at the expense of our own security and that of our allies.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of H. Con. Res. 207--Recognizing the 60th Anniversary of the U.S. Air Force. 
   I am honored to represent the men, women, and families that make up Travis Air Force  Base in Fairfield, California. They are the service men and women who represent ``The Gateway to the West,'' and oversee more cargo and passenger traffic on its runways than any other military air terminal in the United States. 
   To me, they represent what is best about our Air Force and its proud history. Travis airmen are constantly being called upon to provide critical service to our Nation. Along with their Air Force colleagues across the globe they continue to play a vital role in the global war on terror as well as Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. 
   Not only do they put their lives on the line in military missions whenever called upon, but the men and women of Travis have provided humanitarian relief across the globe as recently as the Indonesian tsunami and right here at home in response to the hurricane Katrina disaster. 
   The service members of Travis carry out their missions and protect the homeland because they have the right airlift platforms--the C-5s and the C-17s--to do their job. 
   This year, I was able to secure $10.8 million for the Global Support Squadron Facility at Travis Air Force Base in the fiscal year 2008 Military Construction Appropriations bill. 
   This project would provide a cutting edge operations facility to house approximately 130 personnel necessary for the first Global Support Squadron Facility on the West Coast. 
   It would enhance readiness through specialized design features for command and control, training and deployment preparation, not available in current facilities. GSS is critical to the Air Force's ability to rapidly deploy U.S. military forces and initiate operations in minimal time at any base or location around the globe. 
   The 60th Air Mobility Wing at Travis is the largest air mobility organization in the Air Force with a versatile all-jet fleet of C-5 Galaxy, C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft, and KC-10 Extender refueling aircraft. It handles more cargo and passengers than any other military air terminal in the United States. 
   Travis is the West Coast terminal for aeromedical evacuation aircraft returning sick or injured patients from the Pacific area. The 60th Air Mobility Wing crews can fly support missions anywhere in the world to fulfill its motto of being ``America's First Choice'' for providing true global reach. 
   I am proud to join my colleagues in commending the Air Force and its achievements.

<DOCNO>Mrs. TAUSCHER. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS, IDEALS, AND HISTORY OF NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1021, which supports the goals and ideals of National Women's History Month and pays honor to those who promote the teaching of women's history. 
   I commend the National Women's History Project, which was founded in northern California, for establishing the legacy of Women's History Month; and I thank Congresswoman Woolsey, a fellow Californian, for bringing this important resolution to the floor today. 
   From the earliest days of our great Republic, women have been marginalized throughout many parts of society. But as our country has developed, so too have the rights and responsibilities of women. In 1917, Jeanette Rankin blazed a path for women in Congress, putting  the first crack in our country's highest glass ceiling. Only 3 years later, our Nation ratified the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing that political enfranchisement in America will never be denied due to gender. In 1964, the Civil Rights Act extended gender protections to the workplace and beyond. And as Members of the 110th Congress, we have the privilege to serve alongside a woman who ably executes this institution's highest office and who is the most senior female in American political history. 
   However, the journey from disenfranchisement and marginalization is not complete. Women working full time still earn 80 cents to every dollar earned by men. In this House--the greatest representative body in the world--the number of women serving is hardly proportional to the population we represent. 
   In addressing these persistent inequities, I believe we will be well served by a thorough understanding of the great strides taken by women in the past. A study of women's history is a study of America's path toward greater equality and liberty. The story of women in our country lights the way to the fulfillment of our highest ideals. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution honors the decision made over two decades ago to set aside time for the teaching of women's history, and it highlights the salience of women's history as we chart a course for the future. I commend Ms. Woolsey for her leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join in affirming the importance of National Women's History Month.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Foster amendment to H.R. 5658, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   As chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I am proud to say that my subcommittee's mark already included an increase of $5 million for the Department of Energy's National Technical Nuclear Forensics Program. 
   And I worked with my colleague, Adam Smith, chairman of the Terrorism and Unconventional Threats Subcommittee in support of an additional $10 million for nuclear forensics for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.     
   So when Representative Foster approached us, we were happy to work with him. 
   We welcome his amendment, which complements the base bill very nicely by requiring a plan for forensics research and development and requiring the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State to report on how best to create an independent panel of forensics experts. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Franks amendment. This amendment would increase fiscal year 2009 funding for the Missile Defense Agency by $719 million, back up to the level of the President's budget request. The Bush administration's request of $9.3 billion in fiscal year 2009 for the Missile Defense Agency already represents an increase of $680 million above last year's funded level. 
   With prudent reductions and selected increases, H.R. 5658 authorizes $8.6 billion in FY 2009 for the Missile Defense Agency, roughly equivalent to the fiscal year 2008 level. We provide increases in funding for assistance geared to current threats, like Aegis BMD, THAAD, the missile defense testing program and missile defense cooperation with Israel, all of these by $185 million. At the same time, we make prudent reductions to longer-term, less-mature systems, like the Multiple Kill Vehicle and the Airborne Laser. 
   Unfortunately, the Franks amendment would unravel the thoughtful work of the committee. First, Mr. Franks proposes that the offset would come from any Pentagon research and development account, except the Missile Defense Agency, unfairly placing missile defense programs above all other R&D priorities. 
   Second, it is unlikely that the proposed increase in the funding for the programs outlined in this amendment can be executed in fiscal year 2009. 
   Third, and perhaps more important, the amendment is inconsistent of section 223 of the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, which requires that procurement funds be used for procurement activities, not research and development activities. 
   Also, as written, the amendment would not allow any of the funding to be used for additional THAAD or Aegis Standard Missile Interceptors, because it provides only research and development funding. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 5858 provides our warfighters the real capabilities to meet the real threats to our homeland, deployed forces and allies. It also makes prudent reductions to systems geared to less urgent threats, ensuring that other important national defense priorities, such as readiness, strategic programs and nonproliferation efforts, are well-funded. 
   The House defeated a similar floor amendment last year, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume prior to introducing my colleague from Washington. 
   I just wanted to correct the record. My colleague from Texas must have very old talking points. The subcommittee increased the money for both THAAD, a $75 million increase above the President's budget, and Aegis BMD, $75 million over the President's budget. So what the gentleman just said is totally incorrect. 
   I would now like to yield 3 minutes to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen), who is a very valuable member of the Armed Services Committee and a member of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment for many reasons. I think it is interesting that my colleague from the other side of the aisle sloughs off the fact that we plussed up the President's budget by $75 million for THAAD, $75 million for Aegis. But what he doesn't want to tell anyone is that the President's budget actually cut funding for THAAD firing units, and it wasn't until the majority, the Democrats, went to the administration and said we thought that was a really, really bad idea, and gave the money back to the account. We would have been in a deeper hole. 
   So I think that my colleague is doing a good job supporting the Missile Defense Agency, but that is not what our job is. Our job is to make sure that we have a balanced portfolio of investments for the American people and our warfighters. This mark does it. I think that is why we have such strong support. I think that it is also important for people to know that Mr. Franks wants to buy more Aegis and THAAD inventory; but under the current law his amendment cannot do that because he is using RDT&E funds. So I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Tierney amendment. The amendment seeks to reduce funding for the Missile Defense Agency by about $1 billion beyond the $719 million that the committee has already reduced. 
   I have several concerns with the amendment. Our bill strikes the right balance between the current requirements of the warfighter and the need to invest in future technologies. Our bill increases funding for systems geared toward current threats like Aegis BMD and THAAD, while reducing funding for longer term projects. 
   Our bill already reduces funding for most of the programs the amendment seeks to cut, like the kinetic energy interceptor, the multiple kill vehicle, and the airborne laser. Our bill makes the different reductions to the proposed missile defense sites in Europe based on the slow pace of diplomacy and the technological immaturity of the proposed system. 
   The Tierney amendment, on the other hand, is ill-conceived. First, the amendment undercuts deployment of the existing ground-based mid course defense system in Alaska and California. 
   Second, by eliminating any and all funding for the potential missile defense system in Europe, the amendment would undercut U.S.-NATO cooperation on missile defense against emerging Iranian missile threats to Europe and U.S. troops in the region. 
   Third, the amendment's additional reduction to ABL could actually lead to more missile defense spending because it would delay the planned shootdown demonstration scheduled for next year, leading to increased costs in 2010. 
   Missile defense provisions in this bill by the committee were carefully crafted to balance the need to deliver missile defense capabilities that address current threats, and make prudent investments in future capabilities. It pares back spending on immature science projects, like last year's bill did, and includes a host of provisions to improve accountability for MDA programs. That is why, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Tierney amendment. 
   I would like to yield to the gentleman from Washington.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Pearce amendment to H.R. 5658, the fiscal year 2009 defense authorization bill. The Pearce amendment would restore $10 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead that our bill currently redirects to a more broad-based, advanced certification program. Our bill focuses on sustaining and modernizing the stockpile stewardship program, the core of this Nation's effort to ensure that our nuclear weapons are safe, secure, and reliable. 
   Before any decisions are made about RRW, we must first answer fundamental questions about our strategic posture and nuclear weapons policies. That's why Congress established the bipartisan Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States in last year's National Defense Authorization Act. 
   The Commission's report, due in several months, and the nuclear posture review required of the next administration will help frame the looming decisions about sustaining our nuclear deterrent and modernizing the nuclear weapons complex. 
   One day, something like RRW may be part of a stockpile stewardship program. But no funds were appropriated to conduct the RRW design and cost study last year, and this year's request did not include nearly enough to complete the study. In this context, the committee-approved bill shifts $10 million requested for RRW to advance certification and authorizes the National Nuclear Security Administration to address questions raised by the JASON panel last year about the challenge of certifying RRW without underground testing. 
   The Pearce amendment offset is also a big problem. The offset is a $10 million cut to the DOD Energy Conservation Investment Program, or ECIP. The Department of Defense uses ECIP to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, increase the use of renewable energy and meet national energy policy goals. And ECIP works. Its projects have a nearly 2-to-1 savings to investment ratio on average. A $10 million reduction would be a 12 1/2 percent cut to ECIP. 
   Our bill, H.R. 5658, takes a prudent, sound approach to stewardship of our Nation's nuclear deterrent. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Pearce amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield myself as much time as I may consume, and I will be very brief. 
   I rise today to offer an amendment with my friend MIKE ROGERS of Michigan to provide commuters relief from soaring gas prices by making van pooling a more viable option. Our initiative creates a 2-year pilot program in five regions across the country. It will allow State and local governments access to a Federal Transit Administration policy known as the Federal Capital Cost of Contracting. While the change is fairly technical, its impact is not. It is estimated that this alteration could more than triple van pooling across the Nation, conserving over 500 million gallons of fuel per year and greatly reducing ozone emissions. Moreover, it won't impact the Federal budget, and the vehicles used are made by American manufacturers. 
   Mr. Chairman, this commonsense amendment will give Americans access to another form of transportation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, reduces congestion and saves fossil fuels. 
   I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, I understand that Chairman Oberstar is willing to accept the amendment, and I am happy to reserve my time.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 854, which commends all countries that worked to ratify the amendments to the Bonn Accords to permit open access to the Holocaust Archives located in Bad Arolsen, Germany. 
   I want to thank my colleague from Florida, Congressman Hastings, for bringing this important resolution to the Floor. 
   For the last 62 years, records relating to more than 17 million Holocaust victims have been sealed inside the archives at Bad Arolsen, Germany--the largest WWII-era archives in the world. To carry forward the process of rectifying past wrongdoing and to prevent subsequent humanitarian crimes, it is critical that we throw open the doors of dark repositories like Bad Arolsen and allow the light of accountability to shine in. 
   To open the archives at Bad Arolsen, all 11 members of the International Commission of the International Tracing Service (ITS) were required to ratify the May 2006 amendments to the 1955 Bonn Accords. On November 28, 2007, the final state ratified the amendments, so that Holocaust survivors, their descendents, researchers, and the general public are finally allowed full access to the records housed at the facility. 
   At a time when anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial persist around the world, a vote for this resolution will serve as an indictment of secretive government practices that facilitated vast crimes, and it will reaffirm that the atrocities experienced by Holocaust victims will be remembered and mourned in perpetuity. 
   I commend Mr. Hastings for his leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing gratitude to our international partners for ratifying the treaty to release Holocaust records and in congratulating the United States Holocaust Museum, the U.S. Department of State, and the International Red Commission of the Red Cross for their efforts to open the archives.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to offer H.R. 3159, a bipartisan bill to mandate minimum periods of rest, training and recuperation for units and members of the regular and Reserve components of our Armed Forces between deployment. Fixing our troops' unpredictable rest and retraining policy is long overdue. 
   In an interview last Monday, Marine Corps Commander General James Conway highlighted repeated deployments and short periods of time between them to rest as factors contributing to increased mental stress and burdens on families of service men and women. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am intimately acquainted with how this war has damaged our national security, our diplomatic standing and the readiness of our military; and, as a Californian, I am well aware of how it is draining the defense and security resources of my home State and others. 
   As we speak, a unit from Walnut Creek, California, in my district, is leading a task force comprised of six units that come from armories throughout the East Bay and Northern California. The California Army National Guard indicates that the unit of 824 soldiers is the largest single California National Guard unit to be deployed since the Korean War. These are men and women who will benefit from this legislation in real time. 
   We are sending more and more men and women to Iraq every day. The Bush administration is failing to accurately account for all of the costs of these repeated deployments. On the microlevel, our deployed men and women are being taken away from their families in a revolving door of service because the war has gone on much longer than the President believed it would. And on a larger scale, we are damaging the readiness for our Armed Forces to defend against future attacks here at home and around the world, as well as national emergencies here at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, my bill simply states that if a unit or a member of a regular  component of the Armed Forces deploys to Iraq, they will have an equivalent amount of time at home before they are redeployed. No unit or member of a Reserve component, including the National Guard, could be redeployed to Iraq within 3 years of their previous deployment. In the event of an operational emergency posing a threat to vital national security interests, the President may waive the amendment's limitations by certifying to Congress that deployment of the unit or a member is necessary for national security. 
   The military departments also are provided waiver authority in the bill for individual volunteers who seek to redeploy before the expiration of the mandated time of rest between the deployments. This bill in no way, shape or form hinders the Commander in Chief's ability to manage military personnel. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we come together and take a very critical step to preserve the readiness of our men and women in uniform for them and for our national security. 
   If we are honest about wanting to support our troops, there is no better place to start than to correct our troop rotation policy. For far too long, the members of the Guard and Reserve have been unrepresented in Congress. Today, every Member has an opportunity to help them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters of support for my bill from the Reserve Enlisted Association and Veterans for America.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, what I continuously hear from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are arguments that speak for poor Pentagon planners that are going to have to work a little harder to put units together and handcuffing the Commander in Chief. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that this Presidential waiver, which is inside of this bill, is not only substantive, but it is there to prevent further degrading of our military readiness. I think we all understand that we have heard from people like General McCaffrey, who most recently reported to Congress that 88 percent of nondeployed Army Guard units are rated not ready or poorly equipped, that the Army is overextended, and that we will soon be unable to meet our Homeland Security commitments and meet any new threats if we maintain the current abusive and untenable dwell-time policy. 
   The question for the Members of the House today is who do you stand for. Do you stand for military planners or other members of the Pentagon who have the executive branch to speak for them, or do you stand with the American people, the families of our troops, and the troops themselves, to be sure that we increase our readiness to make sure that we honor their service and their valor and their sacrifice by making sure that they are not only retrained and ready, but they have time to be home with their family before they are redeployed.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to my colleague, because I think it's important that we make sure that we have everything on the table and that we are very clear about who we are standing for and who we are putting the burdens on. 
   What is clear to me is that we have the finest military in the world, that we have men and women, sons and daughters, spouses, brothers and sisters, employees, friends and neighbors that have decided to give their country their time, ultimately, perhaps, pay the sacrifice, the ultimate sacrifice, and go fight for the American people and their ideals to protect us here at home. 
   We have an opportunity today to do what is right, to do what the Pentagon has not done for many reasons. I know my colleagues want to make this about the Iraq war, but I know this is really about our families and our troops. 
   If we cannot guarantee them some predictability for their dwell time at home, for retraining and rest, we are going to continue to degrade the readiness of our military. We are in no shape in this very dangerous world to continue on that path.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I want to make it very clear what this motion to recommit does. This motion to recommit guts our bill and prevents us from giving the dwell time necessary to our troops so that they are not overcommitted, that they can be rested, that they can be retrained, and that they can be resuscitated and spend time with their family. 
   This motion to recommit prevents us from having the readiness that we need for our national security. It prevents the 50 Governors from having their National Guard back home and rested, with good equipment, to deal with contingencies here at home. 
   This motion to commit is just another delaying tactic by the minority to deny our troops the dwell time that they need to train, equip, and rest. 
   The best part about this is the motion to recommit is absolutely unnecessary. If the Secretary of Defense determines that the proposed dwell times in this bill will cause tour lengths of currently deployed units to be extended, or increases the operational risk to deployed units, the underlying bill already provides the President's ability to waive the deployment mandate. 
   So this motion to recommit is not necessary. It is, once again, perhaps the last fig leaf on the last fig tree that my colleagues can find to not stand with the troops and their families to provide them the dwell time they need at home to be ready for the next deployment. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I close by saying I urge my colleagues to defeat the motion to recommit and vote ``aye'' on H.R. 3159. 
   I yield to the chairman of the committee.

   If you look at the report language on page 242, we make it very clear that our cooperative relationship with Israel is not only significant, but primary, and that our efforts to invest with them over these many years on programs like David's Sling and Arrow are significant and are fully funded at the President's request in this bill. 
   What we don't have, however, which perhaps you could help with, is the cooperation of the Department of Defense to share critical information with Israel on THAAD. 
   So I think, frankly, that this is of more of a ``me too'' than it is anything else. We are happy to accept it. But I think if you check the language on 242, you will see that this committee has done all that needs to be done, going along with the President to fully fund these programs, but we could use some help with the administration and the Pentagon to get them to work cooperatively on THAAD.

   In my subcommittee, Strategic Forces, which includes many different issues, including missile defense, the entire nuclear weapons portfolio, our part of the bill passed through on a voice vote and then came to the committee and was supported by virtually all members. So I think we have a very good bill. I think that the conference between the House and the Senate will be a productive one. It will be a time for us to mesh these issues. 
   But as we so often say in Washington, no good deed goes unpunished. I very much appreciate the ranking member from California bringing this motion to instruct forward, but, by the way, it is what is going to probably be in the bill, and it is certainly what is reflected in a bipartisan way by both Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate. 
   I think there has been a lot of rhetoric today about how dangerous a failed state in Iraq would be, and I stand to join my colleagues. I am absolutely, unambiguously convinced that a failed state in Iraq is not only now a bad thing, but would continue to be a bad thing. 
   I guess the real question is, what about the failed policy that got us to a place where we are all concerned about a failed state in Iraq, and why isn't the debate today about the failed policy? How could it be that we are sitting here talking about a national defense bill that is one of the most important bills that the Congress brings, our constitutional responsibility, and we are not talking about a failed policy that has caused us to borrow almost $800 billion, caused us to have virtually no ready ground forces in the United States currently, caused us to degrade our ability to be prepared for any other contingency? Why isn't the debate today about that? 
   Well, because that would be a good debate. That would be really what the debate should be about. But, instead, we are going to have a motion to instruct on things that are already agreed to by the Senate and the House, by the conferees, and I would say every Member here. 
   So I appreciate the Member from California bringing this up. This is easy to support. We are all for it and we all know it. But the real question is: Why don't we have a debate about the failed policy? Why aren't we really concerned about the readiness of our troops, our inability to deal with other contingencies, all of the money we have borrowed, and no solution to extricate ourselves honorably and as soon as possible to bring our troops home so that we can maintain our readiness? 
   Our American forces in Afghanistan and in Iraq have done everything that the American people have asked for. The problem, my colleagues, is they have done it for too long. They have done it for too long without an Iraqi Government that will stand up and provide the political solution necessary for us to be able to leave an Iraq that is beginning to put itself together, knitting those tribes together, moving forward together to do the right thing. 
   But what we have right now is an intransigent, stuck Iraqi Government that hasn't provided the political solution, the only solution, that will be able to create a stable Iraq. It is not our responsibility to create a stable Iraq. That is why they have a sovereign government. And what we can no longer do is enable the sovereign government to come up with excuse after excuse after excuse. 
   I really appreciated my colleague from Virginia explaining to me why the oil legislation written by our State Department isn't something that the Iraqis can pass, even though they have the votes to do it. I find that fascinating. 
   We have been told for months that the petrochemical law is the most important thing that they can do. It is the thing that is going to give the Sunnis the effort to come into the government and feel like they are part of the government and that they are part of a solution and a one-Iraq strategy. But, of course, we don't have that, because even though they have the votes, it seems like it is just a little too hard to do. 
   We are spending too much money. We are spending too much time. We are risking too many American soldiers. We are risking our readiness. The failed policy is really what we should be talking about, Madam Speaker. 
   Madam Speaker, I said it is easy to support this motion to instruct because it is something we all agree on.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Speaker, we have no further speakers on our side and are prepared to close. 
   I just want to once again remind everyone what this is really about. We have an excellent national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2008. It has broad bipartisan support, bicameral support, both the House and the Senate. Most Members voted for this bill when it came to the floor in the spring. We are about to go to conference and make sure that the bills become congruent so we can send it to the President. 
   This is a bill that the President must sign. It has so many good things in it. I want to take a couple of seconds and talk about the fact that Democrats, who took majority in January, have written their first bill in 13 years, and there are many, many good things in here that we are very proud of. We have done many things for the troops. We have included a 3.5 percent pay raise. We have prohibited increases in their health care, which is called TRICARE, and pharmacy user fees. 
   The bill also provides $980 million for National Guard equipment. We know how stressed and strained our National Guard has been. We know how upset many Governors have been that the National Guard has been deployed out of States so the State is without their own National Guard. And the worst part of it is when they went to Iraq or Afghanistan, and some are there for the second and third time, they left their equipment there. So the State doesn't even have equipment that the State can use in the case of a flood or fire or some other kind of an emergency. 
   We have a lot of equipment that we have added; $17.4 billion for MRAPs, which is a plus-up from what the President requested. We have also added a shipbuilding request that the President didn't ask for, which is a Virginia class submarine, an LPD and a T-AKE, and eight C-17s that the Pentagon didn't ask for either, because we know that we need global power projection. 
   This is a very important bill that is part of our congressional responsibility to raise and support our troops, and I am proud to say this is a strong bill that supports our troops, restores military readiness and improves accountability to the American people. I ask for my colleagues' support of it when we bring it back from the conference. 
   I appreciate the fact that this is a motion to instruct, but what we are being instructed is, frankly, two different issues that we have general widespread support for. Both in the House and Senate version of the bill, the language included in the motion to instruct has been included. We should be very confident that they will be part of the final conference report, so this is a motion to instruct that is very supportable. 
   I am happy to yield back the balance of my time.

   I would like to commend my colleague from California, Congresswoman Richardson, for bringing this important resolution to the floor. I am proud to serve with the Congresswoman on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. One hundred years ago, the Los Angeles City Council created the Port of Los Angeles, and it has since developed into one of the largest in the world. More than 43 percent of all goods arriving in the United States travel through the Port of Los Angeles. I appreciate the impact that goods movement plays in our Nation's economy, and the port has an important role in that process. 
   I would like to congratulate the port for reaching its 100th anniversary and congratulate it for being a strong provider of jobs in California. I commend my colleague on the Transportation Committee for her diligent work.

<DOCNO>Mrs. TAUSCHER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   I want to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter. I especially want to thank the Strategic Forces Subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Everett, the distinguished gentleman from Alabama. Many of the very fine initiatives that we produced in this bill were started by Mr. Everett when he was chairman, and I thank him for his cooperation and for his leadership. 
   I want to especially thank our excellent staff for all of their hard work for what is, I think, one of the finest Defense bills that we have been able to produce. 
   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I have worked with my colleagues over the course of this year to incorporate four priorities into the conference agreement before the House today. 
   First, this bill aims to foster and frame a crucial discussion about nuclear weapons by establishing a congressionally appointed bipartisan commission designed to reevaluate the United States' strategic posture. The commission will provide valuable recommendations to Congress regarding the proper mix of conventional and nuclear weapons needed to meet new and emerging threats. 
   Second, the bill takes a prudent step to slow key Department of Energy nuclear weapons initiatives, including the development of the Reliable Replacement Warhead. The conference agreement limits RRW activity in fiscal year 2008 to a design and cost study and reduces RRW funding by $38 million out of a total request of $119 million, more than a 30 percent reduction. 
   The conference agreement also rejects the proposal for a new plutonium pit production facility, or consolidated plutonium center, in the President's budget request. None of the $24.9 million proposed for the CPC is authorized. 
   Third, the bill funds ballistic missile defense systems that will protect the American people, our deployed troops and allies against real threats while shifting resources away from longer term, high-risk efforts. The bill authorizes $8.4 billion for ballistic missile defense programs of the Missile Defense Agency, a reduction of $450 million from the President's request. 
   The conference agreement reduces funding for the proposed European missile defense site by $85 million, and requires final approval by the Governments of Poland and the Czech Republic and an independent study on alternative missile defense options for Europe before construction may begin. 
   The conference agreement also charts a path forward to provide the President with options for a conventional prompt global strike, consolidating funds requested for the Conventional Trident Modification into a new, defense-wide research line for prompt global strike. 
   Finally, we are boosting funding for space capabilities that deliver near-term benefits to the warfighter and improves space situational awareness and survivability. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill strikes a balance between near-term needs and long-term investment, and it creates the means to help bring our nuclear weapons policy into the 21st century. 
   I urge my colleagues' strong support on this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3792, introduced by my good friend, Representative Altmire. This bill ensures that we keep our promises to our wounded soldiers who are injured in the line of duty by guaranteeing they receive full payment of their bonuses. Department of Defense rules deny enlistees their full enlistment bonus if they don't fulfill their entire military obligation. Members who were injured in combat and forced to retire or separate from the Armed Services before the end of their service commitment are forced to pay back the Department of Defense or do not receive the remaining portion of the bonus owed to them. This important legislation corrects this injustice and ensures that service members are not being financially penalized for their injuries after their patriotic duty to and sacrifice for their country. It comforts me knowing that Democrats are being elected to Congress who know and understand the problems that their constituents face and that they aren't wasting any time introducing bills that correct them. For that I commend Representative Altmire and his leadership in Congress on veterans' health care.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, first I would like to congratulate the gentleman from Missouri, the distinguished chairman of the committee, on his first mark of the national security defense bill. He is a fabulous member and a great leader. I appreciate all of the hard work that has been put into this bill. 
   I also want to thank my ranking member, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Everett), for his hard work and his willingness to work in a bipartisan way to achieve what I consider to be a very significant mark for the Strategic Forces Subcommittee; also, the members of the subcommittee and our fabulous staff. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill is a bill that I have worked on with my colleagues to incorporate four priorities into the bill before the House. 
   First, this bill aims to create a public discussion about nuclear weapons by  establishing a congressionally appointed bipartisan commission designed to reevaluate U.S. strategic posture. This commission would provide valuable recommendations to Congress regarding the proper mix of conventional and nuclear weapons needed to meet new and emerging threats. 
   Second, the bill slows the Department of Energy nuclear weapons initiatives. We limit reliable replacement warhead funds to design and cost study activities and eliminate funding for the proposed Consolidated Plutonium Center. Instead, we increase funding to strengthen the Stockpile Stewardship Program, as well as the weapons complex. 
   Third, the bill funds ballistic missile defense systems that will protect the American people, our deployed troops, and allies against real threats while shifting resources away from longer term, high-risk efforts. 
   It fully funds the Army missile defense budget request for the Patriot PAC-3 missile, including funding for the Patriot ``Pure Fleet'' initiative. 
   It fully funds the Ground Based Missile Defense System to protect the United States against a potential threat from North Korea or Iran. 
   It includes funding for Aegis BMD and fully funds THAAD development and deployment. 
   Finally, we are boosting funding for space capabilities that deliver near-term benefits to the warfighter and improve space situational awareness and survivability. 
   Madam Chair, this bill strikes a balance between near-term needs and long-term investment, and it creates the means to help bring our nuclear weapons policies into the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank my colleagues very much for bringing this issue up, although I cannot support their amendment. I appreciate not only their frustration, but their energy that they bring to the debate because, frankly, as the Chair of the subcommittee, that is the reason we did cut $764 million from this program. 
   For a long time I think many of us have been concerned that this has been an agency that has been obviated from all of the normal conventions of responsibility and testing regimen and accountability. I think what we see now is that we do have components of missile defense that are successful. Certainly PAC-3 is successful, certainly Aegis BMD is successful, and many of us have very high hopes for THAAD. 
   The ground-based system has not had as successful testing as many would like. As frustrated as my colleagues may be, as severe a cut as they are proposing is too detrimental to our ability to do what we try to do in this bill, which is to deliver in the near term the kind of protections that we need to have for not only the American people here at home, but for our warfighters deployed down range. 
   These medium and short-range missile threats are real. It is important that we keep this funding going so we can deliver on these good opportunities while we restructure the program and while we hold the Missile Defense Agency accountable for the first time. 
   I have to reluctantly oppose this amendment.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment, specifically because of some of the language that my colleagues have been using. 
   What I find to be absolutely amazing is my colleagues on this side of the aisle who, for the last 6 years, have operated under a theory that there's never been too much money for missile defense without any accountability and without any reasonable sense that they had to have tests and that they had to produce for the American people. So it's not surprising to me that my colleagues rise and try to add back the money, the 8 cents on the dollar that my subcommittee, in a bipartisan way, trimmed from this program, as we did what the Republican bill last year suggested, that we redirect the focus of missile defense to near-term capabilities for the warfighter, for the American people and for our allies. 
   Now, the never-too-much money for MDA crowd will try to gin up all kinds of threats, and I will say it again. We here on this side of the aisle are not confused about the threats. We believe these are real threats, and that is why we have diligently restructured the MDA budget to deal with the near-term threats so that we can actually protect the warfighter, the American people and make sure that we have these capabilities now for current threats. 
   So the idea that we are doing massive cuts and that this is irresponsible probably makes sense to people that think that there's no such thing as not enough money for MDA, but from my point of view and for my constituents, I believe they need accountability, they need a testing regime operated by somebody other than themselves, and we need to have the modest cuts in this budget and need to oppose this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt).

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Chairman, as I said earlier, I rise in opposition to this amendment because we, I believe, have cuts in this bill that not only preserve the ability to have robust investments in missile defense, but, for the first time, create accountability for the Missile Defense Agency to deliver in the near term the kinds of capabilities necessary to protect our warfighters in the near term for real threats they face today, the American people, for real threats they face today and our allies and access abroad. 
   That is what we decided to do last year in the defense bill. That is our most important priority. These are minor cuts that redirect our agency to do what they never did under our colleagues when they were in the majority, which is to have operational testing that is real, that has countermeasures, that deals with the real kinds of circumstances that we would face if we were attacked. There is great doubt out there about the capabilities of this system because it has never been held to the rigor and the robust testing necessary to make it a credible deterrent. 
   We believe these cuts are marginal cuts. We plus up many things in this bill to make sure that we deliver in the near term to the warfighter the capabilities they need, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, let's just be clear. There is nothing in the bill that says that MDA cannot put the system on operational alert using RDT&E funds. They are not prohibited from doing it. In fact, they have done it in the past. 
   What section 222 does say that if you are going to operate it, you should use operating and maintenance funds. That's all it says.     
   So we have no objection to the gentleman's amendment, because in fact there is nothing in the bill that prohibits the system from being flicked on, and there is nothing about what we say that is contrary to what the gentleman is asserting. However, we do believe that it is important that when you are operating a system, you should use operation and maintenance funds.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 5658, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   I want to commend Chairman Skelton for his leadership on bringing such a strong bipartisan bill to the floor. 
   As chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the bill achieves three broad objectives. It sustains and modernizes the stockpile stewardship program, which insures the safety, security and reliability of our nuclear deterrent. It invests in the development and deployment of ballistic missile defense systems that address near term threats to the United States, our deployed troops and our allies. And it supports significant military space programs in critical phases of development, including the space-based infrared system.     
   With regard to the nuclear complex, it provides additional funding to address certification issues raised by the 2007 JASON review of the RRW proposal. It fully executes the National Ignition Campaign, and it explores next-generation stockpile stewardship tools. The bill fully funds the request for the defense environmental cleanup and urges DOE to increase the resources dedicated to cleanup in future budgets. 
   We also fully fund the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, and we stress that the MOX project is a nonproliferation and a national security priority. 
   For the Missile Defense Agency, the bill authorizes $8.6 billion, a cut of $719 million below the administration's request. The bill reflects our committee's strong bipartisan support for addressing the short, medium, and intermediate missile threats that face our warfighters. It includes several important funding increases. It adds $75 million for Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, $75 million for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, $25 million for missile defense target development, and $10 million for the joint U.S.-Israel short-range missile defense program. 
   The bill authorizes $341 million for the proposed European missile defense site, an increase of more than $100 million over current-year funding but a reduction of $371 million below the administration's request. 
   The committee has extended conditions contained in the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act to help ensure that the pace of any deployment of U.S. missile defense systems in Europe is synchronized with our diplomatic efforts and that the proposed system has been fully tested. 
   The bill strongly supports our cooperative programs with Israel authorizing $54.1 million for the joint U.S.-Israel short-range missile defense program, an increase of $10 million over the President's request. 
   It also authorizes $74.3 million for continued development of the Arrow Weapons System. 
   In military space programs, the bill pushes DOD to focus on near-term warfighter needs, space situational awareness, and space protection. The bill also directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for the Department's bandwidth needs in the near and longer term. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to honor my ranking member, Mr. Everett of Alabama, who is retiring this year. Mr. Everett was previously the chairman of this subcommittee. There is no finer gentleman in the House. He is a man of significant effort, he is a perfect Southern gentleman, and it was my pleasure to work with him over the last few years and this year to have him as my ranking member. I wish him and his wife Barbara and their family all the best in their retirement years. 
   Mr. Chairman, the bill supports our critical national security priorities, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support its adoption today.

   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend Chairman Gordon for reporting these two critical bills out of the Science Committee, one focused on math and science education and the second on science and engineering. 
   Taken together, these two bills are a critical step toward restoring our American technological base as well as giving students, engineers, and researchers the tools they need to compete in a global economy. 
   And they are a great way to kick off the Innovation Agenda, an effort that is vital to America's competitiveness, economy and security, and an effort the New Democrat Coalition, which I chair, is proud to be leading. 
   I am very proud to offer a bipartisan amendment with my good friend, Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT of the Science Committee. Our amendment would expand eligibility for National Science Foundation Early Career Awards to thousands of scientists and engineers previously deemed ineligible. These men and women have followed alternative career paths such as working part-time or in non-academic settings, or have taken a significant career break or other leave of absence. 
   In particular, our amendment would level the playing field for women scientists who have taken maternity leaves, and for all scientists and engineers who have taken internships, worked in industry, or who have pursued entrepreneurial efforts. 
   The amendment would also expand the scope of the Presidential Innovation Award to recognize and reward innovations that result in intellectual property that significantly enhances the economic competitiveness of the United States. 
   I strongly support Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Gordon's efforts to promote a strong Innovation Agenda that grows our economy and creates more jobs. 
   I appreciate working with JUDY BIGGERT on this issue and ask my colleagues to support our amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 60th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel and to reaffirm the bonds of close friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel. The birth of the State of Israel gave the Jewish people a land to call their own and serves as a symbol of hope and freedom for all groups who have been oppressed. 
   The creation of the State of Israel followed the attempted extermination of the Jewish people in the Holocaust. Neighborhoods and Jewish communities were divided and families were shattered, but the identity of the Jewish people as a whole remained strong. The faith, hope, and belief in each other and their heritage kept the eternal flame of the Jewish people burning, even in those grave times of despair. 
   Following World War II, the Jewish people, having lost six million of their own, had nowhere to go--no land to call their own. On November 29, 1947, the United Nations general assembly voted to partition the British Mandate of Palestine and create a Jewish State. On May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of Israel, and the United States Government established full diplomatic relations with Israel. 
   Not only has Israel provided so much to the Jewish people, absorbing millions of Jews from countries throughout the world and integrating them into Israeli society, it has also done much to assist other nations facing natural and manmade crises around the world. Israel regularly sends humanitarian aid, search-and-rescue teams, mobile hospitals, and other emergency supplies, to help victims of disasters around the world. 
   Just as our brave men and women fight to protect democratic values, Israel, too, fights for its right to exist and to protect its citizens. Every day, Israel bravely defends itself from repeated terrorist and military attacks. In addition, it has established peaceful bilateral relations with neighboring Egypt and Jordan and has made its desire to establish peaceful relations with all Arab states abundantly clear. 
   The American people feel a strong affinity for the Israeli people based on common values and shared cultural heritage and the United States continues to regard Israel as a strong and trusted ally and an important strategic partner. For 6 decades, the United States and Israel have maintained a special relationship based on mutually shared democratic values, common strategic interests, and the bonds of friendship and mutual respect. 
   At this time, I wish to congratulate the State of Israel on its 60th anniversary and reaffirm my commitment to maintaining the close friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act. 
   In November of last year, the container ship COSCO BUSAN collided with the San Francisco Bay Bridge and spilled 58,000 gallons of bunker fuel into San Francisco Bay. The spill was one of the worst environmental disasters in San Francisco Bay history. 
   I have included language in this bill that would require the Coast Guard to have marine pilots carry their own navigation devices, commonly known as Portable Pilot Units. These devices are an easy and practical way to improve maritime safety and to protect our environment. 
   I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Cummings, and the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and the ranking member, Mr. LaTourette, for working with us to include this language. I think it's very important language that could prevent these kinds of accidents from happening in the future.

<DOCNO>Mrs. TAUSCHER. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker I rise in strong support of the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007. Congress has reformed the intelligence community to better identify global threats and defend the United States, but for too long we have had a gaping hole in our security, eliminating the threat of weapons of mass destruction. And for too long the Bush administration and their congressional allies have left nonproliferation on the back burner. The bill before us today provides the tools we need to fight the threat of the world's most dangerous weapons. In the last Congress, I introduced the 9/11 Commission Combating Proliferation Implementation Act along with my colleagues JOHN SPRATT and MARTY MEEHAN. 
   The essential provision of our bill contained also in the bill before us today creates a coordinator for the prevention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation within the White House. The coordinator would also have both the budget authority over all nonproliferation programs and would also be responsible for designing and implementing a strategic plan to address the current threat levels posed by weapons of mass destruction. 
   Currently, nonproliferation efforts are overseen by the Departments of Energy, Defense, and State. While they all have had some success, these three large agencies are not guided by an overall plan or supported by a single individual who has the ability to ensure accountability. Because of the lack of high-level attention and leadership, some programs have either lapsed or been burdened with unrelated restrictions. Such a coordinating function has been recommended several times, including in the 1999 Deutsche Commission, to access the organization of the Federal Government to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   As the 9/11 Commission warned: ``The greatest danger of another catastrophic attack in the United States will materialize if the world's most dangerous terrorists acquire the world's most dangerous weapons.'' 
   We know the threat; now we have to act. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the work of my colleagues, Chairman RANGEL and Chairman LEVIN, on the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement. 
   I applaud them, as well as Speaker PELOSI and Majority Leader HOYER for achieving a new trade policy for America, workers, and the environment. 
   This groundbreaking agreement is the first FTA to include fully-enforceable rights for workers--an achievement that my Democratic colleagues and I have long sought. 
   Bolstering workers' rights in Peru is not just the moral thing to do; it also helps to build a stable, more prosperous middle class--creating a larger market for U.S. goods. 
   This agreement also requires Peru to abide by multilateral environmental accords--such as protecting Peru's rainforests from illegal logging. 
   Most importantly, Peru may not waver from these commitments to workers or the environment in any way. 
   Madam Speaker, I chair the New Democrats, a group of 60 pro-growth Members. 
   We are dedicated to keeping America competitive--through lowering trade barriers and opening foreign markets to U.S. goods and services. 
   I also come from California, where more than one in five jobs is tied to trade. 
   I am proud to be a pro-trade Democrat in Congress, and I am proud of this landmark trade agreement the new Democratic majority has achieved. 
   America will not remain the world's economic and innovation leader if we refuse to do business with the rest of the world. 
   Likewise, we must equip U.S. workers with the tools to compete and win in a global economy, and help them through the transition, as we have with the expansion of Trade Adjustment Assistance. 
   Finally Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to examine the strategic implications of this agreement. 
   Deepening ties with our pro-growth allies in Latin America is key to security in the Western Hemisphere. 
   Passage of the Peru FTA is a first step in a twenty-first century trade policy: It is an expansion of trade in a way that is solidly consistent with Democratic values. 
   Again, I applaud Chairman RANGEL and Chairman LEVIN for their success, and I urge my colleagues to support implementation of the Peru FTA.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to commend the work of my colleague, Chairman HOWARD BERMAN, on the Patent Reform Act of 2007. 
   This bill is a necessary step forward in the modernization of a patent system that has not been meaningfully updated for decades. 
   I urge my colleagues to show their support for reform by casting a vote for this bill. 
   This bill will result in higher quality patents emerging from the Patent and Trademark Office. 
   It will harmonize our patent system with that of our major trading partners. 
   And it will improve fairness in litigation by preventing ``patent trolls'' from shopping around for friendly courts. 
   At the same time, I look forward to working with Congressman BERMAN to fine-tune a number of provisions in this bill. 
   In my State of California, our economy is based on the incredible advances made by  university researchers, the high-tech sector, and the life sciences industry. 
   Innovations in all sectors must be afforded the strongest possible protection. 
   This has particular importance for small venture-backed firms whose patents are their only asset. 
   With this in mind, I look forward to seeing improvements to provisions governing the way damage awards are calculated in patent suits. 
   The inequitable conduct defense and the issue of continuations also deserve further review and revision. 
   I again applaud Chairman BERMAN for his efforts, and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1908.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Ross). All time for general debate has expired. 
   Pursuant to the rule, the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered read.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Speaker, I raise in support of H.R. 2452, the Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act. Sewer overflows present serious threats to the environment and to human health. Our crumbling wastewater infrastructure has resulted in an increasing number of sewage spills, most commonly through combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows. 
   As this Congress works to reauthorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and improve our wastewater infrastructure, it is essential that our constituents receive prompt notification when a spill occurs. H.R. 2452 provides a national Standard for such notification and permits the use of Clean Water State Revolving funds for publically-owned treatment works to monitor their infrastructure for spills. 
   In California, we have an existing notification process that is the most aggressive in the Nation. I applaud Chairman OBERSTAR and his staff for recognizing the existence of State notification programs and ensuring that duplication of State and Federal standards does not overburden local sanitation officials. In this bill, States like California may operate their own notification program if the EPA certifies that it is substantially equivalent to the Federal program. 
   I would like to include a letter from the California Association of Sanitation Agencies that expresses full support for H.R. 2452. I commend Mr. BISHOP and Mr. OBERSTAR for their hard work on this legislation, and urge my colleagues to support the Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act.

<DOCNO>Mrs. TAUSCHER. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5501, the Lantos-Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   The world has achieved more in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the past decade than it has since this deadly epidemic began nearly 30 years ago, due in no small part to the efforts of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), combined with Congressional enactment of the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2003. 
   As a nation, we have provided care for more than 6 million HIV-infected individuals, including nearly 3 million orphans. We have prevented 150,000 infant infections by providing mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention services for more than 10 million pregnancies. And we have provided anti-retroviral drugs for nearly 1.5 million men, women, and children. 
   Yet in an era where 40 million men, women, and children are infected with HIV worldwide, and where infections continue at a rate of nearly 6,000 per day, U.S. global leadership on HIV/AIDS--as well as the associated diseases of TB and malaria--remains as important as ever. 
   I quote Stephen Lewis, the former United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa: ``the international community must now finally keep its word and mobilize for global AIDS treatment delivery ..... it is a moral imperative that global leaders and institutions keep their promises to scale up AIDS services with urgency and increased resources.'' 
   I believe passage of H.R. 5501 displays our commitment to doing just that. 
   This legislation authorizes $50 billion over the next 5 years, including $41 billion for HIV/AIDS, $4 billion for tuberculosis, and $5 billion for malaria, and is designed to move these programs from the ``emergency'' phase, towards greater sustainability. 
   In particular, I am pleased to see a strengthened focus on the needs of women and girls, and prevention and treatment programs targeted towards this population--including, for the first time, the provision of HIV/AIDS testing and counseling services in family planning programs. I would note that concerns have been raised that the bill's language would block HIV testing and counseling services from being offered by family planning providers that are not compliant with the misguided ``global gag rule'' policy, and I hope that Congressional intent can be clarified that this is not the case. 
   I am also supportive of provisions that remove the requirement targeting one-third of prevention funding towards abstinence-only programs. Prevention programs must be evidence-based, rather than ideologically-based. 
   This legislation doubles, to $2 billion per year, the U.S. contribution to the multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Global Fund, with its emphasis on stimulating a global commitment under an umbrella organization with a truly international AIDS budget, is the best chance the world has of combating this epidemic. I urge my colleagues and the President to ensure that these new authorization levels are fully funded. 
   Madam Chairman, I applaud the bipartisan work of the Foreign Affairs Committee, including its new Chairman, Howard Berman, and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I also want to recognize and commemorate the leadership of our dear friend, Congressman Tom Lantos, whose commitment to the most vulnerable people worldwide continues to be felt through our work on HIV/AIDS. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5501.

   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of America's senior citizens. 
   We in the Congress have a duty to provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services with all the tools necessary to grant seniors continuous access to affordable prescription drugs. 
   This legislation, which I support, helps move in that direction. 
   However, we must be careful that our actions do not restrict seniors' access to medicines prescribed to them by their doctors. 
   And we must be careful to ensure that any changes to Part D do not diminish the ability of life sciences and biotechnology companies to continue innovation--innovation on the drugs that are extending and improving the quality of life for countless people around the globe, and innovation on future research that holds limitless promise. 
   I also firmly believe that limiting formularies is not the way to go because it has a direct impact on limiting choice to seniors. 
   We also need to address the donut hole created by the Republican-authored Medicare bill. 
   It is wrong that we provide seniors help with their drugs, and then suddenly--that help stops. Coverage needs to be continuous. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to rectify this problem. Our seniors deserve it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to voice my very strong support for Chairman Skelton's legislation. It represents an unequivocal belief that the United States cannot and should not be in the business of fighting Iraq's civil war. 
   For over 4 years, it has been clear to me that our troops successfully and bravely accomplished the mission authorized by the President in the fall of 2002. 
   Today's report that our troops have done their job but the Iraqi Government has not underscores the deep problems with the Bush administration's approach. We are no longer at war with Iraq's Government; instead, our forces are caught in the middle of an escalating sectarian conflict in Iraq, with no end in sight. Yet, the President continues to blindly stay the course, with disastrous and deadly consequences. 
   Chairman Skelton's bill would make significant reductions in our troop presence by April of 2008. Democrats, along with our Republican colleagues who no longer trust the President's leadership, are doing all we can to change the President's full speed ahead mismanagement of the war in Iraq and divert the policy toward returning our troops home sooner and safer. 
   This more responsible presence, which limits U.S. presence to fighting  terrorism and training Iraq forces, will be a first step in restoring stability in Iraq and the readiness of our military which has been badly damaged over the last 4 years. 
   I appreciate Chairman Skelton's leadership on this matter, and I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense approach.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1092. 
   It is with careful consideration that I have chosen to support this rule removing procedural timetables from House consideration of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. 
   A vote on this rule is not a vote on the substance or quality of the Colombia FTA. It is a vote in protest of the President's failure to adequately consult the Congress under well-established protocols. 
   I was one of only a few members of my caucus to support trade promotion authority in  2002. It is my strong belief that forcing consideration of such measures is not the way ``fast track'' was intended to be utilized. 
   The President's actions place ultimate implementation of the Colombia FTA in great jeopardy. A failure of the FTA on the House floor would send the worst possible message to our friends and allies in Latin America. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues here in Congress, as well as with the administration, to create the conditions for consideration of this important agreement on its own merits. 
   For too long, the United States has neglected its friends and allies in Latin America, and the Colombia FTA will be a beneficial tool for engagement in the region. 
   In the midst of growing peace and order in Colombia, removing trade barriers between our two countries will facilitate Colombia's progress and benefit both of our economies. 
   President Uribe and the Colombian people continue to face a number of challenges, including narco-trafficking and kidnapping by guerrilla groups, continued violence committed by armed paramilitaries, and the need to protect the rights of unions and their leaders. I have great confidence in his abilities, and I look forward to seeing continued progress in this regard. 
   I also look forward to seeing continued progress and bipartisan support for domestic economic measures, including additional funding to stimulate the economy, to provide support and training for workers, and to address housing, energy, and health care. I urge both President Bush and my colleagues to recommit themselves to these goals, in order to create favorable conditions for consideration of the Colombia FTA.

This is his last defense authorization bill, and I want to thank him for his wisdom and his leadership and his friendship. Godspeed on your retirement, Mr. Everett. 
   This legislation reflects three crucial themes. First, it ensures the safety, security and reliability of our nuclear deterrent. The bill urges the Secretary to clarify lines of responsibility for nuclear weapons. 
   It authorizes $6.6 billion for the Stockpile Stewardship Program, but does not fund the reliable replacement warhead. 
   Second, the bill emphasizes missile defense systems that address near-term threats to the United States with more deliberate development of less mature systems to meet longer-term threats. 
   The bill authorizes $8.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency which is $410 million less than the President's request, but $270 million above last year's funded level. 
   The bill allows construction of the European radar site upon final approval from the host nation, but prohibits construction of the European interceptor site proposed for Poland until both Poland and the Czech Republic have given final approval. 
   The bill provides an additional $100 million for the Aegis BMD and THAAD programs, and increases funding for the U.S.-Israel missile defense programs. 
   Third, this legislation authorizes major space programs and requires the Department of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to jointly plan on meeting national security bandwidth needs.     
   We have a fabulous staff on the subcommittee, very, very energetic and hardworking members.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairwoman of the Foreign Ops appropriations bill about the need for increased funding for the United States contribution to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization called CTBTO. 
   I had planned to offer an amendment to fund the CTBTO at least to the administration's request of $18 million for fiscal yea r 2008; but I would just like to make a few points for the record. 
   As you know, the administration's fiscal year 2008 budget request calls for $18 million for the U.S. contribution to the CTBTO. Unfortunately, the Foreign Operations appropriations bill would shift $8 million of the administration's already inadequate request to another account, leaving only $10 million for U.S. funding for CTBTO test ban monitoring. 
   The administration's request already falls well short of what is necessary to make u p for past funding shortfalls that threaten to slow or stop the construction and operation of the test ban treaty organization's international monitoring system. 
   In 2002, the Bush administration unilaterally decided not to support the U.S. portion, approximately $800,000 per year, of the on-site inspection component of the CTBTO verification activities. The administration, which does not support ratification and entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, argues that because the on-site inspe ction will only be available upon the entry into force of the treaty, the United States should not contribute. 
   For fiscal year 2006, the Bush administration requested and Congress approved only $14.4 million for the CTBTO, which was $7 million short of the $22 million assessed by the organization. 
   The continuing resolution covering most fiscal year 2007 spending set U.S. funding for the CTBTO at the fiscal year 2006 level, which was $9 million short of the United States $23.4 million assessment. 
   We are the single largest contributor to CTBTO, and our shortfalls will have a significant impact. The United States failure to pay its share will directly affect the CTBTO's ability to complete construction and certify for use the remaining stations in the international mo nitoring system, including those in more remote and strategic regions such as Turkmenistan, which lies just north of Iran. 
   I am sure that the gentlewoman from New York (Chairman Lowey) shares my deep concern that the United States is underfunding the CTBTO as the danger of Iran's nuclear program grows as these fundings continue to deplete and we are not able to keep up with our obligations. 
   Unless Congress increases funding for the U.S. contribution, these shortfalls that have accumulated over the last 7 years will continue to undermine the effort to complete a global monitoring network and conduct data analysis designed to detect and deter nuclear weapons test explosions.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. I thank my friend, Chairman Johnson, for the opportunity to speak today in support of the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act. 
   Mr. Chairman, I can't tell you how pleased I am to have joined my good friend and neighbor, Jerry McNerney, in introducing H.R. 700. As Californians, Mr. McNerney and I know how precious every drop of water is to our communities, our economy, and our way of life. 
   Our legislation provides a real Federal commitment to exploring alternative water sources now so we can have the water supplies we will need in the future. This legislation will reauthorize a critical EPA program which was authorized in 2000 by the then Republican-controlled Congress. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican Congress' commitment to the program and water supply reliability ended with words, not deeds. The program was never funded, and the EPA never implemented it. 
   Fortunately, today is a very new day. This Congress has the opportunity to provide local communities with the means to invest in critical alternative water source projects. 
   By providing a modest $125 million authorization for this EPA program, we will help communities plan for their future; and investing in innovative projects such as water recycling, water reuse and aquifer storage will allow our local communities to use water more effectively and efficiently. 
   In my own district, these types of projects are already under way and will benefit from today's legislation. Projects like the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program and the Bay Area Regional Desalination Project are all advancing alternative water sources now and will be able to continue their work through access to these grants. 
   If we are effectively to plan for our Nation's future to use critical resources, there has to be Federal investment and innovation. The passage of H.R. 700 will clearly indicate that this Congress is ready to lead. 
   Today, some are trying to say that this program is duplicative, that these types of projects can already be funded through existing sources. First, let me say that we all understand that programs such as the Clean and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds can be used for alternative water source projects. 
   However, in fiscal year 2007, the President's budget cut the Clean Water State Revolving Fund by 22 percent, and in the fiscal year 2006 he recommended that the fund be cut by $370 million. 
   So let me ask a simple question: Where will our communities find the resources to maintain and improve critical infrastructure and plan for the future if the Bush administration and the Republicans in Congress keep cutting the funds? It is disingenuous for anyone to claim that there are already resources available for these critical water projects while they are cutting the funds. 
   So it is time for us all to be responsible. It is time to make critical investments in water infrastructure which have been neglected for all too long, and it is time to ensure our communities can plan for their future water needs. 
   Mr. Chairman, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act, which was passed by a voice vote in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I urge all of my colleagues to support this very important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. TAUSCHER. Mr. Speaker, I strongly commend Speaker Pelosi for showing tremendous leadership on this issue and creating the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. This committee will provide Congress the opportunity to conduct important and essential oversight that is long overdue. 
   I remain deeply concerned about global warming and have been appalled by the Bush Administration's failure to provide any leadership on one of the most important environmental, economic, and moral issues of our time. As the largest producer of greenhouse gasses in the world, the United States must enact national emissions controls to curb our country's contribution to global warming. 
   European Union leaders are meeting this week to consider plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by the year 2020, a first step in a post-Kyoto global warming strategy that could lead to mandatory limits for cars and pollution allowances for airlines. 
   While these actions are critical, the United States needs to lead in this area as Speaker Pelosi is working to achieve. It is high time for the Bush administration to stop questioning the science behind global warming and act to protect future generations. 
   The Secretary General of the United Nations stated this week that ``the danger posed by war to all of humanity--and to our planet--is at least matched by the climate crisis and global warming.'' 
   As a Representative of California, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Safe Climate Act, which was introduced last year and will be offered again this year. The goal of the 
   Safe Climate Act is to reach 1990 emissions levels by 2020 and then to continue to cut emissions through 2050. 
   In order to achieve these cuts, the Environmental Protection Agency would be instructed to set national standards for vehicle emissions at the levels mandated by California state law, which has the strictest vehicle emissions laws in the country. By focusing on an increased use of renewable energy and allowing the nation's largest polluters to meet new federal standards by buying and selling emissions allowances, the Safe Climate Act sets out effective common-sense energy policies that will reduce the United States' dependence on foreign oil while actively addressing global warming. 
   Again, I praise Speaker Pelosi for drawing attention to this important issue and working toward a solution. 
   I strongly support the passage of the Committee Funding Resolution for the 110th Congress and the authorization for the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.
