<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Chairman, I rise to strongly support this bill. The principle at stake here is the freedom that all workers should have to organize, to bargain for better working conditions, fair wages and real benefits. 
   There are many employers around the country who honor this freedom. Unfortunately, there are also many employers who do not. These employers attempt to prevent workers from unionizing by using tactics that amount to intimidation and harassment, if not outright firing. In fact, one in five people who try to organize unions are fired. These tactics are already illegal, but the penalties are so minor, they are not effective deterrents. 
   Even after overcoming these obstacles and successfully organizing, many workers do not see the benefits of unionization for years because employers can drag their feet as in signing a first contract. 
   The system destined to protect workers' rights needs fixes, and the Employee Free Choice Act is landmark legislation to do just that. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL GUARD YOUTH CHALLENGE DAY -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1202, a resolution that supports the goals and ideals of a National Guard Youth Challenge Day. 
   This measure celebrates the success of the National Guard Youth Challenge Program. Implemented by the National Guard in participating states, the program aims to address the growing national epidemic of high school dropouts by improving the education, life skills, and employment potential for ``at risk'' youth through military-based training and supervised work experience. The program is fundamental in giving young people a second chance to obtain their high school diplomas and to become productive citizens within their communities. 
   The National Guard Youth Challenge Program is results-driven and cost-effective. Since its inception in 1993, nearly 80,000 students have graduated from the program, and more than 90 percent of its graduates earn their high school diploma or GED, go to college, enter the military, or join the workforce. 
   When I served as Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, I met with program participants and staff on numerous occasions and was impressed by the achievements of its graduates. The National Guard Youth Challenge Program has made a lasting impact on young people  and communities not only in Hawaii but across the Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEARL HARBOR NAVAL SHIPYARD -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1139, a resolution that recognizes the men and women of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for their service to our military on the 100th anniversary of its opening. 
   Established by the United States Navy in 1908, Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard has a distinguished history of serving our country. Attacked on December 7, 1941, the workers of Pearl Harbor quickly recovered, returning fifteen of eighteen damaged ships to combat within half a year. On June 1, 1942, an extensively damaged USS Yorktown arrived in Pearl Harbor needing repairs that would normally take an estimated four months to complete. Shipyard workers performed these repairs in only 72 hours and returned the Yorktown to sea, where it played a decisive role in the Battle of Midway, the pivotal naval battle in the Pacific during World War II. 
   The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard currently serves as the home port for seventeen Los Angeles-class submarines and twelve other naval ships. Workers at this shipyard have repaired ships successfully in every war from World War II to the present and are now preparing for the Navy's Virginia-class submarines that are scheduled to begin arriving in 2009. It is time for us to recognize this longstanding commitment to our country and celebrate the tireless contributions of the men and women of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 976, the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). 
   I believe our nation must show true compassion for the most vulnerable among us, and CHIP is a program that helps millions of low-income American children to receive health care so they can grow up in good health. 
   Since its creation in 1997, CHIP has been successful in providing vital health care coverage for children in families who cannot afford private insurance yet earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. 
   There are now 6.6 million children emolled in the program. 
   Unless we act now, they are in danger of losing their health coverage, as CHIP expires on September 30th. 
   Leaders in the House and Senate have worked hard to bring this conference bill to the floor. 
   In supporting the conference bill, I want to note that the bill passed by the House earlier is a stronger bill in its coverage of more children in need and in eliminating the automatic cuts to Medicare reimbursements set to take effect in 2008 and 2009. Eliminating these automatic cuts was at the top of the list of needed legislation by medical and health care groups. 
   I am hopeful that we will address their concerns through another bill before the cuts go into effect. 
   I am also deeply disappointed that Senate Republicans insisted on the removal of provisions providing coverage for the children of legal immigrants. Such discrimination based on immigrant status should have no place in a bill providing health care to children. 
   While work remains to be done, I also want to point out that under this bill we would preserve the coverage of more than 20,000 children in Hawai`i, and in addition 12,000 children in Hawai`i who currently are uninsured would gain coverage. 
   We would preserve coverage for the 6.6 million children nationwide currently covered by CHIP and extend coverage to an additional 3.8 million children who are eligible for coverage but not enrolled. Thus passing this bill would provide health care coverage for more than 10 million American children. 
   A new report by Families USA indicates that during a 2-year period almost 35 percent of Americans under age 65 lacked healthcare insurance. Hawai'i is better than average in this regard, but 29 percent of our state's residents under age 65 still lacked insurance at some point during the past 2 years. 
   I support providing all Americans with high quality, affordable health care, and I hope that Congress will continue to move in that direction. But until we reach that goal, we should take steps that help our most vulnerable populations, including low-income children. This is precisely the group that CHIP will help, if we can get it reauthorized and signed into law. 
   I support CHIP because it is the compassionate, just, moral and the right thing to do. In fact, it is also highly cost-effective. It costs less than $3.50 a day to cover a child through CHIP. It would be far more expensive for taxpayers to leave these children uninsured and having to pick up the tab for indigent care in emergency rooms. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Chairman, I thank you for this opportunity to express my support for H.R. 720 and my strong opposition to the amendment that seeks to remove Davis-Bacon wage protections from the bill. Addressing the Nation's urgent wastewater infrastructure needs by strengthening and recapitalizing the Clean Water State Revolving Fund is critically important. Retaining the requirement that workers be paid the local prevailing wage will help ensure that these projects yield the greatest benefit to the communities they are meant to help. 
   Davis-Bacon not only guarantees that workers receive a fair wage; it helps ensure the quality of the work because it removes the incentive for hiring less qualified workers for a job. Paying prevailing wages also means that businesses and workers in the community where the work is taking place have a fair shot at getting the job and are less likely to be undercut by contractors who bid lower but then cut corners. A well-built project at a fair price should be our goal--not the cheapest possible job where workers' qualifications and quality of work may be compromised. 
   I want to congratulate Chairman Oberstar on moving this critical bill through the committee and to the floor in such a timely fashion. I am very proud to be a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and to be able to tell my constituents that help in upgrading our wastewater systems is on the way.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Chair, my amendment will add another allowable use of funds under section 103, Watershed Pilot Projects, to assist communities in developing integrated water resource plans for the coordinated management and protection of surface water, ground water and storm water resources on a watershed or subwatershed basis. The amendment does not add to the cost of the bill; it simply provides another option for communities in use of the grants funds.  
   It is important that communities look at the inner relationship between each of these water systems when devising management and protection plans. Management of storm water can certainly have an impact on the quality of surface waters, and the quality of surface water has an effect on the quality and safety of ground water. 
   This approach is very much in line with Hawaiian traditions of land management. The traditional Hawaiian land management unit, the ahupua'a, goes from the top of the mountain to the sea. Ancient Hawaiians understood that what happened on the mountain would affect resources at lower elevations, in coastal areas, and even in the ocean. The watershed model of natural resource management is a modern equivalent of the Hawaiian ahupua'a system. 
   It is important that we move to a more holistic way of looking at how our water systems interact. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment to provide communities with an opportunity to develop such integrated plans. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. I just wanted to make a comment about what you just said. You know, there is rhetoric, and then there is action. So while we had hours and hours of debate on all of these bills that we dealt with in the first 100 hours, when it came down to action, so many of the Republicans voted with us. So as the saying goes, ``Where's the beef?'' And frankly, I just want to share with my colleagues from the majority-making class, of which I am very proud, there was an article written in a local newspaper back home about me and how I am doing here, and they quoted a professor from University of Pennsylvania, a political science professor. I don't know why they asked somebody from the University of Pennsylvania. But he teaches a class on how Congress works. And he said, basically, freshmen are hardly ever seen and they are never heard from. Well, nothing could be further from the truth in our class. Not only were we seen, but we were heard from. We were encouraged to speak out. And I think every single one of us had an opportunity to speak on all of these bills, as I certainly did. And so I came here because I really wanted to be responsive to the American people. And as the New York Times only yesterday said, that the House has now approved legislation directly addressing public concerns. And I think that is why we feel really gratified to have been a part of this historic session and to be reminded that prior Congresses, the 104th, 105th, 106th, 107th, 108th, 109th Congresses in the month of January, were taking a break.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (HONORING THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII FOR ITS 100 YEARS OF COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 264, honoring the University of Hawai`i for its 100 years of dedication to public higher education. 
   The 10 campuses of the University of Hawai`i offer more than 620 nationally and internationally recognized academic programs, everything from culinary arts to tropical agriculture. It is the only place in the Nation where students can earn a master's degree in indigenous language studies and has the top 25 programs for environmental law, eastern philosophy, international business, and second-language studies. 
   The 50,000 students who attend the university include many of Hawaii's best and brightest. The sizable Native Hawaiian, Caucasian, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, and Pacific Islander populations on our campuses reflect the great diversity of our State. Their years at the University of Hawai`i will prepare them to be the business, community, and political leaders of tomorrow. 
   I am proud to be among the 250,000 University of Hawai`i alumni who now reside in every State in the Union and in at least 80 countries around the world. This extended community brings the aloha spirit to the world at large. 
   Just last week I was here on the floor of the House with my two green and white footballs in honor of the university Warriors' perfect 2007 football season. The Warriors are the only college team in the country to go undefeated, but they are just one of the UH sports teams we cheer on across the islands. From volleyball to basketball, our athletes draw nearly 700,000 fans to games every year. 
   This is a special year for higher education in Hawaii. Not only is it University of Hawai`i's centennial, but it is also the 35th anniversary of the passage of title IX, now known as the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act. Patsy was a friend and continues to be an inspiration to me. This year the University of Hawai`i joined me and Congress in honoring Patsy and her trailblazing work to open the doors of higher education to women across the country. 
   I want to take a moment to thank the people who make the University of Hawai`i what it is today. David McClain, the current president of the university, and the 17 presidents who have come before him have all been leaders, dedicated to excellence in public higher education. The phenomenal team of faculty and staff has truly made a positive difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of students, past and present. Those students, in  turn, are making enormous contributions to our towns, our State, and our country. 
   My years at the University of Hawai`i in the late '60s were a time of awakening and questioning for me. Attending the university made a profound difference in my life. In fact, all four members of Hawaii's current congressional delegation have degrees from the University of Hawai`i. 
   I am proud to work closely with the University of Hawai`i as a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. As we come to the end of the 100th year in the university's history, congratulations to all involved. Here's to the next 100 successful years. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. HIRONO. I thank my colleague from Louisiana for your warm, what we call, ``Aloha'' welcome to your State. Expect thousands and thousands of rabid Rainbow Warrior fans to descend upon your State to spend money but mainly to cheer on our undefeated team, the Warriors. 
   I would like to add also, Mr. Speaker, that my colleague Neil Abercrombie, who is even as we speak on a plane coming back to Washington, DC, is, of course, very much in support of this resolution. As I mentioned, all four Members of our congressional delegation have one degree or another from the University of Hawai`i. In Neil's case, it is a Ph.D., and he also had taught at the University of Hawai`i. 
   I'm looking forward to also working with Mr. Miller on reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which has helped the University of Hawai`i so much over the years, and it's an honor for me to be on the Higher Education Committee, because the University of Hawai`i, unlike many other States, is the institution of higher learning in Hawaii. It is the public institution of higher learning in Hawaii, which is why literally hundreds of thousands of us have matriculated at the university, and we have a lot to be thankful for for the kind of quality education that the University of Hawai`i has offered to us and continues to do so for the 50,000 or so students who are on campuses all across the State. 
   And as we are moving forward to celebrate our 100th anniversary, we even now prepare to move forward to create further campuses on Oahu and the neighbor islands to afford more educational opportunities, particularly in the rural areas of our State for students in those areas. 
   So with that, Mr. Speaker, thank you very much, and my colleague from Louisiana, once again, ``Mahalo nui loa,'' to each one of you in support of this resolution.  
   Mr. ABERCROMBIE: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 264, honoring the University of Hawaii for 100 years of educating and serving the people of the state of Hawaii. I'd like to thank Congresswoman Hirono and Chairman Miller for their support of this legislation. I'd like to recognize President David McClain and the administration and faculty of UH for all their hard work and dedication. UH holds a distinguished record of achievement in academics, community service and athletics. As a proud alumni and former faculty member of the University of Hawaii, I know personally the impact of the school on those who work and learn there. Yet, that is not the full extent of the University's reach; it touches in some capacity nearly every person in the state. 
   In 1907, the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in Honolulu was established by the Hawaii Territorial Legislature with 10 students and 13 faculty members. Today, the University of Hawaii system is spread across the state with 10 campuses, 3 degree-granting universities: Manoa, the flagship campus, Hilo, and West Oahu; and 7 community colleges: Hawaii, Honolulu, Kapiolani, Kauai, Leeward, Maui, and Windward. The system includes the John A. Burns School of Medicine, the William S. Richardson School of Law, the Shidler College of Business, the College of Pharmacy, and the Congressionally-established East-West Center. There are currently over 50,000 students and 624 academic programs. Across the system, UH's students and faculty have won countless awards, and been recognized for agriculture, anthropology, computer 
   programming, diversity, education and curriculum research, international business, medical research, oceanographic science, public service, and myriad other fields of study. 
   The University values aloha, the Hawaiian concept that embraces respect for the history, traditions and culture of Hawaii's indigenous people. It reflects compassion for all people and commitment to the well-being of these islands. To practice this value UH employs nearly 15,000 Hawaii residents who serve the University and the State of Hawaii by educating its citizens, contributing to the economy, supporting workforce development and engaging the community in addressing societal issues and the challenges faced by underserved populations. 
   The University has also produced more than 250,000 alumni, now residing in all 50 states and more than 80 countries around the world, who are proud to call the University of Hawaii their alma mater. The educational programs at the University have shaped these individuals into global citizens who contribute to the well-being of a world-wide society, with a commitment to integrity, diversity, and service wherever they may be. Alumni who live abroad and on the U.S. mainland take the aloha spirit with them across the nation and world to enrich the lives of others. Among these alumni are all four current and two former members of the Hawaii congressional delegation; former Surgeon General of the United States Kenneth Moritsugu; Time Warner Chairman and CEO Richard Parsons; Miss America 2001 Angela Perez Baraquio Grey; 53 members of the Hawaii State Legislature; numerous professional athletes; and many other academic, art, athletic, business and political leaders. 
   As a reflection of the state of Hawaii, UH is a rainbow of ethnicities, cultures, nationalities, languages and ideas. The University maintains that society is best served by representing populations equitably throughout UH, and that diverse perspectives help root out prejudice and injustice. This dedication is captured succinctly in the motto of the University, ``Ma luna ae o na lahui a pau ke ola o ke kanaka,'' or ``Above all nations is humanity.'' The value of diversity is also shown through the student body: UH is one of the most diverse universities in the nation, with no dominant ethnic group and over 2,500 international students. 
   A further source of pride for the University of Hawaii is the Warriors and Wahine. The athletes, coaches, and support staff are some of the most accomplished and dedicated members of the UH ohana, or family. There are no professional sports teams in Hawaii and the student-athletes of the University carry much expectation and affection from the state. The UH women's volleyball team is among the most esteemed programs in the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), winning three NCAA national championships and one Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW, the predecessor to the NCAA for women's sports) national championship, and are consistently in the hunt for a national championship year after year. The Wahine have produced 23 All-Americans, and three National Players of the Year. The Warrior football team is also an immense source of pride to the state. This year the Warriors were the only NCAA Division I school to go undefeated during the regular season and will be playing on New Year's Day in the Sugar Bowl. The current and former starting quarterbacks; Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan and Timmy Chang, hold numerous NCAA records. The entire state will be cheering on the Warriors and, win or lose, will show aloha to this team. The women's volleyball and football team are two of the 21 programs at the University, all of which bring pride and joy to the people of Hawaii. 
   On this 100th anniversary of the University of Hawaii, I am honored to be able to extend my aloha and mahalo to UH for all it has afforded me personally, and to the state of Hawaii, which is truly enriched because of the efforts of the University.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (FAIR TREATMENT FOR EXPERIENCED PILOTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act of 2007. 
   This legislation will help address America's pilot shortage and improve airline safety, by enabling experienced pilots to continue flying instead of being forced into retirement. 
   Every week, 50 of our most experienced pilots are forced to retire as they reach the current mandatory retirement age of 60. 
   The Fair Treatment of Experienced Pilots Act would raise the retirement age to 65, in recognition that pilots who are 60 are still fully capable of flying. In fact, their experience often makes them better and safer pilots. This commonsense legislation includes requirements for pilots' health, training and evaluation. 
   Tourism is Hawai`i's major industry, and millions of visitors come to Hawai`i by air every year. We recognize the importance of the airline industry to our visitors as well as our residents who travel often for business, to visit family and friends and go on vacations. 
   Clearly, having experienced pilots on our nation's airlines is important to Hawai`i and America. 
   Many of our older pilots are also veterans who served our country in the military. So we are not only talking about the fair treatment of pilots, but also the fair treatment of veterans. Fairness requires us to allow experienced, highly capable pilots to continue flying--and not to be forced into retirement once they turn 60. 
   This legislation has bipartisan support because it is good policy. This legislation helps  airlines and the flying public by improving safety and mitigating the pilot shortage. 
   As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Subcommittee on Aviation, I want to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Oberstar, the sponsor this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker I rise in support of H.R. 1294, the Tomasina E. Jordon Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2006. This bill will confer long-delayed Federal recognition to the Chickahominy Indian Tribe, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe Eastern Division, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, Inc., the Monacan Indian Nation, and Nansemond Indian Tribe. 
   The members of these tribes were thriving before the arrival of the first European settlers. They entered into treaties with the settlers, but as has happened all too often throughout Native American history, they lost their lands to the newcomers. 
   In many cases, to correct the injustice, Congress recognized its obligation to these Native Americans and funded programs benefiting them, but without Federal recognition. This bill will finally begin to make amends to these proud tribes by granting Federal recognition. 
   This bill will permit members enrolled as tribal members to receive benefits applicable to Indians or nations, Indian tribes or bands of Indians without regard to the existence of a reservation and regardless of the location of the residence of any tribal member on or near any Indian reservation. This is only fair. The physical location of any member should not dictate whether he or she who may be otherwise entitled to and in need of assistance, should receive benefits entitled to the Tribe. 
   This bill also prohibits gaming on the tribal land. It permits the Secretary of the Interior to take any land into trust for the benefit of any member of the Tribe. The bill will finally grant the protections and benefits long denied the six Indian tribes for want of Federal recognition. 
   The experience of these tribes is similar to that of Native Hawaiians. To correct the injustices suffered by the indigenous people of Hawaii, my distinguished colleague from Hawaii, the Honorable Neil Abercrombie, and I have introduced H.R. 505, which will lead to Federal recognition of Native Hawaiians. 
   We believe that the time has long passed when all indigenous people with similar histories of sovereignty lost and homelands taken are recognized and afforded the protections they deserve pursuant to Congress' plenary powers over Indian Commerce authorized by the Constitution of the United States. 
   I strongly urge passage of this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 400, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, introduced by my colleague from Hawaii Neil Abercrombie. This bill would prohibit profiteering and fraud relating to contracts executed by the United States Government or a provisional authority for the provision of goods and services in support of U.S. missions overseas. This long overdue legislation will help correct the unconscionable and unpatriotic defrauding of the United States government, our armed services, and American taxpayers. Unfortunately, the problem of contractor fraud has proliferated in the past 4 years. 
   The United States has spent over $50 billion on contracts thus far in Iraq to provide for support services, security, infrastructure construction, and reconstruction work. Much of this spending has been under no-bid or cost-plus contracts. As a result of inadequate planning, control, enforcement, and prosecution, the free-spending, former Coalition Provisional Authority could not account for $8.8 billion of that money. Allegations about rampant waste, over-billing, and outright fraud have been reported time and time again, but no action has been taken to correct this waste of taxpayer dollars. 
   Unfortunately, current law does not explicitly extend extraterritorial jurisdiction for contract fraud on contracts executed by the U.S. Government or any provisional authority supporting a U.S. mission abroad. As a result, numerous instances of fraud have been committed and inspectors general have initiated hundreds of investigations of alleged fraudulent practices, including illegal kickbacks, bid-rigging, embezzlement, faulty construction, and fraudulent over-billing. 
   We need to toughen the laws which apply to individuals and corporations who have placed personal profit and greed over the interests of American taxpayers and our men and women serving in the armed services. While most private contractors are not overcharging the government and are providing good value with their goods and services, others are engaged in fraud and waste, costing the American taxpayers billions of dollars that could be spent on domestic needs, including funds that could have gone to our underfunded schools, health clinics, infrastructure, and environmental programs. 
   Even when the government does act to enforce fraud statutes on the books, it has been stymied by the inadequacy of current law. The infamous case against Custer Battles, an American contractor in Iraq found to have committed 37 acts of fraud, is a case in point. Custer Battles was one of a few contractors that was actually prosecuted and was ordered to pay $10 million in damages. However, it was allowed to walk away scot-free when a federal judge overturned the verdict on a technicality. The court found that United States fraud law did not apply to this contractor since the contract went through the Coalition Provisional Authority which the court held was not part of the United States government. The incompetence of this administration not only permitted fraud against the U.S. but allowed the perpetrator to escape punishment. 
   To successfully prosecute these individuals and corporations, H.R. 400 provides clear and unambiguous legal authority to criminalize this unconscionable behavior on the part of greedy, corrupt contractors and provides a mechanism for successful prosecution. We are talking about prosecuting contractors who willfully and intentionally defraud the government, not those who merely make a business mistake. We should have no sympathy or leniency for those who purposely defraud taxpayers. 
   This is not a partisan issue. As Americans, we should all stand together to put an end to greed and corruption in our government programs, which hurts the troops on the ground, undermines the efforts of our armed forces, enriches the greedy and corrupt, and steals from the American taxpayer. This must end, H.R. 400 is a major step to bring accountability to the contracting process.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act, which reauthorizes the Hawaiian Home Lands Homeownership Act of 2000. The act assists the State of Hawaii's Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, or DHHL, to provide opportunities for homeownership for low-income Native Hawaiians. 
   In 1921, Congress passed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act with the purpose of establishing a homesteading program to place eligible Native Hawaiians on lands in Hawaii designated for such purpose. The law was passed at the urging of the Territory of Hawaii's Delegate to Congress, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole. Some 200,000 acres were set aside for the purpose of providing Native Hawaiians with land. 
   With the passage of the Statehood Act of 1959, the control and administration of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act was transferred to the newly formed State of Hawaii. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands was created in 1960 to administer the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. The mission of the Department is to ``manage the Hawaiian Home Lands trust effectively and to develop and deliver land to Native Hawaiians.'' 
   Despite the good intentions of the Congress, progress of meeting the goal of delivering land to Native Hawaiians was slow. Most of the Hawaiian Home Lands were located in areas far from jobs, and infrastructure such as roads and utilities were nonexistent. Many individuals were on waiting lists for more than 30 years. 
   The Hawaiian Home Lands Home Ownership Act of 2000 has provided the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands with much-needed resources to expand opportunities for home ownership among low-income Native Hawaiians. Especially critical has been the ability to use these funds to develop the infrastructure that makes placing homes on these properties possible. 
   I urge my colleagues to support reauthorization of this important program, and I thank the Chairs, Barney Frank and Maxine Waters, for their leadership in bringing this bill to a vote.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (IN SUPPORT OF EQUITY FOR FILIPINO VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, Filipino veterans are those who answered the call of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and served alongside our Armed Forces during World War II. They fought shoulder-to-shoulder with American servicemen, and we promised to provide full veterans benefits to them. While we have made some progress toward that goal, we have not yet achieved the full equity that the Filipino veterans deserve. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 760, the Filipino Veterans Equity Act, which, in essence, makes good on the promise that our government made to these brave men over 60 years ago. 
   Our Filipino veterans are in the twilight of their lives. Of the 250,000 soldiers that fought with us, only 18,000 survive today. Of that number, 2,000 reside in my State of Hawaii. 
   As we honor our veterans all across the country this Veterans Day, let us include those Filipino veterans who still await a promise unfulfilled.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3865, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007 (ENDA), as well as in support of the amendment to the bill offered by Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN. 
   I would like to thank the chief sponsor .of the bill, Congressman Barney Frank, and George Miller, Chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, for their leadership. This is truly a historic moment, which was largely made possible by their commitment to the democratic ideals of equality and fairness. 
   As an original cosponsor of the original ENDA, H.R. 2015, I am glad to be able to have this opportunity to debate the BALDWIN amendment to include anti-discrimination protections for transgender individuals. It is unfortunate that political realities made it difficult to bring an inclusive ENDA to the floor today in the first place. 
   However, I stand with Congresswoman BALDWIN in her courageous fight to provide for the inclusion of a group that is probably the most in need of workplace protections. I look forward to continuing to work with her and our  likeminded colleagues in any effort to build upon the momentum of H.R. 3865 and provide employment protections for gender identity through future educational and legislative initiatives. 
   The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited employment discrimination based on race and gender. The scope of protections has expanded since then to also bar employment discrimination based on religion, color, and national origin. And while versions of H.R. 3865 have been introduced in each Congress since 1975, this is the first time it will be voted on by the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   H.R. 3865 provides us with a historic opportunity to be able to respond to the prejudice and discrimination that face millions of Americans in our workforce. It is at moments like these, this ability to provide for civil rights progress, that I am truly proud to be a member of the Democratic majority making freshmen class. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3865 and working toward the inclusion of gender identity in future legislation. Mahalo (thank you).

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Mr. Westmoreland to eliminate funding for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program. 
   The Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant is authorized under title VIII of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA). The block grant is used to carry out affordable housing activities for Native Hawaiian families who are eligible to reside on Hawaiian  homelands which were established in trust by the United States in 1921 under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA). 
   Due to a variety of factors, including long-term leases for purposes outside of the HHCA and the lack of funding for infrastructure, only 8,000 individuals currently hold leases, and approximately 19,000 remain on a waiting list, and many of our elderly, our kapuna, have died waiting for the dream of home ownership. 
   I submit for printing in the Record an article from the Honolulu Star Bulletin that introduces these families to us.  
   Homestead awards end long wait for lucky few--One Hawaiian homestead is awarded to a woman 57 years after her father applied.  
   The line for a homestead was so long for Aloysius Lincoln that he never saw the end of it. 
   But yesterday, 57 years after the former Honolulu Gas Co. employee applied for a lease, his daughter claimed the lease awarded for the second phase of a Department of Hawaiian Home Lands project in Kapolei. 
   ``Unfortunately, he died two years ago. He was 87,'' said Frances Segundo, 60, who was a baby when her father signed up for the program. ``However, his legacy goes on, because this award is for our ohana, our family.'' 
   About 2,000 people showed up yesterday morning at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center Exhibition Hall, where the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands awarded 250 lots in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of in their Kaupe'a project in Kapolei. 
   The 52-acre subdivision has 326 lots, 76 of which were awarded in November 2005. 
   Segundo, a clerk at Maui Community College, said her cousin, Naira Martin, would live in the four-bedroom, three-bathroom house with her daughter, but there would always be room for another relative. 
   ``I'm free from the rent, which is going to be over with,'' said Martin, 56. The $2,000 she pays each month for rent will now go toward her mortgage. ``When the whole family comes from the mainland, Louisiana, they will stay with me. It's a very good feeling.'' 
   Gov. Linda Lingle, who was present for yesterday's selection meeting, said the latest awards would help the state's shortage of affordable rentals as new homeowners are able to free up rental homes and apartments. 
   ``Those units now become available for the general public,'' Lingle said. ``It is better for the entire community.'' 
   Yesterday's crowd was a fraction of the nearly 20,000 native Hawaiians currently on the homestead waiting list, about half of which are on Oahu, said Lloyd Yonenaka, a spokesman for the Hawaiian Home Lands Department. 
   Even though more than 1,200 leases have been given out since 2003, the department's waiting list keeps growing, at a pace of about 100 people a month, Yonenaka said. 
   To qualify, applicants must have at least 50 percent Hawaiian blood and be pre-approved to afford one of the five Kaupe'a models, which range between $238,600 and $296,100 in lots averaging 5,000 square feet. The lease rent for the land under their homes is $1 per year. 
   The first phase of the Kaupe'a project is expected to be completed by the end of the year, while Phase 2 and Phase 3 should be done in the first and second quarters of 2007, according to the department. 
   As she signed documents for her new lease yesterday, Vivian Perreira, 71, said she would vacate her Maili home in Waianae--where she lives with husband, Alfred, her son and his two children--sometime next year. Perreira said her youngest son, 47-year-old Prince, a refuse truck driver for Rolloffs Hawaii Inc., had to co-sign her application because her Social Security earnings weren't enough for a loan. 
   After waiting 48 years for her name to be called, Perreira, now in a wheelchair, will lease a four-bedroom home on a corner lot in Kapolei. 
   ``I signed up when I was 23,'' she said. ``I almost gave up, but I left my name on for so long.'' 
   The federal government set up the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act in 1921, eventually reserving 200,000 acres statewide to benefit native Hawaiians. But development of land to provide homes has been slow, and many families have been on the waiting list for decades. 
   Last month the state Supreme Court ruled that 2,700 native Hawaiians can seek monetary damages in a lawsuit against the state for its alleged mismanagement of the Hawaiian Home Lands program. 
   Not everyone who came yesterday had a happy story to share. Homes went to 250 families, but 750 people qualified for lots, which are awarded on the basis of seniority. People who have qualified and waited the longest are the next in line for a home. 
   Lee Kogler, 54, who has been researching her genealogy for more than 20 years, had to leave without a lease after arriving at 7 a.m. with her husband, daughter, grandson and two sons. 
   Kogler turned in her paperwork in 1991. But after marrying and moving to New York, Kogler's application was returned, with the department saying she needed to show the Hawaiian lineage on her father's side. Finally, in 1994, Kogler combed through the bound volumes of records at the state Archives, where she found a Census Bureau report listing her grandmother, Hannah Kaulia, at age 19, living in the house of her father, Samuel, a master carpenter. 
   Kogler, who is number 7,954 on the wait list for Oahu, said she would never quit trying for a lease. 
   ``It's not a sad day,'' Kogler said, citing plans by the department to award another 300 lots in Kapolei in October. ``I'm still with hope. I've waited a long time for this, and I'm not going to give up.''  
   Aloysius Lincoln first applied for Hawaiian Home Lands in 1949. In 2006, a wait of 57 years, his daughter, Frances Segundo, claimed the lease awarded for the second phase of a Department of Hawaiian Home Lands project on the Island of Oahu. Frances claimed the lease because her father had, unfortunately, passed away 2 years before. Frances herself, now 60 years old, was a baby when her father first signed up for the program. Frances stated that ``[her father's] legacy goes on because this award is for our ohana, our family.'' 
   That is something I would like this body to remember: That this is not just money we are talking about today. We are talking about the opportunity for families to live the American dream of home ownership, and Native Hawaiian families are among those with the greatest need. A study conducted in 1996 by the Urban Institute, the National Commission on the American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing, and the State Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, found that nearly half of Hawaiian households and 67 percent of those on waiting lists for Hawaiian Homes Lands experienced housing problems related to affordability, overcrowding, or structural inadequacy. That compares with 44 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives living on tribal lands, and 27 percent of all U.S. households. 
   In 1992, 49 percent of Hawaiian Home Lands applicants lived in overcrowded conditions compared with 37 percent of all Hawaiian households, and 21 percent of non-Hawaiian households. Twenty-eight percent of Hawaiian households put more than 30 percent of income toward housing compared with 22 percent for non-Hawaiians. The rate of homelessness among Hawaiians at 12.2 households per 1,000 is double that of non-Hawaiians. 
   In 1982, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of the State of Hawaii established a Federal-State task force to renew HHCA and the programs carried under that act. The Federal-State task force issued a report in 1983 with specific recommendations, including one that the State and Federal Government should each make contributions of $29 million per year to accelerate the program. 
   For the first time in 2000, Federal funding was made available when housing assistance for Native Hawaiians was added to NAHASDA through the Native Hawaiian Block Grant. This amendment follows what I sense is a developing pattern of challenges to programs benefiting Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian people. 
   The earlier failed challenge to the previously uncontroversial Native Hawaiian Housing Act earlier this year was the first apparent salvo against Native American programs. The attempt to strike funds in the Labor and Education appropriations bill for the Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions, and the Higher Education Act raises the concerns that all programs benefiting Native Americans will be subjected to attack by certain groups. 
   The same arguments of constitutionality of these programs benefiting Native Americans have been raised and rejected by this body time and again. This is not race-based discrimination. The relationship between the United States and Native Americans is based on a political relationship, as Supreme Court decisions have consistently held. 
   Like other indigenous peoples, such as Native Americans and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians have a special trust relationship with the United States. It has been well settled that Congress has clear plenary power to fulfill its obligations to indigenous people who once had sovereign governing entities before the establishment of the United States, and whose lands are currently within the borders of the United States. Like Native  Americans and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians suffered the loss of their sovereignty and lands to the United States. 
   I could go on, Mr. Chairman, but for these and many other reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership on this very important issue.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6867, the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2008. We heard this morning that the national unemployment rate was 6.1 percent in September and 9.5 million Americans are out of work, 2.2 million more unemployed workers than just 1 year ago. 
   The unemployment rate in Hawaii has gone up from 2.7 percent in August 2007, one of the lowest in the country, to 4.2 percent in August of 2008. That increase amounted to 10,800 more people out of work in my State in just 1 year. The 28,100 unemployed men and women in Hawaii are struggling to pay their mortgages, health premiums and energy costs while they continue to look for work in the middle of an economic downturn. 
   Many Hawaii businesses have closed their doors or laid off workers in the last year, including Aloha Airlines, ATA, Maui Land and Pine, and Norwegian Cruise Line. The Hawaii economy is struggling. Tourism, agriculture and retail are all down, making it harder for people in our State to find new jobs. 
   Congress must act now to provide help for the 9.5 million Americans who are out of work. Nearly 800,000 of these workers are projected to exhaust their extended unemployment benefits this month. Over the next 3 months, over 2,400 unemployed workers in Hawaii will exhaust their benefits, leaving thousands of Hawaii families out of work and out of money. 
   We have before us an important bill that would extend these benefits for 7 weeks for the thousands of unemployed in Hawaii and across our country. I urge a yes vote on this measure.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Speaker, the emergency financial rescue package I am supporting today, while far from perfect, contains noticeable improvements on the Paulson Plan we considered on Monday. This package is much more balanced in favor of helping everyday people, middle-class families, and small businesses. The bailout package we considered on Monday was simply too geared toward Wall Street and the corporations whose irresponsible practices helped create this crisis in the first place. 
   This new financial rescue package raises the cap on FDIC-insured bank accounts from $100,000 to $250,000, which will assist families and small businesses while restoring Americans' confidence that their savings are secure. 
   The new package provides tax relief for middle-class families and tax incentives designed to create new jobs and economic opportunities in Hawaii, where people have been hit hard by the economic downturn that preceded this financial crisis. The majority of the tax relief, tax credits, and tax extenders added to the package will provide direct relief and economic assistance to middle-class families and working people--such as the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, relief provision and tax credits to speed research, development, and use of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. 
   The AMT fix, for example, will prevent some 40,000 constituents in my second district of Hawaii from having to pay higher taxes that were originally intended only to affect wealthy taxpayers. 
   The renewable energy tax credits are critical to encourage investment in the alternative energy projects Hawaii needs to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
   In addition, the bill reauthorizes for 2 years the Qualified Zone Academy Bonds, QZAB, program, which helps school districts with low-income populations save on interest costs associated with financing school renovations and repairs. Hawaii received about $1.3 million in QZAB allocations in 2005, 2006, and 2007. 
   Another significant provision of this bill requires insurance mental health parity legislation that advocates in Congress have been trying to pass for the past 10 years. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation. These provisions, included in the financial rescue package, will make sure that families struggling with mental illness do not have that challenge compounded by inadequate coverage of mental health care costs. 
   I have voted for these energy, business, and middle-class tax relief measures earlier in the House. These provisions will help 30 million homeowners, create 500,000 American green jobs, and provide tax relief for well over 25 million middle-class families. Including those tax relief proposals as part of the financial rescue package has made the overall proposal more balanced, and more likely to help everyday people get through these difficult economic times. 
   The economic downturn we are facing, resulting in loss of jobs, foreclosures, and families having difficulty paying for life's necessities, will not be fixed by this relief bill. The economic provisions added to the bill will help. But we need a broader economic stimulus package to get our economy going in the right direction again. 
   I am disappointed that it appears the Senate is not taking up the economic stimulus package (H.R. 7110) recently passed in the House, which will create jobs, extend unemployment benefits, help States with Medicaid reimbursements, and support our Food Stamp program. This bill represented some $222 million for Hawaii. 
   I did talk to Senator OBAMA about his perspective and my concerns about this bill. We both know that much more work remains to be done to address the underlying economic and regulatory problems that won't be fixed with this bill. We agree that new Federal investments are needed in transportation and clean water infrastructure as well as in education to enhance our Nation's competitiveness and to put people to work. Senator OBAMA also shares my concern that the cost of this rescue plan will not ultimately fall on the taxpayers, and he reassured me of his commitment to impose financial service fees to make taxpayers whole. With the right leadership in the White House, I am confident that we can make the changes needed in future legislation to protect homeowners and taxpayers and to reform our financial markets.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1137, supporting the goals and ideals of National Public Works Week. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota, Jim Oberstar, Chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, for bringing this measure to the floor and for his strong advocacy in support of our Nation's infrastructure needs. 
   This week, we honor and recognize the oftentimes unsung heroes of this Nation's public health and economic livelihood, the public works professionals who keep our country running smoothly. The infrastructure facilities and services that these professionals design, maintain and repair are critical to addressing our country's vast needs. Without our rail systems, our airports, our pipelines, our water treatment plants and other such services, our country would be unable to function. 
   Instituted as a public education campaign in 1960, every third week in May recognizes the quiet dedication of the workers who continue to build and maintain our country's transportation and infrastructure each year. For the hard work that these workers put in to improve each citizen's life on a daily basis, it is only fitting that we designate one week a year to celebrate their efforts. In the past, Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Lyndon Johnson have sent letters of acknowledgment to this event, and a Presidential Proclamation was signed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962. 
   While we will continue to formally appreciate this week, I believe it would  also be fitting for us to show our appreciation through our actions. Last August, the House of Representatives passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, WRDA, by a vote of 381-40. This past November, this body overrode a presidential veto for WRDA 2007 by a vote of 361-54. The vote showed an ever-present need to continue to invest and improve in our country's vast network of infrastructure. We must continue to remind our President that these projects need funding, and that ignoring our Nation's needs will only cause our current problems to grow and our infrastructure to deteriorate. 
   I support our public works professionals, our transportation and infrastructure systems and National Public Works Week. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from California for yielding me time. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 1153, celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. First, I want to thank the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and the 78 cosponsors of the resolution. I hope all the Members of the House will join me in supporting this measure. 
   The Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community is composed of over 15 million people. AAPIs own 1.1 million businesses, generating an estimated $326 billion for our economy. The community is a crucial element in the cultural fabric of the United States, representing people from East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and the Pacific islands. We celebrate the month of April as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month to not only commemorate the achievements of the AAPI community, but to remind us of the work that is left to do. 
   In this resolution I highlight four leaders of the AAPI community. One such leader is Yuri Kochiyama, a Japanese American civil rights activist who was involved in attaining reparations for Japanese Americans, and the reformation of the Harlem school system in the 1960s. 
   Another notable member is Private First Class Herbert Pililaau, a native Hawaiian Medal of Honor recipient who died in combat during the Korean War while courageously volunteering to defend his fellow soldiers as they withdrew from their posts. 
   Also noteworthy is Dalip Singh Suand, the first Asian American and Sikh American elected to Congress, who advocated for naturalization rights for people of South Asian descent. 
   Finally, I'd like to commend my predecessor, the late Patsy Takemoto Mink, for becoming not only the first Asian American woman, but also the first woman of color elected to Congress. Her work to increase access to education, particularly through title IX, is an inspiration for my bill, the PRE-K Act, which focuses on our youngest children. 
   The AAPI community has accomplished much and given much, given their history of discrimination. For example, in 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act barred Chinese laborers from entering the United States, even though prior to this date, Chinese laborers built our transcontinental railroad. 
   And another example, in 1942, 120,000 Japanese American citizens and legal residents were relocated to internment camps, while many of their sons served in the 442nd regimental combat team, the most decorated unit in U.S. history.     
   We've repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act and have granted reparations for surviving Japanese Americans. But  there is still much to do to address social and political challenges facing the AAPI community. 
   One major issue is securing self-determination rights for native Hawaiians. H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, grants native Hawaiians the same rights to manage their affairs currently enjoyed by other indigenous people, the American Indians and the Alaskan Natives. I thank the Members who supported passage of H.R. 505 in the House last year. 
   Additionally, about 2,000 Filipinos fought alongside American servicemen in World War II. These Filipino veterans were promised full veterans benefits, yet in 1946, President Truman signed the Rescission Act which stripped them of benefits that were accorded to all other soldiers. Compounding this inequity are the immigration quotas that delayed for up to 20 years the issuance of visas to sons and daughters of these Filipino veterans, a major hindrance to the reunification of these families. 
   We have an opportunity in the House to remedy these situations through two measures that address these issues. S. 1315, which passed the Senate by an overwhelming 96-1 vote, would allow the surviving Filipino World War II veterans to obtain veteran benefits; and my bill, H.R. 1287, the Filipino Veterans' Family Reunification Act, which would exempt the sons and daughters of naturalized Filipino veterans from immigration quotas. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in advancing these legislative priorities for the AAPI community. 
   In closing, our vast pool of knowledge, talent, and cultural diversity is a source of strength for the United States. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 1153 and to participate in events celebrating AAPIs throughout your communities.

   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 309 authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the District of Columbia's Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run. I thank Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton for bringing this measure to the floor. 
   The Capitol Police, along with the D.C. Special Olympics, will participate in the torch run to be held on June 6, 2008. The D.C. Special Olympics will work closely with the Capitol Police and the Architect of the Capitol to make sure that the event is in full compliance with the rules and regulations governing the use of Capitol grounds. Consistent with all events on Capitol Hill, the event will be free and open to the public. 
   The Law Enforcement Torch Run for the Special Olympics is run nationwide by law enforcement officers, leading up to each State's or National Special Olympics summer games. As a matter of fact, I have participated a number of times in Hawaii's Law Enforcement Torch Run. 
   Each year, nearly 50 local and Federal law enforcement agencies in Washington, D.C. participate to show their support of the D.C. Special Olympics. This torch relay event is a traditional part of the opening ceremonies for the Special Olympics which will take place at Catholic University in the District of Columbia. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 339, a resolution that supports the goals of Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month, and that brings much needed attention to motorcycle safety on our Nation's roadways. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) and the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Giffords) for bringing this important issue to the forefront. 
   As spring arrives, our highways and rural roads will once again see a large increase in motorcycle traffic across the country. Motorcycles make up a valuable component of the transportation network in our Nation, with over 6.2 million registered motorcycles in the United States in 2006. These numbers continue to grow in each year as registrations increase by over 60 percent from 1998 to 2005. 
   With gas prices approximating $4 per gallon, motorcyclists benefit from the significant advantage they hold in fuel efficiency over drivers. However, this increasingly popular mode of transportation also requires greater attention to the safety concerns associated with riding. Because of their smaller size, motorcyclists are often hidden in a vehicle's blind spot. Public awareness of motorcycle safety benefits everyone that uses our Nation's roadways, not just motorcyclists, because it can lead to a decrease in car-motorcycle crashes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the statistics on motorcycle fatalities and injuries each year further illustrate the importance of public awareness and the need for greater education of all roadway users. Per vehicle mile traveled, motorcyclists are approximately 37 times more likely than passenger car occupants to die in a motor vehicle traffic crash and eight times more likely to be injured. In 2006, motorcycle rider fatalities increased for the ninth straight year. 
   According to NHTSA, between 1996 and 2006 there were 35,546 motorcyclist fatalities, and 708,000 motorcyclist injuries on U.S. roadways. In 2006, there were 4,810 motorcycle fatalities and 88,000 injuries, up from 2,161 fatalities and 55,000 injuries in 1996. 
   Throughout Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month, riders are encouraged to become educated on the importance of following the rules of the roadway, being alert to other drivers, and always wearing protective gear, such as a helmet. NHTSA estimates that helmets saved 1,658 motorcyclists' lives in 2006, and that 752 more lives could have been saved if the motorcyclists involved in fatal nonhelmeted crashes had worn helmets. 
   Mr. Speaker, as these statistics illustrate, increased awareness of motorcycle safety is an important and urgent need in this country. We cannot allow thousands of riders to die each year on our Nation's highways. Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month helps to decrease motorcycle crashes through licensing, rider training, education, enforcement, personal responsibility, and increased public awareness. 
   I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) and the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Giffords) for introducing this resolution, and urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 305, a resolution that recognizes the important role bicycling plays in both recreation and transportation. I thank Representative EARL BLUMENAUER, an avid cyclist, for bringing this measure to the floor. May has been designated as National Bike Month, making it an appropriate time to consider this measure. 
   Cycling is a healthy, environmentally friendly activity and mode of transportation. At a time when our Nation is facing a growing obesity epidemic and the challenges of global climate change, we in Congress should be making every effort to encourage and accommodate cyclists.     
   H. Con. Res. 305 expresses the support of the Congress for a number of commonsense approaches to increase bicycling and to protect cyclists, including setting goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled, or VMT, and to increase the safety of cyclists, spending highway safety funds proportionately to the percentage of cyclist and pedestrian deaths, implementing ``complete streets'' policies that take into account the needs of all users when designing a road, streamlining nonmotorized transportation project delivery while upholding environmental standards, creating bicycle-friendly Federal lands and developing a national bike route system, continuing and strengthening Federal programs that support nonmotorized transportation and increasing intermodalism, building on the Green the Capitol initiative, which includes a bike sharing program and sets an example for employers to be bicycle friendly. 
   In 1994, the U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT, delivered the National Bicycling and Walking Study to Congress, which created a now-defunct interagency task force to coordinate bicycling and walking safety and mobility efforts across Federal agencies. This resolution encourages DOT to reestablish this task force with representatives from all appropriate Federal agencies. 
   H. Con. Res. 305 gives us a foundation to use as we consider the role cycling will play in the upcoming surface transportation authorization, and lays out a number of thoughtful approaches to increase bicycling and keep cyclists safe. 
   I thank, again, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for introducing this resolution, and urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1252, the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. 
   I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, which makes it illegal for any company to sell gasoline at excessive prices or to take advantage of market conditions by increasing prices during an energy crisis. It allows the Federal Trade Commission and the States' Attorneys General to bring lawsuits against corporations that charge excessive prices for gasoline. The bill also permits investigations of companies suspected of price gouging and requires honest and accurate reporting of pricing practices. 
   In the first month of the 110th Congress, the House took away $14 billion in taxpayer subsidies from the oil companies. This money will be reinvested in alternative, renewable energy sources. 
   Yesterday the House passed a bill by a bipartisan 345-72 vote, a bill that authorizes the Justice Department to take legal action against OPEC state-controlled entities and governments that conspire to limit the supply or fix the price of oil. 
   Hawaii's consumers pay some of the highest gasoline prices in the Nation. In 1998, the State of Hawaii filed a lawsuit against the major oil companies operating in our state. The lawsuit revealed that 22 percent of an oil company's nationwide dealer profits came from Hawaii, a state that represented only 3 percent of the market. Clearly, Hawaii's consumers were contributing an excessive share of the company's profits in relation to market share. 
   Since President Bush took office, gas prices have more than doubled, and previous Congresses have failed to protect consumers from price increases. For the first time in years, Congress has begun exercising its oversight responsibilities. This is important given that the six largest oil companies made $30 billion in profits for the first quarter of 2007, on top of the $125 billion in record profits for 2006. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, which aims to reduce the burden of high energy costs on American families and businesses, build on efforts to increase energy efficiency, lessen our dependence on foreign oil, and cut greenhouse gas emissions in the longer term.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (COPS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1700, the COPS Improvement Act of 2007. I would like to thank the chief sponsors of this legislation, Congressmen WEINER and KELLER, for their efforts in bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor today. 
   Congress created the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322). Administered by the U.S. Department of Justice, the COPS program awards grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to hire and train community policing personnel, implement new technologies to combat crime, and develop new policing techniques. 
   Since its establishment, the COPS program has been widely hailed as a success. It most notably has supported the hiring of over 120,000 additional police officers and helped contribute to a nationwide decrease in the rate of violent crime. In Hawaii alone, COPS grants have helped to hire 522 additional police officers and sheriffs and placed 18 new resource  officers in primary and secondary schools throughout the islands. 
   Yet funding for this successful program has become a yearly Congressional battle. President Bush's latest FY 2008 budget request seeks to cut funding for the COPS program by 50 percent, which is actually an improvement from previous years in which program funding was simply zeroed out. 
   In justifying the COPS program funding cut, the administration has often cited the need to refocus our energies on homeland security issues. However, our State and local law enforcement agencies play an increasingly significant role in homeland security through their already established roles in local crime prevention and investigation. It is not unreasonable to suggest that State and local law enforcement entities are among our first lines of defense in keeping our homeland secure. To that end, it is the responsibility of this Congress to continue to support and strengthen the COPS program. 
   H.R. 1700 is an affirmative step in this direction, as it would authorize $1.15 billion each year in years 2008 through 2013 for the COPS program. This is a 10 percent or $103 million increase from the amounts authorized in current law. Of that amount, $600 million would be allocated each year for the hiring of additional law enforcement officers. It is estimated that this amount will translate into at least 50,000 new police officers on our streets. H.R. 1700 would also allow for up to $350 million annually for grant programs that improve crime-fighting technologies and up to $200 million each year to assist district attorneys in hiring prosecutors. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1700, as it supports the work of law enforcement officers across our Nation. I would also like to extend a heartfelt mahalo (thank you) to our State and local law enforcement officers who serve our Nation with distinction and aloha.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 505, NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule. I thank Chairman Slaughter and Vice Chair MCGOVERN for the rule which fairly gives the only amendment to be filed due consideration pursuant to House rules. I disagree with the amendment because it, if adopted, unnecessarily creates confusion where none exists. 
   The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization bill is a good one, the result of over 6 years of fine-tuning and negotiations, including significant compromises with the Department of Justice, Department of the Interior, and the Office of Management and Budget to conceive a law that should be approved by all persons concerned with the welfare of Native Hawaiians. 
   This bill is supported by the Republican Governor of the State of Hawaii, the Hawaii State legislature, the American Bar Association, the National Congress of American Indians, the National Education Association, the NAACP, League of United Latin American Citizens, and dozens of other civil rights, professional associations and unions. 
   I will enter into the Record a list of all supporters of this measure, as well as letters of support from the Governor of the State of Hawaii, Linda Lingle; the American Bar Association; National Congress of American Indians; and the Japanese American Citizens League, and thank them for their wholehearted support. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me close by quoting a sentence from the letter from the National Congress of American Indians, which is of particular relevance to the proposed amendment to be offered. ``To invoke the equal protection or due process clause of the Constitution in this context, as some of the legislation's critics attempt to do, is a perversion of what those clauses were intended to do. Those submitting this argument are using the very cornerstones of justice and fairness in our democracy to deny equal protection to one group of indigenous people.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to adopt the rule so we may get on to the merits of this important legislation that will at long last afford the Native Hawaiian people self-determination and self-governance long given to other indigenous people of the United States but denied to Native Hawaiians.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, which begins to provide a measure of justice for the indigenous native people of the Hawaiian Islands. I'd like to take a few moments to share some of the history to show why this bill is so important to all the people of Hawaii. 
   The Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown in 1893. Hawaii's last Queen, Lili'uokalani, was deposed by an armed group of businessmen and sugar planters who were American by birth or heritage, with the support of U.S. troops. The Queen agreed to relinquish her throne, under protest, to avoid bloodshed. She believed the United States, with which Hawaii had diplomatic relations, would restore her to the throne. As we now know, despite the objections of President Grover Cleveland, the injustice of the overthrow was allowed to stand and the Republic of Hawaii was established. 
   A few years later, in 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii. Prior to annexation, a petition drive was organized by Native Hawaiians securing signatures of almost two-thirds of the Native Hawaiian population opposing annexation; 29,000 signatures out of an estimated Native Hawaiian population of 40,000 at that time.     
   These petitions are now in the National Archives. 
   The Hawaiian culture was under siege. The Republic of Hawaii prohibited the use of the Hawaiian language in Hawaii schools. Everyday use of the Hawaiian language diminished greatly. Hula, which had been suppressed by the missionaries and then restored by King Kalaukaua a few years before the overthrow, survived but did not thrive. Hawaiians were pressured to assimilate and much was lost. 
   When Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole was elected to serve as Hawaii's Delegate to Congress, he succeeded in passing the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, which set aside some 200,000 acres of land for Native Hawaiians. The reason for the legislation was the landless status of so many Native Hawaiians who were displaced by newcomers and became the most impoverished population in their own land. In recognition of its trust responsibility to our Native Hawaiians, Congress passed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, which is still in force. 
   Hawaii became a State in 1959. Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a Native Hawaiian cultural rediscovery began in music, hula, language, and other aspects of the culture. This cultural renaissance was inspired by hula masters, kumu hula, who helped bring back ancient and traditional hula; musicians and vocalists, who brought back traditional music sung in the Hawaiian language; and political leaders, who sought to protect Hawaii's sacred places and natural beauty. 
   This flowering of Hawaiian culture was not met with fear in Hawaii but with joy and celebration and an increased connection with each other. People of all ethnicities in Hawaii respect and honor the Native Hawaiian culture. 
   In 1978, Hawaii convened a constitutional convention that was designed, in part, to right some of the wrongs done to Native Hawaiians. The constitutional convention created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, or OHA, so that Native Hawaiians would have some ability to manage their own affairs. 
   The constitutional convention also laid the groundwork for the return of some Federal lands to Native Hawaiians, including the island of Kaho'olawe, which currently is held in trust for a future Native Hawaiian governing entity. The convention also designated the Hawaiian language, along with English, as the official State language of Hawaii for the first time since the overthrow in 1893. 
   We can trace the genesis of this bill, embodying the hope of an indigenous people to control their own fate, all the way back to the overthrow of 1893. It has been a long road. I believe how we treat our native indigenous people reflects our values and who we are. Clearly, there is much in the history of our interactions with the native people of what is now the United States that makes us less than proud. But one of the great attributes of America has always been our ability to look objectively at our history, learn from it, and where possible make amends. 
   Native Hawaiians, like American Indians and Alaska Natives, have an inherent sovereignty based on their status as indigenous, native people. They desire the right to exercise management over their own affairs and land. 
   Our State motto, which is the same as that of the Kingdom of Hawaii, is ``Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono,'' which means ``the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness.'' This is an historic vote and one that helps to perpetuate righteousness by righting an historic wrong. 
   I ask my colleagues to stand with the people of Hawaii and support this bill. 
   Mahalo nui loa.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, which begins to provide a measure of justice for the indigenous, native people of the Hawaiian islands. I could argue the legal and constitutional arguments on why this bill should be passed, but I want to take a few minutes to share some of the history to show why this bill is so important to all the people of Hawai`i. 
   As many of you know, the Kingdom of Hawai`i was overthrown in 1893. Hawai`i's last Queen, Lili`uokalani, was deposed by an armed group of businessmen and sugar planters, who were American by birth or heritage, with the support of U.S. troops. The Queen agreed to relinquish her throne, under protest, to avoid bloodshed. She believed the United States, which with Hawai`i had diplomatic relations, would restore her to the throne. As we now know, despite the objections of President Grover Cleveland, the injustice of the overthrow was allowed to stand, and the Republic of Hawai`i was established. 
   A few years later, in 1898, the United States annexed Hawai`i. Prior to annexation, a petition drive organized by Native Hawaiians secured signatures of almost two-thirds of the Native Hawaiian population opposing annexation (29,000 signatures out of an estimated Native Hawaiian population of 40,000). These petitions are now in the National Archives. 
   The Hawaiian culture was under siege. The Republic of Hawai`i prohibited the use of the Hawaiian language in Hawai`i schools. Everyday use of the Hawaiian language diminished greatly and it was in danger of dying out. Hula, which had been suppressed by the missionaries and then restored by King Kalaukaua a few years before the overthrow, survived but did not flourish. Hawaiians were pressured to assimilate and much was lost. 
   When Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana`ole was elected to serve as Hawai`i's delegate to Congress, he succeeded in passing the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, which set aside some 200,000 acres of land for Native Hawaiians. The reason for the legislation was the landless status of so many Native Hawaiians, who were displaced by newcomers and became the most impoverished population in their native land. In recognition of its trust responsibility toward Native Hawaiians, Congress passed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, which is still in force. 
   Hawai`i became a state in 1959. Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a Native Hawaiian cultural rediscovery began in music, hula, language, and other aspects of the culture. This cultural renaissance was inspired by hula masters (kumu hula), who helped bring back ancient and traditional hula; musicians and vocalists, who brought back traditional music and sang in the Hawaiian language; and political leaders, who sought to protect Hawai`i's sacred places and natural beauty. 
   This flowering of Hawaiian culture was not met with fear in Hawai`i, but with joy and celebration and an increased connection with each other. People of all ethnicities in Hawai`i respect and honor the Native Hawaiian culture. We are not threatened by the idea of self determination by Native Hawaiians. 
   In 1978, Hawai`i convened a constitutional convention that was designed, in part, to right some of the wrongs done to Native Hawaiians. The constitutional convention created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs or OHA so that Native Hawaiians would have some ability to manage their own matters. The people of Hawai`i ratified the creation of OHA and voted to allow the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to be elected solely by Native Hawaiians. Although the Supreme Court in Rice v. Cayetano decided that limiting the vote in this manner violated the 15th Amendment, that decision was based on the fact that the State of Hawai`i ran the elections, not whether or not Native Hawaiians are an indigenous, native group with an inherent sovereignty. In fact, the court expressly avoided the issue of whether or not Native Hawaiians are analogous to an Indian tribe. 
   The Constitutional Convention also laid the ground work for the return of some federal lands to Native Hawaiians, including the island of Kaho`olawe, which is currently held in trust for a future Native Hawaiian governing entity. The ConCon, as it is known in Hawai`i, also designated the Hawaiian language (along with English) as the official state language of Hawai`i for the first time since the overthrow in 1893. 
   I was in the Hawai`i State Legislature when we approved creation of Hawaiian language immersion schools, recognizing that language is an integral part of a culture and people. The Hawaiian language was in danger of disappearing. Public Hawaiian language preschools, called Punana Leo, were started in 1984. We now have Hawaiian language elementary, middle, and high schools in Hawai`i, and a new generation of fluent Hawaiian language speakers are helping to keep this beautiful and culturally important language alive. Other native peoples are looking to the Hawai`i model as a means of preserving and perpetuating their native languages.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate February 19, the National Day of Remembrance for Japanese American internment. 
   During World War II, fear and mistrust clouded judgment and allowed brazen racism to take hold. Sixty-six years ago next week, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which sent 120,000 American citizens and legal residents of Japanese descent into internment camps, forcing them to lose their homes, jobs and possessions. Some of these families were held in internment even while their sons showed great patriotism by serving in the Army. In my home State of Hawaii, 10,000 individuals were investigated and an estimated 1,250 Japanese Americans were detained in our islands. 
   During trying times such as our Nation once again faces, we must not allow prejudice against people based on race, creed or national origin to shape public policy. Fear tests our moral fortitude, and this National Day of Remembrance reminds us to reflect on our past actions in order to make just decisions which uphold our Constitution.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act, the largest increase in college aid since the GI bill, and I especially thank Chairman Miller for his leadership. 
   This legislation will make college more affordable and accessible for students in Hawaii and across America. It will do so at no new cost to taxpayers. 
   Keeping America competitive requires an educated workforce prepared for high-skilled jobs. Beyond preparing our youth for careers, education is vital for the full development of an individual. 
   College costs have skyrocketed beyond the needs of many students and their families, and as a result, students in Hawaii and elsewhere are holding off going to college or skipping it all together, and those who do attend college are taking on increasing amounts of debt. 
   So this bill is of critical importance because the hardworking families I represent need this help. 
   I also want to mention a few other provisions in this legislation that are very important to me. As a member of this committee, I worked to increase funding for colleges and universities for native Hawaiians and Alaska natives $30 million over the next 5 years. For this and many other reasons, I rise in strong support of this measure.

   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I ask permission to revise and extend my remarks. 
   I rise in support of the College Cost Reduction Act, the largest increase in college aid since the G.I. bill, and I thank especially Chairman Miller for his leadership. 
   This legislation will make college more affordable and more accessible for students in Hawai`i and across America. 
   It will do so at no new cost to taxpayers. 
   Keeping America competitive requires an educated workforce prepared for high skilled jobs. 
   Beyond preparing our youth for careers, education is vital for the full development of an individual. 
   College costs have skyrocketed beyond the means of many students and their families. As a result, many students in Hawai`i and elsewhere are holding off on going to college or skipping it altogether. And those who do attend college are taking on increasing amounts of debt, so this bill is of critical importance to the hard-working families I represent. 
   I also want to mention a few other provisions in this legislation that are especially important to me: As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I worked to increase funding for colleges and universities serving Native Hawaiians and Alaska Natives by $30 million over the next 5 years. 
   We also included a $10 million investment in institutions serving Asian and Pacific Islander populations that historically have had low education attainment. 
   This legislation includes the provisions from my Early Educator Loan Forgiveness bill that provides college loan forgiveness for graduates who enter the field of early education to encourage more of them to pursue this field. 
   For these reasons and more, I am proud to support this legislation.

   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5. As a first generation immigrant who came to the United States speaking no English, education was a great equalizer for me, which is why this bill is of particular importance to me. Access to education is critical, but college costs are so high that individuals and families are being priced out of the opportunity. 
   I worked to put myself through college and law school, but I couldn't have done it without student loans. It took me 15 years to pay those loans back, but I was glad to have them. 
   Today we have an opportunity to do something concrete, something real, to help make college more affordable and accessible. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Education should be the great equalizer, but that can happen only when every qualified student has the opportunity to pursue it. Mahalo.

   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, the majority of Americans do not support the President on Iraq. Yet he persists. 
   Our caucus is united in our desire to end this war and bring our troops home safely despite our genuine disagreements as to how and when to bring this about. Within this disagreement, we reflect the broad spectrum of opinion in our country. Yet, as Members of Congress, we must take action to change the trajectory of this war, to come closer to the goal of ending the war. 
   By setting deadlines for the President to meet his own articulated benchmarks, this bill places us firmly on that path. 
   This bill is not perfect. There will be ``no'' votes because there are deadlines and ``no'' votes because the deadlines are too distant. The ``perfect'' bill that all of us can support will not materialize and we will be no closer to ending this war. 
   At the same time, until their safe return, we must support our troops and provide them with the equipment and protective gear they need while they are in harm's way. 
   With this bill, Congress for the first time since the war began is not handing the President a blank check or rubber stamping his failed conduct of this war. 
   I strongly urge passage of this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3195, the ADA Restoration Act of 2007. I would like to thank the chief sponsor of the bill, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, George Miller, for their leadership and work on disability rights.  
   Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, 18 years ago with overwhelming support from both parties and President George H.W. Bush. The intent of Congress was clear: to make this great Nation's promise of equality and freedom a reality for Americans with disabilities. 
   Standing together, leaders from both parties described the law as ``historic,'' ``landmark,'' an ``emancipation proclamation for people with disabilities.'' These were not timid or hollow words. The congressional mandate was ambitious: prohibit unfair discrimination and require changes in workplaces, public transportation systems, businesses, and other programs or services. 
   Through this broad mandate, Congress intended to protect anyone who is treated less favorably because of a current, past, or perceived disability. As with other civil rights laws, Congress wanted to focus on whether an individual could prove that he or she had been treated less favorably because of a physical or mental impairment. Congress never intended for the courts to seize on the definition of ``disability'' as a means of excluding individuals with serious health conditions like epilepsy, diabetes, cancer, HIV, muscular dystrophy, and multiple sclerosis from protection under the law. 
   Yet this is exactly what has happened. Through a series of decisions interpreting the definition of ``disability'' narrowly, the U.S. Supreme Court has inappropriately shifted the focus away from an employer's alleged misconduct onto whether an individual can first meet a ``demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.'' 
   Millions of Americans who experience disability-based discrimination have been or will be denied protection under ADA and barred from challenging discriminatory conduct. By passing H.R. 3195, the Congress will be able to correct these decisions made by the courts. 
   H.R. 3195 would do this by: amending the definition of ``disability'' so that individuals who Congress originally intended to protect from discrimination are covered under the ADA; preventing the courts from considering ``mitigating measures'' when deciding whether an individual qualifies for protection under the law; and keeping the focus in employment cases on the reason for the adverse action. The appropriate question is whether someone can show that he or she was treated less favorably ``on the basis of disability'' and not whether an individual has revealed enough private and highly personal facts about how he or she is limited by an impairment. The bill reminds the courts that--as with any other civil rights law--the ADA must be interpreted fairly, and as Congress intended. 
   As an original cosponsor of H.R. 3195, I believe that it rightfully will restore protections for disabled Americans under the landmark ADA, one of our Nation's most important civil rights laws. 
   I would like to share with you just a few examples of how ADA has made a positive impact for individuals with disabilities in my home State of Hawaii: 
   An 85 year old Honolulu woman, who is both deaf and blind, is able to access the public transportation system to visit her husband who resides in a long-term care facility far from her home. 
   The first ``chirping'' traffic light on the island of Kauai was installed at a busy intersection thanks to the work of an advocate for the blind. 
   The annual Maui County Fair has a special day set aside for people with disabilities to participate in the rides and games.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Providing Resources Early for Kids Act of 2007, the PRE-K Act. 
   The PRE-K Act will help more children enter school ready to succeed. It creates a new Federal/State partnership to provide better preschool opportunities for our country's children. 
   Research shows that participation in a high-quality early education program can improve success in school and later in life. So this bill focuses on quality. It is flexible enough to encompass many types of State-funded preschool programs so long as they are high quality. For example, in Hawaii, an Early Learning Task Force is working on a new State-funded preschool program to ensure Hawaii's children have access to a variety of high-quality preschool experiences, from Head Start to community based organizations. 
   The PRE-K Act is one of the best investments we can make in our children, our families, and our Nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its passage.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. I would like to thank the chief sponsor of this legislation, Congressman CONYERS, for his work and dedication in bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor for debate. 
   H.R. 1592 will strengthen existing Federal hate crimes laws in two meaningful ways. First, the bill removes the requirement that victims of violent bias-motivated crimes be engaged in a federally protected activity, such as voting, when the crime is committed. Federal entities would then be able to provide technical and grant support for the hate crimes investigations of State and local law enforcement agencies. Second, the bill provides for a more comprehensive definition of hate crimes to include those motivated by gender, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. 
   In 2005, the FBI documented 7,163 hate crimes directed against institutions and individuals because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability. These statistics were gathered from 12,417 law enforcement agencies across the country. Yet it is not the frequency or number of crimes alone that distinguish these acts of violence from other crimes. 
   We know that hate crimes are more than individual assaults--they send shock waves and fear throughout a whole community and segments of our diverse population. Hate violence is also a message crime and the messages are clear: ``know your place'' and ``your kind is not welcome here.'' Hate crimes clearly pose a serious threat to our Nation's security and the very values upon which our country were founded. 
   As an original cosponsor of H.R. 1592, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of final passage.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. I thank the gentlelady from Florida for her leadership on issues important to our young people, and for yielding some time to me. 
   I know that you mentioned mothers and fathers. Well, grandparents, too, because I'm a step-grandparent and I have a wonderful step-daughter who has two young children. So these are issues near and dear to all of us. 
   As we commemorate the Week of the Young Child, I rise today in strong support of quality early childhood education, and tonight, in particular, for increased funding for Head Start and the Child Care and Development block grants, two Federal programs supporting our youngest children. 
   Congress got it right when it created Head Start 43 years ago. This is an example of a government program that families depend on every day and that really works, thanks largely to the many talented and dedicated teachers throughout our Nation. 
   I want to take a moment to commemorate the life of one such teacher,  Mrs. Leona Stevens, who served as the lead teacher at several Maui Head Start centers for over 15 years. She passed away unexpectedly recently and will be deeply missed by all of us. 
   Mrs. Stevens was known for valuing students' creativity and continually asked them, ``why do you think that'' and ``what do you think will happen?'' She was equally passionate about improving the quality of Head Start by training new early education teachers and furthering her own education. She went back to school to get her associates degree in early childhood education and spent 7 years working in partnership with Maui Community College to train new Head Start teachers. 
   Last year, while Leona was mentoring new young teachers, Congress worked hard to pass the Head Start Reauthorization bill, which was signed into law. The bill made many improvements to this program, but the single most important thing we did was to increase the amount of money authorized for Head Start. 
   Of course we all know the difference between authorized levels and appropriated levels. This year, we must put our money where our mouth is. The fact is, only half of all eligible children are served by Head Start, and a measly 3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers are served by early Head Start. This means hundreds of thousands of low-income families are without access to high-quality early education opportunities for their children. 
   Speaker Pelosi hosted a summit for America's children last year in which we heard from neuroscientists, police chiefs, business leaders, all of whom told us in unequivocal language that it pays to invest in children before they turn six. I chaired a hearing on early education in the full Education and Labor Committee earlier this year, and we heard the same message from State level advocates and policy makers. 
   I talk to parents, Kindergarten teachers and business leaders in Hawaii every time I go home, and they tell me that we must increase access to high-quality early education and child care opportunities. Why? Because that is the best investment that we can make in our young children and in our country's future. 
   Certainly this year, like every other year, Congress will face many difficult spending decisions. We will fund our veterans and troops, fund health and alternative energy research, fund our public schools. I will support increases in all of these things, but this is not a zero sum game and we cannot afford to let our youngest children slip through the cracks. 
   We should increase funding for Head Start by at least $1 billion and increase funding for CCDBG by $874 million. It is a matter of fairness. Every child deserves a shot at success. We know, however, that many children from low-income families start Kindergarten with half the vocabulary of their wealthier peers. High-quality preschool can do much to close this gap. 
   It is a matter, also, of economic prosperity. Our small business community, our science and technology community all need educated workers. Low-income children who go to a high-quality preschool are more likely to graduate from high school than their peers that did not go to preschool. 
   Finally, it is a smart investment of Federal dollars. Research shows that every dollar invested in high-quality early education programs returns somewhere between $2 and $17. Even at the very low end of that spectrum, it is a worthwhile investment. 
   Parents, police officers, business owners and teachers across Hawaii and the rest of the country are asking us to make children a priority. I know that Maui's beloved Mrs. Stevens would join them. I urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to provide real increases to these vital programs. 
   And I close by saying that the working people of Hawaii, we have a much higher percentage of working parents, working single parents than probably any other State in the country, and that is because the cost of living is very high in Hawaii. I've talked to the many mothers and fathers and grandparents who take care of their grandchildren now of how important it is for their kids and their grandchildren to have a good start in life. And certainly one of the best ways for them to get a good start in life is to make sure that we continue to support Head Start and the other grant programs that will give them this chance. 
   I yield back to my colleague from Florida and thank her for her continuing leadership on these and so many other issues.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Improving Head Start Act of 2007. Over and over again, rigorous evaluations have shown that Head Start and Early Head Start works. It improves the lives of our neediest children and families. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill at hand, as it makes several positive changes to the Head Start program. It authorizes $450 million new dollars to the program, which is enough to provide up to 10,000 new spots for children. It prioritizes program improvement by increasing funding for teacher and staff salaries and professional development. It suspends the National Reporting System, which is a flawed testing system that does not adequately assess this comprehensive system. 
   Science has shown that providing a quality early education experience leads to healthy brain development that prepares children for success in school, as well as later in life. Access to high quality early education, as well as to wrap around, comprehensive services, really sets the foundation for children and their parents. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this strong, bipartisan bill. It will directly improve the lives of many, many children and families.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to ask for my colleagues' support for this amendment, to improve Early Head Start. 
   The amendment revises the training and technical assistance system by ensuring that these services are provided by entities with specific expertise in infant and toddler development. It also directs at least 50 percent of training and technical assistance funds directly to the grantees. These are the people on the ground working with children who are best able to prioritize their training needs for the purpose of program improvement. 
   In our hearing on the bill in the Committee on Education and Labor, we heard that Head Start providers are not getting the assistance they need under the current system. One program director said that it had been 10 months since she saw her technical assistance specialist. 
   The current system centralized control often results in the assistance specialist spending more time filling out forms for their supervisors than directly helping the program directors in the field. The bill we are debating today solves this problem for the Head Start program serving preschoolers by directing the responsibility for training and technical assistance responsibility into the State-based system that can better meet the needs of the local providers. 
   Early Head Start directors experience similar problems, and, therefore, should get a similar solution. This amendment provides that solution and, furthermore, requires that these State-based technical assistance providers include individuals with infant and toddler expertise available to work with Early Head Start providers. 
   Rigorous evaluations show that the Early Head Start program has made a positive difference in the lives of participating children and their families. This bill expands the Early Head Start program, which currently serves only 3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers. And as Early Head Start expands, we must ensure that individual programs have the knowledge and skills to provide positive outcomes for participants. This amendment will do that, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Mr. Westmoreland to eliminate section 811 of H.R. 2786 which reauthorizes the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant and Loan Guarantee programs. 
   This block grant is used to carry out affordable housing activities for Native Hawaiian families who are eligible to reside on Hawaiian homelands which were established in trust by the United States in 1921 under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. 
   Due to a variety of factors, including lack of program funding, only 8,000 individuals currently hold leases and reside on Hawaiian homelands. Approximately 23,650 remain on a waiting list, and many of our elderly, our kupuna, have died waiting to achieve the dream of homeownership. 
   This block grant supports the dreams of homeownership for Native Hawaiians, not just in Hawaii, but across our Nation, as 2,712 Hawaiian homeland applicants currently reside outside of Hawaii. In fact, 21 Native Hawaiians who live in Georgia, the home State of the author of this amendment, have applied for this very program he has not once, but twice, tried to eliminate. 
   Many of you may remember that this past July the gentleman from Georgia offered an amendment that would eliminate funding for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program in the fiscal year 2008 Transportation-Treasury-Housing appropriations bill. This body rejected that amendment in a bipartisan vote of 116 yeas to 307 nays. 
   These amendments are really just the latest in a pattern of challenge to programs that focus on benefiting American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian people. An earlier failed challenge to the previously uncontroversial Native American Housing Act, H.R. 835, was the first apparent salvo against Native American programs. Then there was an attempt to strike funds for Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions in the fiscal year 2008 Department of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill. 
   These actions raise the concern that all programs benefiting indigenous people will be subjected to attack. 
   Like other indigenous groups, such as American Indians and Alaskan Natives, Native Hawaiians have a special trust relationship with the United States. It has been well settled that Congress has clear plenary power to fulfill its obligations to indigenous people who once had sovereign governing entities before the establishment of the United States and whose lands are currently within the borders of the United States. 
   Like American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians suffered the loss of their sovereignty and their lands to the United States. Congress has an obligation to Native Hawaiians, whose sovereign government was overthrown with the aid of the United States military under the direction of the U.S. minister. 
   Congress has demonstrated this special relationship by enacting over 150 laws specifically benefiting Native Hawaiians since 1900. None of the laws Congress has enacted benefiting Native Hawaiians have ever been successfully challenged as unconstitutional.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007, and I would like to thank Chairman George Miller of the Education and Labor Committee for his commitment and dedication to bringing this bill to the floor. 
   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted to protect individuals from discrimination they face in the workplace. This bill amends title VII to ensure employees have a realistic remedy to pay discrimination. The bill reinstates the paycheck accrual rule, a law widely interpreted by eight Federal circuit courts to mean that the 180 day time limit for filing a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission begins each time a discriminatory paycheck is received. 
   I would like to stress that this bill does not amend the rule that an aggrieved person may only recover back pay for the 2 years preceding the filing of the charge, so there will be no incentive to wait 5, 10, 15 or 20 years, as our opponents claim, to bring such a lawsuit. Moreover, employers prior to the Ledbetter decision were not inundated with stale pay discrimination claims, and this law will in fact not promote the filings of such claims. 
   The Ledbetter decision was a shocking decision for many of us, because we know what it is like to face pay discrimination in the workplace. It is not as though employers announce that they are going to engage in pay discrimination. Employees are not encouraged to discuss what they are making, so it is very difficult to find out that this kind of discriminatory action is even taking place. 
   Supreme Court Associate Ruth Bader Ginsburg strongly disagreed with the majority decision stating, ``In our view, the court does not comprehend, or is indifferent to, the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination.'' She urged the Congress to act by passing this kind of legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote strongly in favor of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, which promotes renewable energy by providing more than $8 billion in long-term tax incentives for electricity produced from renewable sources and encourages greater energy efficiency improvements to homes and commercial buildings. 
   H.R. 5351 also repeals $18 billion in tax subsidies and loopholes that have for too long benefited the big multi-national oil and gas companies, even as they continue to reap record-breaking profits. While Exxon Mobil raked in $40 billion in earnings last year, American families paid skyrocketing gas prices. In my home State of Hawai'i, where about 90 percent of our energy comes from imported petroleum, residents pay among the Nation's highest prices for electricity and fuel, an average of $3.54 per gallon at the pump. In some parts of the State, the cost for a gallon of regular gas has risen to nearly $4.00. Consumers in Hawaii and across the Nation should not be burdened by excessively high energy costs while also facing a growing credit and housing crisis. 
   We cannot continue to rely upon Big Oil and offshore oil producers to supply our energy needs at the expense of consumers and the environment. This bill contains long-term tax incentives to achieve energy independence by expanding production of renewable homegrown fuels and electricity in addition to extending tax credits for solar energy, fuel cell investment, and residential energy efficient property. 
   I believe that H.R. 5351 will do much to put us on a path toward energy independence, create new jobs as we invest in renewable energy production, and help tight global warming. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2881, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007. I thank Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairman COSTELLO for their leadership and hard work to bring this complex legislation to the floor. 
   While there are disagreements on certain issues, the bill that emerged from the committee will serve the greater interests for the American people for years to come. I am truly proud to have been part of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Subcommittee on Aviation in developing this important legislation. 
   I will address a few of the numerous positive provisions of the bill that warrant mention and support. 
   One section extends the coverage of OSHA to flight attendants. For all too long--well over 30 years--flight attendants have fought an unsuccessful fight to win basic occupational and health protections available to nearly all other American workers. 
   Despite a Memorandum of Understanding in 2000 between FAA and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration to rectify this discriminatory application of employment law, flight attendants are still left without any meaningful safety and health protections. Since the FAA has shown no inclination to follow through on the MOU, it is time for Congress to act. 
   Every day, flight attendants risk exposure to poor air quality, blood-borne viruses including HIV and Hepatitis B, cosmic radiation and noise. They are expected to perform excessive lifting, pushing, pulling and carrying--including carry-on baggage and poorly designed food and beverage carts. Without workplace regulatory protections, flight attendants who are sick and injured have no one to help them. This unacceptable condition threatens not only the health of flight attendants, but the safety of the hundreds of passengers who depend on flight attendants for many in-flight services, not to mention life-saving assistance in times of emergency. 
   The time has long passed for flight attendants to be denied the same protections that the Federal Government affords millions of other hard-working employees in both the 
   private and public sector, including its own employees. It is time for Congress to extend OSHA protections to 50,000 American workers who have been denied this basic employment right by their federal regulator, the FAA, which should be leading this effort. 
   Another important provision that will bring fundamental fairness to the industry is the bill's abolition of the arbitrary 60-year age limit on commercial pilots. Only commercial airline pilots in the U.S. are prohibited from flying after age 60. The International Civil Aviation Authority already allows its pilots to fly to age 65. Many advanced countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand have no age limit. Only the U.S., Pakistan, France and Colombia still hold on to this arbitrary disqualification of otherwise competent pilots. 
   While eliminating this totally subjective and discriminatory restriction on the right to work, the bill provides the necessary safeguards to protect the flying public. No pilot over the age of 60 who is not otherwise capable and qualified will be able to work on the flight deck, just like any other qualified pilot of any age. 
   The FAA itself agrees that the 60-year old limit should be abolished, but it will take the agency two years to promulgate regulations to change this admittedly archaic rule. Meanwhile, an estimated 4,000 pilots will needlessly be forced to retire unless we pass this bill. 
   Finally, one of the more contentious provisions of the bill relates to collective bargaining for air traffic controllers. I support the air traffic controllers on this issue. It is a matter of simple fairness that the FAA be compelled to deal fairly with this important group of its employees. There is no fair and equal collective bargaining if one side can walk away from the negotiation table and unilaterally impose its position once an impasse is reached. Fundamental fairness requires that the parties resume negotiations until an agreement is reached and, if the parties cannot agree, mediation should be required. Meanwhile, the pre-impasse terms and conditions of employment should be maintained, as it is in all collective bargaining relationships, until a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified. 
   Collective bargaining not only protects the rights and benefits of the air traffic controllers, but also protects the lives and safety of the traveling public. When they are adequately compensated and allowed sufficient time for training, rest and recuperation, air traffic controllers would able to do their jobs more effectively. 
   There is no worse a method to destroy morale and loyalty--and hence effectiveness and performance--of employees than to show such disrespect for them. In a job as critical to the safety of millions of travelers, the effectiveness and professionalism of air traffic controllers must be fostered, not undermined by unfair employment practices that treat them with such undeserved disdain. Giving these important employees bargaining rights equal to the employer is not only the right thing to do, it is the safe thing to do for all Americans. 
   For the reasons I have stated, I support this comprehensive and major improvement to our nation's aviation system. I urge my colleagues to look at the bill in its entirety and vote to pass this important legislation.

   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4137, the Higher Education Opportunity Act. I want to thank my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee and in the Senate for their commitment to this important piece of legislation. While this reauthorization is long overdue, I believe this compromise bill will provide millions of our nation's students with increased access to higher education. 
   This bipartisan bill will help provide families with critical information about the cost of college and student financial aid programs. By helping families better understand the true financial costs of higher education and how they can apply for student aid, families will be better able to make informed choices about their student's education. 
   The Higher Education Opportunity Act truly an investment in education at all levels. To provide all of our children with a high quality education that will better prepare them for success in school and in life we must ensure that there is a qualified, caring, competent teacher in every classroom, particularly in the early years. This bill makes great progress toward this goal by expanding student loan forgiveness and professional development programs that will help recruit, prepare, and retain teachers in the field of early education. 
   This bill will also provide more low-income and minority students with support to prepare  for and successfully attend college. I am particularly pleased to see provisions in this reauthorization that provide much-needed resources to Native Hawaiian-serving institutions for programs to help Native Hawaiians meet the demands of careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. 
   Again, I want to thank my colleagues from both chambers for their tireless efforts in advancing this significant legislation. In particular, I would like to recognize Senator Ted Kennedy for his leadership and for his years of dedication to improving access to high quality education for all of our students. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Higher Education Opportunity Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation is needed to strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963. I thank Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro for sponsoring this bill and fighting for its passage year after year and Chairman George Miller for championing this bill through the committee and on the House floor. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act has garnered tremendous support from 230 cosponsors and over 200 national, state, and Iocal organizations. While the Equal Pay Act was intended to prevent pay discrimination in the workplace, 45 years after it was signed by President Kennedy, women, and especially women of color, continue to take home significantly less pay than men for the same work. Single women and female heads of households fare the worst in the current system. These women earn less than their male colleagues during their careers, which in turn adversely affects their ability to save and accrue retirement benefits. 
   As a representative of the second Congressional district of Hawaii, I have the great honor and responsibility of continuing the important work of my predecessor, Patsy Takemoto Mink. Congresswoman Mink's personal struggles as a woman in a culture dominated by men inspired her to work tirelessly for equal rights for women and girls. She faced obstacles in pursuing her education and career, but she was not deterred--instead, she broke down barriers, becoming the first Japanese-American woman admitted to the bar in Hawaii and the first woman of color elected to national office in this country when she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1964. Today, women continue to break down barriers in the workplace, but they still receive only a fraction of the pay men receive for the same work.  
   Although the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed to prevent pay discrimination based on sex, the law clearly has not had the intended result, even after 45 years. Women still make only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men for equal work. This bill will strengthen enforcement of the law, thereby fulfilling its intended purpose. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to stand up for the right of women to receive equal pay and support the Paycheck Fairness Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of amendment number 22, offered by Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Bob Filner, which would provide a one time payment to the courageous Filipino veterans of World War II. 
   Filipino veterans are those that honorably answered the call of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and served alongside our armed forces during World War II. They fought shoulder to shoulder with American servicemen; they sacrificed for the same just cause. We made a promise to provide full veterans' benefits to those who served with our troops. And while we have made appreciable progress toward fulfilling that promise, we have not yet achieved the full equity that the Filipino veterans deserve. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 760, The Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007, which was introduced by the Chairman to provide the necessary reclassification of the service of Filipino veterans to make them eligible for all the veterans' benefits programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs. In essence, H.R. 760 makes good on the promise our government made to these brave men over sixty years ago. 
   Today, out of the 250,000 Filipino World War II veterans, only 18,000 are left. Of that number some 2,000 reside in my home state of Hawaii. As Filipino veterans are entering the sunset years of their lives, Congress is running out of time to fulfill our obligations to them. 
   While there is no question in my mind that the appropriate action for Congress is to provide full veterans' benefits to the Filipino World War II veterans, this one time payment of $15,000 to those veterans who are now American citizens and a $9,000 payment to those veterans that remain Philippine nationals is a gesture that is a step forward in the little time we have left to thank and respect the promises made to these brave soldiers for their service to our country.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, as a cosponsor of H.R. 400, introduced by my colleague from Hawaii, the Honorable NEIL ABERCROMBIE, which seeks to prohibit war profiteering, I support H.R. 1362 which champions the same goals. 
   At a time of war, when the lives of Americans are put at risk, when the limited resources of the Nation are being expended and when programs serving millions of Americans are being cut back, no corporation or person should ever be allowed to misuse, waste or misappropriate Federal tax dollars. Unfortunately, due to mismanagement, incompetence and sweetheart deals, and lack of oversight, certain U.S. corporations and their subsidiaries apparently have blatantly over-charged government agencies, engaged in wasteful practices and committed allegedly fraudulent acts that have resulted in the virtual disappearance of billions of dollars. 
   Examples of American corporations padding expenses then charging an administrative fee on top of the overpriced goods and services have been well-documented. Documentaries such as ``Iraq for Sale'' chronicle a chilling story of unchecked waste, demoralization of our troops from shoddy services provided by contractors and shameless acts of corporate misconduct. 
   It is shocking that, in some cases, it's all legal. Without reasonable restrictions on contractor spending and practices on no-bid and cost-plus contracts and lack of enforcement of existing law, there is no incentive to provide goods and services to the government at the least cost and with the greatest efficiency. Indeed, the current practices foster and encourage waste and corruption, as the dismal track record in Iraq of defense contractors demonstrate. Just one corporation, Halliburton, has disputed charges amounting to over a billion dollars. 
   This bill minimizes the use of no-bid contracts, promote the use of cost effective fixed-price contracts and limit the duration of no-bid contracts, which must be awarded under emergency conditions, to one year. This bill allows the awarding of no-bid contracts which cannot be delayed but require re-bidding when the emergency has elapsed. Public disclosure of the reasons for using no-bid contracts and overcharging will promote transparency and expose improper contracting practices. Fixed price, rather than open-ended cost-plus, contracts will encourage efficiency and minimize unrestricted spending by contractors. 
   H.R. 1362 will go a long way to curb unchecked abuse and overcharging, slipshod accounting practices and lack of accountability. It will give government procurement managers the authority to control wasteful and fraudulent contractor practices, as well as be governed by stricter ethical guidelines to regulate the procurement managers' own behavior. 
   Until now, there has been no effective congressional oversight since the war began and no effective laws to rein in wasteful, corrupt and, in fact, unpatriotic behavior. Billions have been lost in this war, while critical programs in education, health, environment, alternate energy and other domestic needs have been unnecessarily slashed. 
   This legislation will help correct this unacceptable situation. I commend Chairman WAXMAN and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for this important improvement in our Federal contracting laws.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3867, the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act. 
   This bill expands procurement opportunities for small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, women entrepreneurs, and socially disadvantaged business owners. These firms remain under-represented in the Federal contracting marketplace and have yet to receive their fair share of Federal Government contracts. 
   H.R. 3867 assists small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans by requiring agencies to award sole-source contracts to these firms if they are identified as being capable of performing the contracts. These businesses currently receive less than one percent of Federal Government contracting dollars. Authorizing agencies to enter into sole-source contracts with service-disabled veteran-owned firms will raise the likelihood of these firms obtaining Federal contracts. Moreover, H.R. 3867 provides an inflationary adjustment to the limitation on contracts by increasing the size of available contracts awarded without competition to $5.1 million. 
   This bill directs the Small Business Administration, SBA, to comply with an Executive  Order requiring the SBA to provide service-disabled veteran-owned companies with information and assistance on Federal contracting as well as assist other agencies in their strategies to expand contracting opportunities for them. 
   Passage of this bill is also important for our women-owned businesses. In 2000, Congress enacted the Women's Procurement Program to expand opportunities for Federal contracts to women business owners within industries in which they have been significantly under-represented. On behalf of women-owned businesses, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce sued the SBA over the delay in implementing the program and won their lawsuit in 2005. Seven years after the Women's Procurement Program was enacted into law, however, the SBA has yet to establish regulations that would implement this vital program. I share Chairwoman VEL&#193;ZQUEZ's frustration with this delay and her admonishment to the SBA to remedy the situation. 
   H.R. 3867 requires the SBA to implement the Women's Procurement Program immediately. The bill makes economically disadvantaged women entrepreneurs eligible for restricted competition contracts and gives the SBA the authority to waive this requirement in industries that are substantially under-represented by women-owned businesses. Today, women-owned small businesses capture only about 3 percent of Federal small-business contracting dollars. We need this legislation to encourage women entrepreneurs to participate in the Federal contract marketplace. 
   H.R. 3867 expands and modernizes the 8(a) Business Development Program, which has not been amended since 1988. The 8(a) program currently assists over 9,000 small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including about 200 firms in my State of Hawaii. H.R. 3867 makes two main improvements to this program: it provides for an inflationary increase in net worth limitations to a maximum of $550,000 for program participants and extends the duration of program participation from 9 to 10 years. Increasing the net worth ceiling will bring stronger firms into the 8(a) program. 
   Finally, I support this bill because it addresses contracting problems and increases oversight over unqualified businesses by setting standards that protect the integrity and consistency in application of contract assistance programs. H.R. 3867 mandates government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small businesses. In addition, it requires the SBA to perform the necessary checks on program applicants and participants to confirm their business integrity and qualifications. This is important given recent findings by the SBA Inspector General of fraud and abuse in the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) program. 
   Chairwoman VEL&#193;ZQUEZ has noted that the Federal Government failed to meet its small and minority business goals for a 6th year in a row, costing entrepreneurs $4.5 billion in lost opportunities. H.R. 3867 is another step in the right direction to help our small businesses, and I thank Chairwoman VEL&#193;ZQUEZ for her commitment and strong leadership in sponsoring this important legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PINEDALE ASSEMBLY CENTER -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of House Resolution 109. Today we will be taking action on two related measures, House Resolution 122, earlier debated, and this resolution. 
   One of the lowest points in American history occurred 65 years ago when the Constitution and civil rights of 120,000 persons of Japanese ancestry were trampled upon by their own government. Under the cloud of war, hysteria, false rumors and racial bigotry fueled official misconduct that led to the uprooting of innocent aliens and citizens alike in one of the worst wholesale infringements of constitutional rights in the 20th century. 
   As a consequence, thousands of persons of Japanese ancestry were forced by their own government to dispose of their property, businesses, farms and possessions for pennies on the dollar, if anything at all. Families were split up and sent to different relocation camps. Educations were disrupted, and careers abruptly terminated on only a few days' notice. Wholesale violations of basic constitutional rights were committed in the name of national security. Yet not a single act of sedition or espionage by any of the evacuees was ever proven in any court of law. 
   To the contrary, the historic exploits of AJA in the 100th Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team in Europe and the MIS in the Pacific and Asia proved that patriotism was not skin deep. The psychological and emotional pain of this experience was so deep that many evacuees never talked about their experiences for decades. 
   Many who were directly affected by the order live and work among us still. A member of my own congressional staff, my deputy chief of staff, Susan Kodani, was born in the Manzanar Relocation Camp. Her family was then relocated to Michigan, ironically to permit her college-educated father to assist in the war effort. 
   Many more, of course, suffered personal losses and tragedies more traumatic and devastating. By recognizing the historic significance of the Pinedale Assembly Center and by observing the Day of Remembrance as called for in earlier House Resolution 122, we say to the Nation and our fellow citizens that America can never forget this horrible tragedy. While it directly affected one segment of our population, the ramifications to all Americans are profound and no less relevant today as we wage war in Iraq. 
   The constitutional rights of all Americans are in jeopardy if any group of citizens can be persecuted without legal justification. We must all stand vigilant and alert for any attempt by any group, whether a small power clique or the majority of Americans, to overstep the bounds of the law for momentary expediency or even for claims of national security during war. The protection of our constitutional rights of all of our citizens require continued vigilance from all of us.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and my colleague for yielding time. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2007 and ask for my colleagues' support of the bill. 
   The Act assists the State of Hawaii's Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, DHHL, to provide opportunities for homeownership for low-income native Hawaiians. The bill in no way addresses the question of whether or not Native Hawaiians should be recognized as a sovereign entity akin to Alaska Natives or American Indians. 
   During debate on this bill last Wednesday, no Member came to the floor to speak in opposition to the bill. In fact, the gentleman from Arizona, who managed the time, expressed support for the bill. 
   Unfortunately, either during the debate or afterward, e-mails were sent to Members containing at least two erroneous assertions: first, that this bill is unconstitutional and, second, that this bill ``would confer on Native Hawaiians an arrangement like that between the Federal Government and American Indian tribes.'' Opponents then compounded the error by citing the Rice v. Cayetano voting rights Supreme Court decision in support of their broad assertions. 
   As to the first assertion, the constitutionality of any measure must be decided by the courts; and, clearly, the courts have not opined on the constitutionality of this bill. As to the second assertion, there is nothing in the bill that speaks to creating a political relationship between Native Hawaiians and the Federal Government akin to the relationship between the Federal Government and American Indian tribes. 
   This bill, which promotes homeownership, a goal that all of us can support in bipartisan fashion, has been targeted for defeat by opponents who are misreading the bill as well as case law. 
   I was a member of the Cayetano administration in Hawaii and sat in the Supreme Court when arguments in the Rice case were heard. It may interest some of you to know that one of the lawyers arguing the State of Hawaii's case was John Roberts, who is now Chief Justice of our Supreme Court. 
   The central issue in the Rice v. Cayetano case was the narrow question of whether the State of Hawaii could hold an election for trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs where only Native Hawaiians could vote. In holding that the State could not so limit these elections, the majority opinion of the Court deliberately avoided the question of whether or not Native Hawaiians deserved the same right of self-determination granted to American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
   Nothing in the Rice decision holds that programs that benefit Native Hawaiians are unconstitutional. The majority court decision did not call into question the trust relationship between the U.S. Government and the Native Hawaiian people. It did not strike down the Office of Hawaiian Affairs or any other program benefiting Native Hawaiians as unconstitutional. 
   While the entire Hawaii congressional delegation, Hawaii's Governor, who happens to be a Republican, and the Hawaii legislature supports self-determination for Native Hawaiians, that is not the subject of the bill before us today. My colleague and I have introduced H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007, also known as the Akaka bill. We can discuss the merits of self-determination for Native Hawaiians when and if the Congress considers that bill. 
   The bill before us today provides assistance to a limited group of Native Hawaiians, those designated as beneficiaries under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921. That bill, in recognition of the desperate poverty and displacement from the land of Native Hawaiians, established a homesteading program to place eligible Native Hawaiians, or those with at least 50 percent Hawaiian blood, on lands in Hawaii designated for that purpose. The law was passed at the urging of the Territory of Hawaii's delegate to Congress, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole. Some 200,000 acres were set aside for the purpose of providing Native Hawaiians with land. This 1921 Act of Congress has never been challenged in the Supreme Court in the last 86 years. 
   Despite the good intentions of the Congress, progress in meeting the goal of delivering land to Native Hawaiians was slow. Most of the Hawaiian homelands were located in areas far from jobs, and infrastructure like roads and utilities were nonexistent. Many individuals were on the waiting list for more than 30 years. The Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act of 2000 has provided the Department of Hawaiian Homelands with much-needed resources to expand opportunities for homeownership among low-income Native Hawaiians. Especially critical has been the ability to use these funds to develop the infrastructure that makes placing homes on these properties possible. 
   Because the issue of Native Hawaiian rights as a native people lies at heart of the opposition of this bill, I would like to quote attorneys H. Christopher Bartolomucci, Viet Dinh, and Neal Katyal, who stated in a February, 2007, legal document prepared for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs: 
   ``Congressional legislation dealing with indigenous groups is political, not racial, in character and therefore is neither discriminatory nor unconstitutional. Rice v. Cayetano specifically declined to address whether `Native Hawaiians have a status like that of Indians in organized tribes' and `whether Congress may treat Native Hawaiians as it does the Indian tribes'.'' 
   As previously mentioned, we can and should have the debate on whether or not Native Hawaiians should enjoy the rights to self-determination given to other Native American groups when that bill is squarely before us in H.R. 505. Native Hawaiians deserve no less. 
   This bill before us today simply provides Native Hawaiians who are eligible for homesteads under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act passed by Congress with the financing tools to allow them to realize for their families the dream of homeownership which otherwise would be available to very few of them. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mahalo nui loa.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to H.R. 1908, the Patent Reform Act. 
   I applaud the House Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property for their efforts in putting together this comprehensive bill. However, I cannot in good conscience support the Patent Reform Act in its current form given the concerns that continue to be raised from organizations in my district and at least 100 companies nationwide. 
   Organizations in my district, such as the Hawaii Science & Technology Council and University of Hawaii's Office of Technology Transfer and Economic Development, have raised concerns regarding the provisions on mandatory publication, prior user rights, apportionment of damages, and post-grant review, which may discourage investment in innovative technologies, harm inventors, and reduce publication and collaborative activities among academic scientists. I want to make sure that the final bill that becomes law protects the interests of Hawaii's burgeoning high technology industry and small inventors.  
   This bill remains a work-in-progress that certainly requires more debate. Our patent system serves as the basis for America's innovation. It is my hope that the concerns and needs of our inventors will be addressed in conference should this bill pass the House as I very much want to be able to support the final conference report.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I am shocked that some in our community have implied that minorities are somehow responsible for the financial debacle our country is facing now. 
   Apparently, the argument is that minorities are getting loans through the Community Reinvestment Act on the basis of race, and often little else. I don't know what evidence there is for such a sentiment, but I do know that the vast majority of subprime market loans were financed by Wall Street, not by the commercial banks regulated under the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   Trying to shift the focus from the lack of oversight by this administration of our financial markets and the irresponsible behavior of so many brokerage firms by scapegoating minority families who are trying to realize the American Dream of homeownership is not only insensitive, but insulting.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (SUPPORT VETO OVERRIDE ON SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to override the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization. The bill we sent him earlier this month would provide health  insurance for 10 million low-income children. 
   This includes continuing insurance for the 20,000 kids in my State of Hawaii already in the program, and reaching out to provide coverage for an additional 12,000 Hawaiian children currently eligible but not yet enrolled in the program. 
   I am disappointed that the President and many Members on the other side of the aisle have taken what can fairly be characterized as a stand against children. This is how much of the country views their position. Apparently even the President is aware that his veto was a bad decision because he now says that he wants to find a way to compromise with Congress. However, the CHIP reauthorization that the President vetoed was already a bipartisan compromise. 
   The original bill we passed in the House would have ensured health care for children of legal immigrants and other important provisions that the Senate saw fit to cut. So the version of the legislation that the President vetoed was in fact already a compromise bill. 
   It is not surprising that we have strong public support for a bill that reflects our American values. Forty-three Governors, Republican and Democratic Governors alike, share our belief that all children deserve access to health care. Senate Republicans who helped shape the legislation agree. 
   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin summed it up precisely in an editorial this month by declaring that the President's ``veto is indefensible.'' 
   Therefore, I urge my colleagues not to defend the President's indefensible veto, but to instead join together in defense of the most vulnerable among us, our children. 
   This is not only the right thing to do, it is the fiscally responsible thing to do. The bill is fully paid for, and the cost of this preventive care will save substantial money over time as we keep children out of unnecessary and expensive emergency room visits. 
   I am also distressed but not surprised by the President's misinformation in defending his veto. He would like people to believe that our bill provides health coverage to families who don't need it, those who are making $83,000 for a family of four. This is simply not true. In fact, our bill does the opposite. 
   Our bill helps States reach out to enroll the poorest children most in need of health coverage and it decreases Federal contributions to States which cover families over 300 percent of the Federal poverty line. 
   What this veto comes down to is a question of values: Should every child in this country have health care? Does every child deserve a chance to grow up into a healthy adult? I think so, as do my constituents in Hawaii and indeed the majority of Americans. 
   Tomorrow's vote will reflect our values, and I urge my colleagues to stand with our children.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (SEASONED CUSTOMER CTR EXEMPTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 323, the Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act. This bill eliminates a no-longer-necessary regulatory requirement which increases the costs of doing business for hundreds of financial institutions and their customers who ultimately bear the cost of this regulation. 
   H.R. 323 provides long overdue relief for our financial institutions from the requirement of keeping records and filing reports called Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) to the Treasury Department for any financial transaction valued in excess of $10,000.00. 
   While the original purpose of the regulation, to identify suspected money laundering activities, was a commendable tool for Federal prosecutors, its utility has been adequately replaced since 1996 by the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports required by Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The CTRs are no longer the primary tool to identify suspected money laundering activities but banks must still file these reports, unless an exemption is given by the Department to certain ``qualified business customers.'' The exemption procedures, however, have been found to be difficult to understand, cumbersome and still required the banks to obtain annual renewals. 
   This legislation will allow by statute the Treasury Department to issue regulations that would permit depository institutions to apply for an exemption from the requirement to file CTRs on a ``qualified customer.'' The bill defines a qualified customer as any business organized or incorporated under state or federal law that has maintained a deposit account with the institution for at least twelve months and engaged in multiple currency transactions otherwise subject to the reporting requirement. 
   An estimated 30 percent of the 12 million CTRs received by the Treasury Department were filed on recurring customer transactions that were eligible for exemption under the current law. This bill will relieve financial institutions of the costly and unnecessary requirement to file CTRs in those instances and allow them to file a one-time notice of exemption for each qualified customer. 
   The Department will still be permitted where justified to suspend, reject or revoke such exemption notices to assure that it performs its legal duties. It also requires the department to report back within 3 years of enactment on the effects of the bill. 
   This bill is an example of Congress taking appropriate action after reviewing a regulatory requirement that made sense when first enacted but which no longer is needed. Too often, these burdensome requirements continue on the books to the detriment of our business community. Congress should continue to work with our business community to identity other instances of unnecessary regulations and requirements so that appropriate action can be taken.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (KALAUPAPA MEMORIAL ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3332. 
   Kalaupapa is a 2 1/4 -mile-wide shelf of land jutting out beneath sea cliff ranging from 1,600 to 3,000 feet in height on the island of Molokai. It is an incredibly beautiful and isolated area with a unique history. 
   This bill authorizes the establishment of a memorial at Kalaupapa National Historical Park in the memory of those who were forcibly relocated there because they suffered from or were suspected of having Hansen's disease, or leprosy. Once sent to Kalaupapa, most never saw their homes or their families again. 
   Kahauliko, Loe, Liilii, Puha, Kini, Lono, Waipio, Kainana, Kaumoana, Nahuina, Lakapu, and Kepihe. These are the names of the first 12 people who were exiled to Kalaupapa on January 6, 1886, 142 years ago. 
   This poster is a copy of the Kingdom of Hawaii's register, now at the Hawaii State Archives, of those sent to Kalaupapa Peninsula. These first 12 were all Native Hawaiians, nine men and three women. From that day forward until 1969, approximately 8,000 people living in the Hawaii Islands were taken from their families and isolated on Kalaupapa Peninsula, first in Kalawao, and later in the town of Kalaupapa. Because of society's fear of leprosy, which we now call Hansen's disease, food was scarce, and shelter and health care were minimal for the new arrivals. The mortality rate for exiles in the first 5 years was 46 percent due to the poor conditions. 
   ``An Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy'' was first signed into law in 1865 by Lot Kamehameha, the King of Hawaii. The act essentially criminalized the disease. Children, mothers, and fathers were forcibly separated. Children born to parents at Kalaupapa were taken away from their mothers and sent to live in orphanages or with other family members outside of Kalaupapa. 
   The policy was continued in the Republic of Hawaii after Hawaii was annexed by the United States and into statehood. Hawaii's isolation laws for people with Hansen's disease were not repealed until 1969, 10 years after statehood, even though medications to control the disease have been available since the late 1950s. 
   Nearly 6,700 of the approximately 8,000 people who have died at Kalaupapa, more than 75 percent, lie in unmarked or unidentifiable graves. Their names are known only in the official records, which are not easily accessible. 
   A memorial listing the names of those who were exiled to Kalaupapa and died there is a fitting tribute and is consistent with the purpose of the park, to preserve and interpret the Kalaupapa settlement for the education and inspiration of present and future generations. 
   Many have heard of the sacrifices of Father Damien, who is represented by one of Hawaii's two statues in this Capitol, as well as those of Mother Marianne Cope and Brother Dutton, who each gave decades of their lives to care for the patients at Kalaupapa. Fewer know, however, of the courage and sacrifices of the exiles who were torn from their families and all they knew to make a life in this isolated area. It is important that their lives be remembered. 
   The Kalaupapa memorial will bring these people back to their rightful places in their family genealogy and history. Many families have gone to Kalaupapa to search for the graves of their ancestors; but with only 1,300 marked graves, most are disappointed. 
   In a letter of support for the memorial, David and Chris Mahelona explained why they, as Native Hawaiians, feel an urgent need for a monument that would list the names of everyone sent to Kalaupapa. 
   I quote: ``The naming process and the giving of a Hawaiian name is an important and sacred component of traditional Hawaiian culture. It is said that names carry significant mana, spiritual power, and they are actually a part of the person, just like an arm or leg. In ancient Hawaii, a person's name was one of the most precious possessions unique to that individual, and most times related to an event, an ancestor, or a personality trait. In every case, the kapuna (elders) are always consulted. It was the responsibility of the bearer of the name to carry its weight. Therefore, it is important to remember these people by their names at their final resting place.'' 
   I would also like to read the testimony that Kuulei Bell, president of Ka 'Ohana O Kalaupapa, submitted to Congress. Kuulei, who contracted Hansen's disease at age 6, is now 74. And I recently visited her at Queens Hospital in Honolulu. 
   Kuulei testified: ``We need to remember the people who have dedicated their lives and came to Kalaupapa. Father Damien, who we love so much, came to take care of all those in Kalaupapa in the 1800s, and he became one of us, contracted the disease, and so we know how this is. 
   ``And also we know that Mother Marianne gave her aloha and love with all the nuns to come and take care of the patients. They need to be remembered. 
   ``These things are so important, and the monument is a big part of our history and our lives.     
   ``So please consider what we are asking for is our history and for our children to know what happened to many  of our patients. How sad it was for my mother, who had to wait for me to go and she could not even touch me because of the disease. And I could not even touch my children. These are the things that we should consider, how important it is. These are the memories. So please consider these things. I say these things from my heart and I hope that you hear it.'' 
   Kuulei ended her testimony thus: ``Thank you for listening to this. Aloha and much aloha; much, much mahalo.'' 
   Ka 'Ohana O Kalaupapa, a nonprofit organization consisting of patient residents at Kalaupapa National Historical Park and their family members and friends, was established in 2003 to promote the value and dignity of the exiles of Kalaupapa and to make certain that the lives of these individuals are honored and remembered through establishment of a memorial or memorials within the boundaries of the park at Kalawao or Kalaupapa. 
   I want to thank House Natural Resources Committee Chair Nick Rahall and Parks Subcommittee Chair RAUL GRIJALVA for helping to move this important bill to the floor, and I also want to thank my cosponsor, Congressman NEIL ABERCROMBIE, for his strong support and assistance. 
   Most of all, I send my heartfelt aloha and mahalo to all the members of Ka 'Ohana O Kalaupapa, to all the Kalaupapa patients and their families, and most especially to Kuulei on this momentous day. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3332.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in honoring the legacy of human rights champion Lantos Tam&#225;s Pet&#233;r and expressing great sympathy on the passing of this great American. 
   As a member of the freshman class of the 110th Congress, Tom Lantos was certainly a colleague that I admired and looked toward for guidance. I am especially glad that under our new majority he was able to serve as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, a post that he held with distinction. There was an air about him, of European old-worldliness and charm, that I will never forget. It was a great honor to have served with a man of such character and integrity.  
   TOM is famously quoted as saying that he was an ``American by choice.'' And how only in this country, could ``a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and a fighter in the anti-Nazi underground ..... have received an education, raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of Congress.'' As a naturalized U.S. citizen myself, I hope to give back to this Nation as much as TOM did in his many years of public service. 
   I would like to extend my deepest condolences to TOM's beloved wife, Annette Tillemann Lantos, his daughters Annette Tillemann-Dick and Katrina Swett, his 18 grandchildren, and his 2 great-grandchildren. Thank you for sharing Tom with us and with the world. His example of courage and integrity will continue to inspire us.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my fellow Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, CAPAC members, and my other colleagues in celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. 
   I'd like to, of course, thank Congressman Honda for organizing this special order tonight, and for his leadership shown throughout the year in his service as chairman of CAPAC. 
   The heritage month theme is ``Meeting the Challenges for Asian Pacific Americans.'' The APA community has  come a long way since the days when laws excluded us from coming to this country, barred us from many places, public places, and worse, interned us in camps solely because of our ethnic heritage.     
   Nationwide, we are now 14 million strong, and in the next 30 years the APA population is expected to double to about 8 percent of the entire U.S. population. 
   Because of our history of labor immigration and our indigenous island population, Hawaii has had a head start in terms of political representation. Our APA communities have lived and worked in our islands since the mid-1800s, when the first Chinese laborers were imported to work in the sugarcane fields. Since 2000, three of our communities, the Okinawans, Koreans, and the Filipinos, have celebrated their centennial anniversaries of arrival to the United States and to Hawaii. 
   Hawaii produced the first Governors in the Nation of Japanese and Filipino ancestry, George Ariyoshi and Ben Cayetano; the first Native Hawaiian Governor, John Waihee; the first Asian American Senators, Hiram Fong and Daniel Inouye; the first Senator of Native Hawaiian ancestry, Daniel Akaka; the first Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Member of Congress, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole; and the first woman of color to serve in Congress, Patsy Takemoto Mink. And I am privileged to have served as Hawaii's Lieutenant Governor, becoming the first immigrant woman of Asian ancestry elected to statewide office and to be able to continue my service here as the first immigrant born in Japan serving in Congress. 
   Asian and Pacific Islander Members of Congress currently number only nine, including Eni Faleomavaega, our delegate from American Samoa. Also with me in the House are Congress Members Mike Honda and Doris Matsui, Oregon's David Wu, Virginia's Robert Scott, and Louisiana's Bobby Jindals. In the Senate we have Hawaii's two senior statesmen, Senators Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka. 
   Although the successes of our APA community over the years have been many, there is another side to our story that is not often discussed. While more Asians have college degrees than any other group in the country, we also have more people who have not graduated from high school compared with other ethnic groups. And while APAs have higher incomes, the U.S. Census counts 1.3 million Asian and Pacific Islanders living in poverty. There are still many wrongs to be righted. Some of them are decades old. 
   On March 1, 2007, I reintroduced the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act, H.R. 1287, a companion bill to S. 671, introduced by Senator Akaka. It will accelerate the immigration process for the sons and daughters of the Filipino veterans who fought with our American troops in World War II. I am also a cosponsor of the Filipino Veterans Equity Act, H.R. 760, to fulfill our promise of full veterans' benefits to those Filipino soldiers. 
   I know that questions have been raised about the cost of carrying out our obligation to the Filipino World War II veterans. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of enacting H.R. 760 will be $1 billion over a 10-year period. While this is a large sum, it is worth noting that the United States spends approximately $9 billion each month in the war in Iraq. 
   Challenges are also facing our Native Hawaiian population. The desire for self-determination by the indigenous people of my home State has been ignored for far too long by the Federal Government. Native Hawaiians remain the only indigenous group in our country still awaiting Federal recognition similar to the recognition Congress has granted to American Indians and Alaska Natives. H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, would set up a process for Native Hawaiians to organize a government entity. 
   By continuing to work together, I am hopeful that we will be able to meet these challenges as we have overcome others in the past. This month Washington, D.C. is hosting the Eighth Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders, PICL. The triennial PICL brings together the heads of government and senior officials from the Pacific, including Hawaii and the U.S. Pacific Territories. This is the first time that the group has met in Washington, D.C., and it is quite an opportunity for all of us here to find common ground on issues facing the Pacific region and our world. 
   In closing, I would again like to thank Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chairman Honda for allowing us this opportunity to reflect upon how far our APA community has come and yet, of course, remember how much further our community has to go. 
   Mahalo and aloha.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3996, the Temporary Tax Relief Act. 
   This bill will provide 23 million American middle-class families--including more than  90,000 families in Hawai`i--with tax relief totaling $50 billion. Without this legislation, these families will end up paying higher taxes under the alternative minimum tax, AMT. 
   Our middle-class families are struggling with higher health care costs, higher college costs, higher energy costs and higher housing costs and, basically, have not been helped by the 7 years of the Bush administration. Passing this bill will provide some welcome relief for our middle class. 
   This legislation is important in promoting fairness and justice in the tax system. Why should the richest of the rich avoid among us paying their fair share in taxes? Today with this bill we are saying that individuals who earn millions of dollars on Wall Street should pay their fair share in taxes so that hard-working middle-class Americans including teachers, police officers and firefighters, won't have to pay more than their fair share. 
   The bottom line is, without this bill, 23 million families will have a tax increase. With this bill, they will be spared from paying more under the AMT. 
   I am proud that the Democratic majority is supporting our middle-class families with this tax relief, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, which will help correct the unconscionable deficiencies exposed by the Washington Post at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. H.R. 1538 will improve the delivery of medical services to our wounded warriors who have done all that we have  asked of them. We now must honor our commitment to them to care for them when they are injured. 
   H.R. 1538 provides the basic services we would have expected for our wounded service personnel such as readily available case managers and advocates to assist incapacitated patients receive appropriate care, improved training of health care professionals and better monitoring of out-patients to ease the transition to the VA medical care system. The Walter Reed experience showed that we cannot rely on the current system to provide these basic services and care. 
   I am particularly pleased with the attention we will finally pay to the mental injuries, such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, that can be as crippling and incapacitating to our soldiers and veterans as physical injuries. 
   When I spoke on House Concurrent Resolution 63 opposing the President's surge, I mentioned CPT Lisa Blackman, a clinical psychologist, who cared for soldiers who suffered devastating emotional and mental harm inflicted while serving in Iraq and chronicled their troubling and heart-breaking torment in the book, Operation Homecoming. 
   These brave troops, who suffered severe physical as well as mental injuries, shamefully did not receive proper treatment after faithfully serving their country. H.R. 1538 properly recognizes the sacrifices our troops have made and provides the long overdue care and medical services our troops should properly expect and deserve from their government.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (EARLY EDUCATION WORKFORCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Early Education Workforce Act. 
   Our youngest children are our most precious resources. Research shows that a child surrounded by a safe, stimulating and caring environment will literally develop a stronger brain. That child enters kindergarten ready to succeed and is more likely to graduate from high school, hold a steady job, and avoid prison. 
   Early education not only benefits the child and the adult he or she will become; it also helps to ensure that America has the educated workforce we will need to address challenges as a Nation in the future. 
   I believe in research-based policy. If we don't know something is going to work, I hesitate to invest Federal dollars. Unfortunately, in many cases research is ambiguous at best, but high-quality early education is a great exception. 
   We know it works. The research continues to mount as experts from all fields, economists, neurologists, police officers and teachers, come to a consensus that it pays to invest early in our children. 
   Our States are making great progress in ensuring that every family has the option of sending their children to high-quality child care and preschool. However, in Hawaii and around the country, we are facing a major roadblock. We simply do not have a stable, adequate supply of qualified early education childhood professionals. If we  don't have the teachers, we don't have quality programs; and this is a major problem because quality is a key ingredient in early education. 
   A poorly designed program or an understaffed one is not going to produce the results we owe our kids, so we must address this problem. We must recruit and retain early educators. And how do we do that? We can start by passing this authorization bill to streamline professional development opportunities, open doors to early education degree programs, and begin to address the woefully inadequate compensation our preschool teachers and child care workers receive. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill on behalf of our children and to honor and encourage the people who dedicate their lives to preparing our youngest children for success.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (EXPANDING AND IMPROVING ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2284, which will amend the Small Business Act to improve the assistance provided by Small Business Development Centers to Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. 
   This bill will provide management, technical and research assistance to small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians and ensure them full access to existing business counseling and technical assistance available through the Small Business Development Center program. 
   Mr. Speaker, in a recent report by the distinguished Visiting Senior Fellow at the East-West Center and Emeritus Professor at the University Hawaii, Dr. Seiji Naya, the poverty rate for Native Hawaiians was 15 percent in 2005 while the state average was 9.8 percent. Native Hawaiians accounted for 27 percent of the total State population in poverty. The per capita income for Native Hawaiians was only 67 percent of the state average. In terms of per capita income, 32 percent of Native Hawaiians earned less than $10,000 in 2005 compared to only 18 percent for Non-Native Hawaiians. 
   Native Hawaiians are committed to changing these statistics through innovative educational and entrepreneurial programs. One of the most promising government programs that will enable them to do this is the Small Business Act, particularly Section 8(a) which has given Native Americans an opportunity to participate in the economy of this country by providing a fair chance to obtain federal contracts. As a result, hundreds of Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian entrepreneurs have been given the opportunity to demonstrate their business capabilities, while providing valuable services and products to the government and the private sector. 
   The Native Hawaiian organizations that have taken advantage of the 8(a) program have provided hundreds of new well-paying jobs for Native Hawaiians and Non-Native Hawaiians alike. Many Native Hawaiians have received training in new marketable skills. The profits from these enterprises have been plowed back into the Native Hawaiian communities to provide essential social, health and cultural benefits traditionally funded by government or not at all. 
   H.R. 2284 will provide the necessary assistance to help make sure that these worthy programs continue to grow and expand as much as possible by providing needed assistance and business expertise. I urge unanimous approval of this measure.  
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and encourage adoption of the resolution.

   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 406) celebrating the accomplishments of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, and recognizing the need to continue pursuing the goal of educational opportunities for women and girls.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (CELEBRATING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972 AND RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO CONTINUE PURSUING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of the resolution. 
   Thirty-five years ago, a college applicant could be denied admission simply because she was a woman. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 changed that. Led by the late Representative Patsy T. Mink, who had been denied admission to a medical school because of her sex, and Representative Edith Green, Congress established a principle we often take for granted today, the prohibition of sex discrimination in any federally funded educational program. 
   Title IX requires that ``No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal assistance.'' 
   These 35 words over the last 35 years have had a profound impact, and the results are astounding. More women than ever now attend college, which means more women than ever go on to advanced degrees. In 1972 only 9 percent of law degrees were earned by women. In the mid-1970s, when I attended law school, that number had improved. Women then had made up 15 percent of the graduating class. Today women earn almost half of all law degrees. The story is similar for medical degrees and Ph.D.s. 
   This new generation of highly educated women has made a substantial impact on society. Expectations have changed. Girls expect to grow up and contribute to our country and the world in any way they want, as doctors, lawyers, CEOs, school principals, consultants, just to name a few careers previously underrepresented by women. 
   Title IX also literally changed the face of athletic programs and colleges throughout the country. In fact, it is through athletics that title IX's impact has seeped into the public's consciousness. In athletics the change from 1972 to 2007 is astounding. Today, college athletic opportunities abound for young women. In the past three decades, title IX has led to a 450 percent increase in the rate of female participation in college sports and a more than 900 percent increase in participation at the high school level. And the recent surge in women's professional sports teams could not have happened without the dramatic increase in women playing college sports. 
   The thousands of women athletes in basketball, volleyball, soccer, and other sports, where we can see them, root for them, and even play on the team with them, have had a huge impact. Young girls today take it for granted that they can play a sport and aspire to athletic scholarships to college. My own niece started playing volleyball in junior high, continued in high school, and is aiming for a volleyball scholarship to attend college. Women in my generation did not even consider this a possibility. Title IX opened the door to higher education for women in many ways, including through athletic scholarships. 
   These successes, both academic and athletic, are worth celebrating, as are the women who came before us here on the House floor as leaders of the title IX movement. In 2002, after Representative Patsy T. Mink passed away, Chairman George Miller introduced a bill that named title IX the ``Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act.'' 
   This picture of Patsy hangs in my office. She was my friend and continues to be an inspiration to me. I am proud to represent the congressional district that Patsy represented for so long and so well. I know that if she were here today, she would remind us that our work is not done. 
   There are many challenges still to be addressed. Women continue to face substantial barriers, especially in high-wage fields such as science, technology, engineering, and math. Women own less than 30 percent of all U.S. firms. Women make up only a third of chief executive officers and less than 20 percent of engineers. Sexual harassment remains pervasive in schools and on college campuses. Women's and girls' sports teams still receive only 33 percent of recruiting dollars and 38 percent of athletic operating dollars. 
   Title IX is as necessary today as it was in 1972. 
   I am pleased that over 120 of my colleagues are cosponsors on this resolution, including Speaker Pelosi. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in celebrating title IX's successes and in recognizing the work still to be done in our march towards equal educational opportunities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (SMALL BUSINESS FAIRNESS IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1873, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act. 
   This bill creates a competitive bid process in the federal marketplace by restricting the ability of federal agencies to generate contracts that are too large for small businesses to compete effectively. Within the last 7 years, larger firms have benefited from the bundling of contracts while the total number of contracts received by small businesses has declined nationwide by 55 percent. H.R. 1873 increases the goal for small-business participation in federal contracts to at least 25 percent and requires the Small Business Administration to work with government agencies each fiscal year to establish and meet contracting goals that benefit small businesses. 
   Small businesses represent the overwhelming majority of businesses in Hawaii and play a vital role in economic growth for the state. H.R. 1873 will provide increased opportunities for Hawaii's small business community to compete for federal contracts that formerly were bundled and ended up going to larger out-of-state corporations. 
   Of course, this bill will help small businesses throughout the country compete for their fair share of federally funded projects. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4. Talk about an all-American concept, using our purchasing power to lower our costs, something big companies do all the time. This is why I am so pleased that one of the first pieces of legislation before us will help our seniors, our kapuna, as we say in Hawaii, lower their prescription drug costs. I am proud to say that in 2002 Hawaii enacted a law creating a similar program to allow negotiating for lower prescription drug costs. 
   Thousands of American families spent countless hours studying the Medicare part D process. My family was one of those. I sat with my 82-year-old mother as we worked our way through the confusing plans. Unfortunately, many of the families' efforts were not rewarded with the desired outcome, affordable prescription drugs. 
   America can do better for our seniors. By giving Medicare negotiating authority, we will take an important step in the right direction. Mahalo.

<DOCNO>Ms. HIRONO. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this resolution. The Iraq war has lasted longer than U.S. involvement in World War II and has cost the Nation hundreds of billions of dollars. We have lost over 3,000 of our finest men and women. Thousands more have been maimed and too many lives have been shattered. 
   As Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman TOM LANTOS said, this ``resolution will establish the first marker,'' the first step toward ending this nightmare. 
   The war in Iraq is the moral issue of the day, and like all great moral issues, there are heartfelt disagreements on both sides of the aisle. But every second, minute, and hour that passes, lives are being lost in Iraq and devastation continues with no end in sight. 
   We owe it to all the brave men and women who have already sacrificed so much, over 3,000 of them who have made the ultimate sacrifice, to steer our country on a course that will bring our troops home safely, take care of them and their families when they return and end this war. 
   Despite 4 years and deadly losses, according to Foreign Policy Magazine's recent survey of over 100 top national security experts, 86 percent say the world is more dangerous for the U.S., and, most troubling, 87 percent believe that the war in Iraq has had a negative impact on the war on terror. Other surveys have reached similar conclusions. 
   Yet the President now wants another $235 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan to add to the $427 billion for the war already approved. In this debate, we should listen in particular to the words of Americans who actually served in the war. I am honored to serve in this Congress with new Members JOE SESTAK of Pennsylvania, TIM WALZ of Minnesota, and PATRICK MURPHY, also of Pennsylvania, all veterans of the Iraq war. Their eloquent and strong voices of firsthand experience add immeasurably to this debate. 
   There are also people like Captain Lisa Blackman, a clinical psychologist who cared for soldiers in Qatar. As we become increasingly aware of the thousands of soldiers to emerge from firefights or attacks physically unscathed but with substantial emotional damage, Captain Blackman's experience in regularly tending to these soldiers provides further troubling insights into this devastating war. 
   In a message chronicled in the book Operation Homecoming, Dr. Blackburn wrote of how her patients responded to questions she asked them about their symptoms. She didn't get the expected reactions. They were unexpressive. But when she asked them, ``Have you ever been in combat?'' they became unglued and burst into tears. 
   As she described it, ``[W]hen I say burst, I mean splatter, tears running ..... sobbing for minutes on end, unable to speak, flat-out grief ..... '' She observed, ``No one ever feels like they are doing enough. If you are in a safe location, you feel guilty that your friends are getting shot at and you aren't. If you are getting shot at, you feel guilty if your buddy gets hit and you don't. If you get shot at but don't die, you feel guilty that you lived, and more guilty if you get to go home and your friends have to stay behind. I have not seen one person out here who didn't [check off] `increased guilt' on our intake form.'' 
   Indeed, every soldier who saw combat or the results of combat has likely suffered hidden but disturbing psychological harm to some extent. In spite of this, the Veterans Administration has been deprived of the critical funds necessary for the rehabilitation of these brave troops. The President, who continues to send more and more troops into the war on the one hand, has sought to reduce spending for medical services for these same troops on the other. His budget reduces spending for VA over the next 3 years. 
   Our troops are not the only ones suffering from the policies of this administration. All Americans who now oppose the war 2-1 are impacted by the massive cuts in or complete elimination of important social, health, education and environmental programs. 
   The cost of this war keeps going up, adding to our national debt. The interest on our debt alone is more than we devote to the education of our children, care of our veterans, and for the administration of justice combined. This body must go on record in united and solid opposition to the escalation of the war and in complete support of our soldiers and veterans. We must be resolute in our efforts to bring an end to this quagmire. 
   As Speaker Pelosi said, ``Friday's vote will signal whether the House has heard the American people. No more blank checks for President Bush on Iraq.'
