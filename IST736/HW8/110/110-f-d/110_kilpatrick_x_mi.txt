<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. First, let me congratulate you for a fine piece of legislation for the safety of our coal miners and others who need to make sure that our people working in the mines across this country are safe and that they have a working atmosphere that is safe for them and for their families. I congratulate you on that act. 
   In Michigan, in my district specifically, we have salt mines; no explosions, they aren't dangerous, and this act also covers our salt mines. I live under some of the salt mines. I live over the salt mines, I might add. They are a hundred years old. We've never had a collapse. They don't have the same requirements. They provide critical infrastructure needs that we have in our community, and have been very, very good business partners in our community for over 100 years. I worry that, with this legislation, they may be penalized and have to come under some of the limits, air limits, the larger fines, and the impact of those. So, I am asking, can you assure us that our salt mines in Michigan and my constituents, that this S-MINER will not be unfairly applied to them?

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ABOLITION OF THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I also want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee from the great State of California, for offering this resolution, House Resolution 272, commemorating the 200th anniversary of the end of the transcontinental slave trade for our country. Awesome that it is, we thank the President who signed that proclamation and that we began to work as one country with many ethnicities in our country. 
   Slavery is a cruel, unusual, inhumane treatment. Many of us just returned from overseas and were in the slave dungeons, and to see the inhumane treatment that many of our ancestors felt then and some vestiges of it today is awesome. But we are still here. We are still here running businesses, contributing to America. We are still here attending universities and in the Halls of this Congress of the United States of America. 
   We have much work to do, 200 years, and we hope thousands of years from now, because, you see, Africans brought the gifts of civilization, religion and science to the world, documented in anthropological studies, the first man. 
   So it's unfortunate but it's past, chattel slavery, but we have much work to do. We need better schools. We have got to be the best that we can be, first class, no exceptions, and we accept that responsibility. 
   To my young sisters and brothers across this Nation of all ethnic persuasions, rise up and be the very best that you can be. Never let anyone take the intellect, the intelligence or the mastery that God has given you to be the very best. Slavery is an abominable crime that we must never have again for any race of people, and in vestiges around the world, we see pockets of it. 
   But we rise today to support House Resolution 272, and to ask as Americans and people of the world that we build together a stronger America, where people have access to quality education that helps us to compete with the Chinas and the Taiwans and the Indias of the world, that we rise as a Nation of Americans and that we never again forget that all people are created by one God known by many names. 
   So I stand here as Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, one of 435 Members of this Congress, one of 43 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, to say to America, we are still the best country in the world. We still have a lot to achieve, and as we improve our schools, as we invest our  moneys, this $3 trillion budget that we have in this country, make sure that this Congress, this administration, the people rise up to have a fair immigration policy, to have fair schools that are funded, that are technologically sound to compete. 
   And we pledge to you as African Americans, we will produce young people and others who are rising up, owning their own businesses, doing what we need to do to do our part so that our children know that we are the best, we intend to be the best, and we want the doors of opportunity to stay open so that access will be there.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I am an avid football fan, an avid basketball fan, as well as hockey. Michigan and Detroit proper are always part of that game. 
   Championships. Unfortunately, two other great teams are in the Super Bowl, one of the most exciting sports activities happening this weekend in Miami, Florida as we have seen since the last Super Bowl was held in Detroit, Super Bowl XL. And I am honored to stand here, as some of my previous colleagues have said, to just pay respect to the National Football League. This is not my first association with them. We have run a coaches' clinic with the National Football League now for some time. They work with high school coaches to develop their skill so that their athletes and graduates will matriculate into the NFL as they go through their college years. 
   So I am honored to, first of all, thank the NFL for working with us and with the men across this country, that the young men become strong in their character, in their competitiveness and in their nature as they win Super Bowls. 
   As was said a little bit earlier, Chicago Bears, one of my favorite teams, and thank you, Coach Lovie Smith and the front office and all of you who have brought the Bears this far, to the players, to the wives, to the families for the sacrifices that you have made. We honor you, Chicago Bears; and we wish you the best, Coach Smith. 
   And also Coach Tony Dungy. I have followed his career for many years. The tragedy that he had last year, we all prayed for him in this Nation, and our prayers are with you as well. 
   Indianapolis, Chicago, Super Bowl XLI in Miami, just a few hours from now; and for the first time in the history of the sport, which started in 1869, we have not one, but two African American men, Lovie Smith being a protege of Tony Dungy, leading two fantastic teams in one of the greatest sports of mankind. 
   So I stand here to thank the NFL and to thank the coaches, the players, their families and the institution. It was the NFL who started, in 1987, the Minority Coaches Fellowship that allowed many offensive coaches and defensive coaches to become head coaches. Today, we have three head coaches who graduated from that program and actively working with their sports to bring them this far. 
   Over the years, and in 2002, the late Johnny Cochran and Cyrus Mehri put forth a program known today as the ``Rooney Program'' after Dan Rooney, who I had an opportunity to meet, the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers just last year in Detroit during the Super Bowl, which allows and asks that NFL teams consider achievement and expertise, that they might move forward and present championship coaches as has been had right now as we begin to celebrate Super Bowl XLI. 
   It is a great day that is coming in the next few days. Thank you to the league, as well as to our heroes, Coach Tony Dungy, Coach Lovie Smith. And I don't want to stand here and pick a winner; I like the game too much. Unfortunately, the Detroit Lions won't be there, but we like you, too, Detroit Lions. Just do better next year, okay? But for the rest of the world, and as this sport will be watched across the world, congratulations to the first two African American coaches to reach the Super Bowl. 
   May the best team win, and we will be hollering and screaming for you all Sunday evening. God bless

   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Speaker, Members of the House of Representatives, and people across this great Nation of ours, we have lost a jewel in Julia Carson. 
   I met the Congresswoman some 30 years ago, and she from the legislature in Indiana and I from the legislature in Michigan served 18 years together in those legislative bodies, and then came here together in 1997 to begin our tenure in the United States House of Representatives, she from Indiana, me from Michigan. 
   We both got assigned to the Financial Services Committee our first term,  she from Indiana and I from Michigan. And together, during this 10 years of journey, we have worked together in this House of Representatives. Courageous, bold, smart, intelligent, compassionate. All those things that you want in a public servant, JULIA CARSON was that. 
   To the people of Indianapolis, the State of Indiana, you have lost a jewel. And all that we ask in this body of 435 of the most powerful people in the world, as well as the 100 most powerful people in the Senate, is that you send us another JULIA CARSON: intelligent, bold, compassionate, a coordinator, one who speaks for the people that she represents. 
   Ms. Carson and I have had many battles and many struggles together. As was mentioned earlier by our chairperson of our Ethics Committee who is handling this Special Order tonight, she and I were in Indiana in her room with her 2 weeks ago. She looked beautiful. Her skin was radiant. Her heart was strong. And she said to us, thank you. Thank you to us as her sisters, and thank you to the people of Indiana who have been with her for over 30 years. 
   It is important that we come together tonight as members of the Congressional Black Caucus as well as members of the Indiana caucus, because we know she lives. We know she is in these walls and looking upon us now. What are you doing, girl? What are you all talking about? Thank you, JULIA. We love you, my sister. 
   And as we continue in our journey today, let's take a little bit of Congresswoman JULIA CARSON with us, dedicated, compassionate, take no prisoners, speak for the least of these. Thank you, my sister. And may you rest in peace.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Speaker, it is with significant reluctance and reticence that I will vote yes, on final passage, of the Economic Recovery Act. In the State of Michigan, which is facing record high unemployment, failure of businesses, and increasingly tighter credit markets, we must do something, right now, to ensure that the citizens, businesses, and organizations of the city of Detroit, the State of Michigan and the United States of America survive. This is not a perfect bill. I would have preferred that Congress explore other options, most of which did not involve a single dime from taxpayers, as was utilized during the savings and loan crisis, in a more deliberate manner. The provisions in the bill that ``recommend'' and ``suggest'' that the Secretary of the Treasury protect senior citizens, working families and others facing foreclosure; that ensure the utilization of qualified ethnic minority and women owned businesses, among others, need monitoring and oversight. The provisions are woefully inadequate and need improvement. 
   My yes vote, and it is perhaps one of the most difficult votes I have made in my 30 years as a public servant, is a reflection of the fact that if Congress does not do something soon, we possibly face an economic Armageddon the likes of which we have not seen since the Great Depression. Since I voted against the first version of this bill, the stock market has dropped a net of over 500 points and over one trillion dollars in total value. Our labor market has lost over 200,000 jobs in the month of September. Inflation has risen to new highs. My office has been besieged with phone calls from hundreds of small- and medium-sized businesses that cannot purchase goods or services or meet their payroll because they cannot access their lines of credit. Parents in Michigan are concerned that they cannot secure student loans for their children. This inevitably hurts all Americans. 
   The Constitution of the United States, to which each and every Member of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate, takes an oath to protect and defend at the beginning of each 2-year session of Congress. Article I, Section 9, clause seven, of the U.S. Constitution says ``no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by law.'' The Constitution also establishes three separate and distinct branches of government: the legislative, judicial and executive branches. As an Appropriator and for our U.S. House of Representatives, I oppose this bill's unprecedented and unparalleled secession of the power granted to us by the people and 
   the Constitution transferred to one appointed person from the executive branch of the Federal Government. 
   Households in Detroit, the State of Michigan, and America feel the rumblings of the financial earthquake beneath their feet. Unemployment has risen to all-time highs. Michigan is one of the leading States in unemployment, home foreclosures as well as business losses. The sudden, precipitous and dramatic slump in home values, retirement accounts and pensions is a prelude to worse things to come. I have fielded dozens of phone calls from businesses in my district from small convenience stores and automobile dealerships, to large corporations that are unable to access credit lines to make their payrolls. Without swift, immediate, and strong fiscal action and direction, America and Americans are in dire trouble. 
   Again, it is impossible for parents to get student loans for their children attending college. It is virtually impossible to get a mortgage with a rate that is reasonable. It is hard to find a decent, paying job. Again, it is tough for businesses to get loans to purchase those goods, items, and services that mean the difference between surviving and thriving, or even making their payroll. We have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in America this decade. This bill is not a cure-all, by any means. However, it is a start to stop the bleeding from which so many of our citizens and businesses suffer. 
   This bill does contain several provisions for which I fought and support. The bill will immediately increase the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's, FDIC, limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which will increase confidence citizens have in our banking system and prevent bank runs. The home foreclosure provision allows the Secretary, at his discretion, to lower the interest rate and, in some cases, the principal of home mortgages, ensuring that more citizens will stay in their homes and not on the streets this winter. This bill will provide property tax relief to up to 30 million homeowners--extending a new $1,000 property tax deduction for non-itemizing couples through the end of 2009. Finally, the bill provides that minority- and women-owned businesses, along with minority professionals, at the suggestion of the Secretary of the Treasury, will be included as contractors and analysts and will hopefully get a portion of the $700 billion that will be utilized by Secretary Paulson to stabilize our economy. 
   A key aspect of this bill that will become law is mental health parity for all Americans. Regrettably, too many private health insurers often provide less coverage for mental illnesses than for other medical conditions. Many insurers believe that mental health disorders are tough to diagnose, and that care for mental illness is ineffective, expensive and simply not worth the money. Thanks to this bill, all Americans will have access to mental health care. When mental health care is a part of our general health care, there is often little or no increase in cost to insurers. This is a most important aspect of the bill and is an aspect of which we all can be proud. 
   While these provisions are not as strong as I would like, my opposition to the overall bill, or to these provisions, is not strong enough to risk the enormous battering that continues to hammer our families and our economic system. The economic consequences of inaction are such that the citizens and businesses of our State and our Nation might not survive. That is a risk that I refuse to take. I will continue to fight for even stronger rules and regulations as we work in the wake of this bill, under a new Democratic President. 
   With the faith of God, with the support of the people of Michigan, and with the guidance and leadership of my ancestors, I will continue to work and fight to ensure that American families will be able to stay in their homes; that businesses will come back even stronger and employ, engage and ensure that more people have decent, fair paying jobs; and that Detroit and Michigan will rise to the heights that once  made it, and America, the world's manufacturing powerhouse. My support of this bill is a beginning step in that direction.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, as a Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Committee, I come to you, America, with a good bill. It is unfortunate the tactics over the last 24 hours has not allowed us to move forward to protect American citizens. 
   The President's budget came to us with a cut of $50 million for the first responders. Homeland security has to talk about hometown security. It is about a partnership with our Federal Government, our State government, and our local communities. So right off the bat a budget that cuts first responders $50 million is not a good budget. 
   We have before us a good budget, a budget that has been put together so that it takes care of hometowns better than presently. So that if, God forbid, another terrorist attack or natural disaster happens, we will be better able to meet that need. It is a budget that I believe deserves our support. And when passed by this Congress, and I predict it will be passed after the tactics have wilted and gone away, then we will have a good bill. 
   I am from the State of Michigan. In Michigan, we have the largest population of Arab Americans outside of the Middle East. They have been our friends for decades. They work in our communities and go to school with our children. They produce and pay taxes. It is unfortunate after 9/11 a population of Arabs from other countries brought havoc on our country, and they should be caught, they should be punished, and they should be dealt with. 
   I only mention the Arab population because I also in my district have the international waterway of the Detroit River that separates the city of Detroit from the country of Canada, Windsor,  Ontario, Canada specifically. Canada is one of the greatest friends that our country has. I am sad to report, as you know, many countries in this world are not so friendly to the U.S. because of many things that have happened by this administration over the last 8 or so years. 
   But the bill before us is a good one. It protects the northern border where I come from, where things come in and out of that border every day. Over a billion dollars of commerce passes the Ambassador Bridge every day. This bill provides more money to protect America, protect commerce, and protect the people who live in that region. 
   The local grants, the grants to first responders have been increased in this bill. We need to have that partnership. You can't talk about homeland security unless you talk adequately about hometown security. This bill does that. 
   We talk all of the time about how we move forward in this country. I believe it is how we work together in a bipartisan way; and over the last almost 24 hours now, in a bill that is almost $35 billion, we have been unable to move forward to protect Americans citizens. Your Federal budget is $2.9 trillion. There are three main entitlements that we pay for to help American citizens, 44 million Americans who are participants in our Medicare program, entitlements that are part of that budget, Medicaid, low-income, disabled children, over 40 million of them who are part of this budget. And our veterans, veterans who have protected this country since our inception. We have to treat them better, and this budget and the budgets that come after this do that. The President's budget did not. 
   This is the first of 12 budgets, and it is unfortunate that we are at a stalemate and can't protect American citizens. 
   Mr. Chairman, I stand here asking that the process go forward. You have made your point. We hope that we come back and have some kind of dialogue so we can better make the proposition that America deserves to be protected, as this Homeland Security bill does. 
   In the metropolitan area of Detroit, we have 5 million people who live in that area, 219 cities and townships. It hosts the largest multicultural population probably in this country. We need a good Homeland Security bill. We have one here before us. Let's let the process go on. I hope the leadership on both sides of the aisle can come together and talk about how we can move this process. We don't need to be stalemated. Yes, we can stay. We can stay for the next 2 months and never go home, but is that really what America needs us to do? 
   Recently, regarding the Congress, like the President, the American people have said they are disappointed with both of us. They want us to move forward. Let's pass this Homeland Security bill and get on with the business of building the Nation for God's children.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I have the highest respect for my chairman, BARNEY FRANK, and your genius, thank you very much, as well as Speaker Pelosi for her leadership. 
   A week ago today we were sent a three-page bill, $700 billion, send it back to us and never ask us any questions. I am proud that the chairman and Speaker and leadership on both sides of the aisle have come to some agreement. 
   Contrary to popular belief, our financial crisis was not due to just people who couldn't afford the loans. It was Wall Street's problem, the people who managed this process over the years, with a lack of regulation from this administration. It was also predatory lending, lending from predators, banks in many instances, the very people we are going to give the money to, who took the loans, who made the loans, and didn't require the proper oversight. It is not the little people. 
   It is the loss of jobs. In America we have lost over 600,000 jobs over the last 8 years, good jobs, manufacturing jobs. The American Dream has slipped away, speculation from Wall Street, from developers. All of us have been affected by this crisis, and all of us believe there ought to be some end to this. 
   We must work as elected representatives of the people. Over 400 economists, as has been said earlier and we have the documentation, are opposed to the process and the way we are going about it. Three of them are Nobel Laureates who have come to this conclusion, and economists, professionals extraordinaire. 
   Unfortunately, there is no judicial review in this to protect the average citizen. We talk about the mortgages, but this helps the banks in their book of mortgages. It does not help the little person who needs it. There is no judicial review to come to her aid or his aid. 
   It is unfortunate that we are here today talking about $700 billion, and, as an appropriator, $1 trillion is probably what it will be and more. We do not yet know how much it will be. 
   We need to take our time on this. We have been talking about it now 7 days nonstop. We can do better. There is a better process. I hope that we can slow down this train. 
   We will probably vote in a few hours, less than an hour now. The Senate is not going to vote until later this week. We can do better, the American people deserve more, and I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Speaker, as we prepare to vote on one of the most important pieces of legislation in history, I rise in opposition to the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP. While I have nothing but respect, admiration and trust in Speaker Pelosi and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, this legislation, which was forced upon Congress by the Bush administration, provides no judicial review of individual home mortgages for my senior citizens, single parents and working families; is opposed by over 400 of our Nation's top economists and three Nobel laureates; does not adequately protect the American taxpayer; was not considered under regular order and does nothing to stimulate our stagnant economy. 
   The state of Michigan is one of the states hardest hit by home foreclosures, unemployment, and the loss of jobs. For poor people and low income people and many ethnic minorities, the Court is the option of last resort when you are on the brink of losing your home. As Chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, I sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi requesting that such language--that would allow a citizen under the threat of foreclosure--to go to court to have a non-partisan, objective judge review their financial circumstances and, if warranted, lower the principal of the mortgage. Under this legislation, judges do not have that option. Instead, this discretion is left up to the Secretary of the Treasury. While we are busy bailing out the financial markets, this bill does little for the folks on Main Street. This bill does not bailout my senior citizens who are behind on their mortgage. This bill does not help my working single parents who are facing foreclosure. This bill does not work for the majority of the people in the State of Michigan, who are staring down the barrel of losing their largest asset--their home. 
   Over 400 of our Nation's top economists, including three Nobel laureates in economics,  oppose this bill. The Washington Post reported on September 26, 2008, that over 200 economists ``have signed a petition organized by a University of Chicago professor objecting to the plan on the grounds that it could create perverse incentives, that it is too vague and that its long-run effects are unclear.'' While their reasons are many, Dean Baker of the Center on Economic and Policy Research, one of these economists, says that ``suppose the Paulson plan goes through. It is virtually certain that the economy will weaken further and the number of foreclosures and people without jobs will continue to rise. This is the fallout from a collapsing housing bubble ..... this bailout will make further stimulus much more difficult to sell.'' 
   The Treasury Department admits that it has absolutely no factual basis for asking for $700 billion. We have asked the hard, tough and important questions of the Secretary and this administration, only to come up short. 
   This bill was not considered under Congress's regular order of conducting informational hearings from all sides, a mark-up of the bill in subcommittee bill in subcommittee 
   and full committee, and finally, a floor vote. When we do not exercise the rules of this institution, we debase the rules, the regulations, and the standards we have to conduct the people's business. This deliberate process allows everyone to support, oppose, and amend legislation--an opportunity we did not have during this process. I have recommended that Congress establish a select committee, made up of the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Committees with jurisdiction, including the administration, to arrive at legislation that addresses the problem of illiquidity of credit markets, insolvency of businesses, and the hardship of foreclosures. This Committee would meet for three weeks, or a time certain, and would guarantee that as representatives of the American people, we have done our job. 
   This bill does not adequately protect the American taxpayer. As an Appropriator, I am designated as the protector of the people's purse. While the administration does not have $35 billion to spend on the health care for the children of families of working women and men; while the administration does not have the money to provide for Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help my seniors, low- and middle-income families pay for their lights, gas and oil heat; while the administration does not have the money to extend unemployment benefits; while the administration does not have the money for a summer jobs program for teens, adults and senior citizens; while the administration has $10 billion per month and one trillion dollars to spend on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; when the Administration argues over $22 billion--less than 1 percent of the overall budget--on virtually every issue before the Appropriations--Committee, we do not have the money. However, we have $700 billion--and believe me, it will soon be $1 trillion--to bail out Wall Street. Something is wrong with this analysis, America. 
   We are being asked, once again, to ``trust'' the administration, when time is supposedly running out, and if nothing is done, the worse will befall all of us. Regrettably, as a Congress, we have been in this position before. Under duress, we were supposed to trust the administration that these tax cuts were going to save America. Under duress, we were told that if a bill that authorized wiretapping of law abiding, American taxpayers was needed as terrorists were at our door steps. Under duress, we were told that America was imminently under threat from Iraq. Now, again, at the last minute, we are being asked, under duress, to trust one trillion dollars to a Treasury Secretary who is out of office in less than three months? 
   Must we do something? Of course. There is a better way. We must ensure on regular order for this bill. We can use fewer American tax payer dollars--who did not get us into this problem in the first place--to ensure the stability of our financial markets. There are clearly better and safer alternatives. I am not an economics expert, but I do know that as the steward of the people's purse, I have a higher standard to which I am held accountable.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, at this time we are very happy to present our Congressional Black Caucus budget for 2008. Our budget is balanced. It takes us to surplus in 5 years. It reduces the deficit, and it invests in America's families. 
   We are happy today to present to you a budget. The full budget is $2.9 trillion. That would be $3 trillion if it were rounded off. 
   The Ways and Means Committee that handles the entitlements will handle Medicare for over 44 million seniors' health insurance; Medicaid for over 45 million disabled, low-income seniors' programs; and our veterans programs. Our Appropriations Committee will handle $930 billion of those dollars in our 2008 discussions on this budget. 
   I am happy to present to you a balanced budget from the Congressional Black Caucus that takes care of our veterans, that invests in the war, that makes sure that our seniors are taken care of, and that our children and their SCHIP program for children's health care is fully funded so that all children in America can have an adequate health care system. 
   Madam Chairman, the Congressional Black Caucus budget is a good budget. I would urge our colleagues to accept it, to vote for the CBC budget.  
   Madam Chairman, I am proud that Congress is considering an amendment that I, along with my colleague Robert Scott from Virginia, am introducing that will change course, confront crises, and continue the legacy of not only the Congressional Black Caucus, but of America. This budget changes our fiscal course from a sea of debt, deficit and despair to financial stability and responsibility. The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment confronts the crises faced by our senior citizens who will not have enough money to heat their homes in the winter or cool them in the summer; it will confront the crises faced by our veterans and those wounded warriors who do not have adequate health care, mental health treatment, or physical therapy; the Kilpatrick/Scott amendment to the budget continues the legacy of this Nation's historic mission of caring for the least of our sisters and brothers. 
   As the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and as an appropriator, I know that the American people demanded a change last year. Rounding out for even numbers, we have a $2.9 trillion dollar budget. Six hundred billion of that spending will go to defense. A little more than 300 hundred billion will go to the people. We can do better. The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment will do just that. It ensures that our Nation is safe; it takes care of all Americans; and it gets America on the path to fiscal stability. 
   The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment is fiscally responsible. 
   The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment eliminates tax cuts for the top two income brackets. Studies show that 99.7 percent of the benefits of the tax cuts go to those households with incomes over $200,000, 86 percent go to households with incomes above $500,000, and 65 percent go to households with incomes above $1 million. The CBC budget would rescind those tax cuts and restore the more fiscally responsible tax rates that were in place in 2001 and throughout much of the economic boom of the 1990s. This results in $90.6 billion over 5 years for the American people. 
   The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment eliminates the capital gains and dividend tax cuts. Again, 70 percent of the benefits of these tax cuts go to households with more than $200,000 in income. This results in $98 billion over 5 years for the American people. The bill applies more than $6 billion to reduce the deficit created by these unfair tax cuts and the war. 
   The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment, for fiscal years 2008-2012, has a total deficit that is $339 billion less than the President's budget and $107 billion less than that of the House Committee on the Budget. These are savings that not only reduce our debt to foreign nations, but allows more money to be used to the needs of the American people. 
   The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment protects Social Security. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus strongly opposes private accounts. Privatizing what is arguably the most successful social insurance program in the world would only divert resources from the Social Security Trust Fund and generate trillions of dollars in new debt over the next few decades. Furthermore, the Congressional Black Caucus is strongly opposed to the use of the Social Security surplus to finance the deficit in the rest of the budget. The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment protects Social Security by opposing the use of the Social Security surplus to finance the deficit in the budget. 
   The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment fights for our warriors at home and abroad. 
   The amendment also reallocates $300 million in savings in the Department of Defense, using recommendations from the General Accounting Office. These savings will be used to implement the GAO's recommendations for: health facility renovation upgrades at bases; mental health services for post traumatic stress disease; public school Initiatives, aka the Troops to Teachers initiative; cancer research; tuberous sclerosis research; and Parkinson's disease research. 
   The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment will take care of our veterans, by fully funding the construction of new and improved VA hospitals, providing more funds for more VA workers, and the local clinic initiative for non-urban areas. It is simply shameful that those who have volunteered or were drafted to fight for this country cannot have the best in health care our country has to offer. 
   The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment improves the international stature of America. 
   Our reputation as an international savior has taken a significant hit over the past 6 years. The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment addresses our stature and improves our relationship with our global partners. As you know, the Congressional Black Caucus has focused on issues of interest on the continent of Africa. The fact  that we have not addressed the issues of Darfur, global AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria is a shame on America and the Congress. The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment addresses these challenges with more than $3 billion going to the Darfur Initiative; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Child Survival and Health, and International Family Planning Programs.      
   +$50,000,000    
   +1,000,000,000    
   +50,000,000    
   +1,040,000,000    
   +80,000,000    
   +600,000,000    
   +100,000,000    
   +50,000,000  
   The Kilpatrick/Scott amendment helps all Americans. 
   Social needs have taken a back seat to tax cuts and this war for far too long. Among other things, the CBC amendment will fully fund the Community Development Block Grant at $1.5 billion; provide $1 billion for the construction of new and technologically advanced elementary and secondary schools; fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act, the first time in that program's history that it will be fully funded. This full level of funding will include the complete funding of the science and math program, a program that trains teachers in math and science, and emphasizes math and science in our Nation's elementary, secondary and high schools. The amendment fully funds the Pell grant program, the SCHIP health care program for poor and low income children, the Women's, Infants and Children's--WIC--program, Head Start and the Food Stamp program. 
   For a balanced budget; for funds that will address the needs of our Nation's wounded warriors from wars in the past, present and future; for fiscal responsibility and accountability; for the protection of our Nation's children, safety and seniors, a responsible vote is a vote for the Kilpatrick/Scott amendment on the budget.  
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Chairman, I would like to yield myself 2 minutes. 
   This bill does not raise taxes. This bill does rescind the permanent tax cut  for the 1 percent of the wealthiest Americans and then reinvests that money into American families. 
   This bill balances the budget. We reduce the deficit that the other party got us in over the last decade, the highest budget deficit in the history of our country. 
   This budget takes care of our troops, protects Americans. This budget is fiscally responsible. We make sure, in our budget, that we invest in health care for all the children of America. We also take care of those seniors who find themselves in need of adequate health care. Yes, and we fund and make sure Medicare, the health insurance for 44 million seniors, and Medicaid, programs for low-income and disabled Americans, are taken care of. 
   Have we spent too much? No, we haven't. Is the budget in balance? Yes, it is. We want to make sure in our Congressional Black Caucus budget that we are leaders. We come here as 43 Members of Congress representing 26 States and 40 million Americans. Ten of our Members have districts that are not majority African Americans. We represent Asian Americans, Latino Americans, European Americans, Indian Americans. 
   We are the conscience of the Congress. We bring to you a budget that, we believe, is balanced. It is the best budget, and we ask for your support.

   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker and Members, I stand here today as chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus to say thank you to America, thank you to the president and CEO of NBC News network, as well as the president and CEO of CBS News network. I had an opportunity to meet with them last week. They did the right thing. 
   Our country is in peril. We need to bring our country together. Thank you very much for the senior staffs of both of those organizations and for the people of America for standing up and speaking out. 
   We are in trying times at the moment, and there is much we must do to bring our country together and make our families stronger. Kudos, most gracious love, to the women of the Rutgers' basketball team, 10 young women, all honor students, child prodigies, dedicated and working to make life better for themselves and for America, to get to Rutgers, to stay there, to achieve academic excellence, and, yes, then to excel. Also, kudos to the University of Tennessee women's basketball team, the NCAA women's basketball champions. 
   This is the 35th anniversary year of title IX. Title IX is the legislation 35 years ago that was enacted that would make an equal playing field for women in sports and athletics. We will celebrate title IX and have been all year. I have spoken to President McCormick, and the Congressional Black Caucus, the Speaker of the House and others will be welcoming the Rutgers and Tennessee teams as well as the president and coaching staffs to our city of Washington, DC, very soon. We will hold a 2-hour summit and hear from the National Organization For Women, a psychiatrist from Rutgers University, some renowned women and others who speak to the values of America. 
   Today we had the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in our Appropriations Committee. He came for his budget today. We talked about how do we make America better; how do we shut down some of the smut and other things that are negatively impacting our children. We are a better Nation than that. He has agreed to work with us and together, through this Congress, the FCC will be stronger. We must strengthen some of the things that they must do. 
   The 1934 law is archaic. The courts have interpreted that law very narrowly. This is far bigger than a person. This is about the strength and success of our families, of our children. 
   On behalf of the men and women who serve in this United States Congress, and specifically the men and women of the Congressional Black Caucus, let us rise up and build a better Nation for our sisters, our girls, our women, and, yes, our men and boys.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. I first want to commend Speaker Pelosi for her leadership and tenacity, for doing the right thing for America; to Chairman Obey and Chairman Murtha for working together to bring this bill to the floor. 
   In my 30 years of public service, this is probably one of the most difficult votes I will make, but it is the right vote. I will vote ``yes'' to support the supplemental. 
   This war has lasted longer than World War I and World War II. More than 3,200 young men and women have lost their lives, over 30,000 amputees and the like, mental health services that we don't yet know we will have to endure from this ill-advised war. 
   It is a good supplemental. Is it perfect? No. But it does begin to change course, to change course that this Nation needs that we begin to invest in America, to take care of our children, to bring our soldiers home. I wish we could bring them home tomorrow, but there is a process, and this bill begins that process by using the President's own benchmarks that the Iraqis would rise up and take care of their own country, their own people. This is a civil war; we ought not be in it. 
   I ask you to vote ``yes'' on the supplemental.  
   The Americans who live in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan want our women and men in our military home now. As a Member of Congress who has opposed the war from the very beginning, so do I. In my three decades of public service to the citizens of Michigan and all Americans, this is one of the most difficult votes I have had to cast as an elected official. 
   As you know, I voted against the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. I did not support the pretext nor the context for our involvement in Iraq. I felt then, and I feel now, that we did not exhaust all of our diplomatic,  political or military options. Regrettably, I have been proven correct. 
   In January of this year, we will have been involved in Iraq longer than we have been involved in World War I and longer than we were involved in World War II. We will have lost over 3,200 lives, over 25,000 women and men wounded and maimed, and over $500 billion dollars in a conflict that, as of today, is only getting worse and worse day by day. I want our women and men fighting in Iraq home now. 
   Three decades of public service teaches you that Americans do not do revolutions, Americans do evolutions. As steadfast, as earnest, as honest as I, and the vast majority of my constituents, want our troops home immediately, I support this bill and will support this bill enthusiastically. Why? This bill does three things--first, it finally establishes and demands that the President of the United States be held accountable for our troops in Iraq and how our tax dollars are being spent. Second, it has a deadline for our troops to come home. Third, it provides some emergency support for some of the programs decimated by the permanent tax cuts for the rich and by the fiscal demands of the war. 
   As my colleagues who have been to battle in Iraq and who have borne the burden of war and its concomitant issues, I am not merely anti-war; I am anti-failure. This bill will get our women and men home, and it will require that Iraqis bear the responsibility for ultimately managing the country that is theirs. 
   Under this bill, the President will have to send troops to war under the same rules, regulations and guidelines established by the Pentagon. Rules that say that troops need adequate rest between tours of duty. Rules that say that no soldier or Marine will be sent without adequate training, equipment, or supplies. Rules that allow infantry commanders to have the final say in the welfare and safety of their troops. If the President chooses not to follow these long-established rules, he is to let Congress and the American people know why not following these rules is a national emergency. 
   Under this bill, accountability is demanded from contractors who are in Iraq. It cuts all of their contracts by ten percent, to allow Congress to see if taxpayer dollars are being spent on what these contractors say they are. For four years, there has been no accountability, no oversight, no responsibility in how the $500 billion that has been spent in Iraq--currently, we are spending an estimated eight billion dollars per month in Iraq--and finally, this bill establishes that accountability. As a Member of the august Appropriations Committee, this is not only my privilege, but my responsibility, to all of the taxpayers of America. 
   Under this bill, by July 1, 2007, the President must certify that Iraq is making meaningful and substantial progress in meeting political and military benchmarks, including a militia disarmament program and a plan that equitably shares oil revenues among all Iraqis. If the President does not provide this certification then U.S. forces must begin an immediate redeployment to be completed no later than December 2007, or 180 days. 
   This bill does not ignore the fact that it is everyday Americans who have also paid a price for this war. Senior citizens who could go without heat in the winter or air conditioning in the summer. Children who could go without health care. And it has been 191 days since Katrina landed, and over half of the houses, hospitals and businesses have still not been rebuilt. As much of an emergency as Iraq is, these are equally important emergencies. 
   I requested that the Committee add $1 billion in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP); along with the Chairman, I was able to get $400 million. I requested that the Committee add $1 billion in funding to rebuild houses in the Gulf region; the Committee was able to commit $2.9 billion to Katrina relief. The bill also ensures the long term health of our warriors at home and abroad. It adds funds for those veterans who are disabled by Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; it provides for the hiring of more staffers at the Veterans Administration to speed up medical claims; it ensures that those veterans who have severe brain injuries have the therapy and care that they need; and it makes sure that Walter Reed Hospital remains open and that Walter Reed, as well as other VA hospitals, receives the funds they need to take care of our warriors. 
   Thirty years as a legislator will teach you that no bill is perfect, and that compromise and negotiation is the hallmark of this country. If this bill fails, the President is further empowered to do what he has been doing for the past 4 years--a process of failed promises, fratricide among warring factions in Iraq, and fomenting doom. Compromising your tactics is not compromising your principles. My principle is to bring all of our troops home as soon as possible; end this war; and rebuild America's reputation as the standard for human rights, freedom and dignity. 
   It seems ludicrous to this Member of Congress that our President has threatened to veto legislation that contains his own benchmarks for success in Iraq, ensures our troops have the training they need, and supports our veterans. For months, conservative and Republican commentators and elected officials asked ``what is the Democratic plan for Iraq''? Ladies and gentlemen, this is that plan. While Democrats have offered a plan to support our troops and change direction in Iraq, Republicans are preparing to oppose legislation that funds protection and equipment for our troops and supports our veterans. Instead of working to change direction in Iraq, opponents to this bill are turning their backs on our troops and our veterans, and backing the stay-the-course strategy in Iraq. 
   I am a warrior for peace. I am a supporter of our women and men who serve our military throughout the world. I will vote for this bill because it provides emergency help to our Nation's senior citizens and children, who have borne a different burden from this war; it brings our troops home; and it demands, for the first time in four years, accountability, credibility, and responsibility from our President.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, as well as the gentleman from Iowa for yielding me my time. 
   This is about the law. This is about the law. This is about Michigan's law. In 1993, after 20 years of trying, the  Michigan legislature--I, a member at that time, and others--passed a law that, after many referendums in the City of Detroit, a referenda would be held throughout the State of Michigan that said who could have casinos. We were allowed that after 20 years of working on that. 
   In 1994, back to the people of the State of Michigan, there was a referenda that said if you are to have a casino you must come back to the people. This law circumvents that. There are 18 Native American tribes in Michigan. All but two who are getting this casino deal do not support this legislation, mainly because, in the Michigan compact, Native Americans share in the net profits. This bill would not allow the other 16 tribes to share in the profits, thereby putting their own reservation casinos in jeopardy, while at the same time rewarding 2 and not the other 16 sharing the profits. 
   There's a way to fix this. Go back to the ballot box, which is what the Michigan law says. Let the people of Michigan speak on this. Casinos are regulated by States, as IGRA gives them that authority, not by the Federal Government. 
   Much has already been said, and I will tell you who opposes this: The Bureau of Indian Affairs, the U.S. Department of Interior, the National Indian Gaming Association, UNITE HERE, AFSCME, NAACP. We can fix this, but go through what everybody else went through to get gaming and casinos in their community. 
   The Native Americans asked for it. Over 60 tribes across this country oppose this legislation. Why must we circumvent them and come here? It's not about competition, as Americans love competition, and we support that. Go through the process. Respect the law. 
   Native American tribes deserve better, and we want to see that happen.  
   Mr. Speaker, thank you for your kind consideration and care when, in December of 2007, you agreed with me that both of these bills should not be brought to the floor without being considered under regular order. The House Natural Resources Committee and the House Judiciary Committee both had hearings on these bills, and while the Natural Resources Committee reported the bill favorably by a 21 to 5 vote, the House Judiciary Committee reported the bill unfavorably by a zero to 29 vote. Since that vote, both of these bills are opposed by 16 of the 18 tribes that are in the State of Michigan; and opposed by over 60 Native American tribes across the country; by both Michigan's AFSCME and the NAACP; and finally, the U.S. Department of Interior not only opposes the bills but questions the validity of the land claim that they purport to forward. 
   In essence, both of these bills will allow two Native American tribes located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula to build casinos 350 miles from their reservations and near the city of Detroit and in Port Huron, Michigan. I vehemently oppose both of these bills. 
   My reasons for opposing these bills, which will allow land to be taken into trust for gambling purposes for the settlement of proposed land claims, are actually very simple. These bills set a dangerous precedent for Congress; they contravene Michigan State law; they are very controversial among the tribes in Michigan and throughout Indian Country; it is not clear that these land swaps are valid; and finally, Congress has not had a comprehensive review of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, in nearly two decades. Furthermore, it is important to note that these land claims have never been validated by the U.S. Government or any court of law. In fact, the courts have ruled against the Bay Mills Tribe on their claim on two separate occasions. 
   The people of Michigan have spoken at the ballot box about gaming expansion in our State. In 1994, they voted to allow three casinos in the city of Detroit. In 2004, the people voted to limit any more expansion of gaming unless there was a statewide referendum. In addition, the Michigan Gaming Compact specifically prohibits off-reservation gaming unless all of the tribes in Michigan agree to a revenue-sharing plan. These two bills are simply an attempt to circumvent both the will of the people of Michigan and the compact the Michigan State Legislature has made with the tribes in Michigan. 
   Instead, these bills would have Congress mandate not one, but two off-site reservation casinos located over 350 miles away from the reservations of these tribes. Moreover, the disputed land is located near the two tribes reservations in the Upper Peninsula but yet the land they want for a ``settlement'' is located 350 miles away near the city of Detroit. If these bills were to become law, what would prevent other tribes from seeking a land claim anywhere in the United States for off-site reservation gaming? Is this the real intent of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act? 
   It is indeed ironic that in the 109th Congress, the House Resources Committee, on a bipartisan basis, passed legislation by an overwhelming margin to restrict off-site reservation gaming. Yet today, it now seeks to expand Native American gaming in an unprecedented manner. 
   Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988 that allows tribes to conduct gaming on lands acquired before October 17, 1988. In 1993, former Governor John Engler negotiated a gaming compact with the seven federally-recognized tribes in Michigan, including the Bay Mills and Sault Ste. Marie Tribes. 
   In order to prevent a proliferation of Indian gaming across the State, a provision was added to the compact that required any revenue generated by off-reservation gaining be shared among the tribes who signed the compact. This provision has worked well for over 15 years. The two bills before Congress today would simply nullify this critically important provision of the Michigan Gaming Compact. Both of these bills would allow the tribes to; (1) settle a land claim that has never been validated and is located near their reservations in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and (2) acquire lands 350 miles from their reservation to build casinos. Furthermore, these bills actually include gaming compacts in them that were never approved by the Michigan State Legislature who has approved every other gaming compact. It is important to note that Congress has never passed a gaming compact in the history of Indian gaming. IGRA specifically grants that authority to the States. 
   In 2004, the voters of Michigan spoke again in a statewide referendum and overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative that would restrict the expansion of gaming in the State of Michigan. This referendum would require local and statewide approvals for any private expansion of gaming in Michigan. 
   The people and the elected officials of Michigan already have a solution to this matter--the ballot box. There is nothing in the referendum that would prevent the two tribes and their non-Indian developers from initiating a statewide referendum to get casinos in Port Huron and in Romulus. In fact, both of those cities have already passed local referendums. But the tribes and their developers decided to short-circuit the vote of the Michigan people and come to Congress to get a casino on a proposed land claim that is located near the tribes' reservation lands in the upper peninsula of Michigan. 
   I am aware that the Governor of Michigan has sent the House Natural Resources Committee a letter supporting these bills. You should know that there is no legal basis for the State to support these agreements because, in fact, the State has already won this case in the Michigan Court of Claims and the Bay Mills Tribe appealed it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court subsequently declined to hear the case. 
   The Governor ignored the fact that the city of Detroit will be the main victim of the State's largess in these casino deals. The city of Detroit will lose hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of the competition of these new casinos and that will cause irreparable harm. Harm to whom? Harm to the current investors of the casinos in the city of Detroit, who have invested more than $1.5 billion in the construction of the three casinos in the city of Detroit. Harm to the thousands of jobs that have been created and the tax revenue that those jobs generate for the city of Detroit and the State of Michigan. Ultimately, this will harm the State. When compared to their private counterparts, Native American gaming sites, because they are sovereign nations and must share their revenue with other Native American tribes, do not bring in the tax revenue of private investors. 
   In the end, these two tribes are seeking to do an end-run around two statewide referendums and the Michigan Gaming Compact of 1993. Rarely have voters in any State in this country spoken so clearly on gaming issues. In light of all of this, it would be a travesty for Congress to mandate two off-site reservation gaming casinos that would have such a negative impact on the people in Michigan. 
   But, for the moment, let us ignore the impact that these bills will have on the city of Detroit. Let us ignore the precedent that these bills will set, allowing any Native American tribe to claim any piece of land hundreds of miles away, as their native tribal land. Let us ignore the fact that IGRA has not been reauthorized in more than two decades, and clearly needs to be revisited and revised by Congress. What I cannot ignore is the strong possibility that the very integrity of Congress is in jeopardy. 
   On October 10, 2002, in testimony before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the chairman of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe, Bernard Boushor, said ``the Bay Mills case was a scam from the start.'' In testimony and information provided to the House Natural Resources Committee in February of this year, Saginaw Chippewa Chief Fred Cantu cited  Chairman Boushor's testimony, stating that the original lawsuit on the land claim was a collusive lawsuit. 
   The proponents of this legislation have repeatedly stated that these bills are simply to address the aggrieved landowners in Charlotte Beach. But according to the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe ``the Charlotte Beach claim did not originate with Bay Mills. It was a product of a Detroit area attorney who developed it specifically as a vehicle to obtain an IGRA casino ..... the goal was never to recover the Charlotte Beach lands.'' 
   How was this originally a collusive lawsuit? The Bay Mills Tribe sued Mr. James Hadley on October 18, 1996 who entered into a settlement in which he gave land to the Bay Mills Tribe 300 miles from their reservation to build a casino in Auburn Hills, Michigan. That plan was rejected by the Department of the Interior. The point is that Mr. Hadley was not an aggrieved landowner, he was an active participant in what the Sault Tribe described as ``a collusive lawsuit'' and ``a scam.'' 
   I strongly encourage all of you to read the testimony of the former Sault Ste. Marie chairman before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the testimony of the Saginaw Chippewa Chief Fred Cantu, and review the documents Chief Cantu provided to the Committee, which was provided to the House Natural Resources Committee at its hearing in February and to the House Judiciary Committee at its subsequent hearing. 
   There is a way to save the integrity of Congress. The Saginaw Chippewa Tribe has requested that the U.S. Department of the Interior investigate the land claims made by these tribes, and determine whether they are valid claims, worthy of Federal resolution. It is my understanding that the Department of the Interior is reviewing the validity of these land claims. I would urge the Committee to wait until this investigation is complete until it rushes into passing legislation that mandates off-reservation gaming. 
   Congress should not be in the business of handing out off-site reservation gaming casinos. It is my hope that the wisdom of Congress is the rejection of both of these bills for the following reasons: 
   These bills set a dangerous precedent for Congress by approving a compact which is a State, not a Federal, responsibility; 
   They contravene Michigan State law; 
   They are controversial among the Native American tribes in Michigan; indeed, nine out of Michigan's 12 tribes oppose these bills; 
   The city of Detroit would lose thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in the investments made by the three casinos currently operating in Detroit; 
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs has already rejected a similar application for gaming in Romulus, Michigan; 
   These bills would involve the removal of valuable land from the tax rolls of the State of Michigan, resulting in the potential loss of even more revenue; 
   It is uncertain that these land swaps are legitimate, possibly jeopardizing the integrity of the U.S. Congress; 
   The Committee should allow the Department of the Interior the time to do their due diligence to determine if these are valid land claims; and 
   Congress needs to revisit, revise and reauthorize the IGRA, which has not had a comprehensive review in nearly two decades. 
   Let me state for the record, once again, that I am not opposed to more gaming in the State of Michigan. I am also not opposed to off-site reservation gaming. I have been opposed, am currently opposed, and will always be opposed to any measure, any bill, any regulation that says that the will of the people does not matter. The will of the people is tantamount. It is my hope that the wisdom of Congress prevails and that the voice of the people matters in rejecting these bills on the floor today.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, my love of the Constitution of the United States of America, and my hatred of unfair precedents, equals my vote against the Minority Leader's resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, I was one of the 26 Members of Congress who voted against the privileged resolution offered by Minority Leader JOHN BOEHNER. My opposition to this resolution has little to do with the serious allegations against Congressman WILLIAM JEFFERSON, and everything to do with the oath that each and every Member of Congress took in this very chamber--to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. In America, we have a Constitutional principle of innocence before being proven guilty and that no citizen shall be ``deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.'' The resolution by the Minority Leader will not allow our system of justice to work. If the system of justice is not allowed to work for a Member of Congress, for whom should the system work? 
   I also oppose this measure because of the horrible precedent it establishes. Instead of illustrating and penalizing those instances of law breaking and working toward establishing higher standards for all Members of Congress, the Minority Leader's resolution puts the behavior of one individual under a microscope. Instead of seeking an opportunity to improve the behavior of all Members of Congress, this resolution makes the political low blow of focusing on the behavior of one. 
   Members of Congress certainly know, or should know, that the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, also known as the Ethics Committee, has traditionally deferred criminal matters to the Department of Justice. This makes perfect sense. The Department of Justice will carry out an investigation, offer a platform for the proving of innocence or guilt, and allows the adjudication of  citizens before their peers. The resolution offered by the Majority Leader allows this process to occur, and upon its conclusion, for Congress to then make a decision based on the merit of the facts. The Minority Leader's resolution reaches a conclusion before the facts have even come to court. Indeed, it reaches a conclusion before Congressman JEFFERSON is even formally arraigned. 
   The disrespect this resolution has for our Constitution that we have all sworn to uphold and defend by not allowing our system of justice to work its will; the absolute terrible precedent this resolution makes in establishing guilt based not on facts but politics; and by focusing on only one Member of Congress instead of seeking to reform or address the behavior of all Members of Congress, are the reasons why I cast my vote against this measure.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the FY08 House Appropriations Financial Services Subcommittee bill. As you know, this will be the first of the 11 bills that the House Appropriations Committee have considered that will have all of its earmarks in it as it first comes to the floor; and one in which all of its earmarks are publicly disclosed. We have ushered in a new era in Congress, and it is an era of which I am proud. 
   I have attended all of the hearings the subcommittee has had this Congress, and have enjoyed my work not only with Chairman JOS&#201; SERRANO, but with his staff of Dale Oak, Bob Bonner, Frank Carrillo, Karyn Kendall, and Deborah Bilek. We have had to make many difficult decisions. But I am proud to say that we have been able to make some major accomplishments. Among them include: CDFI/Bank Enterprise Fund--$54,000,000. 
   Along with Chairman SERRANO, we were able to get an increase for funding for both the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, CDFI, and the Bank Enterprise Fund. Both of these programs are of vital importance to our Nation's urban areas, and help improve access to a wider array of financial services in distressed communities. Fourteen million dollars of this fund is to go to the Bank Enterprise Fund. 
   II. SBA MICROLOAN PROGRAM AND MICROLOAN TECHNICAL SUPPORT--$17,000,000
   Small businesses are the engine that drives the American economy. This supports funding of the Small Business Administration's Microloan program and technical support for the microloan program of the SBA. The microloan program will receive a total of $17 million ($2.5 million for loan subsidies and $14.5 million for technical assistance). The President's budget proposed to terminate technical assistance and to provide no subsidy for microloans. 
   I am also pleased that we were able to get report language that emphasizes and enhances the role of the Federal Communications Commission toward ensuring that all ethnic minorities, senior citizens and the disabled will not have blank television sets when the whole country goes from an analog signal to totally digital signals on February 17, 2009. Also, we were able to ensure that the Department of the Treasury step up their enforcement of companies that use predatory mortgages and loans on senior citizens, ethnic minorities, and the disabled. Not only do we have language in the report that emphasizes this need, we provide these agencies with the funding they need to do what America needs done. 
   Finally, I want to discuss one area of particular interest to me. The bill, under its section regulating the District of Columbia, has a cap on what attorneys can bill for families of disabled children who need assistance under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or IDEA. No where else in our country is this the case. This is a shame. During subcommittee and full committee consideration of the bill, I wanted to offer an amendment to remove this section. However, my staff and I have been working with Mayor Adrian Fenty, and will not advocate the removal of the provision this fiscal year. Mayor Fenty agrees with me that this provision should be removed; by the next fiscal year, language that does the least amount of harm to the citizens of the District of Columbia and which enhances the quality of life for all disabled children and their  families should be completed. I ask unanimous consent to insert as part of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a letter dated June 26, 2007 that I received from Mayor Fenty addressing this problem, which will follow my remarks. 
   I would like to say one word about earmarks. What has been missed in this debate is the fact that in this bill, like most of the bills that have come to the floor with earmarks, a good number of these earmarks are earmarks requested by the President. This bill contains $1.3 billion worth of earmarks specifically requested by the President for a wide variety of projects throughout the nation, mainly for projects by the General Services Administration. It seems to me to be hypocritical for the minority to have so much energy to criticize the earmarks of other Members of Congress, especially those of us in the Majority, while offering not even a hint of outrage at the earmarks offered by the President. 
   This subcommittee covers over 700 individual agencies. We have so much authority, the Chairman has to give us cards with what it is over which we have jurisdiction. It is my desire that we can keep all amendments to this, and the rest of the bills that my colleagues and I have been working so hard on the House Appropriations Committee, to a minimum; that these bills move as quickly as possible through the House and Senate; and that President Bush signs these bills into law so that we can continue to work for the American people.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of every Congress, every member of this august body takes an oath to ``defend and protect the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' It is an oath that I am proud that the majority of the citizens of the 13th Congressional District of Michigan have honored me with their vote for more than 12 years. One of the most important duties that I have as a Member of the United States House of Representatives is to protect and defend its citizens, which is precisely what H.R. 1592, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, introduced by my fellow Michigander and Detroiter, one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus, House Judiciary Chairman JOHN CONYERS, JR. This bill protects all Americans from bias-motivated violence; it provides funds so that local authorities can tackle the tough challenge of hate crimes, and it protects the First Amendment to the Constitution. It does not criminalize speech or thoughts; it does not give some people ``special rights,'' and it is not anti-Christian. 
   As a child and as a proud Christian, the least common denominator of all of the lessons that I learned from my parents and minister is about God's ethic of love. Along that, I learned from the practices of my parents and my minister my divine responsibility to love our neighbors as ourselves. Indeed, it is out of my love that all of my brothers and sisters, and the activism that Jesus Christ illustrated through loving His enemies, through His compassion for the poor, the down trodden, and those who seek justice, that I became an activist, a state legislator and now a Member of Congress. It is that thirst for justice for all human beings that drives all that I do, guided by unerring and infinite wisdom and faith in God. 
   Despite the teachings of my parents and that of countless clergy--of all religions--around our Nation, there are some who perpetrate crime with hatred and bigotry in their heart. Who can forget that, during the civil rights era, the murders of the courageous Medgar Evers? Who can forget the killing of civil rights workers James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman for merely registering African Americans to vote? Who can forget the murder of native Detroiter Viola Liuzzo, who was gunned down as she drove civil rights workers to voting booths? All of these crimes, motivated by some bias, were ultimately prosecuted under Federal laws because, at the time, local authorities were either unable or unwilling to prosecute these crimes. These crimes could only be prosecuted because all of these individuals were participating in activities protected by the Federal Government--helping individuals vote or register to vote, for example. Only in limited, specific instances does this law even apply. 
   I vote in support of H.R. 1592 because H.R. 1592 sends a powerful message that all crime motivated by hatred and bias will not be tolerated in our society. I have voted for this bill at every opportunity when it came before the U.S. Congress. This legislation strengthens Federal law by providing local authorities with more money to prosecute hate crime and by expanding the jurisdiction to crimes motivated by bias against the victims actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender, or disability. 
   Unfortunately, opponents of this bill are shamelessly advancing false claims about the bill's impact on religion, particularly the freedom of clergy to preach about their beliefs, and that the bill legalizes certain sexual acts. Both of these claims are patently false. If you are a minister, this bill does not restrict any sermon, homily, speech or lesson unless that minister plans to start urging people to go out and commit violent crimes against others. During floor debate on the bill, Chairman Conyers reiterated the fact that the bill would not legalize any one of a plethora of sexual acts or activity, most of which are already illegal in most states. 
   Again this bill in no way, shape or fashion restricts free speech. Indeed, it clearly states, and has been supported by a Republican-dominated, conservative Supreme Court, that it in fact protects the First Amendment. Language is protected under this bill. Actions are criminalized. Preaching against homosexuality, against disabled people, against women--the categories that this bill protects--is allowed as it has always been, under the protections of the First Amendment. Under this bill, it would be criminal to incite violence by willfully causing ``bodily injury based on the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the victim or is a violation of the state, local, or tribal hate crime laws.'' 
   Since 1991, over 100,000 hate crimes have occurred in our nation. Hate crimes devastate the communities, counties, cities and states in which they occur. These crimes of bigotry and hatred against an identifiable minority--based on race, color, ethnic origin, gender, 
   disability or sexual orientation--not only hurts the individual affected, but demoralizes and dehumanizes whole groups of people. As the civil rights era clearly illustrated, these crimes are committed solely to intimidate and trample upon the human rights of others. 
   This as the immediate effect of crushing the investment of companies in that locality, of tourists visiting that state, of individuals wanting to relocate to that region. This is measurable in real dollars and cents. The Federal Government cannot stand by to allow these heinous, horrible offenses to be committed. I did not stand for this when I was an activist fighting for human rights in the City of Detroit, Michigan; I will not stand for it as a Member of Congress with an opportunity to make a change and make a difference. 
   Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel once said that ``indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor--never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she is forgotten. The political prisoner in his cell, the hungry children, the homeless refugees--not to respond to their plight, not to relieve their solitude by offering them a spark of hope is to exile them from human memory. And in denying their humanity, we betray our own. Indifference, then, is not only a sin, it is a punishment.'' 
   In the past decade, our country has had men murdered merely because they were gay, disabled, or African American. These were all hard-working, tax-paying, law-abiding American citizens, killed because of these differences. As we move onward through this  new millennium, as we continue to change course, confront crises, and continue the legacy, I will do so with the continued guidance and love of an infinite God, with extraordinary hope, with profound faith, and with the knowledge that in caring for the least of our brothers and sisters, we care for ourselves. We cannot afford to be indifferent. 
   As we celebrate two centuries of the end of the African slave trade, it is my hope that today will be the beginning of the end of the decades of mindless hatred, bigotry, and discrimination against all God's children. All Americans have an investment in a stable, violence-free government, and that is exactly what this bill provides.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. 
   I stand here today in support of House Resolution 63, a long time coming, but as it is always said, it is right on time. I stand here to speak for the millions of Americans today who have had enough, who have had enough of this war, its unjust nature, its over $500 billion that has been spent there in Iraq and Afghanistan and not spent in our own country. 
   I stand here today in support of H. Con. Res. 63 because this war has lasted longer than World War II. My 87-year-old father fought in the Navy at Pearl Harbor during World War II. One of my political mentors, a great man, Mayor Coleman Alexander Young, a former Tuskeegee Airman, fought during World War II. It is time to bring our troops home. It is time for us to change the course. 
   As we celebrate this Black History Month, the theme of the Congressional Black Caucus during these times are change course, do something different, act, speak, donate, join, confront the crisis, the crisis of the war which is why we are here today, and then continue the legacy that has brought this country to greatness. 
   Many of my Congressional Black Caucus members have served in the military. JOHN CONYERS, CHARLIE RANGEL, ED TOWNS, BOBBY SCOTT, WILLIAM JEFFERSON, SANFORD BISHOP, all able men who have fought and served in our military over the years. 
   We come to you, tonight, this evening, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, proud Americans. We love our country. We serve our people. And we want to remain the strongest Nation in the world. 
   Who speaks for the American people in this time of crisis? They spoke to us last November when they said enough is enough. The first military man who died in wars for our country's independence was Crispus Attucks, who fought in the Revolutionary War, an African American man who gave his life because he loved this country, could not vote at the time, could not own property, but again he fought in a war because, again, this was the greatest country in the world. 
   So what do we do today as we discuss H. Con. Res. 63? It is time to engage in a diplomatic solution. We cannot win this war militarily. The generals, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have spoken out against the escalation. What is the plan, Mr. President? How do we bring our soldiers home, redeploy them on the periphery, and make our country safe, and, at the same time, invest those dollars in Americans' lives, in their children's lives? 
   Dr. King wrote a book, ``I Have the Strength.'' I have the strength to stand before you today for the American people. I have the strength to let you know that we as a Nation can be all that God wants us to be. That in fighting wars, and wars will come from time to time, this is the time to bring this one to the end. 
   I will protect and speak out for the over 3,100 families who have lost young men and women, over the tens of thousands who are blinded and amputees, and over the many hundred thousands we do not yet know who will be in need of mental health services as our mental health capacity in this country has been shredded. 
   Those dollars have to be invested so that we take care of our veterans. I have the strength to stand here before you this evening because it is time, as we debate H. Con. Res. 63, that we rise up as a Nation and speak out and continue our legislative responsibilities, as I stood before you, took my oath of office that I would protect this country, our Constitution, against both domestic and foreign intimidation. 
   I stand before you tonight as one of 43 members of the Congressional Black Caucus during this African American History Month, who love our country, who want us to invest in America's families. H. Con. Res. 63 will begin that discussion. It will make it available that we might change course, do something different, listen to the American people. 
   We love our troops. We served in those troops. Our families served. We want the strongest military that we have available. We are now having in Iraq equipment shortages. If we spent over $503 billion, why is it that equipment is not adequate for our soldiers to engage in battle? 
   Accountability. The Inspector General recently reported $9 billion is unaccounted for. That is $9 billion as part of the $500 billion that could be invested in American families. So I say as I stand here, H. Con. Res. 63, vote ``yes.'' Let's change course.  
   I am honored and blessed with the understanding of a power greater than that of any singular or even collective Membership of this Congress. That power has allowed Congress to finally debate the most pressing question of our time--the War in Iraq. As I prepared myself to speak in support of H. Con. Res. 63, a very simple and very clear declaration that Congress supports our troops, but we oppose the escalation of this war, I reflected upon the words of one of the greatest warriors for peace this world has ever known, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. A prolific author, Dr. King wrote a book entitled, ``Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?'' In it, Dr. King writes that ``we are faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity.'' Congress lost our opportunity for real debate on this war a little more than four years ago. Congress has that opportunity now. 
   As this is the height of Black History Month, I also speak to America today because of the investment that my ancestor put through 4 centuries of slave labor, 4 centuries of lynchings, 4 centuries of Jim Crow laws, 4 centuries of sitting on the back of the bus, 4 centuries of combined discrimination. And despite 4 centuries of second class citizenship, African Americans have always heeded the call to arms in defense of a country that did not always defend them. 
   Indeed, when it comes to war, the very first person, black, white, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Native American to die for this country was an African American, Crispus Attucks, who did not even have the right to vote, the right to buy property, the right to be recognized as a human being. He wanted the right to love our country. Like the hundreds of thousands of African Americans who have followed his footsteps in the military, I honor and I appreciate the service of all our women and men in the military of all ethnicities. I support all of the women and men who serve, without glory but with honor, efficiently and effectively protecting all of us, never hesitating to pay the highest price any human being could pay for our freedom. 
   I speak to America today because Americans have had enough, as best selling author Frank Rich illustrates, of the ``decline and fall of the truth.'' Of what decline and fall do I speak? Of ``Mission accomplished.'' Of ``bring 'em on.'' Of ``shock and awe.'' Of ``dead or alive.'' Of ``uranium coming from Africa.'' Of ``smoking guns becoming mushroom clouds.'' Those Americans who have had enough are not just the Democratic majority. They are not just the senior citizens, the working class 
   women and men who punch a time clock every day, or the liberals of America. They conservatives, my Republican colleagues in Congress and elsewhere, people in the red States and blue States, business owners, military women and men and their families. 
   My father served this country honorably as a member of our military, as have many of my relatives. Many members of the Congressional Black Caucus have also served this country in our military. Just off of the top of my head, my colleagues Chairman JOHN CONYERS, Chairman CHARLES RANGEL, Congressman ED TOWNS, and Congressman BOBBY SCOTT, among others, have worn the uniform. My political mentor and hero, the late, great mayor of Detroit, Michigan, Coleman Young, was one of General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.'s understudies as a Tuskeegee Airman as a bombardier and navigator. During the Vietnam war, African Americans served despite the opposition of Dr. King and other groups opposed to the Vietnam war. They did it for the same reason why I serve this country as a Member of Congress--because I love our country. 
   The investment that began when African Americans set foot in Jamestown, Virginia in 1619 and continues to this very day is the reason why I stand in support of this resolution that is but the first step, to resolve the challenge that is Iraq. I am not a military expert, and I don't pretend to be a military expert. But, as noted genius Albert Einstein once said, ``insanity is doing the same over and over again and expecting different results.'' Over and over, Congress has spent over $503 billion in Iraq. Over and over, America's finest have died, with more than 3,000 women and men, in Iraq. Over and over, women and men are wounded or maimed, some for life, with more than 25,000 today. Today, we still cannot safely fly planes on a reliable basis in and out of Baghdad. This is progress?  
   Progress is what Americans want. I know that war can be messy, amorphous at times, and brutal. After a war that has lasted more than the United States involvement in World War II, our military women and men deserve progress. Our taxpayers deserve progress. Our current course, and this surge, is not what Americans want, this is not what Congress wants, this is not what I want. 
   Historians have generally acknowledged that the debate on the war in 1991 was one of the high marks of this institution. Congress did not cede its role then to a popular President. Instead, Congress and the White House worked together to achieve a worthwhile goal. It was difficult. Both sides had to compromise. But guess what? That is how a democracy works. 
   Unfortunately, Congress did not have this debate over 4 years ago in a war that has now lasted longer than the United States was involved in World War II. Thank God, we have that debate now. Thank God, we have heard the voice of the American people. Thank God and the American people, it is time for a change. 
   After this debate, after this resolution, I hope that this is the beginning of our country, and our world, to begin to choose between chaos and community. As Dr. King once wrote, ``we have a choice today--nonviolent coexistence or violent co annihilation.'' 
   Dr. King wrote another book entitled ``Strength to Love.'' It is because I have the strength to love my country, the strength to love our troops, the strength to love the oath I took for this office--that I will protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I have the strength to support this resolution. We need to be smarter about our policy in Iraq to include diplomatic and political solutions rather than repeating the same military policies that have not worked, but continue to put the finest of our women and men in harm's way. Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, working together, can arrive at a solution that establishes a stable democracy in Iraq, protects American interests, and increases the role and responsibility of the Iraqi people to fend for themselves. 
   Instead of ``bring them on,'' I hope that my colleagues agree that Congress can start to ``bring them home.'' I will vote in strong support of H. Con. Res. 63, and hope that Congress can quickly work to bring stronger, binding legislation to the floor soon.

   You know, you have heard it said tonight that she was a friend and a leader and intelligent and you could count on her when she gave you her word. We all felt that. And I think as Congressman Payne said, she is in this Chamber, and she will be in this Chamber, and it is our responsibility to carry her spirit and her dedication to building a new America for all of God's people. 
   The caucus has received many letters and congratulations, condolences and expressions of love for Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones. At this I would like to put some of them in the Record, from the South African Embassy, from the Embassy of Turkey, from the Black Women Lawyers' Association of Greater Chicago, and from the Embassy of Colombia. The list goes on and on, and we will be putting them in all week long. To you, Sister Sister, you live, and you always will.

Madam Speaker, Members of Congress, people of the United States of America, I stand this morning as chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus to say thank you to the thousands of people who are in Jena, Louisiana as we speak, and the tens of thousands around this country standing for liberty and justice for all. 
   Unfortunately, a tragic accident happened in Jena, Louisiana. A gentleman has been incarcerated since December; the appeals court has thrown out the conviction; he is still incarcerated. Six young men attacked, two days before the incident that they are in jail for, and now we ask for justice. 
   This is an important day in the history of our country. We rise, as we just said the Pledge of Allegiance, justice and liberty for all. Congratulations to the attorneys, to the coalition, to the families. Let's retry this in juvenile court where it ought to be and bring justice to the Jena 6. Congratulations, young men. Stand strong. We are with you. God bless.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank our chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. We are legislators. The President has a job and we who represent the people have a job. It funds the war, a war that the other side started, and the speech that they are giving tonight is the same speech they gave 4 years ago. 
   It's time to change course. This bill funds veterans who have been wounded severely, children who need health care, and all the emergencies that this country needs to address and has not been taking care of the last decade. 
   Pass the bill. 
   Mr. President, sign the bill. It's the best bill. The Senate and House have agreed, and we don't care that the President has said, before we even passed it out of the first Chamber, that he would veto it. We have to pass this bill, bring our troops home, and have a plan for success. 
   This is a good conference report. Americans, speak out. If the President does veto the bill, there is something to be paid. The troops need our help and our support, and I thank Chairman Obey and Chairman Murtha for their leadership. Vote for the conference report.  
   ``Few will have the greatness to bend history itself; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation.'' Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
   This vote will affect us today, it will affect our children tomorrow, it will affect our grand children of the next generation. Unlike some of our colleagues, I refuse to legislate any bill, much less this bill, merely because the President has issued a veto threat. Our brand of government has lasted for more than 230 years because of the separation of powers. The President needs the money, and Congress controls the power of the purse. 
   We have the opportunity to change course, confront crises, and continue the legacy of not only the Democratic Party but of America with this vote today. 
   As of April 23, 2007, there have been 3,333 U.S. Military Deaths Confirmed by the Department of Defense. There have been at least 20,000 women and men who have been wounded, and untold numbers of women and men who have been affected by traumatic brain injuries that we are just discovering, and will suffer for decades from post traumatic stress disorder. 
   The Democrats have worked to compromise with the Administration. While I, like many of my colleagues, hoped that we would retain the House language with regard to the troop deployment provisions, I understand that honesty and compromise are the hallmarks of this august body. 
   Make no mistake about it; this vote is a vote to support our troops and will bring an end to the war in the near future. The military options for Iraq are exhausted; we need to pursue diplomatic solutions so that the Iraqis and other countries in the Middle East can be real shareholders in the fate of Iraq. 
   This supplemental enforces the President's own benchmarks that the Iraqis protect and end their civil war. This bill has the military's own standards for readiness and deployment. This bill provides more than the President requested for military procurement, construction, health care, and readiness. 
   I am proud that the Committee supported my request for increased funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, to remove the matching funds for many of the grants and loans going to the rebuilding of states affected by Hurricane Katrina, in particular the city of New Orleans. 
   $450 million for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)/Counseling: African American male Vietnam and Iraq theater veterans have higher rates of PTSD than Whites. Rates of current PTSD are 28% among Hispanics, 21% among African Americans, and 14 percent  among Whites. African Americans have greater exposure to war stresses and had more predisposing factors than Whites, which appeared to account for their higher rate of PTSD. 
   $450 million for Traumatic Brain Injury care and research: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the function of the brain. 
   $20 million to address the problems at Walter Reed: When the federal base-closing commission recommended shutting down Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, it was noted through a number of reports that most of the patients and communities affected were African-American. 
   $100 million to allow the VA to contract with private mental healthcare providers to offer veterans, including Guard and reserve members, quality and timely care: African Americans are more likely to be victims of serious violent crime than are non-Hispanic whites. 
   Food Assistance (PL 480 Title II): Adds $450 million, which is $100 million above the President's request, to support food aid in Sudan/Eastern Chad, Southern Africa, and the Horn of Africa. 
   Agricultural Assistance: Adds $3.7 billion. According to the National Farmers Union, over 80 percent of U.S. counties were designated as disaster areas in 2005, and 60 percent were declared in 2006, making this assistance essential if farmers are to maintain their livelihoods in the coming year. 
   Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP): The Supplemental adds $400 million to partially restore cuts to the program. 
   Pandemic Flu Preparedness: Adds $1 billion to purchase vaccines needed to protect us from a global pandemic. 
   State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP): As amended in Committee, the proposal adds $750 million for SCHIP to ensure continued healthcare coverage for children in 14 states that face a budget shortfall in the program. 
   Foreign Aid: $40 million in security assistance is added for Liberia. This provision was added only because of the CBC. 
   After far too long, the bill will address the outstanding needs of our working women and men by increasing the minimum wage of Americans.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (PERMITTING DELEGATES AND THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER TO CAST VOTES IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution. The Delegates vote in committees. They are assigned the task. They spend the hours, and they deserve the vote in the full House. There is no reason, except for an act in 1995 that caused them to lose that right to vote in committees, Committee of the Whole, and here this resolution talks about voting in the Committee of the Whole. 
   We need their vote. They are citizens of our country. They work, they pay taxes, they fight our wars. There is no reason that they would not be allowed, not just the Committee of the Whole, as was mentioned just earlier, they also need that final vote on legislation. When you fight wars, and we are in some now, and some of their people are fighting, they ought to be represented and have a voice in this Congress. 
   At the same time, and I don't want anybody to mistake, the District of Columbia, who has over 700,000 residents, more than some of our States who have two Senators and a Congressperson, not being allowed the right to vote? Something is very wrong with that in this country where we live. And I believe that this is the first step to regain what they lost earlier, but it is certainly not, I hope, the final step. 
   It is important as we go forward and as we acknowledge Congresswoman, as I call her, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, my good friend, Congresswoman Donna Christensen and the Representatives from Puerto Rico and Guam and Samoa Islands, that they fight our wars, they pay taxes in D.C., and they serve in our Congress. So I rise to support it, and Members of the Congressional Black Caucus take a unanimous position that we support this legislation. We ask for its immediate passage, and we come back and give D.C. statehood that they have earned and should have.  
   Citizens from Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. have paid taxes and have protected the Constitution of this country in our military. Some of our colleagues who have been fortunate enough to serve Americans in this august body have protected it as Members of Congress. It is now time for us to protect the rights of those citizens to at least be able to vote in the Committee of the Whole. It is a first step toward equity, equality and egalitarianism for so many people who have given so much but have received so little with regard to having a voting representative in the United States Congress. 
   Right here, in Washington, D.C., citizens were not allowed to even vote for President until the adoption of the 23rd Amendment to the Constitution in 1961, but which actually occurred in 1964. Right here, in Washington, D.C., citizens were not even allowed to vote for their own Mayor or local form of government until 1974. Right here, in Washington, D.C., as I face the setting sun, thousands of white tombstones, honoring some of the souls of individuals from Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. face us as immortals. These citizens, about six miles away from where I stand at Arlington National Cemetery, have paid the highest price for freedom any individual will ever pay. These citizens--hard-working, women and men, some of whom have served and are still serving our country in Afghanistan and Iraq--two centuries and thirty-one years since the Declaration of Independence, do not have the right to full representation in Congress. I applaud my colleagues for beginning the process that, I hope, will ultimately allow the citizens from Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. full voting representation in Congress. This is but a small step, but it is a step in the right direction. It is right, it is just, and it is time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. I thank you, Madam Chair, for yielding. I certainly appreciate your leadership and all that you do for this body. I thank you for being the coordinator for this Special Order as we move through this 110th session. We thank you for your leadership, delta woman. We appreciate you. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand here tonight as chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus. We are from 26 States. We are 43 Members. We represent over 40 million Americans. Eighteen of our Members have less than 50 percent populations of African Americans. The highest percentage that any Member represents is 61 percent African Americans. So we represent all ethnicities of America: Latino Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, Arab Americans, Italian Americans, European, and the whole conglomerate. So we call ourselves the conscience of the Congress because we are they, 43 of us, 26 States, representing over 40 million Americans who can speak and represent all ethnicities in America. 
   Disparities in health care is real. It's alive. And it is really determined by how you live, where you live, what economic standards are you able to afford with you and your family, from generations yet unborn. So we are here tonight to talk about how do we close that gap? What ought to be the policies of our United States government to take care of American citizens, 300 million of us, from disparate backgrounds? What can we do to close the gap? 
   One thing we can do is to make sure that education, quality education, is had for every American; that they may compete not against Ohio or Michigan or California and New York, but to compete in the world, China, India, other countries of the world who revere, and in knowing that education is the key not only to a successful life but a key to adequate health care opportunities. 
   Number two, that we invest in those communities so that we put the dollars where they are necessary, so that we don't have underserved communities as we have today across America, underserved as it relates to health care, their access to quality health care. Can they really participate in programs that make their lives better? 
   When we have a healthy America, then we have healthier families, we have healthier cities, and then, of course, our country is one of health. 
   We talk about disparities of health care, and it refers to the difference between two or more population groups, the outcomes and the prevalence of certain illnesses, heart disease, diabetes, access to quality health care, are we really providing what is necessary for America's families? And we, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, don't believe that we do. 
   Our Federal budget is 2.9 trillion of your tax dollars. We round that off and say $3 trillion in this 2008 budget that we are dealing with. Of that budget three entitlements: Medicare, health insurance for 44 million American seniors; Medicaid, over 40 million low-income, disabled, and children's programs; and then our veterans, our proud veterans, who have fought in our wars ever since the beginning, some in battle, some in theater, some not, but defending our country.     
   When you take out the main three entitlements, our Appropriations Committee handled 600 to $800 billion. Two-thirds of those monies goes to the entitlements, as was mentioned, and a few others handled by the Ways and Means Committee, where some of those health programs were had. And the other, what we call discretionary funding, is what is handled in the Appropriations Committee. 
   Of the $800 billion in 2008, $600 billion of that is going to defense, to defense. Proud that we are of our Defense Committee, but never is it intended that two-thirds of that budget, three-fourths in many instances, will go to defend the country. We have to end the war. We've got to bring our soldiers home. We have to invest in American families. 
   I believe that health care, education, housing, environment and access to capital are those things that this Congress must fund. That's why we have disparities, because many families start at a disadvantage; low income, poor schools, health crisis, unable to get quality health care. 
   So as we come to you tonight as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, we ask you, America, stand up for what you believe. If you want a strong family, if you want strong opportunities, if you want investment in your children and in your families, speak to that. 
   Our theme for the Congressional Black Caucus is ``Change Course.'' Do something different, America. Join. Speak out. Donate. Volunteer. Be a part of something that you believe in that will make America stronger. Health care, we believe, is one of those things that you will find yourself participating in. 
   Change course and then confront the crisis. Confront the crisis of education. Why is it that our schools can't compete with schools around the world? Confront the crisis of the war. And yes, confront the crisis of the disparities in health that we find ourselves in today. We can do better. We can be better. Make sure you're a part of that equation. 
   And then let us all rise up and continue the legacy. Change course, confront crises, and continue the legacy that all of us have put together as members of the African American Congressional Black Caucus, Latino Caucus, Tri-Caucus, the Asian Caucus as well. We work together to make sure that we begin to address some of the disparities that we see. 
   So, Madam Chair, thank you for your leadership. Thank you as we try to talk to America to become involved, to change course, to confront crises, to continue the legacy that so many have given their lives and time that we might be on this floor tonight. 
   This is the greatest country in the world. Let's eliminate the health disparities. Let's make our families stronger. Provide better education opportunities, better work opportunities and, yes, access to capital. When we do that, we will eliminate the disparities that we find now in our health system. 
   With that, Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding me this time. 
   Today is the first day of the rest of our lives. I stand here to pay tribute to my friend, my sister, chairwoman, Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. I was asked earlier by an interviewer: How would she like us to remember her? A leader, a fighter, a mother, a grandmother, excellence bar none, first class, no shortcuts. 
   To Jim and Valerie and to the rest of the family, to the grandchildren, just know you have her blood and you can do anything. No limits; be the best. 
   As chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus, we are honored to have had her with us and teach us and show us the way. JUANITA has been special in this body, rising from mayor, city councilperson, the first African American woman to chair the House Women's Caucus, and over the last 11 years serving in this body, a special friend to me personally. We many times talked about our families. 
   So my sister, JUANITA, as you take your rest with the spirit of God, we know you will watch over us and make  sure that we do our due. We know the family knows you are with them forever. 
   To Jim, it's okay, we're here for you and we always will be. 
   So let us continue to rejoice. He makes no mistakes. We now have extra protection in heaven.  
   On behalf of the entire body of the CBC, we are both remorseful and reflective on the life and legacy of Representative JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. 
   We are praying with and for her family and dear friends during this season of grief. 
   Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD should be celebrated for her abounding commitment to service and advocacy. During her 7-term tenure as the eloquent voice of the 37th Congressional District, including Long Beach, the industrial suburbs of Carson and Compton and parts of south central Los Angeles. 
   As a former educator and recipient of a myriad of distinctions, including: 
   First African American woman to chair a full committee in the U.S. House of Representatives; 
   First African American woman to serve on the Carson City Council; 
   First African American woman to render the national Democratic response to President Bush's weekly radio address; 
   First to be named Honorary Curator of the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach; 
   First Democratic Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues. 
   Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD made certain to pave the way for her firsts to not be the last for African Americans and Americans across the globe. 
   Therefore, the CBC will continue to carry on the work of Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD as we change course, confront crises and continue the legacy.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, at this time, the Congressional Black Caucus will present our 2009 budget for the fiscal year: Tough Choices, Right Priorities. 
   The Federal budget is $3.1 trillion. Of these four main entitlements: Medicare, programs for over 40 million Americans, disabled children, low-income; Medicaid, 40 million children, low-income, disabled; Medicare, 44 million seniors' health program; and veterans, who have worked to build our country's security over these many years. 
   The budget we have before us invests in American families. It invests in our children, in our families, and it secures us at the same time. 
   There is no tax increase in this budget. And you will hear over and over from the other side that we're increasing taxes. We are not. We are rolling back those permanent tax cuts, for any American citizen who earns over $200,000 will have the regular tax procedure. What we're rolling back and increasing the revenue so that we invest in America's families are incomes over $200,000, that we might ensure all of America's children, that we might invest and save Medicare, as well as Medicaid. 
   We will increase the funding for No Child Left Behind, our premier education program that has never been properly funded. Education is the equalizer. America now falls behind the major nations of the world because our education system is crumbling, and our Congressional Black Caucus budget invests in education. We also offer money  in our Justice Department for having safer communities across America. 
   We will present to you our 2009 Congressional Black Caucus budget. It is fair, it reduces the deficit, and it invests in America's children and in America's families. 
   It is my opportunity, as we move on and present the various Members who will speak, that we will show you that this budget is a budget that America needs: tough choices, right priorities. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, our country, our Declaration of Independence, and our Constitution are all based on a promise. The promise in the Declaration of Independence is that taxation without representation was, and is, wrong. The promise in our Constitution is that all citizens of this country have ``certain inalienable rights'' and it is the job of Congress to secure those inalienable rights. H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, would secure those rights for the hard working, tax paying citizens who, merely because they live in the Nation's Capital, do not have a voting representative in the U.S. Congress. 
   We enjoy many rights as Americans. The right to vote and the right to equal representation is perhaps the most sovereign right that we as Americans have. In my own personal history as an activist, I was an active and aggressive participant to secure these rights for all Americans. Indeed, some of our colleagues in Congress today were jailed and beaten to protect these civil freedoms. Unfortunately, too many died for this cause. The sacrifices of these individuals and organizations, along with the basic, essential sense of freedom and justice, is a clarion call and underscores our obligation to the more than 600,000 citizens of Washington, DC who pay some of the highest taxes in the Nation, but do not have a vote on those taxes; who have served and died in every war our country has fought, but do not have a vote to authorize a war; and who, in 2007, still do not have a voting representative in the U.S. Congress. 
   H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, will not only add full and unfettered voting power for the Representative from the District of Columbia, it also adds a new Congressional District in Utah. This bill, the manifestation of hard, tough, bipartisan negotiations, finally provides fairness and justice that has been denied for more than two centuries to the citizens of Washington, DC. For more than two centuries and a half, while our country has made democracy our global mantra, citizens in the Nation's Capital have not had a voice. For more than two centuries and a half, citizens in the Nation's Capital have been muted and marginalized. The District of Columbia Voting Rights Act is a step in the right direction, empowers the citizens of Washington, DC, and finally allows for the citizens of Washington, DC to fully embrace and enjoy the fruit of their labor, taxes, and diligence to our country. 
   I am pleased that the wisdom of 240 of my colleagues prevailed in this vote, and I look forward, like the vast majority of my colleagues, to quick action in the Senate and to President Bush signing this bill into law as soon as possible. I applaud the work of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, Congressman Tom Davis, and the collective bi-partisan effort to preserve the principle of fair, equal representation.

   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman Barney Frank and his entire Financial Services team and committee for the outstanding work they have done with this very difficult situation for the last month or so. Thank you, Barney, and for the full committee. The Michigan delegation in a bipartisan way worked feverishly to make this happen. Thank you very much. 
   America is at a crossroads, a crossroads on whether America will be a first-rate country as we move through this century. Seventy years ago, my grandfather, as well as hundreds of others, came to this part of the country  from South Carolina to the midwest, to the manufacturing base of America, the base that built the middle-class in this country. Without the manufacturing, there would be no middle-class in America. Do we want to forsake that today? I hope not. 
   The American automobile industry is the military equipment builders of our country, from World War II and every war thereafter, building the tanks, the ammunition, the body armor and the like. It will be a mistake for us if we don't preserve this industry. 
   Three million-plus direct jobs with another 10 million from insurance, health care, security. You name it, those are 13.6 million Americans affected by this automobile industry. We must preserve it. 
   The middle class is dwindling as we speak. With all the problems America has, this is not the time to kill, if you will, the only manufacturing base we have left in our country. We already yielded the electronics industry. We yielded the fabric and the garment industry. Manufacturing is one of the tools that can keep our country alive. I hope you will vote today and save this most vital industry. 
   I mentioned my grandfather. I am the next generation after that. Because of the manufacturing industry, the automobile industry specifically, we have been able to send generations of young people who are now 40, 50, 60 years old to college, the manufacturing industry. 
   Vote for this bill. Don't do it wrong. Let's do it right.  
   Giving thanks to God, who is the power, force and director of my life, I thank the Democratic Leadership and my colleagues in the Michigan delegation for their continued hard work, objective analysis and hard questions for both automobile manufacturers and taxpayers. As an enthusiastic supporter of the automotive industry, I, along with the unanimous agreement of the Michigan delegation, seek a balanced, fair solution for American taxpayers, manufacturers, dealers, and suppliers to the automobile industry. A large part of that solution is this bill, crafted by Chairman Frank and Members of the House Financial Services Committee on which I once served. This bill will provide $15 billion in bridge loans to help struggling automakers survive while they prepare plans to restructure their companies to build more competitive, fuel-efficient, and technologically-advanced vehicles. This assistance will not only help manufacturers, but it will help the workers, the dealers, the suppliers and the 13 million jobs that are directly and indirectly affected by the largest industry in our Nation--the automobile industry. 
   In addition, this bill, which would amend current law, demands taxpayer protections such as limits to executive compensation, including a ban on so-called ``golden parachute'' payments, a prohibition on dividend payments over the life of the loans, rigorous independent oversight, and provisions for the government taking warrants and allowing the taxpayer to profit in any upside of the restructuring. This is a fair balance for both the manufacturers and American taxpayers. If the Big Three were to collapse, there would be a loss of personal income of close to $400 billion, with a combined loss of tax receipts of $156 billion, over 3 years, according to the Center for Automotive Research. With the interdependence of Mexico, Canada and the United States because of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), this vastly underestimates the ultimate impact if the Big Three were to go bankrupt. 
   With the recent loss of more than half a million jobs in one month, in our Nation, Federal assistance to the automotive industry is needed immediately for our economic, military, and energy security and safety. A government-supported restructuring of the auto industry is urgently needed for our economic, military and energy security. General Wesley Clark recently wrote that ``some economists question the wisdom of Washington's intervening to help the Big Three, arguing that the automakers should pay the price for their own mistakes or that the market will correct itself. But we must act: aiding the American automobile industry is not only an economic imperative, but also a national security imperative.'' 
   This is an opportunity for Congress to do four things. One, it is an opportunity to get our country to energy security or energy independence. Two, it is a chance to ensure that, unlike our textile and electronics industry, to preserve and protect our manufacturing base, the last industry in which America still holds a slight but precarious lead. Three, it can be a way in which we get the manufacturers toward building the vehicles that Congress mandated that they build. Four, we can preserve the jobs and businesses of dealers and suppliers. In all of the discussions of saving the manufacturers, there has been little, if any, discussion to save the thousands of automobile dealers and suppliers to the automotive industry. 
   Congress has been advocating that our country become either energy independent or have energy security. Indeed, President Richard Nixon challenged that our Nation become independent on foreign oil in the early 1970s. Although the automotive industry is in a crisis, this is truly an opportunity to start a major reorganization and reprogramming of the entire automotive industry. In less than 2 years, General Motors will produce the first practical all-electric motor vehicle. This is a welcome opportunity, and is a development that all Americans should embrace. By being the first to produce a battery that can get hundreds of miles per charge, the United States can be the first in this manufacturing technology. This will create thousands of green jobs, clean up the air, and make us less dependent on foreign sources of fuel. This achievement is right around the corner, as GM is set to bring the Chevy Volt to market in less than 2 years. In less than 10 years, these batteries and fuel cells can be, and should be, built in the United States. 
   Second, we need to preserve the automotive industry as it is the base of manufacturing in the United States. Second only to the strong faith that Americans have in one another is the strength of our economy. Our modern economy was built by companies like General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. These are the companies that essentially built this country to victory in World War II and every military conflict we have had ever since. These companies not only built the tanks, the Jeeps, the trucks that support the women and men in our military, they often created the technologies that allow us to have navigational systems in our cars, brakes that last for thousands of miles, and protect our bodies in accidents. We cannot afford to lose this innovative intellectual property. 
   The auto industry has come to the rescue, once again, for our women and men in the military. The Humvee, the Stryker, and the mine-resistant ambush vehicles, and the like are built primarily in Michigan but entirely in the United States. As General Wesley Clark said, ``the lives of hundreds of soldiers and marines have been saved, and their tasks made more achievable, by the efforts of the American automotive industry. And unlike in World War II, America didn't have to divert much civilian capacity to meet these military needs. Without a vigorous automotive sector, those needs could not have been quickly met.'' Our economy and our troops cannot survive the loss of the automotive industry. 
   Third, the manufacturers know what is at stake today. It is not only their individual survival, but whether our country suffers a recession or a depression. We cannot afford, at this perilous time in our economy, the shut down of any company. Any form of bankruptcy would tear what little confidence consumers have in the auto industry to shreds by decimating consumer demand and forcing thousands of suppliers who need the cash flow from the auto manufacturers into immediate default. This legislation would allow time and cash for the manufacturers to make the necessary and needed change in their vehicles, again mandated by Congress, for the long-term energy self-sufficiency and environmental protection we seek. This legislation does just that. 
   One in every 10 jobs in the United States is somehow linked to the automotive industry. After the purchase of a home, the purchase of an automobile is the largest purchase for the overwhelming majority of America's consumers. Michigan, specifically my home city of Detroit, has been the home of the automotive industry for decades. More than 13 million jobs are directly or indirectly rely on the automotive industry. The losses of the automotive industry have been massive. In 2005, General Motors, which is headquartered in my Congressional District, lost more than $5.6 billion on its North America operations alone, with Ford losing $5.5 billion during the same period of time. GM's share of the market, which used to be 36 percent in 1990, had shrunk to 26 percent in 2005. Ford's 1990 share of the market, which was 24 percent, was 17 percent 2 years ago. Production for Ford and GM has dropped 26 percent since 1999. 
   In the wake of these losses, Michigan and our country have lost a significant number of jobs. Both GM and Ford announced a series of plant closings in North America, with an estimated loss of 60,000 jobs through layoffs and early retirement buy-outs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2005 the automotive industry lost a total of 215,000 jobs, and stated that ``industry employment is headed downward and is not likely to recover for several years.'' This situation does not get any better for those related industries supplying automobile parts, providing insurance for automobiles, or selling vehicles wholesale or retail. 
   While domestic manufacturers are not entirely blameless for these losses, a significant factor has been the way in which China has  done business with the Big Three. One of the U.S./China Commission's conclusions, to which I testified 2 years ago, was ``the many subsidies provided by the Chinese government to the auto industry will quickly distort the nature of the market. This will be true especially in the United States, where markets are most open. The Chinese challenge to the U.S. auto industry is a significant assault on American manufacturing, and that assault is increasing in magnitude and in pace.'' Are we willing to concede to other countries, perhaps China, our manufacturing base? 
   Finally, I am worried about the health of automobile dealers and suppliers, specifically ethnic minority automobile dealers and suppliers. It is my understanding from experts in the field that up to 75 percent of ethnic minority new car dealers, if they do not receive financial assistance within 60 days, will fail. In a meeting two weeks ago with the Speaker and the House Democratic leadership, the manufacturers estimated that more than 700 dealers are expected to close their doors before the end of the year. In all of this discussion about helping the manufacturers, it is only fair that some of this help go directly to the ethnic minority dealers and suppliers who are the backbone of their communities and of the automotive industry. Ethnic dealers and suppliers are first generation dealers and suppliers and simply do not have the economy of scale of their majority counterparts. As we move forward with this legislation, it is my hope that we provide immediate assistance to those who most need it--ethnic minority automobile dealers and suppliers. 
   We face tough times. The automotive industry can succeed, with the help of Congress, once again. The automotive industry has made mistakes, and all of the manufacturers present will tell you that I have worked with them to improve their product, outreach, and business model. Here, in Washington, DC, it is often hard for legislators to truly appreciate how difficult life is for the rest of America. In Michigan, we face record foreclosures, unemployment and job loss from manufacturing. We must save the automobile industry for the future of not only the industry but for the state of Michigan and our country. We must not repeat the mistakes we made in giving away our textile and electronics industry to other countries. We must do all we can to retain this vital segment of America.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Speaker, today, Congress, once again, wrote a prescription to the President for American children and their families that needs to be filled immediately. I am proud of the fact that Congress has sent to the Senate, and will soon send to the President, an insurance remedy for so many working families. I strongly support H.R. 3963, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, the modified bill to reauthorize and expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program or SCHIP. Working with the Minority, we were able to quickly craft a bill that addresses the concerns of most, if not all, Members of Congress. 
   In the wealthiest country in the world, far too many children are without health insurance. We can afford to spend $10 billion per month in a war in Iraq, but we cannot spend $35 billion over 5 years to protect our children? We cannot support those working families who cannot afford or do not have access to affordable health insurance? Over 81 percent of Americans, when asked this very question, agree with the Democratic Party that we need to take care of our children, and we need to take care of them now. Since the inception of SCHIP, the number of uninsured children has been reduced by one third. However, millions of children still remain uninsured or underinsured. 
   The revised bill before Congress today still would expand SCHIP to cover 10 million children and increase spending on the program to $35 billion over 5 years, funded with a 61 cent per pack increase in the federal cigarette tax. The bill would limit coverage to children in families with annual incomes below 300 percent of the federal poverty level, and performance bonuses would be offered to states that enroll greater numbers of children in Medicaid. The bill also would offer performance bonuses to states that provide subsidies to employed parents to offset the cost of enrolling their children in a private health insurance plan. 
   Passing this legislation should be a bipartisan issue. SCHIP was created to address the growing problem of children in the United States without health insurance. SCHIP assists children whose family's income falls above the threshold for Medicaid, but who still cannot afford to purchase medical insurance coverage. More than two thirds of the children who will be covered under this bill are ethnic minorities. 
   A lack of medical insurance not only harms children, but their families and the community as a whole. Reauthorizing this bill is so important because children without health insurance do not receive regular checkups and doctor visits that every child needs. May I remind my colleagues that less than 10 miles from where we vote, a little boy died from the lack of getting a simple dental examination. Furthermore, millions of children won't get the preventive care they need and will likely receive care in emergency rooms if this bill is not reauthorized. This only drives up the cost of medical care for everyone. 
   SCHIP gives working families the peace of mind that their children will have accessible and affordable health care. Healthy children do not get unnecessary diseases and go to school ready to learn. Healthy children become healthy teenagers, who ultimately will become healthy adults. Although children are about 30 percent of our population, they are 100 percent of our future. This $35 billion is a wise investment in the future of America. 
   In the Bible, in the chapter of Isaiah, it says that ``the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatted domestic animal together; and a little child shall lead them.'' Today, Congress worked together to stand up for the children of our Nation. The President, and Congress, ignored the wisdom in protecting our children one time too many; it is now time to erase that mistake. We have that opportunity now. 
   SCHIP is a smart investment in our Nation's children and working families. Congress has changed the course of the discussion of health care for our children and working families; we have confronted the crises of the lack of health insurance; we will continue the legacy of caring for some of the least of our brothers and sisters. I look forward to quick passage of this bill in the Senate, and the President's enacting this bill into law. Our children deserve no less.

<DOCNO>Ms. KILPATRICK. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, the Greek historian Herodotus is often called the ``father of history.'' In his work, The Histories, he attempted to chronicle the origin and outcome of the Greco-Persian War so that future generations could learn from experience. Unfortunately, for the men and women in Iraq and their families and for the American people, President Bush refuses to use what we have learned to revise our strategy for Iraq, redeploy our troops, and refocus on the priorities and protection of America's families. 
   The President continues to insist that America's involvement in the war in Iraq is an integral part of the war on terrorism. The Iraq Study Group, among other objective observers, repeatedly refuted this statement. Perhaps worse than this statement is that, despite the President's claims, the evidence indicates that progress is not being made in Iraq: 
   America's families unjustly continue to bear the burden of war; they have paid the price with the loss of 3,600 lives and with injuries to 26,000 service men and women. The order of nature has been violated--fathers and mothers are burying their sons and daughters. How many more of our loved ones will pay the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom of others? 
   America's families have paid more than $450 billion in taxes that have been use to fund failure instead of our future. We build stronger families and a stronger America when we provide our citizens with access to quality education, affordable housing and healthcare, well-paying jobs, and financial security. How much more will we spend before we realize that the very foundation of our future has crumbled beneath our feet? 
   The Iraqi Government has failed to meet critical benchmarks endorsed by the President in January. The President has said, ``when they stand up, we'll stand down.'' The Iraqis have not amended their Constitution, passed an equitable oil sharing law, reformed laws to provide government jobs to former members of the Ba'ath Party, or held provincial elections. When are the Iraqis going to stand up? 
   Seventy percent of Americans support withdrawing almost all U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008; half do not believe that the increase in U.S. forces since January of this year has made a difference. In addition, several Republicans have joined Democrats in calling for a new direction in Iraq. However, the President continues to wage a war with complete disregard for the concerns of the American people and the counsel of military leaders. When will the President connect the dots and see that the picture he has drawn is not a pretty one? 
   The Iraq Study Group stated that the use of the military in Iraq has passed; it is time for diplomacy to take place. Regrettably, diplomacy has not been seriously considered by the President, and internecine warfare and outright civil war has filled the vacuum of this viable option in Iraq. Also, the refugee problem in Iraq has worsened the situation in the Middle East; to date, the United States has taken in less than 200 refugees from Iraq after promising to take in thousands. Why haven't we taken in more refugees or fully allowed diplomacy to bear fruit? 
   These are among the many reasons why I support H.R. 2956, the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. I have opposed this war from the beginning and have been engaged in a continuing fight to change course. While our troops have performed heroically, violence remains high, and we must remove them from harm's way; we must require Iraqis to take responsibility for their own fate, and we must refocus on investing in America's families. This legislation--which is consistent with the advice of military and foreign policy experts, ensures the safety of our men and women in uniform, addresses our commitment to fighting terrorism, and reflects the will of the American people--allows us to do just that. This bill: 
   Acknowledges that our military has accomplished the mission they were given in the original 2002 authorization to use force and that Iraq is now responsible for its own future. 
   Requires American forces to begin redeploying within 120 days and to complete the transition to a limited presence by April 1, 2008. 
   Reiterates that the redeployment must be done in a safe and orderly way, with maximum attention paid to the protection of American forces. 
   Requires a comprehensive strategy by January 1, 2008, for U.S. policy in Iraq, including a discussion of American national security interests in Iraq and the broader region, the specific missions remaining forces would undertake, and minimum force levels required to accomplish them. 
   Names specific missions that the President must consider, but it does not require or authorize those missions. 
   Requires the President to submit updates on the use of and need for any forces remaining in Iraq every 90 days starting on July 1, 2008. 
   Dag Hammarskjold, a Swedish statesman and United Nations official, once said, ``There is a point at which everything becomes simple and there is no longer any question of choice, because all you have staked will be lost if you look back. This is life's point of no return.'' Certainly, the President and administration have reached that point. For them, the decision to stay the course is simple because it is too difficult to admit failure. However, as the representative for 670,000 of God's best in Michigan's 13th Congressional District, I am willing to make the hard choices. I believe the majority of my colleagues are, too. 
   The President can no longer afford to let his pride get in the way of making the right decision. Our troops, our families, our international reputation, and our future are at stake. 
   In the Bible, we read in Chronicles 7:14 that ``If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves ..... and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and ..... will heal their land.'' The international community--the billions of us who inhabit our home of planet earth--are children of God. We must learn to walk in the light and in love. It is out of my love of God, my love of the Constitution, my love of this country, and my love of my constituents, that I ask my colleagues to join me in support of the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;ENCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, today we take a firm stand against the President's tragic war policy in Iraq. Today we vote on H.R. 2956--the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. 
   This legislation is another appeal to a tone-deaf administration that our current path in Iraq is failing. The American people have had enough. They have had enough of the needless bloodshed; they've had enough of the misleading explanations; they've had enough of the broken promises; they've had enough of the lack of vision from this President. 
   The President's policy is based on false pretenses, for which there are now only imperfect options. After losing more than 3,500 of our servicemembers, and spending close to half a trillion dollars, it is time to bring our troops home. I salute the courage and professionalism of our soldiers who have served our country in Iraq. They overthrew an authoritarian regime and captured a dictator. Now it  is time for our commander-in-chief to bring them home. The ongoing instability in Iraq is a political problem that requires a political solution. 
   To continue to ask our service men and women to make the ultimate sacrifice for this misguided policy is simply immoral. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation because we must bring our troops home.

<TEXT>
   Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress and Americans across the world, thank you. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Madam Chair STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, for accepting the responsibility for leading the Special Order. Thank you very much. 
   We need a new direction in America. We need a plan, one we never had 4 years, 5 months ago as this country struck a sovereign nation, Iraq. We need a plan. I would say a new plan, but we never had an old plan. So a plan is what this country must have. President Bush wants the same ``no plan'' to go forward. It is time for change: over 3,800 Americans dead, over 28,000 Americans wounded in battle. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, 43 members from 21 States, we represent over 40 million Americans. And to a person, all over our districts, they want a change. They want a new direction with this war in Iraq. Eighteen of our members represent less than 50 percent African Americans. Several of our members represent less than 15 percent African American. We represent the American people, almost 300 million in our country, 40 million represented by the members of our caucus. We represent Latino Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, European Americans, Indian Americans, and African Americans. The entire multi-ethnic society are represented by members of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
   So when we start our Special Order tonight to talk about the war in Iraq, a war we never should have fought, a war that has lasted longer than World War I, World War II, the Civil War, and the war continues, you might remember, America, last spring they were all saying wait until September. We sent a bill with benchmarks to the Senate, to the House, passed the House, went to the Senate. The President vetoed it. We sent him another one. They say, okay, we won't do another one; we will wait until September. Well, now General Petraeus is saying not September 2007; let's now give them until March 2008. No new plan. 
   They are going to ask for $200 billion in the next several weeks. Already have spent $565.4 trillion of your tax dollars on a war we never should have fought. 
   America wants a change; we want a new direction, Mr. President. We want to bring our troops home in the most orderly possible plan that we can put together. And I hope and the American people hope this administration as well as our military leaders will come up with a plan. It is your responsibility to do that. 
   We support our troops. We support the veterans all over this country as well as those veterans who are fighting this war. The mental health needs that our country will have as a result of this war, we yet do not know. There will be significant needs for mental health services. This supplemental has very little money that is coming through. And this is a supplemental that we spent this year, 2007 and 2008. Understanding, again, we have already spent $565.4 trillion. Repeat that: $565 trillion in this war. 
   We must bring our troops home. We must have a new direction. And as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, we will say it over and over again: set a plan in motion. Change direction for our country. 
   Benchmarks. You heard also, benchmarks. What about these benchmarks that Congress, the President, and President Maliki put together earlier this year? It is really between President Bush's administration and the administration in Iraq, 18 benchmarks that they said they would meet by September. The General Accounting Office reported to this Congress last week they have met three of them. They are not sustaining their own government. They go on vacation, and they want us to fight their war. 
   Our people tell us to bring our soldiers home. We hear it across the country, Republicans and Democrats as well as independents: bring our troops home. It is unconscionable that this Congress would consider as an appropriator and as a Member of this body as well as a citizen of this country 200 billion new dollars for this ill-advised war in the next several months. 
   Rise up, America. Thank you for protesting over this last week. Keep the protests up. If you can't come to Washington, have them in your own State, in your own city. Let us hear your voices. It is too silent out there. This is a better country than that. 
   So as we come to you tonight as Members of this United States House of Representatives, 110th Congress, where there have been 110 African Americans elected and voting in this Chamber over these many years, we are proud to have that responsibility and we will remain the conscience of the Congress. Bring our troops home. End this ill-advised war. Rebuild America from the ground up. Our children deserve more. Our seniors who built this country need more. 
   There is no reason why we can't have top-quality education, good health centers, good environment, good infrastructure, bridges that don't collapse. But, you see, you can't spend $565 trillion of your money in a war that we should not be fighting and at the same time invest in America's future. 
   So as one of 43 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, we say to you, America, become engaged. Speak out. Ask that we bring our troops home. Ask for a new plan. Ask for a change of direction. Our theme for 2007 and 2008 is change course, do something different. Join. Volunteer. Work for a better America. Confront the crisis of the war, of education, of health care, of infrastructure needs. And then for us to continue the legacy, not just members of the caucus but all Americans, continue the legacy of people who have built this country, who have laid down their lives. And, for us, so many of our ancestors and forebears who fought the  civil rights movement who speak out today for a just America. 
   So my brothers and sisters, American citizens, rise up, change course. Fight to end this war today so that your grandchildren will have a better America tomorrow  
   Mr. Speaker: One of the costs of the war in Iraq that is often overlooked is the waste of tax dollars that could be used to fund programs and facilities that would improve our quality of life. America's families want access to well-paying jobs, affordable health care, and quality education. The War in Iraq presents a threat to our military readiness and the development of communities across our country. We must reinvest in programs that address the priorities of America's families to preserve the safety, security and stability of Americans everywhere. 
   I was against the War in Iraq from the beginning I will continue to stand strong for the citizens of the 13th Congressional District of Michigan and America. We must take America in a new direction. Let us work together to ``Change Course, Confront Crises, and Continue the Legacy.'' 
   IT'S TIME TO CHANGE COURSE
   The citizens of the 13th Congressional District of Michigan have collectively spent $555.4 million in Iraq. For this much money, we could have provided, right here to citizens in the 13th Congressional District: 190,892 people with health care; 7,747 more elementary school teachers; 83,268 more places with Head Start; 379,635 children with health care; 4,477 more affordable housing units for working class people and senior citizens; 50 new elementary schools; 60,288 scholarships for college students; 7,670 music and arts teachers; 12,009 police officers, fire fighters and emergency medical technicians; 780,628 homes with renewable energy options; or 8,403 port container inspectors.

   IT'S TIME TO CONFRONT CRISES
   On September 7, 2007, the non-partisan General Accounting Office concluded that the Iraqi government ``met three, partially met four, and did not meet 11 out of 18 benchmarks. Overall, key legislation has not been passed, and it is unclear whether the Iraqi government will spend $10 billion in reconstruction funds.'' [GAO-07-1230T] 
   As of September 10, 2007, 3,759 U.S. troops have been killed and more than 27,770 have been wounded in the Iraq war since it began in March 2003. [Department of Defense, 9/10/07] 
   IT'S TIME TO CONTINUE THE LEGACY
   The Iraq Study Group stated that the use of the military in Iraq has passed; it is time for diplomacy to take place. Regrettably, diplomacy has not been seriously considered by the President, and internecine warfare and outright civil war has filled the vacuum of this viable option in Iraq. [Iraq Study Group, December 6, 2006]. 
   Out of four million Iraqis who are refugees, the United States has taken in a total of 687 between April 1, 2003, and February 28, 2007.

[New York Times, 9/10/07]. 60 percent of Americans say the U.S. should set a timetable to withdraw our forces from Iraq and should ``stick to that timetable regardless of what is going on in Iraq.'' [USA Today. 9/10/07]. 
   IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE 
   As of September 2007, U.S. troops have been in Iraq for four years and six months. The Revolutionary War lasted eight years and two months. The American Civil War lasted four years. The Spanish-American War lasted five months in 1898. World War I lasted four years and just under five months.
