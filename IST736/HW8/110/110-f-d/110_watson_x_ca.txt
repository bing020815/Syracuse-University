<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (BIG OIL SPENDS MORE ON STOCK, LESS ON EXPLORATION -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, Americans are driving out of their way to fill up on the cheapest gas and are skipping summer vacations and important appointments because gas prices today are just too high. 
   And while Americans are paying record-high prices, Big Oil is reaping record-high profits. But instead of investing those profits for exploration on the 311 million acres of land open to new energy production, Big Oil spends their money on stock buybacks and dividends. 
   In 1993, oil companies spent only 1 percent of their profits on stocks. Last year, that number rose to 55 percent. And yet Big Oil continues to spend only in the single digits on finding new oil. It's no wonder that 68 million acres of land already leased to Big Oil sits undeveloped because Big Oil is spending all of its profits buying back its stock rather than searching for new oil. And yet House Republicans continue to allow Big Oil to get away with this. 
   Last week, for the second time, House Republicans could have forced Big Oil to use it or lose it, but once again, they sided with Big Oil. How high do prices have to get before House Republicans will join us in providing relief for the consumer?

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow this House will have the opportunity to send the Iraqi Government a strong message: They're now responsible for their own reconstruction funding. 
   As we debate a new war supplemental, Democrats are bringing an amendment to the floor that requires all Iraqi reconstruction costs to be provided on a dollar-for-dollar match. 
   To date, the United States has spent an estimated $46 billion in reconstruction costs in Iraq, all while our infrastructure is crumbling. The Iraqi Government is also currently working under a budget surplus, while, thanks to the Bush administration, we continue to face record deficits. 
   The amendment also requires the Iraqi Government to charge the U.S. military in Iraq the same discounted price for fuel that it charges everyday Iraqis. Another fair measure considering that the Iraqis are expected to take in a record $70 billion in oil revenues this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would hope that Democrats and Republicans could come together tomorrow to pass this common-sense amendment so that we can invest in America, rather than Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, we have lost Paulette Marie McFarland, 58, who was a trailblazer, an innovator in early childhood development, dying of pancreatic cancer on Tuesday, October 23, 2007, at her home in Chatsworth, California. 
   She was born Paulette Marie Mahan in Bluefield, West Virginia, on August 12, 1949. She received her bachelor's in early childhood education from Hampton University in Newport News, Virginia, and her master's in education from Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles, California. 
   Paulette taught in the Los Angeles Unified School System for 30 years and spent the majority of her tenure at Van Nuys Elementary. She received many accolades during her career, which included Teacher of the Year for her school region. Paulette served as a Master Teacher for student teachers for Cal State University, Northridge and University of California, Los Angeles. She participated in the Bilingual Teacher Classroom Program and reviewed the latest research in education  and applied that knowledge to her teaching strategies. 
   She always admired educators and their ability to create challenging and novel ways to encourage students in learning. As a bilingual teacher, she strove to make education an exciting, joyful, and motivational tool. She was one who is able to motivate and challenge students in a positive and stimulating manner where students are encouraged to reach their potential and value their own self-worth. She was that person. Most importantly, she was an outstanding teacher, and she was one who loved and enjoyed teaching. 
   Paulette believed some of the major challenges today are low achievers, child and drug abuse, gangs, and development learning disabilities. And she promoted the importance of the individual increase in parental involvement providing parent education, smaller classes, and tutoring programs as possible solutions. 
   Paulette was not only committed to her students and her family, but the community at large. For many years, she served on the planning committee for the NAACP Image Awards. She was an active fund-raiser for the Chrysalis Homeless Center, the United Negro College Fund, and other charitable organizations. She participated in the Literacy Campaign for the American Broadcasting Company, and volunteered in food and clothing drives. 
   For the last 2 years, Paulette served as scholarship chairperson for the San Diego African American Alumni Association, and with her husband, Roland, served as president for 4 years. She secured funding for more than 100 students, making it possible for them to pursue a college education. 
   On December 4, 1982, Paulette married Roland McFarland, vice president for broadcast standards and practices at Fox Broadcasting Company, at Hollywood Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, California. 
   Her memory lives on through her beloved husband, his children, Curtis McFarland and Roslyn Daniels; mother, Odessa Mahan; father, David Mahan; sisters Beverly Cummings and Margo Mahan; brother, Garner Mahan, and many cherished grandchildren, family, and a host of friends. May she, indeed, rest in peace.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, this week with pride the new Democratic House opens this congressional session by bringing ethics reform measures to the House floor that will sever the unhealthy ties between lawmakers and lobbyists. 
   We made a promise to the American people that we would drain the swamp of unethical behavior here in Washington, and we begin this Congress by living up to that promise by banning travel and gifts from lobbyists, getting tough on special interest earmarks, and ending the abusive processes that have destroyed democracy. 
   The American people sent us all a message last November. They want us to work for them and not for the special interests. I would hope that our agenda for reform would garner the support of both Democrats and Republicans. We should all be interested in policies that will ensure that the outrageous abuses of power that have taken place over the last couple of years do not continue. 
   These important reforms are only the beginning.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL STRATEGY IN CHAD AND DARFUR -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would first like to thank Representative Wolf and Chairman Payne for recognizing the importance of developing and implementing a strategy to resolve the crisis in Chad. 
   Chad has been politically unstable for over 40 years, suffering from civil  wars as well as ethnic and religious tensions. Human rights conditions remain notably poor, and the government lacks transparency and accountability. 
   In the past 3 years, as fighting between the government and rebels increased, 180,000 Chadians have been displaced, adding to the inflow of 290,000 refugees from the Central African Republic and Sudan's Darfur region. Although the government developed a plan for reform, and signed a peace agreement with rebel groups in 2007, the conflict has not ceased. 
   In February 2008, rebel forces, supported by the neighboring Sudanese government, sought to remove President Idriss D&#233;by from power, killing hundreds of civilians in the process. 
   The 16 U.N. refugee camps suffer from water and firewood shortages, as well as periodic attacks on aid workers. New controls imposed by the Chadian government on humanitarian organizations hinder the movement of assistance and personnel. 
   In September 2007 the U.N. Security Council, followed by the Council of the European Union, approved the presence of a multinational security force to facilitate assistance and create favorable conditions for reconstruction and development. 
   The United States has provided over $338 million in humanitarian assistance since 2004 and also provides security assistance to the Chadian Army through the International Military Education and Training funds. 
   It is imperative that the U.S. work harder to develop and implement a sound strategy to protect and assist Chadians and other refugees and, together with the international community, condemn Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and the National Congress for their support of the armed rebellion. Further destabilization in Chad will lead to wider regional instability and hinder the United States' counterterrorism capabilities in a very sensitive region. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to support this resolution that adds the House's voice to the chorus of condemnation from the administration and our European allies to the provocative actions taken in recent weeks by the Russian Federation against the Republic of Georgia. 
   I commend my distinguished colleague, Representative Wexler of Florida and chairman of the European Subcommittee, for promptly introducing this important resolution. 
   For several years, the Russian Government has promulgated policies that have increasingly sought to undermine the sovereignty of the Georgian Government and its territorial integrity over Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Such harmful policies include awarding residents in these regions with Russian citizenship, Russian passports, and even the right to vote in Russian elections. 
   In addition, the Kremlin has assigned Russian officials to hold positions in the separatist governments in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It has also provided military equipment and volunteer fighters to support militias active in these regions. Such behavior is counterproductive to efforts to find a peaceful resolution to these conflicts and contrary to Russia's commitments to international peacekeeping. 
   Irritated by international recognition of Kosovo's independence despite its objections and incensed by Georgia's clear future in NATO, Russia escalated its dangerous actions towards Georgia in the weeks leading up to and immediately following NATO's Bucharest Summit. On March 6, Russia withdrew from the sanctions regime imposed on Abkhazia in 1996 by the Commonwealth of Independent States thereby eliminating the remaining limits on direct Russian economic relations with Abkhazia. 
   On March 21, the Russian Duma passed a nonbinding declaration asking the government to consider the ``expediency of recognizing the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.'' On March 25, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's incoming president, spoke out against NATO membership for Georgia. During the NATO Summit, Russian President Putin sent letters to the separatist leaders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia to express his support for their regimes. 
   As outlined in this resolution, President Putin instructed his government on April 16 to establish official ties with these separatist regimes. He further ordered his government to recognize legal documents issued by these authorities as well as legal entities registered by them. The tension reached its climax on April 20 when an unarmed and unmanned Russian reconnaissance aircraft was shot down over Georgian territory, reportedly by a Russian MIG-29 fighter. Despite Russian claims of innocence, neither the Georgians nor the Abkhazian rebels have this plane in their fleet. 
   Last week Russia further strained relations by moving an extra contingent of troops into Abkhazia. The Kremlin claims to be responding to a Georgia military buildup along the border, which the Tbilisi Government denies. Although Russia's troop level remains within the 3,000 soldier limit allowed under the 1994 U.N. ceasefire agreement, NATO has backed Russia's assertion that any increase must be approved by all parties. 
   Such hostile actions are in stark contrast to the recent attempts made by Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili, to find a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict in the Caucasus. As he rightly stated, ``There are no issues that we and the Abkhazians cannot solve through negotiations.'' 
   On March 28 and April 12, President Saakashvili introduced new proposals to facilitate a resolution to the conflict. They included international guarantees of Abkhaz autonomy, broad political representation for the Abkhaz, the right to veto legislation related to the constitutional status of Abkhazia as well as its language and culture, and the establishment of a joint Free Economic Zone in the Gali region. President Putin has turned a deaf ear to these suggestions. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in calling on the Russian Federation to revoke immediately its decision to establish official ties with these regions and to support the territorial integrity of Georgia's borders. 
   Rather than engaging in provocative acts, President Putin should respond favorably to President Saakashvili's call for active involvement by the Russian Federation as well as the international community to forge a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict. 
   Furthermore, NATO should uphold its Summit promise to Georgia of a future in the Alliance by considering the extension of a Membership Action Plan at its December meeting. This act would welcome the country into the Euro-Atlantic community and could serve as a deterrent to further Russian aggression. I strongly support this resolution and urge my colleagues to join me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank my colleague Mr. Rush Holt for offering this important measure and for his tireless leadership in promoting human rights and democracy in Burma. 
   For more than a decade, the military regime in Burma has ignored the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people. As we saw in its bloody repression of last September's ``Saffron Revolution,'' the regime continues to trample on human rights. And it is squandering Burma's vast natural resources through spending on the regime and its weapons, while leaving the overwhelming majority of Burma's people in poverty. 
   Now the regime plans a May 10 referendum to institutionalize these policies through a sham constitution. The referendum attempts to give democratic legitimacy to a process that was designed by the Burmese military, implemented by the Burmese military, and benefits only the Burmese military. As such, it is anything but democratic. 
   Today, as Burma recovers from a devastating storm that left thousands dead and missing, with many more homeless, our sympathies are with the Burmese people. But it is not natural disasters but rather the yoke of the Burmese military that has left Burma's people impoverished and calling for greater political participation for more than 20 years. 
   It is especially appropriate that we stand with the Burmese people today as they face not only the devastation of the cyclone but also the continued devastation caused by this regime. Accordingly, I call on my colleagues to join me in condemning the Burmese junta's sham referendum and constitution. 
   By passing H. Con. Res. 317 today, we call on the administration, the United Nations, and the international community to support a legitimate, inclusive dialogue between the regime and opposition forces. Only such an inclusive tripartite negotiation can put Burma back on the path to peace and prosperity, where it rightfully belongs. 
   Please join me in support of H. Con. Res. 317 and offering support for restoration of real democracy in Burma. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Sires, for offering this important legislation in memory of a great American, Dith Pran. Through the film ``The Killing Fields,'' Dith Pran is for many Americans the face of the Cambodian genocide. That movie documented Dith Pran's personal struggle, his friendship and cooperation with New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg, and the larger horror of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia. 
   Much as ``The Killing Fields'' reminded Americans of the Cambodian genocide, Mr. Dith's life work as a photojournalist and U.N. goodwill ambassador raised awareness around the world of the atrocities that took place for those in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. 
   This resolution commemorates the work of Dith Pran's life, including his work as a photojournalist for the New York Times, his bravery in surviving the Cambodian genocide and escaping to Thailand in 1979; his advocacy for the Cambodian refugees and victims of genocide around the world after he became a U.S. citizen and a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations in 1994; and his work with former Senator Charles Robb to help pass the Cambodian Genocide Justice Act establishing an Office of Cambodian Genocide Investigations at the State Department. 
   Mr. Dith's work laid the foundation for ongoing justice and reconciliation tribunals within Cambodia that continue to this day.  
   For all these reasons, I support this resolution and urge my colleagues to join me as well.

   H.R. 3658 amends the Foreign Service Act to give the Secretary of State needed authority to ensure that foreign service officers from U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are provided the same benefits as their colleagues from the 50 States. 
   Currently, the State Department provides air transportation home from overseas assignments for the purpose of rest and recuperation to all foreign service officers who reside in any of the 50 States. However, current law does not permit the department to provide the same benefit to foreign service officers who reside in any of the territories. 
   The State Department has informed us that they do not have any objection to this measure. The cost of implementing it would be very small as it would impact very few foreign service officers. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution that would rectify an inequity in the treatment of our dedicated foreign service officers.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (60TH ANNIVERSARY OF INTEGRATION OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the integration of the U.S. Armed Forces. The policy that opened the door to full integration of the military was executive order 9981, signed by President Harry Truman on July 26, 1948. Despite the fact that President Truman signed this order, African Americans have served in this Nation's military with distinction since the Revolutionary War. 
   Some of the storied accomplishments of blacks in the military date back to the War of 1812. During the Battle of Lake Erie in September of 1813, which this event is depicted in a painting at the head of the east stairway in the Senate wing of the Capitol, nine small ships defeated a British squadron of six vessels, and due to the shortage of personnel, about 25 percent of the sailors involved were black. 
   During the Civil War in September, 1864, the Battle of New Market Heights was one of the last major fights before the war came to a conclusion. During the conflict, 14 blacks won the Congressional Medal of Honor for their bravery in the line of fire. This event marked the largest amount of blacks to receive the Medal of Honor for a single battle. This accomplishment has almost been left out of the history books, but today we recognize their honorable service and contributions to freedom. 
   During World War II in 1943 and 1944, a group of young determined black men who called themselves the Tuskegee Airmen, which my late first cousin, First Lieutenant Ira O'Neal, served as one of the original pilots, fought in the skies over North Africa and Europe with honor and with courage. The Airmen flew over 15,000 sorties and over 200 bomber escort missions. Some individuals have questioned their record of never losing a bomber to enemy fire, but, nevertheless, their accomplishments blazed a trail of fire towards integration in the Armed Forces. 
   Even after the signing of executive order 9981 in 1948, neither the Army nor the Navy planned to alter their existing racial policies, and it wasn't until October 30, 1954, when the Secretary of Defense finally announced that the last racial segregated unit in the Armed Forces of the United States had been abolished. 
   In April of 1948, there were only 41 black officers in the regular Army, and that was up from 8 in June of 1945. By the end of June, 1948, there were only 5 warrant officers and 65,000 black enlisted men and women. 
   During fiscal year 2004, the total strength of the Armed Forces was over 2.2 million people. Military demographics showed that African American men and women made up over 16,800 commissioned officers, more than 3,300 warrant officers and over 313,900 enlisted. At that time blacks made up 16.7 percent of the total strength of the Armed Forces. 
   We have come a long way as a Nation in 60 years to integrate the U.S. military. African Americans in defense of this Nation are now commanders of warships, advisers to Presidents, but there is still more work to be done in terms of diversity in the senior levels of military leadership. 
   Currently, less than 5 percent of officers at the rank of one star general and above are African American. As this Nation moves forward and we realize the future threats we will face, it is imperative that we tap into our full potential and give minorities opportunities to hold senior leadership roles in our military. 
   That is why I would like to thank Representatives Cummings, Meek, Johnson, and Castor of the House Armed Services Committee for sponsoring the Senior Military Leadership Diversity Commission. The commission will study the development of minorities to reach the general and flag officer ranks of the Armed Forces. 
   For many years blacks have fought on two fronts in their military careers. One front was on the battlefield in pursuit of freedom for our country, and the second front was on the city streets, where they fought against racism and discrimination. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues to further diversify the senior ranks of the military, and I look forward to the official celebration of the 60th anniversary of the integration of the Armed Forces in the Capitol rotunda. 
   And I would just like to add that our new superintendent of schools in Los Angeles is a former admiral, Admiral Brewer, and we're very proud to have him. Not an educator, but a well-proven military leader.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Ernest Gallo, who learned his craft of winemaking from a recipe in the basement of the Modesto public library with his brother Julio and with $5,900 of borrowed money, developed one of the largest wine empires in the world. They founded the E. & J. Gallo Winery in 1933 at the end of Prohibition. The Gallos rented a building and made an ordinary wine for 50 cents a gallon. They made $30,000 their first year of business. Mr. Ernest Gallo was an aggressive business leader who worked long hours and then went home and worked some more. His company made wines under more than 40 labels and employed 4,600 workers with wine sales in over 90 countries. 
   For decades the name ``Gallo'' was synonymous with inexpensive California wine. Mr. Gallo battled that image with advertisement; with humor; and to a large extent, by buying up wineries with more exclusive labels than his own company. 
   Robert Mondavi of Napa Valley, and a friend, said, ``Ernest was a visionary. He was committed to making America a wine-drinking country.'' 
   Mr. Gallo lived and breathed wine. He aired wine commercials on TV and participated on wine promotion boards. He chaired the Wine Institute and mentored generations of winemakers. He erected wine billboards and traveled the country checking on wine displays in supermarkets. He enjoyed drinking his own wines, particularly a product that morphed over years from ``red table wine'' to ``Cabernet Sauvignon.'' 
   Mr. Gallo had an uncanny talent for tapping into consumer tastes with sweet products such as Boone's Farm, which was so popular in the 1970s, which caused a worldwide shortage in the apple concentrate it was made from, and other products like Ripple and Thunderbird. 
   He moved upscale in 1974, introducing high-quality, cork-finished varietal wines, but the venture failed. He also developed E. & J. brandy and Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers. Additionally, Mr. Gallo developed its Gallo of Sonoma line and began buying upscale competitors, including the Mirassou and Louis M. Martini labels, and introducing foreign brands Ecco and other types of wine. 
   Mr. Gallo died unexpectedly in his Modesto home on March 6 of this year. He lived to the ripe old age of 97. And his brother Julio Gallo passed in 1993. 
   I commend the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza) for introducing H. Con. Res. 88, honoring the life of Ernest Gallo, and I urge its swift passage.

   On October 31, 2003, somewhere in the Iraqi desert between Fallujah and Baghdad, First Lieutenant Todd Jason Bryant was killed when his Humvee was struck head-on by a rocket-propelled grenade. His life was taken instantly at age 23. He was assigned to C Company, 1-34 AR where he assumed duties as platoon leader, 3rd Platoon.     
   First Lieutenant Todd Bryant received the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon for his distinguished service to his country. 
   First Lieutenant Todd Bryant is survived by his wife, Jenifer, his parents, Larry and Linda Bryant, his brother, Major Timothy Bryant, USMC, and his sister, Tiffany Bryant. 
   The memory of this jovial fun-loving man will live on forever through his family and friends. Jenifer Bryant said, ``There was a lot more to him than just a soldier. He was my best friend. His goal in life was to make people think that he was the most hilarious man alive.''

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, the importance of financial and fiscal responsibility cannot be overstated. Personal financial literacy is essential to ensure that individuals are prepared to manage money, credit and debt and become responsible workers, heads of households, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders and citizens. That is why I am pleased to support H. Res. 273. 
   Personal savings as a percentage of personal income decreased from 7.5 percent in the early 1980s to a negative 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2005. 
   As the resolution notes, 92 percent of college students acquire at least one credit card by their second year in college, yet only 26 percent of people between the ages of 13 and 21 reported that their parents actively taught them how to manage money. 
   The Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy seeks to improve the personal financial literacy of young adults. Jump$tart's purpose is to evaluate the financial literacy of young adults and to develop, disseminate and encourage the use of financial education standards for grades K-12 and promote the teaching of personal finance. 
   To that end, Jump$tart has established 12 must-know personal financial principles for young people to improve their financial future. These 12 principles should be followed by adults as well. 
   The 12 financial principles stressed during the Financial Literacy Month for Youth are map your financial future; 
   Do not expect something for nothing, and high returns equal high risk; 
   Know your take-home pay, compare interest rates, pay yourself first, and money doubles by the rule of 72; to determine how long it would take your money to double, divide the interest into 72; 
   And your credit past is your credit future; 
   Start saving young, stay insured, budget your money, do not borrow what you cannot repay, and let me add one more thing, pay all your taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this resolution supporting the goals of Financial Literacy Month and urge all my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 71, to commemorate the 85th anniversary of the founding of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, a leading association for 1.3 million American citizens of Greek ancestry, and Philhellenes. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution, and I thank Mrs. Maloney for her leadership as the author of the resolution and as one of the Chairs of the Congressional Hellenic Caucus. 
   The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, known as AHEPA, was born out of the cruelty and subjugation imposed upon many minorities by hate groups during the early 20th century. The organization was founded in Atlanta in 1922 to respond to growing attacks on Greek Americans and Greek American businesses by the Ku Klux Klan. It has since grown to become the largest and oldest American-based, Greek-heritage grass-roots membership organization.  
   AHEPA's initial interests were to cultivate Greek-owned businesses and help its members assimilate into American culture. Today, AHEPA's mission is to carry the legacy of Greek culture throughout generations. The organization continues to do this through diversification, language immersion and educational enrichment. AHEPA is known for its philanthropic resources which fund equal opportunity housing, hospitals, specialty schools and academic scholarships. 
   While AHEPA primarily is a membership organization for Greek Americans or Americans of Greek descent, membership is open to all Americans who support the organization's mission. This is the finest tradition of Philhellenism, and reminds us that the modern relationship between the people of America and of Greece was forged by their parallel struggles for freedom from foreign tyranny, and by the inspiration we both take from the democracy first developed centuries ago in Greece. 
   For 85 years the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association has remained an organization that embodies the true meaning of America. I commend AHEPA, and ask that my colleagues support this commendation. I urge all my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 71. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, Congress will take up a continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government after September 30. While the House has passed all 12 of its appropriation bills, Senate Republicans continue to obstruct efforts to finish the process over in the other Chamber, making the continuing resolution necessary. 
   In our appropriations bills, we rejected the President's most harmful cuts and made targeted investments in veterans care, education, health care, homeland security, and law enforcement. And we did this all by remaining fiscally responsible. 
   This is something new around here. Past Republican Congresses refused to abide by the pay-as-you-go philosophy. As a result, they turned a $5.6 trillion 10-year surplus under the Clinton administration into a $3 trillion deficit today. 
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan summarizes the Republican stewardship of the Federal budget best when he states in his new book: ``The Republicans in Congress lost their way.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats will continue to be fiscally responsible.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of this resolution. As one of the co-Chairs of the bipartisan United Kingdom Caucus, I am honored to have the opportunity to speak in support of H. Res. 416, a resolution saluting the public service of Tony Blair, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. 
   I would first like to commend our distinguished colleague, Mr. Peter King of New York, for introducing this timely resolution that pays tribute to the remarkable political career of one of America's strongest allies. 
   Two days from now, Prime Minister Tony Blair will leave 10 Downing Street for the last time. He will be leaving behind a legacy of domestic reform and international activism. His successor, Gordon Brown, praised his accomplishments and told him that ``Whatever we achieve in the future will be because we are standing on your shoulders.'' 
   Mr. Blair was first elected to Parliament in 1983 and served as Prime Minister for over a decade, securing a place in the record books as the only Labor leader to have won three successive elections. 
   Mr. Blair has been a strong and steadfast ally of the United States throughout his time in office. No American will ever forget the solidarity he expressed on behalf of our British cousins in the days following the devastating terrorist attacks of  9/11, when he announced, ``We were with you at the first. We will stay with you to the last.'' 
   Mr. Blair was the first foreign leader to visit Ground Zero. He further demonstrated his support by sitting in this Chamber during President Bush's speech before a joint session of Congress 2 weeks later. 
   American hearts went out to Mr. Blair and the British people in July of 2005 when cheers of celebration over London's successful Olympic bid turned to tears of mourning following the devastating terrorist attack on the city's public transportation system. 
   Domestically, Mr. Blair was unwavering in his commitment to securing a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Blair aided the negotiations that led to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement on April 10, 1998. This momentous agreement brought all communities into the governmental process, providing a framework in which the ballot box replaced the bomb as a means of political expression. 
   During his final months in office, Mr. Blair witnessed the fruits of his labor as age-old enemies Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionist Party and Martin McGuiness of Sinn Fein took their places as first and deputy first ministers in the restored Northern Ireland Assembly. Mr. Blair welcomed the opportunity for Northern Ireland to ``escape the heavy chains of history'' and ``make history anew.'' 
   It is appropriate that this House recognizes the outstanding public service of Tony Blair during his decade as Britain's Prime Minister and thank him for his unfailing friendship during our Nation's time of greatest need. 
   I strongly support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be the author, with my good friend, Darrell Issa, of this resolution to honor the life of a great American and dear friend, Jack Valenti. Both Washington and Hollywood lost an icon in April with the passing of Jack Valenti. For nearly four decades, Jack served as the public face of Hollywood as the head of the Motion Picture Association of America where he was most famous for creating the film rating system we use today. 
   Jack's career as a public servant began during World War II when he flew B-25 bombers for the United States Army Air Force. After the war, Jack served as one of President Lyndon Johnson's closest advisers. Jack left the White House after several years to become a pioneer in the entertainment industry. Joining MPAA in 1966, Jack created the movie rating system that we use today. Jack served as one of Washington's most effective lobbyists, moving easily between Hollywood and Washington as the president of the MPAA for 38 years. 
   After his tenure at the Motion Picture Association, Jack joined the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria as a final mission in his extraordinary life and committed himself to working tirelessly to increase the quality of life of those suffering from the devastating effects of disease and poverty across the globe. He served as a relentless spokesman for disease-devastated communities across the globe while navigating the Halls of Congress with statesmanlike agility to ensure that the United States increased its funding to the Global Fund to fight AIDS and to fight tuberculosis and malaria and other programs that save lives. 
   Not only has the global health community lost a great advocate, but so has the entertainment industry and Washington lost a truly great friend. 
   So I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, every day the Bush White House is losing more credibility with the American people and with the Congress. Late last year the Justice Department fired eight U.S. Attorneys for purely political reasons. Last week, Attorney General Gonzales came to Capitol Hill and swore that the terminations had nothing to do with politics. But then 2 days ago we learned that these decisions were not made exclusively by the Justice Department. The political purge reached the highest levels at the White House and was actually prompted by President Bush. So much for no political involvement from the White House. 
   Mr. Speaker, this information would have never come out if the new Democratic Congress did not take its oversight responsibility seriously. U.S. Attorneys should be free of political pressure and that is simply not the case with the Bush White House. 
   We will continue to demand answers from an administration that is not too interested in working with Congress. It would be nice if they would finally learn their lesson and realize that it is time to level with both the Congress and the American people.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, it was with great sorrow that I learned of the passing of my dear friend and constituent, Tina Allen. Tina dedicated her life to documenting the spirit of black Americans through her sculptures. 
   Each of her subjects, famous or not, were her way of writing our history in bronze. As an artist, she was an inspiration. As a person, she was a beacon of life as she brought to life the features of great people. 
   She often said that ``great people should have great monuments.'' Her work includes abolitionist Frederick Douglass at the African American Museum of Birmingham and featured in the movie, ``Akeelah and the Bee''; Rev. Martin Luther King in Las Vegas, Nevada; botanist George Washington Carver at the St. Louis Botanical Garden; Sojourner Truth, City Hall Park, Battle Creek, Michigan; and more recently, entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr.     
   Tina worked on projects big and small. She was best known for her monumental statue of ``Roots'' author, Alex Haley, which was installed at Haley's Heritage Park in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1998. Her hands were able to create life-like images from simple mounds of clay. As a result of her work, Tina was interviewed as a featured artist on the ``Best of CBS Sunday Morning.'' 
   Ms. Allen was a child prodigy in sculpture and at age 11 was taken under the wing of internationally renowned abstract sculptor, William Zorach. After earning her BFA from the University of South Alabama in Mobile, she continued her studies in New York and also in Italy. 
   To her family and friends, I extend my sincerest condolences on their loss. Her sculptures will live on as a testament and inspiration to others. She will be sorely missed, but forever remembered. 
   And Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield the remaining part of my time to the distinguished Congresswoman from California, MAXINE WATERS.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2929. 
   From the beginning of the President's invasion and occupation of Iraq, he has insisted that the United States has no intention of permanently occupying that country. I think there is no better way to reassure both our friends and our adversaries that the United States does not intend to become an imperial occupier of Iraq than to make clear that the U.S. will not build permanent military bases there. 
   The American people are seeking clear assurance that their government has a plan for leaving Iraq. If the President fails to embrace this legislation, it would only confirm for many Americans that the President has no strategy for bringing our troops home and, in fact, intends to keep them there forever. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I hope the President will listen to the American people and sign it into law.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, as you just heard, this week House Democrats unveiled the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act, a bill that reauthorizes SCHIP, ensures millions of children receive the care they need, and protects Medicare for America's seniors. 
   The introduction of the CHAMP program comes days after the National Governors Association, made up of both Democrats and Republicans, called for urgent action to reauthorize the SCHIP program. Unfortunately, while strengthening SCHIP has broad bipartisan support from our Nation's Governors and in the U.S. Senate, the Bush administration and some congressional Republicans oppose efforts to strengthen the program so it does not continuously run out of money. Instead, they are proposing to underfund the program significantly, which would cause millions of children to lose coverage. 
   Mr. Speaker, insuring America's children is an affordable goal. It costs less than $3.50 a day to cover a child through SCHIP.

   We didn't hear the Vice President disputing his place in the executive branch when he claimed executive privilege at congressional attempts to have Cheney make public his energy task force members. 
   No, Cheney is once again trying to do an end-run around the rules. Last week the House Oversight Committee learned that Cheney had exempted his office from the Presidential order that establishes government-wide procedures for safeguarding classified national security information. 
   Editorials nationwide are decrying Cheney's actions. The Kansas City Star said that this is another example of his ``insistence on secrecy and his disdain for open government.'' USA Today said there was ``no surer way for leaders to get the country in trouble than to mix arrogance with secrecy.''

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, today Democrats will bring forward the final piece of legislation in the Six for 06 for America, the Clean Energy Act of 2007. This bill is vital in assuring the American taxpayers that the government will close loopholes and end giveaways in the tax code for major oil companies. 
   In my work as Ranking Member on the Government Reform Subcommittee on Energy and Resources in the 109th Congress, I worked closely with my colleague DARRELL ISSA in investigating the overlooked but serious problems with the oil and gas royalty programs. The mismanagement of several of these leases potentially could cost America's taxpayers nearly twenty billion in royalties over the next 25 years because of errors in drafting the leases. 
   Had the leases been negotiated properly, it is estimated that the government would have collected an additional $700 million in royalties in 2005 alone. Do the math. These funds would allow one American family to fill their Dodge Caravan minivan over 12 million times, even with the high gas prices we are facing now. 
   Madam Speaker, our citizens should not pay for bureaucratic mistakes nor should they suffer the consequences of this administration not holding these companies accountable. H.R. 6 will be a start to fixing this and many other examples of government mismanagement in the energy sector. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time for us to promote energy legislation that will lead to positive outcomes for the economy and the environment while protecting taxpayers and consumers. H.R. 6 does this and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, the escalation of the conflict in Iraq is an exercise in futility. It has been 3 years now since the President declared that our original mission was accomplished in Iraq. 
   And then the President let victory escape from our grasp. He confused the toppling of Saddam Hussein with accomplishing the mission. 
   But there is a more important question being raised here on the House floor. It is an issue which has confused our mission in Iraq from the beginning. And it is the preposterous argument that Iraq is part of the war against al Qaeda. 
   The al Qaeda attack on America killed almost 3,000 innocent Americans in New York, at the Pentagon, and in a field outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. We pursued al Qaeda into Afghanistan, dislodged the Taliban and cornered Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora. We had al Qaeda on the run. We had the world united against terror and in favor of freedom and democracy. 
   But then the President switched his focus at a critical time. He dismissed the factors which had brought success in Afghanistan, a just cause, clear evidence, and a community of nations, and instead pursued his Iraqi adventure based on faulty intelligence and employing a strategy rejected by his own Army Chief of Staff and numerous other generals. 
   Thus, the President gave al Qaeda breathing room; he let them regroup, because he lost focus on the war on al Qaeda, to wage war on Iraq. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, al Qaeda and the Taliban regrouped. 
   Iraq is not the central front in the war on al Qaeda. Iraq is a distraction from the war on al Qaeda. Each day we spend in Iraq is a day we are not working to bring the perpetrators of 9/11 to justice. 
   Whatever happened to Osama bin Laden? Why aren't we looking for him? 
   We have a direct connection to 9/11. The families of those who perished on 9/11 are still waiting for an answer. 
   This escalation is an appalling display of our weakness. We are sending only 21,000 combat troops to Iraq because, after stretching our military thin for 4 years, that is all the troops we have available at the moment. 
   The President cannot tell us what victory is or when he hopes to achieve it. What is really our goal in Iraq? What are we trying to achieve? And are we going to leave this mess for the next President? 
   Today, Iraq is consumed by civil war. Her neighbors, including our allies, Jordan, Kuwait and Turkey, are overwhelmed with refugees, and Iran is strengthened and emboldened. If that is not already destabilized, then the word truly has no meaning. 
   The occupation itself is what is destabilizing Iraq. The occupation is placing Americans on the killing fields. The occupation undermines American prestige and authority, and the occupation in Iraq makes it harder to defeat al Qaeda. 
   The military battle is over. Our only hope is to change course, to acknowledge the reality that we have lost the military struggle in Iraq. Only then can we reengage with a strategy to give us a political victory. 
   We must remove our forces and move forward with a political and diplomatic strategy to engage both our allies and our adversaries in the region. This will mean talking to Iran, not capitulating to Iran. Even at the height of the Cold War, Reagan was willing to talk to Moscow. Until we are willing to engage with Iran, our friends in the Middle East, who fear Iranian dominance as much as we do, will not believe we are serious about confronting the Iranian threats. 
   Last, and most appalling, is the desperation accusation that we are going to cut off funds for our troops. Simply not true. 
   This attack is especially galling when it has been a Republican Congress and a Republican President who, for 4 years, left our troops vulnerable, without proper equipment, without proper armor, and in an effort to fight this war on the cheap. 
   I will never vote to leave our troops without the support they need. But neither will I vote to continue down a path that is putting them at needless risk. 
   Vote for this bill.

   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, in June of 2006, the Bush administration announced a new plan for securing Baghdad by increasing the presence of Iraq security forces. That plan failed. 
   In July, additional U.S. troops are moved in. By October, the Pentagon was admitting that the plan to secure Baghdad had failed. In the fall of 2005, the Bush administration increased troop levels by 22,000 around the time of the elections, and the escalation had little long-term impact on quelling sectarian violence. 
   The New York Times had a story by a young troop member in Baghdad yesterday. You need to read it, because it talked about how the snipers killed one of their buddies and how they went in to get his body out and to get his helmet, and the blood spilled down the clothing of the rescuers. 
   This is happening every day because we are fighting a war with an unknown enemy in the middle of sectarian violence. It must stop.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, thanks to a 4-month investigation by the Washington Post, the world learned last week that our Nation's injured soldiers are not receiving the care they deserve once they return from active duty. 
   The Post investigation described conditions at Walter Reed Hospital that are deplorable. One of the buildings at the facility, Building 18, showed signs of neglect everywhere: mouse droppings, cockroaches, stained carpets, cheap mattresses and mold on the ceilings. After the Post printed its findings last week, the Pentagon finally started renovating Building 18, but it should not have taken the embarrassment of this investigation for the Pentagon to do the right thing. 
   American soldiers who have put their lives on the line for this Nation deserve better than what they are getting at Building 18. The Pentagon says it was forced into housing hundreds of troops there after all the other buildings were filled to capacity, and now the President wants to send more troops to Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. I'd like to thank STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES for providing this opportunity for us to remember someone that I considered a dear friend before I came to the House. I met JULIA in the 70s, and we bonded together because we were active in the National Conference of State Legislators, the Black Caucus. We were the two women in the Senate. And once you meet JULIA, you never forget her. She had that kind of impact on you. 
   And I remember her sitting up in the back with her head hanging very low. And she looked up and she saw, you know, I'd say, how are you feeling JULIA, and she'd say, oh, great. Well, you knew she wasn't feeling great. 
   But she said, you know, I want to go on a codel. So I'm taking my own codel because no one here will take me with them. That was JULIA. 
   And then I remember going out and she was standing against one of the pillars outside and hardly able to stand. I said, well, JULIA, let me stand with you. She said, no, I'm holding on. My staff is coming after me. She was the can-do-it person. And regardless how bad the time was, she never let you know. 
   She was the second one that went out with dignity and class and grace. And I knew that the time would not be long, because I called her office and I talked to her chief of staff; and when he said he was sitting at her bedside, I knew then that she wouldn't be back. 
   And I saw JULIA, like all of you did, as a leader, a crusader, a humanist. She understood racism and oppression, but she was never deterred by it. It only made her more of a leader, more of a crusader and more humanistic. 
   As a former Congressman, Andy Jacobs relates in JULIA's official biography, and I quote the Congressman: ``The only thing some people learn from oppression is hatred and revenge. Others learn compassion and empathy. From the physical pain of material poverty and the mindlessly cruel persecution of knee jerk racism, JULIA CARSON made her choice to be hard work, compassion and an engulfing sense of humor.'' It is therefore fitting that in 1996, JULIA CARSON took on the task of seeking the Congressional Gold Medal for another pioneer in the struggle for human rights, Rosa Parks.     
   It took nearly 3 years, but JULIA did not go and she did not falter. In June of 1999, President Clinton signed into law Congresswoman JULIA CARSON's bill to authorize the Congressional Gold Medal for Rosa Parks, and we all came to be part of that experience.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, Americans continue to suffer pain at the gas pump due to 7 years of missed opportunities and outdated policies. President Bush's energy strategy was literally written by the oil companies--give more public resources to the same oil companies that are raking in record profits while Americans are reeling from record prices. 
   Every day we hear House Republicans demanding the need for more domestic drilling in order to reduce gas prices. What we don't hear is anyone on that side of the aisle demanding that Big Oil drill on the 68 million acres of land they are sitting on, refusing to develop. 
   Legislation on the floor today will force those oil companies to produce oil and gas or diligently develop the 68 million acres of public land they already have, otherwise they will lose the leases. Experts estimate that these reserves could produce an additional 4.8 million barrels of oil.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me first thank our colleague from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) for introducing this important resolution. For years, the United Nations has attempted to reduce the potential for conflict on Cyprus and to heal and reunify that long-divided island. 
   Last year, Under Secretary of the United Nations Ibrahim Gambari potentially made progress towards resolving this issue. Thanks to his efforts, the Greek and Turkish Cypriots signed an agreement on July 8, 2006, that sets out principles forming the basis for a future permanent agreement. 
   Mr. Speaker, these important principles include, first and foremost, recognition that the status quo, with a divided island, is unacceptable. They also include a commitment to unification based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation; a commitment to form intercommunal working groups aimed at achieving confidence-building measures to improve daily lives on both sides of the island; and a commitment to promote a positive atmosphere that would allow negotiations to thrive. 
   All of us hope that the July 8, 2006, agreement between the Greek and the Turkish Cypriot communities will prove to be an important step on the road to reunification of Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal federation. The pace of the progress must accelerate. To date, it has been, at best, halting. But both parties have at least renewed their pledge to work towards a negotiated agreement. 
   Mr. Speaker, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1758 expresses full support for the July 8, 2006, agreement. I hope the Members of this body will reinforce that message by backing this bill, and thereby backing the unification of Cyprus. The resolution before us, H. Res. 405, expresses its support for the immediate implementation of the July 8, 2006, agreement, and it calls on the administration to support it as well.     
   Mr. Speaker, the people of Cyprus deserve our encouragement and our support in their efforts to prepare for new talks aimed at reunification, and that is exactly what this resolution seeks to do. I strongly support it, and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I would like to thank Chairman Lantos, as well as my friend Mr. Bilirakis as, I think, acting in place of the ranking member (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for helping me to move this bill to the floor. 
   I am proud to be the author of H.R. 2553, the Public Diplomacy Resource Centers Act of 2007. This bill is designed to provide our diplomats abroad with additional tools to show the world the best of American society. In the 110th Congress, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is working to help redeem the status and prestige that the United States has lost around the world in recent years. 
   While U.S. foreign policy clearly is a key factor in how we are viewed  abroad, other factors are also critical to how the United States is viewed around the world. An important point of regaining our rightful leadership role is to find more effective ways to let the world know who we are as Americans and what we stand for. 
   One of the most effective elements of American public policy is the array of libraries and information resource centers around the globe. The facilities run by our State Department provide people in foreign countries the ability to freely access information about the United States, about their own societies, and about science and the arts. For years, these resources have been a testament to the principle that the greatest tool we have against tyranny is the truth. 
   But as we face this moment of tighter budgets, I am afraid that our public diplomacy libraries and resource centers are not getting the support they need. 
   That is why I have introduced this bill. The bill would not seek to disrupt the efforts that the State Department has under way to organize and run its resource centers. Rather, it would seek to put these efforts on a more stable footing by creating a clear funding stream for the State Department libraries and resource centers abroad. 
   Furthermore, the bill would establish the Johnny Grant film series as part of the State Department's public diplomacy effort. Johnny Grant is a legendary friend of American entertainment and is known as the honorary mayor of Hollywood for his continued efforts on behalf of the American entertainment industries. He is also an ardent proponent of the power of American film to convey the universal values of freedom and opportunity to others around the world. As of this year, he will have made his 60th trip abroad to entertain our troops.     
   By the way, he traveled with Bob Hope often. The Johnny Grant Film Series would provide the United States Government with the opportunity to show the world the optimism and promise of America as portrayed in our classic films. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank both my chairman, Tom Lantos, as well as my cosponsor, the ranking member, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for their extraordinary efforts to help me move this legislation forward. I would also like to specifically thank David Abramowitz and Lynne Weil of the majority staff, and Doug Anderson and Sam Stratman of the Republican staff for the kind consideration they showed to me and my staff as we sought to move this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (EXPANDING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND BRAZIL -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would first like to thank our colleagues, Congressman ELIOT ENGEL and DAN BURTON, for introducing this important resolution. Their leadership on Brazil-related matters is greatly appreciated. 
   Mr. Speaker, Brazil has the largest economy, population, and land mass in South America. It is the fifth most populous country in the world, and its economy is the 11th largest. It is high time we recognize, as this resolution does, the expanding strategic relationship between the United States and Brazil. 
   We in America are finally waking up not only to Brazil's importance, but to how natural this relationship should be. Brazil is also the right country with which to cooperate on alternative energy sources. 
   This resolution commends Brazil on successfully reducing its dependence on oil by finding alternative ways to satisfy its energy needs and recognizes the importance of the March 9, 2007, U.S.-Brazil memorandum of understanding on biofuels cooperation. 
   The agreement promotes greater cooperation on ethanol and biofuels between the world's two largest ethanol-producing countries. Brazil has become the world's largest consumer and producer of ethanol from sugar cane. By the end of 2006, 80 percent of new-car sales in Brazil were flex-fuel, meaning they can run on a mixture of ethanol and gasoline. 
   Furthermore, ethanol supplies 40 percent of the motor fuel used in Brazil and is extremely competitive with gasoline. We as Americans can learn a great deal from Brazil and they from us as we try to reduce their dependence on oil and diversify our energy resources. The U.S. and Brazil are providing technical assistance to build biofuels industries in Third World countries, including the Dominican Republic, Haiti, El Salvador, St. Kitts, and Nevis. 
   It is also important to note that Brazil, through its leadership of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and other achievements, has emerged as a regional leader in the Western Hemisphere, a role this resolution recognizes for Brazil. 
   Brazil's leadership in the Americas and throughout the world signals the emergence of a vital partner and friend to the United States. That is why I  strongly urge all Members to support this important resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (TROPICAL FOREST CONSERVATION ACT OF 1998 AMENDMENTS -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the Tropical Forest Conservation Act Reauthorization bill and urge my colleagues to do so as well. I would particularly like to recognize the efforts of Congressman MARK KIRK, the sponsor of H.R. 2185. Congressman Kirk is a long-time champion of this innovative debt-for-conservation program. Mr. Kirk's legislation extends and expands a vitally important environmental initiative launched during the Clinton administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, over the past 9 years this program has resulted in 12 Tropical Forest Conservation Act agreements in Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South America. These agreements have provided $135 million to help conserve 50 million acres of tropical forests. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act has become one of the most effective foreign policy tools that the executive branch has at its disposal to encourage developing states to take action to protect and preserve tropical forests.  
   The program has been a tremendous success. It has provided needed funding to actively pursue debt swaps, buybacks, and debt restructuring with developing nations in return for concrete expenditures aimed at protecting vital natural resources. This mechanism inspires more prompt debt servicing and gives foreign governments a greater sense of responsibility for preserving the global heritage. 
   H.R. 2185 would expand the program in a very significant way by extending its debt-relief-for-conservation mechanism to expenditures aimed at protecting coral reefs and sensitive marine environments. Coral reefs and coastal marine environments provide a host of benefits to humankind. They harbor a major share of the world's marine biological diversity, and act as vital nurseries and seeding grounds for many sensitive deep sea species. They also provide the foundation for economic, social and recreational activities of immeasurable value. 
   Mr. Speaker, coral reefs are extremely sensitive treasures. However, the shocking reports of wide-scale coral bleaching that has occurred around the globe in recent years should serve as a wake-up call for all of us. Urgent action is needed to mitigate the contributions that human activities are making to this problem. 
   H.R. 2185 provides just the kind of creative, targeted and mutually beneficial assistance that is clearly required to tackle this important ecological threat. H.R. 2185 will also enable more key countries to participate in the program. Currently, in order to qualify for the Act's mutually beneficial mechanism, a country must have an IMF agreement in place. Under the new language, eligibility would also extend to nations that are implementing sound macroeconomic policies. 
   Mr. Speaker, the executive branch has partnered with us in crafting this reauthorization, and has expressed its interest in seeing it pass this year. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I learned of the loss of our colleague and four-term Representative, Jo Ann Davis, who represented Virginia's First District, referred to as America's First District. She was a great leader and a tireless advocate for all of her constituents. And for those of us who came in after her, I remember she organized a WeightWatchers class, saw that we were there every week, and that we followed the procedure for weight watching. She said, Now, be sure to weigh yourself so that you can see what kind of progress you are making. But I want you to know, I don't weigh myself because I don't think I am progressing. 
   Jo Ann was first in many ways. As the first elected female Republican from the Commonwealth, she set an example for women across the country who aspire to political office. She worked tirelessly on behalf of our men and women in uniform and the many Federal civil servants in her congressional district and succeeded in introducing and passing legislation that benefited these important constituencies. 
   We all know that we lost our colleague to breast cancer. I remember going over to her when we heard that Juanita Millender-McDonald was taking a leave, and the women's caucus wanted to send greetings, and I asked her if she would be the first. She looked at me and she said, No, because on that day, Friday, I take my chemo and I am very sick afterwards. So I said, Well, I understand. I just thought the two of you had much in common and that you could inspire her. We know that it is such a devastating disease that takes away our loved ones too quickly. I don't know at the time if it was in Jo Ann's mind, but she never let on. She seemed to be very secretive about her personal self. 
   So, as a reminder, this is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and I think it is so appropriate that we salute her and her life because she lived so well and influenced so many people and was really a symbol for how to deal with the condition that she had and she was challenged by. 
   Our colleague will be sorely missed, not only here, but in her home district where her constituents knew that she represented them with excellence, integrity, and tenacity. We all mourn her loss, our friend and colleague. I send my most heartfelt condolences to her family, staff, and her many close friends here on Capitol Hill and in Virginia.

   On behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise for the consideration of H. Res. 1152, which pays tribute to Arnold Palmer for both his distinguished golfing career and his dedication to excellence and sportsmanship. 
   H. Res. 1152 was coauthored by Congressman Ferguson of New Jersey and Congressman Baca of California, and is cosponsored by 83 Members of Congress. The bill before us was first introduced on April 24, 2008, and was taken up by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on May 15, 2008, where the measure was amended and then passed by voice vote. 
   A native of Western Pennsylvania, Arnold Palmer is regarded as one of the greatest golfers in the history of the professional sport of golf, winning over 90 PGA tour titles since the mid 1950s, and 62 champion tour wins since 1980. Arnold Palmer became the face of televised golf in America, and even today his talents and accomplishments in the sport of golf continue to set the standard for many, including the greats of today, such as Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh.     
   Nicknamed ``The King,'' Arnold Palmer has demonstrated excellence both on and off of the golf course by establishing the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Florida, and the Arnold Palmer Pavilion at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
   Mr. Speaker, in honor of the contributions Mr. Palmer has made to the world of golf and the landscape of America, I urge the adoption of H. Res. 1152.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I stand in support of H.R. 5787, the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act, which is a sensible, bipartisan effort to address some of the problems with the current Federal property disposal process. 
   There are three key provisions in this bill. The first allows the General Services Administration to help pay the cost of other agencies' disposal activities. In particular, GSA will be able to help agencies pay costs with regard to properties that have yet to be declared excess. These costs include environmental cleanup, demolition, surveying, and life cycle costing. 
   Another key provision modifies existing law to make clear that when a property has been transferred to a nonprofit organization or a State or local government for a public purpose and that public purpose is no longer being met, the property must revert to the Federal Government, which must dispose of it. 
   The final major provision allows all agencies to retain the proceeds from the sale of Federal surplus properties. These proceeds will be used for disposal activities such as developing and implementing a plan to identify and declare properties excess, appraisals, utilization studies, and life cycle planning. The Office of Management and  Budget has stated that allowing agencies to retain the proceeds will provide agencies with the funds necessary to cover upfront costs associated with disposals. 
   This bill does not waive any existing law regarding the screening process and therefore does not affect the access of homeless providers or State and local communities to these properties. 
   I want to commend Representatives Moore and Duncan for introducing this bill. I also want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis for their dedication to this issue for many years.

Their service is crucial to the protection of Americans everywhere, and their daily sacrifice is what helps to guarantee our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   H. Res. 1132 was introduced by Ted Poe of Texas on April 22, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2008 by voice vote. This legislative measure has the support of over 65 Members of Congress, and its principal purpose is to show our appreciation for the risk that 900,000-plus sworn law enforcement officers face daily in their service to communities throughout the United States. 
   In this past year alone, our country has lost over 180 law enforcement officers in the line of duty, and while just last week many of their fellow officers descended upon our Nation's Capital for National Police Week in remembrance of these fallen heroes, today, we, in the Congress also take a moment to express our gratitude for these courageous Americans by recognizing Peace Officers Memorial Day. 
   Therefore, it is with humble gratitude that we salute and we thank our country's peace officers, as well as remember those officers who gave their life in service and protection of ours.

   Mr. Speaker, more than 1.5 million U.S. troops have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and according to an Army study, 20 percent are showing signs of post-traumatic stress syndrome. But surprisingly, most VA police officers do not receive any training on how to deal with patients suffering from mental illness. That is why we must prepare VA law enforcement officers to deal with the tens of thousands of veterans returning from Iraq that are expected to utilize VA medical centers for mental health services. 
   H.R. 1853, the Jose Medina Veterans Affairs Police Training Act, will ensure that our veterans are treated with dignity and respect when they seek treatment at VA facilities. Veterans' mental health needs should be one of this Congress' top priorities, and I urge your support.

   Improving the COPS program is very important to the constituents I represent in California's 33rd Congressional District. If this bill passes, my district alone will get at least 25 new police officers, an additional school resource officer, along with more funding to be used for technology in Los Angeles' law enforcement agencies. 
   Mr. Speaker, today our children are killing one another in my district at an appalling rate. The Los Angeles Police Department recorded 7,714 gang crimes in 2006, a 14 percent jump over the previous year. I believe we need to take a comprehensive approach to combating gang violence and ensure that our youth have safe, quality schools that give them an alternative to the streets. 
   But there is one action we can take right now that will immediately reduce the level of violence and protect our kids, and that is to put more police on the streets. 
   We have the bill here today that does just that, the COPS Improvements Act, and I urge colleagues to support this measure.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, April 4, will mark the date that Martin Luther King departed and went for his just rewards. I have a theory that messengers are sent to Earth to make us better human beings. And if you go back in history, Jesus Christ left early in his thirties, the Kennedy brothers left early in their thirties, and Martin Luther King, after he had done his work, left us. 
   And so we are very fortunate to be able to participate in a service today honoring the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   I would like to pay tribute to someone from the State of California who can be described as a ``diamond in the sky.'' 
   Charles Thorntona left this Earth about 2 weeks ago, and I presented his family with a Congressional Memorial Certificate of Recognition: 
   ``Whereas he was preceded in death by parents Polly and Jimmie Thorntona and godson Gary Parker. 
   ``Whereas he leaves behind lifelong soul mate Christine; children Kishaun and Charles Thorntona, Victoria and Aurea Smith and Chris Bale; grandsons DeAndre and Jaydn; and siblings Jim, Sandra, Pamela, and Timothy Thorntona and also Debra. 
   ``Whereas, as a musician, artist, and coach, Charles touched many lives. A big-hearted father figure who thrived on making others happy. A legend, never to be forgotten. 
   ``Be it resolved that Charles Thorntona be immortalized as a humanitarian, who shared his life to make it better for his fellow man and left an outstanding lasting legacy for his family and friends. May he rest in peace.'' 
   And may I just share a poem that was written called ``A Diamond in the Sky,'' and it's a tribute from his brothers Jim and Tim and also written by Alice Holmes McKoy: 
 Stand and take a bow; As you leave us for the pureness of heaven, You have left us in this mist of life; What becomes a legend most ..... you, my brother; The one who reached out to everyone. You chose to engage to interact to love; Sharing and caring, never too busy to do. Why you? The original rock of our world has been called to your eternal rest with the Lord; You were supposed to let me know these things in advance ..... after all, I am your brother ..... but it's all right; As you sit with Jesus, Mom, Dad, and young Gary, Man, know that you will always be loved and appreciated; and as I look into the sky tonight ..... I see you ..... a diamond in the sky.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (MUHAMMAD A. NASSARDEEN, FOUNDER OF RECYCLING BLACK DOLLARS IN LOS ANGELES -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, it was with great sorrow that I learned of the loss of a stalwart champion of political and business empowerment within the Los Angeles community. I'm speaking of Mr. Muhammad A. Nassardeen, a pioneering entrepreneur and a staunch promoter of ``economic activism.'' 
   Muhammad Nassardeen founded Recycling Black Dollars in 1988 as a way  to encourage African Americans and others to patronize African American-owned businesses and promote the practice as a much needed strategy for revitalizing the community and addressing problems such as unemployment. 
   Muhammad Nassardeen never saw the City of Los Angeles as it is, but he envisioned what it could be. He was ``connector'' extraordinaire. He connected black consumers with black businesses, and black business owners with one another. It is estimated that some 2,000 to 3,000 businesses benefited from the work of Recycling Black Dollars. 
   Muhammad Nassardeen's vision and focus on the economic empowerment and advancement of ethnic minorities in Los Angeles will be sorely missed. He was a beacon of light out of economic darkness for many. 
   The City of Los Angeles, colleagues, family and friends all mourn the loss of Muhammad A. Nassardeen, and I extend my most heartfelt condolences to his family, his colleagues, his many close friends in the Los Angeles business community and here on Capitol Hill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, this week we learned that the Army refused to release a report it commissioned from the RAND Corporation on the mistakes made in the planning and the implementation of the Iraq war. 
   We all know that mistakes were made. However, it's important that the Bush administration hear from independent voices exactly why the war in Iraq did not go as the administration planned. 
   The RAND report, uncovered by the New York Times earlier this week, chided both President Bush and then-National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, for not resolving differences between the State Department and the Pentagon. It also highlighted the administration's failure to develop a single national plan that integrated ``humanitarian assistance, reconstruction governance, infrastructure development and postwar security.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the Bush administration has a lot of lessons to learn but refuses to listen to any independent critiques. I would hope the administration would take this report seriously and would also conclude that the status quo in Iraq cannot continue. 
   It's time that we bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (M<em>c</em>CAIN'S ASSESSMENT OF ECONOMY SHOWS HE REALLY IS NOT AN EXPERT ON THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year Senator McCain said he needed to study up on the economy because it was not his strong suit. You can certainly say that again. Yesterday Senator McCain once again said, and I am quoting now, ``The fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' His comments came on a day when the stock market fell 500 points, its worst drop in 7 years, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. 
   What fundamentals is Senator McCain referring to? It certainly can't be the fundamentals of ensuring more Americans have a job. Every moment this year, the Bush-McCain economy has shed tens of thousands of jobs. To date, more than 600,000 jobs have been lost. 
   Nor can it be the fundamentals of ensuring that middle-class Americans are prospering. Over the last 8 years under the Bush-McCain economy, real wages have actually fallen by $300, while basic necessities like food, gas, health care, and education have skyrocketed.  
   Mr. Speaker, Senator McCain needs to study up more on the economy and reject the failed economic policies of the last 8 years.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Chairman, I would first like to thank Chairman Obey both for his help securing this funding and for giving me this opportunity to defend it here on the floor. 
   The entertainment industry in Los Angeles is what the auto industry is to Detroit or the oil industry is to Houston, a source of skilled, high-wage jobs for average working class families. 
   The On Location training program at West Los Angeles Community College seeks to make sure that Los Angeles youth get the skills they need to fill these jobs. The skills we are talking about here are film editing, electrical wiring, lighting, and set design and construction. 
   At a time when more and more film production is moving offshore, this program ensures that L.A. retains its number one competitive advantage, the highest quality film production workforce in the world. In 1996, when we worked out the welfare reform program for California, we placed the retraining of those coming off welfare in the community colleges, and this is one of the programs that is located there, because we find that people who are returning to the workforce and our veterans, average age 27 years, go to the community college. 
   Young people in Los Angeles County suffer from one of the highest rates of youth unemployment and violence in the Nation. At last count, the unemployment rate for young people in L.A. County was close to 12 percent. 
   The On Location program creates opportunities for Los Angeles young people while supporting the most important industry to the southern California economy. This program makes sure that kids of average means can get the technical skills they need to get good jobs working in film and television production. 
   Earlier, I approached Mr. Hensarling, who announced his opposition in a press release, and explained  that the money in this project doesn't go to Hollywood studios, it goes to West Los Angeles Community College, and the program trains youth in the skills needed in this industry. 
   I could draw parallels to other community college programs in other people's districts, but I won't do that. So what we want to do is to use these Federal funds, because it is connected to the Federal welfare reform program, to allow this college to prepare our young people to work in an industry that really is the fuel to the economy. It is a $600 billion industry. It not only fuels the economy in California, but it fuels the economy nationwide. So, we need critical investments in education and job training so that we can compete in the global economy. 
   Rather than seeking to defend the tax cuts for the wealthy, let us work together to support needed investments in job training like the effective On Location program that benefits the average family and the unemployed youth of California. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS REPORT ON THE ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Thank you, Congresswoman STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES; and thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   I want to congratulate Congressman Meek, Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and CAROLYN CHEEKS KILPATRICK for putting together a most excellent Congressional Black Caucus annual legislative week. The event was very well attended, and the many issue forums were informative and enlightening. 
   I held three issue forums, one on African American entrepreneurship in South Africa, and one on African American celebrities and their too often unreported commitment to social issues. 
   And my third panel, entitled ``Finding Justice for the Black Cherokee Indian Freedmen,'' looked at the current Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma's efforts to expel its black Cherokee citizens. I was pleased to have a number of Cherokee citizens, including Joe Byrd, the former principal chief of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, Jon Velie, attorney for the Freedmen, and Marilyn Vann, president of the Freedmen Descendants Association. 
   In the year 2000, the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma attempted to disenfranchise its Freedmen descendants. The circumstances were nearly identical to the current efforts of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma to rid itself of descendants of the Freedmen who are rightfully citizens of Cherokee Nation. The Bureau of Indian Affairs took a proactive stance against the Seminoles, cutting off their funding for nearly 2 years and also suspending their franchise to conduct gaming. 
   Interestingly, the Bureau of Indian Affairs first 
   declared the Cherokee Freedmen situation identical to that of the Seminole Freedmen. Then the bureau did a 180-degree flip flop, taking a hands-off approach to Cherokee Freedmen. The BIA chose to shirk its fiduciary responsibility, even as the Freedmen's rights were obviously being trampled on by the Cherokee leadership. 
   In March of 2007, the Cherokee Nation held an election to expel the Cherokee Freedmen, in violation of the 1866 treaty which granted full citizenship  rights to Cherokee Freedmen shortly after the Civil War. That is when the plight of the Cherokee Freedmen first came to my attention. 
   I immediately wrote a letter to Assistant Secretary Artman of the Bureau of Indian Affairs requesting an interpretation of the vote. The letter was signed by 25 of my congressional colleagues. The response I received from Secretary Artman almost a month later was unsatisfactory. In effect, the Secretary said that the bureau had not taken any administrative action and would continue its careful evaluation of all facets of this matter. In effect, I was told that the BIA would continue to monitor a situation that didn't need further monitoring, but immediate action. 
   It is only when I discovered that the BIA would not move proactively, that it would not forcibly and vigorously stand up for and protect the rights of Cherokee Freedmen as it had done for the Seminole Freedmen, I introduced H.R. 2824 to sever the United States relations with the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma until such time that it restores full citizenship rights to Cherokee Freedmen. 
   My legislation has been characterized by Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma as a termination bill, which is blatantly false. There is not one sentence in the legislation that addresses terminating the Cherokee Nation's Federal recognition status. 
   The Cherokee Nation has made the argument that Congress should not intervene until the courts have resolved the matter. It made this point the center piece of its public relations campaign to disenfranchise the Freedmen descendents. But the past actions of the Cherokee Nation belie its commitment to the rule of law. After the Cherokee Nation's tribal courts ruled in favor of Lucy Allen, a Freedmen descendant who sued for citizenship, the Cherokee Nation's leadership chose to dissolve the court and packed the newly constituted court with cronies who proceeded to approve a referendum to disenfranchise the Freedmen. 
   The Cherokee Nation's leadership states that funding cuts will hurt many Cherokees who depend on Federal funding. This past Friday, coinciding with the day of my issue forum, the Cherokee Nation took out a full page ad in Roll Call and in the Hill making this claim. What the Cherokee Nation doesn't tell you is that it has already spent $2.7 million or more lobbying against Freedmen and that the Cherokee Tribal Council recently debated allocating $4 million to lobby against the Freedmen. What they don't tell you is that a lot of this money has gone and will go to pay for services of high-priced public relations firms. It's too bad that the Cherokee Nation will not use its money to help those in its tribe who really need assistance, but instead will use millions of dollars to launch a hateful and vitriolic attack against African descendents of the Cherokee Nation who form a minority of its, there are only 2,800, they're a minority among its 270,000 thousand Members. 
   And finally, my legislation was not an attack on Indian sovereignty or the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma's sovereignty. 
   The Cherokee Nation receives roughly $300 million a year from the Federal Government. It also conducts highly lucrative gaming operations with a Federal gaming charter. The sovereign right to discriminate with our taxpayers' dollars is not a right at all. It's illegal. 
   The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma argues that it should be treated like other tribes and have the exclusive right to determine its citizenship. Because the Cherokees signed a treaty with the Confederate States of America and fought against the United States to defend slavery, the conditions of the treaty of 1866 and reconstituting the relationship with the United States was that the former slaves and their descendents, called the Freedmen, would be citizens with full rights. My legislation only seeks redress for the Cherokee Nation for the restoration of their treaty rights that entitle them to citizenship, to vote, to hold office and to have equal rights with other Cherokee citizens. 
   Madam Speaker and Representative STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, I appreciate the time you have given us, and I think we were very successful this weekend in gathering information and enlightening our public who attended from across the country and around our Nation. Thank you very much.

   During the first 100 hours, this Congress will vote to extend economic prosperity to 7.3 million Americans who have been left behind for far too long. It has been almost a decade since the Federal minimum wage has been increased. Today, a minimum wage worker is trying to make due on less than $11,000 a year. This is simply impossible; $5.15 an hour is simply not a fair and livable wage for hardworking Americans. In fact, the minimum wage is at its lowest purchasing level in over 50 years. 
   It is time Washington stands up for the little guy and gives more than 6 million workers a much-deserved pay raise.

Early on, her teachers would say of her, ``She could walk amongst kings and not lose her common touch.'' She moved easily among people, singing her way into star status, and even appeared on an early TV version of ``Star Search.''

   Barbara Kaufman was a special education administrative secretary for Los Angeles County Schools for over 25 years. She was a champion for the rights of children with special needs and deeply loved working in her chosen profession. In addition, Barbara volunteered in the political campaigns of myself, and she accepted any job that would add to the improvement of the people's social, political and economic conditions. 
   After many bouts with illness, Barbara's activities were limited. However, she participated as much as possible in her church, particularly enjoying Bible study and prayer support groups. Barbara Kaufman was a woman for all seasons and a witness for Christ.

   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, this week Democrats will continue to meet the needs of the American people by introducing the legislation to cut student loans interest rates in half. 
   The cost of attending college continues to skyrocket, putting college out of reach for more and more students. Tuition and fees at public universities have increased by 41 percent after inflation since the 2000-2001 academic year, and fees at private universities have jumped 17 percent after inflation. Today, the typical student borrower graduates from college with $17,500 in debt. According to the Department of Education, the rising cost of higher education will prevent 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year college over the next decade. 
   Madam Speaker, more than ever the health of our economy rests on having a highly skilled and educated workforce. College access is key to America's future, and cutting student loan interest rates is key to making college more affordable to millions of Americans.

   Voting is fundamental to the Democratic process. It is the one act that allows the widest participation of the American public in our political process. Every voter who goes to the polls should be assured that his or her vote will be counted and the candidates they put in office will be able to have the voting power to voice their needs in this House.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I first want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) and the other cosponsors of this resolution for recognizing International Women's Day in honor of the contributions and achievements of women all over the world and the importance of promoting and protecting their rights. 
   I want to pay special tribute today to my distinguished female colleagues on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who are performing their important responsibilities with distinction and honor. I also want to recognize my distinguished colleague, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who has achieved the distinction of becoming the first woman to obtain the ranking position on this committee. 
   Today, women all over the world are becoming leaders in science, medicine, the arts, politics, business, and even the military. 
   Despite this progress, women and girls continue to represent the majority of the poor, the chronically hungry, refugees, the HIV-infected, the sick, the uneducated and the undereducated, the unemployed and disenfranchised people. 
   Women are also subject to specific forms of physical and structural violence and discrimination because of their gender. These include sexual violence in both conflict and nonconflict situations, sex trafficking, and domestic violence from their partners and family members. 
   Cruel cultural practices targeted at women include denial of voting rights, freedom of movement, and property rights. Women are also subjected to genital mutilation, forced and early marriages, humiliating and harmful  widow practices, bride burnings and honor killings. Women also continue to experience an unequal remuneration for work of equal value, discrimination in hiring and admission to educational institutions, and lack of flexibility for special needs such as paid and extended family leave. 
   It is not enough to simply declare the equality of women, condemn their mistreatment, and increase the number of women in the workplace. We must, in all sectors of society, address the structural mechanisms which deny women and girls access to the same rights and opportunities as boys and men.     
   We must also attack and eliminate the criminal and cultural practices which destroy the lives and freedom and the health of women. 
   Statistics prove that when women are better off in our society, their children are happier, healthier and more educated, and our world is better off. 
   I will do everything in my power to ensure that every piece of legislation we consider in the committee will improve the security, opportunity and prosperity of women, and I know my colleagues will share this important goal. 
   In honor of our wives, our mothers, our daughters, our female colleagues and our Speaker, and women around the world, I am proud to support this resolution, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE NEGRO BASEBALL LEAGUES AND THEIR PLAYERS -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, in 1872, Bud Fowler became the first African American to enter organized baseball. At the time, Sporting Life magazine called him ``one of the best general players in the country. If he had had a white face,'' they said, ``he would be playing with the best of them.'' There were only a handful of black players during that time. 
   By the end of the 1800s, the door to organized baseball was slammed shut to African Americans, and as a result, in 1920, Andrew ``Rube'' Foster managed a Negro baseball team and organized seven other team owners to join him to form the Negro National Baseball League. Mr. Foster is known by many people to be the father of the Negro Baseball League. 
   For his efforts and contributions to baseball, he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Since 1920, many teams were formed to expand the Negro Baseball Leagues. He produced many extraordinary players like Satchel Paige, ``Cool Papa'' Bell, ``Double-Duty'' Radcliffe, ``Groundhog'' Thompson and many others. 
   Presently, there are 278 members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, 18 whom had played in the Negro League. These greats include Willie Mays and Jackie Robinson, who first played in the Negro Leagues and then entered Major League Baseball. 
   Indeed, the players in the Negro Leagues were of such high caliber that many of them later moved to other major leagues and enjoyed better statistics playing there than they did in the Negro Leagues. 
   The opening of the doors of the major leagues to Negro League players often is attributed to Branch Rickey, who made a bold decision to sign Jackie Robinson to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Unfortunately, many owners of Negro baseball teams could not compete in the recruitment and financial compensation for African American players, which later caused many African American teams to fold in the early 1960s. 
   Some people shake their heads and say that the Negro Leagues' players came along too early. I think ``Cool Papa'' Bell had it right when he said ``they opened the door, just too late.'' 
   But then it is never too late to right what has been a wrong, to create equal opportunity and to open the doors for the Luke Easters, the Minnie Minosos, the Kirby Picketts, the Barry Bondses, the Frank Thomases, and countless others who have thrilled and delighted us with their skills. 
   The achievement and success of African American baseball players on the baseball field have helped break down color barriers and integrate African Americans into all aspects of society.     
   This bill recognizes the teams and the players of the Negro Baseball Leagues for their achievements, their sacrifices, their dedication, and their contributions to baseball and the Nation. I commend the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) for introducing the bill, and I urge its swift passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, public service is the cornerstone of living democracy. That said, I do fervently believe it takes a special person to give their life to serve the public. I stand before you to honor an individual who, for over 30 years, dedicated his life to public servitude, former California Lieutenant Governor, Leo T. McCarthy. 
   Lieutenant Governor McCarthy was one who valued what was best for all of Californians, not just those that were of means and access. Much of this can be attributed to McCarthy's humane beginnings as the child of a poor immigrant family. It was during the time McCarthy's father, Daniel, opened a pub which became the community haven for the local Irish Catholic population, that young McCarthy became smitten with service. In his youth, McCarthy engaged in many service-oriented activities, which included early studies for the priesthood and service within the United States Air Force. 
   After earning his law degree, he began a career in politics that spanned over three decades. He served first as a member of the California Board of Supervisors and, in 1968, won a State assembly seat, where he eventually assumed the role of Speaker. 
   During his tenure in the California Assembly, McCarthy instituted a number of reforms. He reduced the number of oversight committees, provided members with bill analysis for floor sessions and provided more accountability and greater public access. 
   Leo McCarthy was a man on a mission, and in 1982, he ascended to what would become the pinnacle of his political career, the role of Lieutenant Governor of the State of California. As Lieutenant Governor, McCarthy wanted to unify the differing socioeconomic and cultural climates of the State. He established the Feminization of Poverty Task Force, which was comprised of women from all walks of life to develop ways to overcome economic barriers common amongst women and girls. 
   He also enacted legislation to better regulate nursing home patients and ensure that women had the best possible preventive care. He was an advocate for minority and female-owned businesses, and coerced business leaders into understanding the economic benefits of work site child care facilities. 
   When asked to reflect about his years in the public sector, Leo McCarthy said, ``I was lucky. I was in a position to make a contribution. I felt very fortunate to have played a role. Some days were miserable, and some unhappy, but there were a lot of days that were great. There was a sense of satisfaction and being helpful to people.''

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES DAY -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, the most sacred institution of our society is that of the family. And within the family, its most precious asset, and that is its children. I stand before you today asking that my colleagues support me in  establishing a National Children and Families Day. 
   President Bush has stated that, ``Families instill in our children values; they shape character and are the foundation of a hopeful society.'' These are the goals for which we strive on National Children and Families Day. It is the intent of the National Children and Families Day to emphasize the importance of loving and stable relationships between parents, communities and children. 
   I once heard a teacher ask her class, What is the greatest Nation in the world? As the students muttered the names of countries worldwide, she pointed to her head and said, Imagination. 
   Through National Children and Families Day, I wish to cultivate and encourage the active imaginations of children, for we know that from creative and innovative thinking comes the ability to hope and dream for a brighter future. 
   Creating an environment that instills important values and builds strong character and provides sound education for our children is a vital national priority. With a firm foundation, children will be better able to face the challenges of the future. 
   As a legislator, I often find myself thinking of the countless children I represent whom I view as future voting constituents. And I think of how the policies we enact today could hinder or empower them 10, 15 or 20 years from now. 
   This, Mr. Speaker, is why I urge my colleagues to support National Children and Families Day. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, it is clear that no one is buying into the scare tactics created by the President and some Republicans regarding the expiration of the President's Protect America Act. Newspapers around the country are rightfully asking Republicans that if this law were so crucial to national security, why did they oppose an extension of it last month? 
   The Saint Louis Post-Dispatch called this intimidation and ``fear mongering at its most craven.'' The Oregonian wasn't fooled by the President's political actions, writing: ``If the Protect America Act is as crucial as he says it is, then he is taking a terrible gamble with the safety of his country's citizens.'' The Palm Beach Post recognized that ``political distraction'' is more important to this administration than the law. They wrote, ``The law that Mr. Bush and some Republicans say is vital could have been extended for 3 weeks. Instead, they let it die.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are serious about passing a strong FISA law that provides our intelligence community with the tools necessary to protect our national security, and we urge congressional Republicans and the White House to join us at the table.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, last week President Bush tried to label this new Democratic Congress a ``do-nothing'' Congress. Is he serious? Or did he simply forget that he signed bills into law that were written and passed by this Congress that increased the minimum wage, made college more affordable for millions of children, and made our Nation safer by fully instituting the nonpartisan 9/11 Commission recommendations? 
   The President is also ignoring the fact that he's vetoed legislation that had strong bipartisan support. We sent him a bill that would insure 10 million children to have quality health care, but he vetoed it. 
   We sent him another bill that would have allowed for Federal funding of stem cell research so that we can discover cures for diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; but, again, the President vetoed it. 
   We also overwhelmingly approved a bill that protects our communities by building and repairing critical flood walls and levies; but, again, last week, the President said no. 
   This Congress is proud of its accomplishments, but there would be more if the President stopped saying no to progress. Fortunately, today we will override his veto of the water resources bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, we have had some fierce debates here in the Congress about our occupation of Iraq. Many Republicans insist that redeploying our troops from Iraq will lead to failure there. My Democratic colleagues and I see it much differently. We see clearly that our continued occupation is a debacle that prevents Iraqis taking control of their own nation and destiny. 
   But what Democrats and Republicans can agree on is that Iraq is not America's only national security concern. America faces several potent strategic challenges: al Qaeda. Afghanistan. Iran. North Korea. If we continue to exhaust our military in Iraq, we risk being at a disadvantage facing these other dangerous threats. 
   This bill ensures that our troops get the rest, recuperation and retraining they need to be most effective. If we fail to provide our troops with the time they need to rest, refit, and retrain at home, we are putting them at a disadvantage when they return to theater. 
   Furthermore, the common sense provisions in this bill mean that we are paying attention to another group that has borne the brunt of this war: our soldiers' families. It has been said that there are two ways to break the military: you can break the soldier, or you can break the family. Our troops agreed to accept a certain level of hardship when they enlisted. The least we can do in return is make sure that we have their back, and are giving them the time they need to recuperate. 
   The strength of our armed forces comes from the strength of our men and women in uniform. If we fail to pass this bill, we risk weakening American national security. We face a host of threats beyond Iraq. Pass this bill to keep America strong and prepared.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Thank you so much, Representative Waters, for allowing us this opportunity to express our feelings towards the escalation of the war, the war of choice, in Iraq. 
   I am adamantly against this expansion. I see it as another provocation. I see Iraq now being the spawning ground that attracts all those who hate America to come and kill Americans. 
   The President is asking for 21,500 more troops to go on the killing fields. We don't even know who the enemy is. We use the name insurgents. We don't even know the President's definition for victory. How do you measure victory? 
   I remember the day that a great many Members stood up saluting the fact that Iraq had a democratic election. Apparently, there is no faith in those that were elected to administer the country of Iraq because they are talking about America losing the war. 
   We were told by Rumsfeld that 368,000 Iraqis had been trained. Where are they? Do they run away in the heat of battle? There is a lot of mystery surrounding this whole debacle called the ``war against terrorism'' in Iraq. 
   I thought we were looking for Osama bin Laden. All of a sudden we switched over to a nation of 28 million people, to Saddam Hussein, who didn't like Osama bin Laden. 
   I really feel that we were misdirected, misguided and, really, bottom line, lied to. And I don't know if you knew this, but while the President was making his presentation last night on a new direction forward, U.S. forces entered the Iranian consulate in Iraq's Kurdish-dominated north and seized computers, documents, and other items. It was also reported that five staff members were taken into custody. This is during the time that the President was making his speech. 
   Now, what I fear is that when the President said the axis of evil, Iran and North Korea, one down, the second one to come, and the third one very soon. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wish to end with giving you this piece of information. What does that state? I understand right now that the United States has worked with the Iraqi Government to have a law where they will contract out their oil for the next 30 years and 75 percent of the proceeds will go to the contractors. Seventy-five percent. It is the major rip-off of all time. 
   Was that the real reason why we invaded without provocation into Iraq?

   The Bush administration was wrong when it said the intelligence community would go dark, outrageous, when the act expired earlier this month. 
   Kenneth Wainstein, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said that even after the President's law expired, ``intelligence officials would still be able to continue eavesdropping on already-approved targe ts for another year.'' And Kate Martin, the Director of the Center for National Security Studies, said our government could immediately listen in on any new individual plotting a terrorist attack without a court order under existing FISA emergency authority. 
   Clearly, our intelligence community is not going dark. And I would hope that congressional Republicans would stop this scare tactic.

   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker and my honorable colleague, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, thank you for this opportunity to salute our women over a period of time. 
   I would like now to introduce you to a woman by the name of Mayme Clayton. 
   Mayme Clayton, a renowned librarian, worked her entire life to assemble a priceless collection of historical artifacts. The collection was assembled over a 40-year period by Mayme A. Clayton, 1923 to 2006, a career librarian at the University of Southern California in my district, and University of California, Los Angeles, my alma mater. And Dr. Clayton's singular commitment to preserve African American culture and history was inspired by her desire to ensure that children would know the richness and diversity of African American contributions to the world. 
   The Mayme A. Clayton Collection of African American History and Culture is comprised of seven main components. They are as follows: rare and out-of-print books, manuscripts, documents, films, music, photographs, and memorabilia. The collection is a remarkable cultural treasure, with a vast ability to educate and to delight. It is our hope that this particular collection will be explored on the Web site to learn more about the collection and why Dr. Mayme Clayton assembled it, and the goals of the Western States Black Research and Educational Center. 
   It's a research center, and it's scheduled to receive a Federal grant to refurbish its facilities that are located in my district, Culver City, California. The center will be known as the Mayme Clayton Library, and it has housed the largest collection of rare books, films, recordings, and other documents on black Americans outside of the Schomburg Library.  
   Ms. Clayton's historic efforts have not been in vain, but can rightfully serve as historical and intellectual nourishment for this generation as well as future generations of Americans.     
   When she learned that there was a location for her rare collection, which she kept in her garage, and I remember going over as a student at UCLA and going through her works for a paper that I had to do, I knew that she would outgrow that space and would have to find a place that could rightfully house such a precious collection. But we found a place for her. It was the old courthouse in Culver City. As you know, you cannot sell a courthouse; so we're on loan. They lent it to us for a period of time, and we're going to see that Federal grants go to that library to preserve this collection. 
   And I am so pleased to put that name into your psyche because she has skillfully, artfully, and scholarly recorded our history, as written by slaves themselves and written by free men. 
   Mayme Clayton, a true African American heroine. 
   Thank you, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, for giving me this time to talk about Mayme Clayton.

   We heard a number of our Republican colleagues come to the floor today to object to particular spending items in the bill, but this might be a first. Mr. Pence has an amendment here to prevent spending on something that doesn't exist. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think it's worth us having a real debate on the need for a fairness doctrine. But before we get into the merits of the Fairness Doctrine, we should point out that the Fairness Doctrine has not existed since 1987, so that the argument that the Fairness Doctrine has somehow caused bias in America media is a complete red herring. 
   But I think we need to take a hard look at what happens to our public dialogue in this country when only six companies have dominion over public debate.     
   Mr. Pence says he doesn't want the Federal Government deciding what is fair and what is not fair, but at least the Federal Government is accountable to voters. And so I think we need to get back to what is really fair in an open society. And I urge my colleagues to vote against the Pence amendment. 
   And I would urge Mr. Pence to join us in working to open up a free, true market in American media. And I stand ready to work with you, Mr. Pence, or any other Member of this House who wants to shift our public debate away from the centrally planned media environment we have today to a truly, functional, free market where new entrepreneurs have a chance to compete with established media companies and where new ideas have a chance to compete with the old and failed policies of the past.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to announce the passing of a great American, Ira O'Neal, Jr., who happened to be my cousin, one of the original Tuskegee Airmen recently honored with the Congressional Gold Medal here in the Capitol. 
   Ira O'Neal was born in Phoenix, Arizona, on June 11, 1918. He was drafted into the 1st Army Corps in 1942, where he served in the 42nd Aviation Squadron as a first lieutenant. 
   In 1948, President Truman issued his famous executive order that racially integrated the military. At the same time that Truman issued his order, the military was moving from a wartime to a peacetime footing. As a result of our Nation's reduced force structure, Ira was one of the many thousands of soldiers who was discharged. 
   Although Ira had been discharged from the military, he was not deterred from serving his country. In 1949, Ira was able to reenlist in the U.S. Air Force. He proudly served his country until he retired in 1972. 
   After retiring, he started a security service that contracted with the Watergate apartments. He hired a young man by the name of Wills, who discovered the Watergate break-in. Ira was contacted, and his report started the Watergate episode. 
   Ira has been a resident of the District of Columbia for 56 years and has always been active in his community. In 2004, he received the Roots in Scouting Award recognizing a lifetime of work with the Boy Scouts of America. 
   I was honored to be with Ira at the Bolling Air Force Base Officers' Club on March 28 of this year when Kerwin Miller, Department of Veterans Affairs, presented him with a proclamation declaring Tuskegee Airmen Day in Washington D.C. 
   During the same ceremony, a room at the Officers' Club, the Tuskegee room, was also dedicated. A day later, I was again honored to share with Ira that proud moment at the rotunda of the Capitol when he and the other Tuskegee Airmen received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award that Congress bestows. 
   Mr. Speaker, for his dedicated military service, during and after World War II, and for his ongoing public service on behalf of the District of Columbia, I am proud to acknowledge and to salute First Lieutenant Ira O'Neal's service to his country, his community and family. 
   May God bless him and rest his soul.

   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I learned of the death my dear friend Johnny Grant, known internationally as the honorary Mayor of Hollywood. His departure from our lives has created a significant void in the normal glitz and glamour of everyday Hollywood. Johnny was a symbol of great Hollywood movers and shakers who took sincere interest in creating goodwill worldwide. 
   Johnny's legendary accomplishments in Hollywood drew strongly from his roots in radio and television. He was one of television medium's earliest pioneers and stars. Johnny traveled the world to entertain U.S. troops in his role as the United Service Organization ambassador. He joined comedian Bob Hope in taking entertainers to war zones to perform for military personnel and was the first recipient of the highest honor awarded by the USO. Johnny was also a retired major general in the California State Military Reserve, a volunteer backup and support force of the National Guard. 
   Johnny Grant served as chairman of the Los Angeles City Fire Commission; the Los Angeles County Social Service Commission; and the Burbank, California Police Commission. More recently, he had been a member of the Los Angeles City Cultural Heritage Commission. He was the only person ever to twice receive an Order of California, the State's highest honor. 
   A lifelong bachelor, Johnny Grant was best known to television audiences around the world as the enthusiastic host alongside the more than 500 celebrities he inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame. With his ebullient style, Johnny was one of the west coast's most sought after masters of ceremony. He emceed more than 5,000 civic and charity events. Johnny was also a humanitarian who produced hundreds of charity events where he was instrumental in raising millions of dollars for the USO, for the Boy Scouts, the Arthritis Foundation, police and fire services, veterans organizations, and others. 
   Although he has an honorary star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the real star, his presence and inspiration will be sorely missed. We will miss him. And just last month he completed his 60th trip to entertain servicemen and women abroad. 
   We extend our most heartfelt condolences to his family, colleagues, and his many close friends here on Capitol Hill, in California, and around the world.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Today, Madam Speaker, January 15, 2008, is an auspicious day for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, as it celebrates its 100th birthday anniversary. Founded in 1908 on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C., Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority is the first Greek-letter organization founded by African American college women. Alpha Kappa Alpha is a sisterhood of women who have consciously chosen to improve the socioeconomic conditions in their city, State, Nation, and the world. 
   Its history tells a story of changing patterns of human relations in America in the 20th century. The small group who organized the sorority was just one generation removed from slavery. The sorority has directed its efforts toward improving the quality of life for all mankind while living the sorority motto: by culture and by merit. 
   I am proud to count myself as a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority; and throughout the years I have witnessed firsthand how the power, vision, and commitment of our founders and members have inspired AKA to endure and prosper through 10 decades. Our membership includes high-profile women from all walks of life and from all disciplines, including the astronaut and physician Dr. Mae Jemison, poet Maya Angelou, actress Phylicia Rashad, entertainer Gladys Knight, entrepreneur Suzanne de Passe, U.K. member of Parliament Diane Abbot, performing artist Alicia Keys, Indira Gandhi, and a host of other regional, national, and international political leaders. My colleagues Sheila Jackson-Lee and Eddie Bernice Johnson, also retired Congresswoman Eva Clayton, and the late Juanita Millender-McDonald are sorors, too. 
   Alpha Kappa Alpha led the way with such programs as Vocational Guidance, Foreign Fellowship, the Mississippi Health Project, Health Programs, Nonpartisan Council, the American Council on Human Rights, Sickle Cell Anemia, Job Corps, the purchase of Martin Luther King's birthplace, the establishment of Educational Advancement Foundation, and the African Village Development Program, among a few. 
   The AKAs have always understood that the world's greatest asset is its youth, and developed several integral programs in an effort to increase their opportunities. These programs include PIMS, or Partnership in Mathematics and Science; ON TRACK: Organizing Nurturing, Team-building, Respecting, Achieving, Counseling, and Knowing; Ivy AKAdemy; and the Young Authors Program. 
   Inspired by the vision, Celebrating Our Past, Serving Our Community, Honoring Our Sisterhood, women from around the world have gathered in our Nation's Capital today to honor this anniversary, celebrate our achievements, and resolve to build on the legacy of our founders by strengthening our commitment. Today, the sorority donated $1 million to Howard University and $10,000 to the Andrew Rankin Chapel. 
   On July 10-11, 2008, the AKAs, under the astute leadership of Dr. Barbara A. McKinzie, Centennial International president, will host its Centennial Boule here in the United States Capital, the sorority's birthplace. More than 20,000 members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority will tell the Nation and the world the story of 20 women who started a movement which advanced a people and changed the course of history. 
   And I ask all of you to join me in acknowledging this great milestone as Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority embarks on its second century of service, the bedrock of our sorority, and excellence. It was true in 1908 and it is true today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6625, the Veteran Voting Support Act. 
   In May of 2008, the Department of Veterans Affairs passed Directive 2008-25 that prohibited third party nonpartisan voting rights groups from holding voter registration drives on VA grounds. Outraged by this stance that the VA had taken, I, along with 54 of my colleagues, including Chairman Brady and Chairman Filner, sent two letters to VA Secretary James Peake requesting he overturn the policy. 
   As we returned from the August recess, on September 9, 2008, the VA passed a new policy directive, 2008-53. The new directive now allows State and local election officials and nonpartisan groups to give veterans access to their fundamental right to vote. We applaud the VA for overturning its previous directive, and I believe it is a step in the right direction. But the new policy still falls short of providing veterans complete access to voting in VA facilities. So H.R. 6625 will fix that problem. 
   The Veteran Voting Support Act would designate VA facilities as voter registration agencies under section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 which requires public assistance organizations provide voter registration opportunities by offering information related to requesting an absentee ballot, making absentee ballot applications available, and require the VA to work with elected officials to ensure the delivery of absentee applications and absentee ballots. 
   Currently, our Nation is fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and as a consequence, our veterans are returning home with catastrophic injuries that require them to reside in a VA facility for extended periods of time to receive treatment for their wounds. This is why it is absolutely imperative that we give the selfless stewards of the Constitution complete access to voting in our elections. It is because of the sacrifice of men and women in the Armed Forces why we are free. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Brady and Chairman Filner for working with me on the legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6625.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, we mourn the passing of a great Congressman whose public service was emulated by leaders present and past. Gus Hawkins has left us with a sterling legacy that was built on the politics of inclusion. 
   While in office, he authored over 100 laws in the area of adult education, apprenticeship training, slum clearance, low-cost housing, workmen's compensation for domestics, disability insurance, pensions for senior citizens, and child care centers. He was also responsible for the Fair Employment Practice Act of 1959, the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962, and the Fair Housing Act of 1963. More importantly, he authored the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965, which was an extensive statute funding primary and secondary education. 
   As a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, he chaired various committees and continued in his effort to enhance educational opportunities for children. He was instrumental in forming the National Council on Educating Black Children. 
   Augustus Hawkins' philosophy of service and leadership to the State of California and the Nation is perhaps best said in his own words, and I quote, ``The leadership belongs not to the loudest, not to those who beat the drums or blow the trumpets, but to those who day in and day out in all seasons work for the practical realization of a better world, those who have the stamina to persist and to remain dedicated. To those belong the leadership.''

   After the untimely passing of our colleague Juanita Millender-McDonald, Stephanie called and she says, ``Hey girl, I am coming out there to spend some time. I just want to be in Juanita's space.'' 
   So she came out, and I picked her up. And representing Hollywood, I took her with me that weekend, and she met Ben Vereen and she met other celebrities, and she was so thrilled. She said to me, ``I'm coming out again, girl. I'm coming out again.'' 
   After we had our AKA Boule several weeks ago here and we had our pink and green, she came in the last I saw her in her red. And she came strutting down this aisle, and she said, ``See, I got my red on. We are getting ready to have our Boule too.'' I said, ``Well, your red is just a deeper pink.'' We laughed. And that was the last time I saw her. 
   Stephanie was that kind of person, who, as everyone has described her as being, she lived life to the fullest. She was a fighter with a tremendous presence. She stood up for tens of thousands who could not stand up for themselves, and she fought for justice, equality and opportunity for every American. In her home State of Ohio and in her beloved city of Cleveland, she led the fight for election reform to assure that every American's vote was counted and was valued. 
   Stephanie was also loved and respected by her colleagues here on Capitol Hill, where in relatively short order she was appointed the first, among her many firsts, African American woman to the prestigious Ways and Means Committee. She also served as chairwoman of the Committee on Ethics and made great strides to work across the aisle in a nonpartisan manner. 
   I admired her enthusiasm for public service, her integrity, her warmth and her keen intellect. I extend to the family my condolences, to her friends and to all of her colleagues. Her presence will be missed. But I know she is in this assemblage at this moment. Her shoes will be hard to fill, but, Stephanie, we feel the surge of energy as we speak of you this evening.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, yesterday's hearing in the Government Reform Committee left me with many concerns. I am concerned about Blackwater's role when they get involved in U.S. military operations. 
   In April and November of 2004, Blackwater personnel attached themselves to U.S. troops and engaged enemy positions. These actions may have set a bad precedent and may have been a catalyst that led to the September 16 shooting death of Iraqi civilians. 
   I also am concerned about Blackwater's unprecedented rise in procurement of Federal Government contracts. Initially, Blackwater was awarded no-bid contracts for security services in August of 2003 and June of 2004 worth more than $73 million, and the President just today vetoed a bill for children's health that was worth $11 billion.

   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, during the course of the war in Iraq, the American people have paid a very heavy price, not just financially, although the war has already cost over 400 billion taxpayer dollars, but also through the tragic loss of at least 3,775 American lives, with countless more injured. And under the President's plan to continue our failed policy in Iraq, these immense sacrifices will continue. 
   According to General Petraeus, if we go forward with this war as the President wants us to, on average, two U.S. men and women will die every day; another 15 will be wounded each day; and we will spend $300 million each and every day we are there. 
   It seems that these massive losses do not register with some of my Republican colleagues who continue to support an open-ended commitment in Iraq. In fact, Republican Leader Boehner even said recently, when asked how much longer we should stay in Iraq, that the sacrifice being made will be a small price. I don't think so.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, over the last month this Democratic Congress has passed important legislation that will help our economy, our veterans, and millions of middle class families. But our efforts are being opposed by a Bush White House that refuses to work with us to solve our Nation's most pressing problems. 
   We can't turn around our economy without addressing the escalating housing crisis. Last month, we passed a comprehensive package that addresses the crisis directly, helps stabilize the housing market, and makes a real difference for families at risk for losing their homes. 
   To help jump-start our economy and help reduce prices at the gas pump, we passed legislation that extends vital tax relief to millions of families, strengthens investment opportunities for American businesses, and encourages the production and use of renewable energy. To help veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we passed a new GI Bill that restores promised 4-year scholarships so they can go to college after they complete their military service. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are passing legislation here in the House that can make a real difference for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, today, Tax Day, millions of Americans know that their tax dollars will support rebuilding Iraq instead of rebuilding America. Americans have already spent $44 billion in rebuilding Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a huge oil revenue reserve. 
   Today, taxpayers may be wondering how this money could be spent in Iraq, our money, instead of rebuilding the U.S.A. With the $339 million that we are spending daily in Iraq, we could instead provide an additional 18,000 American students with Pell Grants so they can attend college. We could also hire and keep 4,400 ``COPS on the beat.'' Our moneys could be used, if we spent them here, to have 2,000 more border guard agents to protect our borders. 
   Madam Speaker, as Americans pay their taxes today, they have a right to know why billions are being spent each month in Iraq instead of here in the U.S.A.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (IN MEMORY OF ROSCOE LEE BROWN -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness and a deep sense of loss that we received the word of the passing of Roscoe Lee Brown on April 11, 2007. Mr. Brown was a distinguished Californian whose deeds and life merit the grateful acknowledgment of his community, his State, the Nation and the world. 
   Roscoe was born on May 2, 1925, in Woodbury, New Jersey. He graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania in 1946, earned his post-graduate degree at Middlebury College, and did graduate studies at Columbia University. 
   In college, Roscoe was also a star athlete, winning the world championship in the 800 meters in 1951. After finishing his college and post-graduate career, Roscoe returned to Lincoln, where he taught French and comparative literature. 
   At a dinner party in 1956, Roscoe announced his decision to become an actor, auditioned for and won a role in Julius Caesar the next day at the newly formed New York Shakespeare Festival, and found his life-long artistic passion, performing five more roles with that company. 
   In 1961, Roscoe appeared with James Earl Jones in the original off-Broadway cast of Jean Genet's landmark play, ``The Blacks.'' He won an Obie for his role in ``The Old Glory,'' received the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for both ``The Dream on Monkey Mountain'' in 1970, and ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' in 1989. 
   He wrote and directed ``An Evening of Negro Poetry and Folk Music,'' 1966, returned to Broadway in Tommy Tune's 1983 ``Kicking the Clouds Away,'' and earned a Tony nomination in August Wilson's ``Two Trains Running.'' That was 1992. 
   In 1962, Roscoe made his debut in films, appearing in ``The Connection.'' He has also appeared in ``The Comedians'' in 1967; ``Up Tight!'' in 1968, Hitchcock's ``Topaz'' in 1969, ``The Liberation of L.B. Jones,'' ``Superfly,'' ``Uptown Saturday Night,'' ``Logan's Run,'' ``Legal Eagles,'' ``The Mambo Kings'' and ``Dear God.'' 
   Roscoe's television career included memorable appearances on all the top 1970 sitcoms, including ``All in the Family,'' ``Maude,'' ``Sanford and Son,'' ``Good Times,'' and ``Barney Miller.'' He replaced Robert Guillaume on ``Soap,'' and in 1986 he won an Emmy guesting on ``The Cosby Show.'' 
   His resonant baritone was heard in documentaries, live-action fare and animated films, as well as the spoken-word arena with such symphony orchestras as the Boston Pops and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. For many years he and actor Anthony Zerbe toured the United States in ``Behind the Broken Words,'' an evening of poetry and dramatic readings. 
   Roscoe Lee Brown was a person of exceptional talent and accomplishments. He was among the first generation of African-American actors who sought to ply their craft during a period that rarely acknowledged or provided opportunity to persons of color. 
   It can truly be said that the Denzel Washingtons and other younger black actors in movies and television stood on the backs of giants like Roscoe Lee Brown, who blazed a trail for them through perseverance, hard work, and uncommon displays of exceptional talent. 
   May he rest in peace.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
   This legislation extends the mandate of an important bipartisan panel created by Congress, appointed by the President and working on behalf of the American people. This group keeps a watchful eye on major efforts by the private sector and the U.S. Government to inform and to influence opinions overseas and to improve America's understanding of other lands. 
   Since September 11, 2001, such efforts, known collectively as ``public diplomacy,'' have been recognized as an integral part of our country's work to foster better relations with people abroad. Congress created the predecessor of this panel more than half a century ago. Now it is called the United States Advisory Commission on  Public Diplomacy, and it deserves our sustained and enthusiastic support. 
   The commission regularly delivers its findings and makes recommendations to the President, the Congress, the Secretary of State and the general public with easily accessible reports. These reports also include assessments of the scholarly integrity and political neutrality of the cultural and educational exchange programs of the Department of State. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy does good and important work. Its mandate should be extended not merely annually, but for nearly 3 years more, as our legislation ensures. I am proud to be the author of this legislation, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this short, but important, bill.

   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, last week President Bush requested an additional $42 billion from Congress for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, bringing his total funding request for the upcoming year to $190 billion. 
   Also last week, the Congressional Budget Office released a report concluding that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost $2.4 trillion over the next decade. That's nearly $8,000 for every American. 
   Just imagine if we rejected the President's plan to continue the war in Iraq for another decade and worked instead to responsibly redeploy our troops out of Iraq within the next year. Rather than spending $2.4 trillion over in Iraq, we could instead invest it here with our own people. This would be more than enough to provide every college freshman in our Nation with a free 4-year education at a private college or university. We could also use that money to provide health care coverage to every American for a year or could pay off 26 percent of our national debt.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
   I would first like to commend our distinguished colleague, Mr. FORTU&#209;O of Puerto Rico, for introducing this resolution. 
   More than 140 years ago, the great Henry Dunant founded the International Committee of the Red Cross after witnessing the atrocities of the Battle of Solferino in 1859. 
   Mr. Dunant's heroic advocacy on behalf of the humane treatment of wartime sick and wounded spawned a global movement dedicated to helping those in need and protecting human dignity for all. 
   Today, there are more than 185 Red Cross, Red Crescent and Magen David Adom societies throughout the world and more than 750 chapters in the United States alone. These organizations help vulnerable people in communities prevent, prepare for and respond to and recover from disasters, complex humanitarian emergencies and life-threatening conditions. The red symbols of these great organizations are unambiguous, internationally recognized, signs of comfort, hope and protection. 
   The American Red Cross, in particular, is a vital lifeline for many people, both in this country and abroad. In conjunction with its sister national societies throughout the world, it has assisted millions of distressed individuals. 
   In 2006 alone, the American Red Cross responded to 23 international disasters and contributed more than $16.1 million in financial support. Often beyond the lens of cameras or public view at some of the most devastated corners on Earth, the American Red Cross represents our country and our national spirit of generosity and hope. 
   To honor Mr. Dunant's legacy and the work of thousands of volunteers and donors, the American Red Cross and its partners will celebrate World Red Cross Red Crescent Day. This resolution pays tribute to this event and to the work of thousands of volunteers internationally. It reaffirms our country's support for the world's largest humanitarian network and celebrates the values of the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, and Magen David Adom societies. 
   I am pleased to note that for the first time World Red Cross Red Crescent day will include Magen David Adom, Israel's national Red Cross society, which became a full member of the international movement in 2006. 
   I strongly support this resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank our colleague, Congresswoman Thelma Drake, for sponsoring this important resolution and for her leadership on this issue. 
   Twenty-five years ago, William and Kathleen Magee of Virginia traveled with other medical professionals to the Philippines to treat children with facial deformities. Little did they know it was a trip that would change their lives and the lives of thousands of children around the world. 
   Inspired by the Filipino children, the Magees decided to start their own organization designed specifically to address cleft palates and cleft lips in countries where medical care leaves those afflicted with few options. 
   They called it Operation Smile, and the Magees were the perfect couple to start it. William is a plastic surgeon, and Kathleen is a nurse and social worker. Since 1982, operating out of their headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia, they have led a dedicated coalition of medical services workers to address facial deformities around the world. 
   Aside from appearance and comfort level, these are serious conditions that can cause problems with feeding and speech, as well as ear disease. 
   In the past 25 years, Operation Smile has provided corrective reconstructive surgery to some 100,000 children and young adults in 25 countries. 
   Operation Smile adeptly recognizes the differences in these countries and brings together medical professionals to tailor their care depending on the setting. The organization coordinates training activities, as well as fellowships and professorships, to further both its own mission and the medical system in these countries overall. 
   Operation Smile provides a network of resources to assist families in the United States with children born with facial deformities. It runs an annual international student leadership conference and student leadership program, and it trains surgeons in certain advanced skills. 
   We can all learn from Operation Smile and the model it provides to medical professionals and organizations around the world, and we can all learn from the Magees that public service can go far beyond one's chosen profession. 
   That is why I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor Operation Smile and William and Kathleen  Magee on the 25th anniversary of their organization. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (COMMENDING THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO FOR ENACTMENT OF A LAW TO IMPROVE THE STATUS OF MARRIED WOMEN -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   H. Res. 294, as amended, commends the government of Lesotho for changing its laws to effectively eliminate legal discrimination against women in Lesotho's legal system. 
   In many parts of the world, women's rights are extremely limited, or barely exist, compared to the rights of men. While women and girls constitute 51 percent of the world's population and make up 70 percent of all agricultural workers, they continue to suffer more from poverty, chronic hunger, HIV/AIDS, and lack of access to education. Women often constitute the highest percentage of those dispossessed of their land, disadvantaged by customary law and traditions which privilege men. Women are often subject to discriminatory laws that restrict their civil, economic and property rights. 
   Until the passage of this law in Lesotho, women were defined as legal in Lesotho after marriage. Lesotho women had no rights to enter into economic transactions without the consent of their husbands. They could not purchase or inherit property and had no standing in the courts. 
   Customary law in Lesotho ensured that property belonged to the husband, or was entrusted to a male relative. In many instances, after the death of a parent or spouse, or in the event of a divorce or after an out-of-court settlement, many married women got nothing other than their personal effects. 
   In November of 2006, His Majesty King Letsie III and the government of Lesotho took a major step towards correcting this grave injustice against women citizens by enacting the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act, giving Lesotho women many of the rights they have long been denied. 
   If faithfully implemented, the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act will be an important vehicle for gender equality in Lesotho. It will certainly go a long way towards reducing the risk of women, particularly widows, divorcees and their children from falling into extreme poverty, which will increase their risk of exposure to the HIV/AIDS pandemic which has devastated the country's poorest population. 
   In a country where nearly 25 percent of adults are infected with HIV/AIDS and the life expectancy of women is 44 years, this new law is crucial to removing barriers to access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services for women and girls. 
   There is still progress that needs to be made on gender equity in Lesotho. According to the State Department, ``a woman married under customary law has no standing in civil court. Under the country's dual legal system, marriages which occur under customary law must be legalized in the civil system to have legal standing.'' 
   But I believe the efforts of the government of Lesotho are showing real progress in the area of promoting equal rights for women, and I believe it's our responsibility to acknowledge the efforts of those people seeking to empower individuals from all walks of society. As right and overdue as it might be to make these changes, that does not make them easy changes in a society that has done things a certain way for so long a time. Hence, if we wish to see more political leaders around the  world stand up and make the effort to change their societies for the better, we should be making as much of an effort here to support those efforts. 
   The actions of the Lesotho government, to guarantee equity for women under the law, will serve as an important model for other African Nations in addressing their national health and poverty challenges, and I look forward to the replication of this law across the continent of Africa. 
   And that is why this resolution also acknowledges another factor in making this change to empower the women of Lesotho.     
   It was through the work of the Millennium Challenge Corporation that we were able to encourage the best instincts of Lesotho's political leadership to make these changes into law. It is instructive to pay attention to how the MCC's leadership convinced Lesotho to make these changes. 
   They did not demand a change as a quid pro quo for MCC assistance. Instead, they appealed to the Lesotho Government's sense of reason, by convincing them that any assistance provided by the United States for economic development would be only half as effective if half of Lesotho's population was excluded from the formal economy. 
   I know we have had some concerns here in Congress about the MCC and its effectiveness, and I think it's important for us to look very carefully at the MCC and our entire U.S. foreign assistance delivery system, because I fear there has been a dreadful lack of effective leadership over this avowed pillar of U.S. foreign policy. 
   But I think there are a great deal of positive lessons to draw from the success of the MCC, and I hope we can support the MCC as it works to strengthen and expand its efforts. 
   I think the MCC's concept and directions are promising, and I hope the MCC's future efforts will bring more opportunities to introduce resolutions such as this one, and I am really proud to have presented this resolution, because that was one of the locations that I was asked to go to as an ambassador. Instead, I went to Micronesia, so I am really, really interested in how they make progress, and particularly how they empower their women. I urge all my colleagues to do the same and support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the U.S. passport system is broken and the average Americans are paying the price. We have heard their call for help and are here today to pass the Passport Backlog Reduction Act to help the State Department address this bureaucratic crisis. 
   Every citizen of our Nation has the right to hold a passport and getting one should only take a few weeks at most, but millions of Americans have had to wait for months on end simply for the right to travel abroad. People are lining up at dawn every day at passport offices around the country trying to salvage trips at the last minute. They are desperate to get the one document that will let them see ailing relatives overseas, conduct important business, or begin studying abroad programs. 
   A passport is much more than a travel document, and these delays are much more than an inconvenience. A passport is proof of American identity and, for many Americans with immigrant heritage, a passport is proof of their identity and commitment to America and the American idea. A passport must be available to any American citizen who requests one, and delays that are currently clogging our system are preventing American citizens from fully exercising their right of citizenship as well as freedom of travel. 
   Three years ago, Congress passed the law requiring travelers to show passports if they were returning from anywhere in the Western hemisphere. Demand for passports in the last year has been at record highs, but poor planning by top officials meant that the State Department was unprepared to cope with the surge in applications. 
   My colleagues and I on the Foreign Affairs Committee have been outraged by this poor planning and the resulting bottleneck. Last week the committee held a hearing on passport delays, and we heard testimony about the hard-working employees who are working through the night and giving up their weekends to clear the backlog of applications. At passport bureaus across the country the State Department has shipped in junior staff, government fellows, and rehired retirees to meet the crushing demand. Yet, phone calls to regional passport bureaus and to consular affairs offices have often gone unanswered on tens of thousands of occasions. Meanwhile, congressional offices  are being flooded with phone calls from outraged citizens. They wonder if their passports have simply disappeared. 
   The Passport Backlog Reduction Act will assist the State Department's efforts to get all of the filed passports back to waiting travelers, and keep up with the demand in the coming months. This bill lifts legal impediments so that the agency can hire retired foreign service officers to process passport applications. Some of these officers will also be permitted to assist the officials who investigate passport fraud to ensure that passports only go to those citizens who are eligible for them and who do not pose a security risk. 
   Endless delays in exercising every citizen's right to a passport are outrageous and absolutely unacceptable. So, I urge my colleagues to support this bill so the House can take one additional step to ensure that our citizens' demands for their passports are met expeditiously. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today to announce the passing of a great American, Quincy Beaver, Sr. Quincy had been a resident of Carson, California, for 38 years. His contributions to his community, the State of California, and the world are legend. He was a passionate advocate for justice and equality and devoted countless hours working in political, civil rights and labor union movements. 
   Quincy's community and social activism span nearly 7 decades. Upon receiving an honorable discharge from the military in 1945, Quincy returned to Los Angeles where he immediately began to serve his community. Given his passionate commitment to service, he was presented numerous accolades and awards that are too numerous to list. 
   But a few of Quincy's leadership positions, honors and awards include Chair of the Employment Labor Committee of the Los Angeles chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, referred to as CORE, board member of the South Central Welfare Planning Council, board member of the Charles R. Drew Community Advisory Council, founding member of the Carson/Torrance NAACP, and Chair of the chapter's First Executive Board, member of the Compton and Long Beach chapters of the NAACP, and board member of the Campaign for a Citizens' Police Review Board. 
   Quincy was a major player in the creation of the Southern California Free South Africa movement and a founding member of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Democratic Club, and elected its first president in 1972. 
   He worked in numerous local, State and national political campaigns; and during the 1972 campaign, Quincy formed the Black Workers for McGovern. In 1984, he founded and served as chairperson of the 31st Congressional District Jesse Jackson for President Campaign. 
   For the last 44 years, Quincy was a member of the California Democratic Council, CDC, a state-wide organization of Democratic clubs where he held numerous positions in the organization, including immediate past president. 
   Quincy was married to Geneva Phillips, who was his friend, his confidant, his caregiver, and the love of his life. They shared a passion for community service and grass-roots politics. He was the proud father of four children. 
   We will sorely miss Quincy's unswerving commitment to community service, quality education, to jobs and to safe working conditions for all people. We will certainly miss his community activism. Dear Quincy, rest in peace.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today to commend the University of Southern California, located in my district, Trojan football team for its victory in the 2007 Rose Bowl. The Trojans' Rose Bowl victory puts an exclamation mark on a successful 2006-2007 season as well as years of unparalleled Trojan football excellence. Let me cite just a few examples of the football team's long list of accomplishments: 
   The USC Trojan football team achieved its fifth consecutive AP top 4 finish. Its appearance in the 2007 Rose Bowl marked an unprecedented fifth consecutive Bowl Championship Series bid. The team won an unprecedented fifth consecutive PAC-10 Conference championship. It maintained a top 10 ranking in the AP College Football Poll for the past 56 editions. And the football team won 56 of its last 60 games. 
   It is noteworthy that the USC Trojan football team accomplished these feats while playing the second most difficult schedule in the Nation. 
   The victory of the USC Trojan football team also exemplifies the excellence of the University of Southern California as not only an athletic powerhouse but also an academic institution of higher learning. USC has established itself as a leader in the fields of communications, media, the sciences, as well as the arts. It is home to one of the best, if not the best, schools of film in the United States. It also boasts a world-renowned school of music. 
   USC is the oldest private research university in the West and is a critical part of the 33rd Congressional District of California. It is home to 33,000 students, 3,100 faculty, and 7,900 employees. It is the largest private employer in the City of Los Angeles. Its physicians serve more than 1 million patients a year. Its Educational Opportunity Programs Center has provided academic enrichment and support services to thousands of neighborhood residents.  
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I commend both the University of Southern California's football team for its victory in the 2007 Rose Bowl; its coach, Pete Carroll; its athletic director, Mike Garrett; as well as the coaches, students, alumni, and staff who were instrumental in USC's Rose Bowl victory. 
   And I just need to add this: I want to also commend the University of Southern California and its president, Steven B. Sample, for taking in 130 students from New Orleans when their university had flooded. And they not only allowed them to come there and admitted them, but they gave them room and board at a time of great need. 
   So USC and its president have played a major role in the continuous success of the University of Southern California; the City of Los Angeles; and the people of the Golden State, California.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise this evening to celebrate the life of my very good friend and colleague, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald. 
   I personally have known Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald for over 30 years. Our time together spans back before her days as a Member of this distinguished body when I was member of the Los Angeles Unified School Board and she was there as an administrator and then as a California State legislator. And then on that road she was elected to the Carson City Council. 
   Juanita's distinguished life is a life of ``firsts.'' She is the first African American woman in history to chair the Committee on House Administration, which oversees the operation of the House, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institute, and the National Zoo. The Committee on House Administration also oversees all Federal elections. Juanita worked tirelessly to investigate all reports of voter irregularities and voter disenfranchisement. She was one of the first Members of Congress to call for a congressional hearing on reported voting irregularities in the State of Ohio. She played an important role in congressional election reform. 
   Juanita Millender-McDonald was also the first African-American woman to serve on the Carson City Council and the first to hold the position of chairwoman for two powerful California State Assembly committees in her first term. 
   Like myself, Juanita Millender-McDonald at heart was an educator. After raising five children, Juanita, at the age of 40, returned to school and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Redlands and a master's degree in educational administration from Cal State L.A. 
   She spent her early career in the classroom, teaching high school and working at a career center. It is here that Juanita first demonstrated her ongoing interest in the lives of young people and issues that impact the lives of women and their children. But above all, Juanita worked tirelessly for all the people in her community. And I want to say, all the people. She was a people person who had an uncanny skill to build and sustain networks. 
   As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, JUANITA worked, again, tirelessly to secure much-needed Federal assistance for Southern California's transportation needs, including funding for her passion: for the Alameda Corridor. 
   Juanita's passing is a great loss to this institution as well as her constituents and as well as this Nation. She was a great citizen as well as a great person and would have made a lasting and important contribution to this body in her position as House Administration chair. She was making that contribution every single day. 
   And I would say to her, Juanita, you missed the caucus. You missed the California Caucus. You missed the Black Caucus. 
   She said, I am so busy working, I don't have time for the caucuses. She was committed. 
   And on a personal note, Madam Speaker, when she was sworn in as a Congresswoman in her district, I went there. She had been sworn in here, and when she got up to speak, she said, You know, I was raised on a farm and I married early. And she said, I was so naive, when I had five children one after another, I just knew it was that orange juice, being raised on a farm. So I would tease her. I said, ``Juanita, watch out for the orange juice.'' 
   She was one of my closest friends and colleagues. She will be missed. And I want you to know she was raised by a father and her older sisters. She was the youngest. So she said, You know, on a farm we were wealthy. And she said, But it was my father who played the role of both parents. He set down the principles and values by which I run my life. So in honor of my father, I am adding as my middle name, my maiden name, his last name. So, therefore, she became Juanita Millender-McDonald. And if you ever saw her signature, it was one of the most beautiful, graceful signatures. And she always took time to write ``Juanita Millender-McDonald.'' And I would go on correcting people when they said ``Juanita McDonald.'' I said, ``No. Juanita Millender-McDonald.'' 
   So, Juanita, we celebrate you and we know that you are here in these Chambers today. And to end my piece and allow the others, we did a taping with our voices on it, and at the end we sang to her ``Dreamgirls.'' We will always be dreaming of our Juanita Millender-McDonald.

   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, it is with sadness that I join my colleagues here on the floor this evening to pay tribute to a colleague who we lost far too soon. 
   I was saddened to hear the news yesterday of Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald's passing. Juanita was really a woman of many firsts, who broke down countless barriers for women and for African Americans. 
   While the history books no doubt will list the numerous accomplishments of her long career, I will remember her best as a champion for economic opportunity and empowerment for the people of Long Beach and Los Angeles. I was pleased to have had the opportunity to work with her on many issues important to the communities shared by our adjacent districts. When workers, for example, in our communities who assembled the C-17 aircraft, faced the prospect of their assembly plant shutting down and losing their jobs, Juanita led the fight to make sure that those jobs were not lost. And she succeeded, and hundreds of people's lives are better off today thanks to her hard work. 
   When I first joined Congress, Juanita took the time and made a special effort to introduce me to many of the local leaders in the African-American communities that straddle our districts. This was very thoughtful of her and I will always be in her debt for it. 
   We here in Congress will certainly miss her insight, her experience, and her energy. And I will most certainly miss her beautiful smile and her unforgettable style because she truly is an unforgettable woman. 
   I am sure that her constituents will miss her tireless advocacy on their behalf. They and we have lost a fine public servant, and we have lost a tremendously fine colleague. But most of all, my thoughts tonight are with her husband, their children and grandchildren, and their extended family. I wish them all the strength during this difficult time, and I want them to know that Juanita is truly an incredible woman who shall not be forgotten.

   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, I want to know why the Intelligence Committee did not receive the confidential information that I am hearing is going to be discussed here. If the information discussed here is not confidential, why do we need a secret session and to what end are we having this? We are supposed to vote on FISA tomorrow. I understand there is a compromise that pretty much has been agreed upon. I have been whipping it. 
   So I want to know to what end we are having this secret session. I would like to yield to you, Mr. Blunt.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, with 8 straight months of job losses, the Bush economy has now shed 605,000 jobs this year. The state of our Nation's economy is a direct result of economic policies Washington Republicans have been waiting decades to implement. But it wasn't until they had control of all levels of power from 2001 to 2007 that they fully implemented their strategy. Middle class families are now paying the price. 
   For 7 years now President Bush and congressional Republicans have been looking out for the wealthiest few while 2.5 million more Americans are unemployed and nearly 5 million more Americans live in poverty. While the price of groceries, gasoline, and health care have all gone up, the purchasing power of a middle income salary has fallen over the last 7 years. Real wages have only grown .3 percent since 2000, compared to 7.7 percent growth during the Clinton years in the 1990s. 
   Mr. Speaker, middle class families fair much better economically when a Democrat inhabits the White House. The American people should support real change in November.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, for 7 years now, Washington Republicans have allowed Big Oil to run our Nation's energy policy. From the very first days of this administration, Vice President Cheney was meeting in secret with energy executives to develop its energy proposal. Today we see the results of that secret policy that was approved by a rubber-stamp Republican Congress. When President Bush took office, the average price of gas was $1.47. Today, it has more than doubled to an average hovering around $4. 
   Since taking control of Congress last year, Democrats have rejected the failed Republican policies that are responsible for these record high prices. We are working to lower prices by cracking down on price gouging, holding OPEC accountable for price fixing, repealing subsidies for profit-rich oil companies, and instead investing in renewable energy. 
   Each of these efforts have received some partisan support, but the Republican leadership of this House and the President continue to oppose our efforts.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, this will be the first of a special order pinpointing and focusing on the need for universal health care insurance. 
   There will be speakers today that will point up various areas of need. But in opening this hour, I would like to say that over the past 15 years there has been incremental reforms that have expanded health care coverage to limited populations and have crowded out an increasing number of Americans from the private insurance market. 
   Preventable and mismanaged chronic disease, such as asthma, cancer, diabetes and heart disease, are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and account for the vast majority of health care spending. They have affected the quality of life for 133 million Americans and are responsible for 7 out of every 10 deaths in the United States, killing more than 1.7 million Americans every year. Chronic diseases are also the primary driver of health care costs, accounting for more than 75 cents of every dollar we spend on health care in this country. 
   As reported by the Centers for Disease Control, in 2005, this amounted to $1.5 trillion of the trillions spent on health. Despite worldwide problems, the issue of chronic disease does not register with large segments of the public. As policymakers, we must raise the awareness of the health care crisis on this issue of the uninsured and underinsured as a primary concern in Congress. 
   Now, there is legislation to ensure that all Americans will have access guaranteed by law through the highest quality and most cost-effective health care services, regardless of their employment, income or health status. 
   The following Members will be speaking on this issue, and I call up as the first speaker the young lady from Texas, Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee.

   Ms. WATSON. I just want to say that Members in this first hour have struck a chord with the American people and the needs. And when we talk about homeland security, it is not the land, it's the people on the land. And I am very disturbed that we're losing too many of our people who help defend this land to all kinds of diseases and health problems that need not be. With the proper kind of access to health care, we wouldn't be seeing so many of our viable citizens perish. We could do something about it. 
   So we intend, Mr. Speaker, to have a series of these discussions with America. And we do hope that maybe we can pull in CNN, Nightline, that's ABC, Channel 7, to hold a periodic series of these discussions about access to health care. 
   We do hope that you're able to make your presentation at this time, Mr. Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. I would just like to read some of the 51 stories of Americans with cancer who suddenly find themselves overburdened with medical bills, and they have gaps in their coverage. These are real people, Mr. Speaker. These are real Americans who are calling out to us. 
   As you know, we've had two very fine proposals coming from Senator HILLARY CLINTON and Senator BARACK OBAMA that would address access to health care. 
   Over on our side, in our House, we have the valiant efforts over the years of Congressman JOHN CONYERS, JR. He would have been here today, but there was a conflict. But he will continue the drum beat and the call for us to get down to business so we can have accessible health care. 
   I'd like to take some time to read you the plight of real Americans. This one is Susan M. She said, ``My husband, Tom, was diagnosed with lymphoma in 1996, just 4 months after our daughter was born. He underwent three series of chemotherapy before dying of encephalitis in 2001. At that time the entire family was insured through his employer. 
   ``The monthly premiums went to $900 per month, and since I had left my job to care for him, I didn't have many options. I was able to get the kids covered by Medicaid, and I signed up for Ingram Health, which only covers doctors visits and prescriptions, not hospitalization or long-term treatment. This carried us along until a mammogram showed I had breast cancer in 2006, then I was put in to the breast and cervical cancer program. I received excellent care and am currently cancer-free. 
   ``Earlier this year I took a contract position for 6 months at 20 to 30 hours per week. Working again helped my attitude tremendously. The depression I had struggled with for 10 years started to lift, and I was feeling positive about my future prospects. 
   ``But, of course, the extra income meant that my kids were no longer eligible for Medicaid. So I had the added stress of finding insurance for them. I was afraid that my eligibility in the breast and cervical cancer program was also in jeopardy, so I never told my case manager about working. 
   ``Now, the contract has run out and I'm looking for work again. I'm afraid that my coverage under the breast and cancer program will end before I can  get a job with benefits. And the bill for the children's insurance will be due in a few weeks. And I worry about what impact a pre-existing condition will have on my job prospects. 
   ``It doesn't seem fair that my health should be tied so punitively to a job. It just adds to the emotional stress, which is already too high. 
   ``Thank you for reading and thank you for caring.'' 
   That was from Susan M. 
   Jennifer G says, ``My mother suffered and died with ovarian cancer. It was terrible. And as with many ovarian cancers, hers was not detected until it was way too late for successful treatment. 
   I am 36 years old now. My husband and I are finished having children. My doctor recommended that I have a hysterectomy because my risk of getting ovarian cancer is much higher now. 
   I am lucky enough to have health insurance. Unfortunately, an accountant working for the insurance company is able to override what my doctor recommends because they don't want to pay for it. They would rather take the gamble that I may or may not get the cancer. I, of course, would rather not gamble with my life. 
   ``I am all for everyone having health insurance and having access to whatever health care they need. However, being covered by health insurance does not guarantee that you will get the treatment you need or any treatment that your doctor might recommend. 
   ``It is not enough to demand coverage for all people. Insurance companies would still have the power to say no any time they want to save some money. 
   ``And I don't have the solutions. I can just recommend that this is a problem on two levels. Getting some kind of universal health care coverage will just be the first step. Getting insurance companies to cooperate with doctors decisions will be the next step. This is where much of the reform will need to happen. 
   ``Plus, I know several people who are fighting cancer and recovering from cancer. All of them have health insurance. Most of them are being denied coverage for medicine to fight their cancer. It is pathetic to have health insurance and not be able to count on it to help you when you need it the most.'' 
   And Mr. Speaker, just this morning, I was called to be told that one of our dear friends and PR persons died of cancer at 2 a.m. this morning. Her name was Pat Tobin. She came from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Los Angeles a couple of decades ago. She has a daughter, a sister. 
   And we went to her bedside on Friday, and I could see at that point that she possibly would not make it through the night. But she did. She made it until 2:00 a.m. this morning. 
   And I tell about that particular account because if we could set priorities in this country to cover the health needs of all Americans, rather than pour billions of dollars into a conflict 10,000 miles away, that I see never ending, and I see us involving ourselves in sectorial problems that we don't even understand. We don't even understand the language the people speak. How in the world could we understand their customs and their conflicts with each other? 
   If we could take that money out of the gopher hole it's in and put it into research in this country to stop this deadly epidemic of cancer throughout our land, wouldn't this make our country stronger? 
   We're losing 4,000, we have lost 4,090 people, and countless innocent Iraqis and others. I hear it could be as much as 300,000. 
   But no, we stupidly, stupidly and incorrectly continue to dump monies, and we don't even take care of our own domestic priorities. 
   We argued over health care for children? Every child in this country, whether that child is here with legal papers or not, not only deserves an education, but deserves health care. What kind of country are we that let its own people die because insurance companies are saying oh, no, that's too much? 
   And we never see their actuarial data, by the way, Mr. Speaker. That actuarial data could go into investments that fail. We don't know it. They just up the premium. 
   And when you have a catastrophic illness or a long-term illness, it could bankrupt you. Look at Ed McMahon, Tonight Show host, along with Johnny Carson, for decades. And now he's on CNN on the Larry King Show, talking about his broken neck and his injuries, and now his Malibu home is in foreclosure.     
   That's an American of prominence who was worth at one time $100 million. But a catastrophic illness could run you into bankruptcy. And that story is told many, many times. 
   I will not take the time now, Mr. Speaker, but these are actual people with actual stories. And we are the policymakers, and we're going to continue to tell their stories night after night until we, as a body, until we, as the Congress, can come together and set our priorities on what is really necessary to keep America strong. And it might take a new administration. 
   So we're going to lay the groundwork for the next President and Commander in Chief of these United States to choose prosperity, to choose health care, to choose education, to choose social services over profiteering by your best buddies in the oil industry. You can read between those lines. And we hope that the next President of the United States will set, as its higher goal, to keep America healthy and be sure that every single American and persons here can get that kind of health care. So together we can conquer. 
   We should not lose another person to cancer. We should not in this country because we should have done the kind of in-depth research and tests so that we could come up with various prescriptions and remedies to save the lives of so many worthy people. 
   Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker, for this time. We will be back again another night.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, just how long are congressional Republicans going to follow President Bush's lead? Thanks to 7 years of Bush policies, Americans are facing skyrocketing costs for basic necessities. Millions of families have lost their homes, unemployment is rising, and 7 million more Americans are uninsured. 
   You would think any one of these statistics would send congressional Republicans looking for a different solution. Instead, it appears a plan to blindly follow until the finish. 
   When the President vetoed a bipartisan bill that would provide health coverage to 10 million children, House Republicans stood with President Bush twice in supporting his veto. When the President vetoed legislation for stem cell research that could lead to cures for diseases such as diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's, House Republicans once again stood by President Bush and upheld his veto. Then last week a majority of Republicans refused to provide relief to 3.8 million Americans who are struggling to find new jobs. 
   When are congressional Republicans going to realize that following President Bush is not the answer?

   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, in past State of the Union addresses, the President has promised the American people that he will strengthen America's security. Unfortunately, his policies have made the world more dangerous and America less safe. Now he wants to escalate the war in Iraq, despite the overwhelming opposition of the American people and many of his own generals. 
   After years of insisting we ``stay the course'' in Iraq, the President has finally decided to make a change. Unfortunately, it is one that puts more Americans in danger and further compromises our security here at home. There is no doubt that the war in Iraq was the defining issue during last year's election. Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of a change in course, but not the one now proposed by President Bush. 
   Madam Speaker, tonight President Bush has a chance to show he has listened to the American people, his own generals, and Democratic and Republican Members of Congress.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, I want to add my remarks to those of my colleagues, but I have got some personal things to tell you. 
   Yes, he had that compassionate spirit. His unwavering concern for individual human rights and his deep knowledge of the world were an inspiration to us all. I remember when my predecessor passed away, I got a call at my embassy saying that if you should come to Congress, there is a place on Foreign Affairs for you. I hadn't even said I was going to come. Well, the results were I did. 
   I sit with honor among my colleagues on Foreign Affairs. I had the privilege to be trained at the State Department twice with his son-in-law, one of those rare specimens of humanity that he allowed to marry Katrina, his daughter. And I said to TOM after Katrina in Louisiana, ``I'm so sorry that Katrina has to go around through life after this terrible, terrible hurricane and present herself as `Katrina.' '' 
   He said, ``She's strong like I am. She can survive.'' 
   But I knew that when he called on me to lead the delegation to Italy, something that he looked forward to every year to continue our dialogue with Great Britain, I knew something was not right, but that proud, distinguished, tall-standing human being never uttered a word. And so I kind of knew something was up. 
   When I got back, I said to him, ``Thank you for the honor of going to Portofino and leading the group in your place.'' He said, ``Ambassador, you deserve that,'' and never said another word. 
   Then he called us together and he said, ``Travel, learn what is happening around this globe.'' And that is what we are doing. We are carrying on his legacy by learning the world, knowing it the way he did. 
   We will certainly miss this giant of a human being.

   Ms. WATSON. Madam Chairman, I just returned from South Africa, and I did a single codel visiting the various clinics and hospices that are receiving PEPFAR funds. And I happily report that the small donations they do receive are stretched beyond imagination. They are finally realizing that the NGOs have really made great strides. 
   About 4 years ago, when we went offering them assistance and so on, most of our help was rejected. But I want you to know that one clinic, which is a hospice, gets $70,000 a year. And what they do is reach out to the NGOs in the area. There are volunteers from America there. They run an excellent facility, and you can see gradual progress. 
   I was told by our appointed ambassador that he was going to reduce the amount of donation by $50 million, and I cautioned him because that would be the wrong message to send for the small successes they have had and that what we can do is say to the government there that we will cap it at a certain amount and then you need to also kick in. 
   So I want to report to our committee and to Mr. Payne, the Chair, that the funds are working. They're improving our image, and they're helping to save lives in South Africa.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, Washington Republicans are not leveling with the American people on the immediate effects of the expiration of the Protect America Act. Despite their fear-mongering, even the Bush administration admits that it still has the ability to continue all its wide-ranging surveillance for another 6 months. 
   Kate Martin, Director of the Center for National Security Studies, said, ``If the government learns of new individuals plotting terrorist activities, it can immediately surveil such individuals, the court can issue an order within minutes of being asked, or the government can start surveillance without a court order under the existing FISA emergency authority.'' 
   Richard Clarke said, ``The President misconstrued the truth and manipulated the facts. It was wrong to suggest that warrants issued in compliance with FISA would suddenly evaporate with congressional inaction.''

   Ms. WATSON. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas. 
   I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 335 which authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds on Thursday, July 17, for a celebration of the 100th anniversary of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. 
   In January of this year, the sorority began its year-long celebration of its 100-year anniversary. Founded in 1908 on the campus of Howard University in Washington, DC, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated is the first Greek-letter organization founded by African American college women. 
   Alpha Kappa Alpha is a sisterhood of women who have consciously chosen to improve the socioeconomic conditions in their city, in their State, in the Nation and in the world. Its history tells a story of changing patterns of human relations in America in the 20th Century. The small group who organized the sorority was just 1 generation removed from slavery. 
   Through the years, the sorority directed its efforts towards improving the quality of life for all mankind, while living our sorority's motto, ``by culture and by merit.'' 
   I am so proud to count myself and Eddie Bernice Johnson as members and proud members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. Throughout the years, I have witnessed firsthand how the power, vision and commitment of our founders and members have inspired Alpha Kappa Alpha to endure and prosper through 10 decades. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 335, which will ensure that a vital component of the 100th anniversary celebration will take place on these distinguished grounds of the United States Capitol. 
   I want you to know, our membership is very tuned in to the issues that we face domestically and we face internationally. And they would want to see all of us be able to benefit from the legislation that is passing both Chambers and going to the Governor to reduce the prices of oil, to address our infrastructure, to provide the right to health care for every American, to be sure that Americans can receive and realize the American dream to home ownership. 
   I am so proud to stand here in support of H. Con. Res. 335, to allow our membership to come in and get into this progressive atmosphere and to celebrate their 100th year of existence.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, please let me set the record straight on congressional action on gas prices. 
   We now have a law, it is the farm bill, the historic investment in affordable biofuels, and beefed-up oversight on market manipulation. The President's veto was overridden on May 21 of this year. We also have the Renewable Energy and Job Act. It was passed on May 21 and there is a threat of a veto, but it was passed. Then, the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act, holding OPEC and oil companies accountable for price fixing, and it passed on May 20, it is also under a veto threat. 
   Now we have a law, Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act. It was passed on May 13 and it had a pretty hefty vote to take it out of this House, it is now law. Let's set the record straight. 
   We also repealed subsidies to profit-rich big oil companies, and invest in renewable energy. It also is under veto threat. It passed here at the beginning of the year, February 27. We also have a law, Energy Independence Law with Market Manipulation Ban & New Vehicle Mileage Standards. It is now law. It passed the House last year on December 18, 2007. 
   We have another bill that is under a veto threat, a crackdown on gas price gouging. It passed the House on another pretty hefty vote that was bipartisan; it passed on May 23. And, Hold OPEC Accountable for Oil Price Fixing, it passed on May 22 on a vote of 345-72, and it is under veto threat. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, you are going to hear that the Democrats aren't doing anything, but let me give you the exact votes on all of these bills. 
   The Republican leader, John Boehner, voted ``no'' on OPEC price fixing, oil fixing. He voted ``no'' on price gouging. He voted ``no'' on renewable energy. He voted ``no'' on energy security. 
   Roy Blunt voted ``no'' on OPEC price fixing, ``no'' on price gouging, and ``no'' on renewable energy. 
   Adam Putnam voted ``no'' on price gouging and renewable energy. 
   Thaddeus McCotter voted ``no'' on renewable energy and ``no'' on energy security. 
   And it goes on and on and on. 
   So to set the record straight, we are putting out sound bills to address the oil, shall I say, surge in price, because in my city of Los Angeles I was astounded when I got home to see that Diesel 2 sells in Los Angeles on the average for $4.99.9. I am sure when I get back to Los Angeles in a week it will be $5. The average price of gas in Los Angeles, in my district, and really throughout California, is $4.12 a gallon. 
   Madam Speaker, we are proposing good and sound legislation to address the needs for energy and renewable energy sources in the United States of America so our constituencies can get back and forth to work and enjoy a better life, and so we need the help of the other party because this should not be an issue that is partisan. It is an issue for America.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I regret that the Los Angeles Unified School District in California lost one of its most prestigious leaders. Ron Prescott died a week ago, and for over 30 years he represented the district in Sacramento, California, the capital. 
   Ron Prescott, over the years, was voted one of the top lobbyists for children. He was charismatic, he was diplomatic, but most of all, he was dedicated to the children of our State, and particularly the second largest school district. 
   Ron Prescott had a way of influencing you to do the right thing. When there were several attempts to break up the unified school district, it was Ron that saved our district.  
   When you needed to know the facts on funding for certain programs, it was Ron who was there with the facts. 
   He was never the kind to be obnoxious, but the kind that you could understand. He was always clear. He was always factual. He was always committed. 
   We have lost a great educator. We mourn his loss.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD JOIN US IN OVERRIDING THE PRESIDENT'S CHIP VETO -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Madam Speaker, 10 years ago, the Children's Health Insurance Program was created in a strong bipartisan fashion to ensure more low-income children have access to quality health care. Today, thanks to CHIP, 6 million children who would otherwise be uninsured can see the doctor of their family's choice any time they want. 
   For the first 8 years of the CHIP program, the number of uninsured children fell significantly, but that changed 2 years ago, and the trend continued last year when 700,000 more children joined the ranks of the uninsured. That was simply unacceptable to many of us here in Congress, and that's why we crafted a final bipartisan agreement that not only continues to provide health care access to 6 million kids who are already in the program, but also to 4 million others who are also eligible for CHIP. If the President had  his way, the number of uninsured children would go up by at least 800,000 over the next year. That is why we need to override his veto today.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (CALLING ON UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TO CHARGE IRANIAN PRESIDENT WITH CERTAIN VIOLATIONS BECAUSE OF HIS CALLS FOR DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
   Every Member of Congress is disturbed by the offensive comments that regularly emanate from the mouth of the Iranian President. His pledge to wipe Israel off the map and his denial of the Holocaust have shocked the civilized world. 
   I am among those who feel it is no longer enough simply to shake our heads disapprovingly and go about our business. Context is everything. 
   We are talking about a Jewish majority nation, Israel, whose very existence is threatened by another nation developing a nuclear bomb. Less than three-quarters of a century ago, Hitler and Nazi Germany wiped out more than a third of the world's Jewish population. We cannot stand by and watch if the Iranian President has similar designs. 
   When Ahmadinejad says that Israel is a legitimate regime with no basis for its existence, our sense of justice tells us we cannot simply ignore it. When he describes Israel as ``a disgraceful blot [on] the face of the Islamic world'' and declares that ``anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury,'' we can't, as people of conscience, dismiss these words as mere rhetoric. 
   That is the premise of this resolution. This resolution urges us not to shrug, but to take action. It calls on the United Nations Security Council to charge Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with Article 2, section 4, of the United Nations Charter, which requires all member states of the United Nations to refrain in their international relations from the threat  or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Even more poignantly, it calls for the Security Council to charge Ahmadinejad with violating the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which forbids direct and public incitement of genocide. 
   I strongly endorse the premise of this resolution, that we should take seriously Ahmadinejad's venomous rhetoric and respond in a serious fashion that will demonstrate our fortitude in stopping him. With this measure, we also set an example by serving notice to other bigoted world leaders that we will not tolerate racism and thinly veiled threats. 
   We should be more than happy to set aside any notion of prosecuting President Ahmadinejad under the Genocide Convention were the President to renounce his previous positions on the Holocaust and on Israel. In the absence of such apologies, however, the administration should initiate action that would result in the prosecution of President Ahmadinejad for crimes under the genocide convention and to do so without delay. 
   I strongly support this resolution. I urge all my colleagues to do likewise to send a message to Iran. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (NOTING KILLINGS OF DOZENS OF INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA AND CALLING ON RUSSIAN PRESIDENT TO AUTHORIZE COOPERATION WITH OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would like to commend our distinguished colleague Mr. Chris Smith of New Jersey for introducing this important resolution that emphasizes the vital necessity of free speech in a democratic state. Often people consider freedom of speech as just icing on the cake of a society that treats its citizenry well. It's a nice touch but not the most essential component. 
   But let me be clear, freedom of the press is not just a bourgeois middle class concern. It is not just an American concern. It is the essential component of democracy, as much as in Russia as anywhere else. 
   Freedom of the press sharpens the tools of democracy and holds a government's feet to the fire. It is the only real way to inform the people about their own country and mobilizing them around crucial issues. 
   Nowhere is this more important than in Russia, where nascent independent press formed in the early 1990s had suddenly dissipated under fear of government reprisal. It is no mistake that this decline has been accompanied by a simultaneous acquiescence of democratic opposition in the country. 
   The threat to reporters writing about government decisions and engaging in investigative journalism is immediate and real. It has reached the point that journalists in Russia that dare to criticize the government are constantly looking over their shoulders in fear. 
   According to Reporters Without Borders, 21 reporters have been murdered under mysterious circumstances since Putin took office in March of 2000. Almost all of those mysteries remain unsolved because the Putin government refuses to investigate fully and honestly. 
   In the case that has led to perhaps the greatest outcry, Anna Politkovskaya was shot to death in the elevator bank of her apartment building in Moscow. She and her family had feared for her life ever since she emerged as an acclaimed journalist and human rights activist. She wrote numerous articles critical of Kremlin human rights abuses and misdeeds in Chechnya, and she paid the highest price for it. 
   Paul Klebnikov, the editor of the Russian version of Forbes magazine, investigated suspect business dealings and was subsequently shot to death in Moscow. 
   Ivan Safronov, a military affairs reporter who criticized the failure of Russian military programs, died in mysterious circumstances after falling five stories from a window in his apartment building. 
   These three deaths, as well as the tragic loss of many of their brave colleagues, remain unresolved. It appears that the Russian government, which is led by a former KGB colonel, somehow no longer knows how to investigate such crimes. I find that awfully curious. 
   We cannot allow this repression, this silencing of an independent media, to continue, especially in a country with a nascent democracy and starved for objective information. 
   There was a fleeting moment in Russia in the early 1990s when an independent media flourished and new publications cropped up overnight. Now, the brave critical journalists who remain cower in fear. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, which highlights the disturbing trend of these suspicious deaths in Russia. It stresses the importance of a free flow of information to a democratic society, and praises the courageous men and women who seek to bring transparency to the Russian people after so many years of Communist secrecy. 
   Finally, it calls on President Putin to seek outside help in investigating these unsolved crimes and on the United States Government to formally offer such assistance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WATSON. (CALLING ON GOVERNMENT OF UGANDA AND LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY TO RECOMMIT TO POLITICAL SOLUTION IN NORTHERN UGANDA -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Hank Johnson, for sponsoring this important and timely resolution on the nightmarish conflict in northern Uganda. 
   Two decades of horrific battle between the Lord's Resistance Army and the Ugandan government have taken up to 200,000 lives and displaced nearly 2 million civilians from their homes. But the human tragedy in Uganda cannot be simply represented but numbers and statistics. It is about the daily pain and terror of victims and their families. 
   Like other rebel forces that have fought the tragic civil wars of Africa, the Lord's Resistance Army built its ranks with child soldiers, both girls and boys, and used vicious and unspeakable methods to alienate these children from their families and their villages. Time and again, Uganda child victims have been forced to commit unthinkable acts, to kill their parents and other relatives before being abducted themselves. 
   Over two decades of war, more than 30,000 children have been kidnapped and faced a horrible fate, becoming absorbed into the LRA. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of terrified children leave their home villages each evening at dusk and walk to distant towns to avoid being kidnapped by the LRA and pressed into service. They are known in Uganda as the ``night commuters.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, every parent in the United States labors to reassure their young children that they are safe at home when sleeping in their own beds. The greatest crime of the Lord's Resistance Army is to take even this basic right away from children and families of northern Uganda. 
   While the LRA is responsible for the overwhelming majority of violence and abuse of children and their families, the government of Uganda also has been cited time and again for human rights violations. In August of last year, South Sudan's President brokered a cessation of hostilities agreement between the government and the rebel forces, but the accord broke down and only last month did the 10-month effort resume. 
   I believe the Uganda people deserve both peace and justice. It is incumbent upon the international community to work with Uganda people, particularly the people of northern Uganda, along with the International Criminal Court and the Ugandan judiciary, to make sure both a lasting peace and real justice are achieved. 
   The healing and the recovery of the Uganda people, particularly the children, from this tragic war, requires that we make their personal peace the priority right now. It is the only path to lasting stability for northern Uganda. That is why I urge the passage of this legislation, to put Uganda on a path to peace once again. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would first like to commend our distinguished colleague, Mr. Cliff Stearns of Florida, for introducing this important resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise today in strong support for this measure, which recognizes over 200 years of sovereignty of Liechtenstein and supports efforts by the United States to strengthen and further its relationships with this country. Liechtenstein may be small in size, but it is big in stature. 
   Just square 62 miles and nestled in the heart of Europe between Switzerland and Austria, it boasts 35,000 inhabitants, a strong democratic government and a constitutional heredity monarchy. Its mountain landscapes have made it renowned as one of the most beautiful countries in Europe. The country punches well above its weight in its contributions to the global banking and financial sectors. 
   In just the last 60 years, it has developed from a mainly agrarian society to one of the most highly industrialized countries in the world. Indeed, its economic growth should serve as the model for the potential of all small countries. It has become a strong economic partner for the United States, which has been the largest export market for Liechtenstein over the past 10 years. 
   In addition, Liechtenstein-based companies have created over 4,500 jobs in the United States, mainly in manufacturing, sales and service. Given the celebration last year of Liechtenstein's 200 years of sovereignty, it is fitting that the House pass this resolution to pay tribute to the country's democratic tradition and prosperity. 
   Furthermore, in recognition of the important partnership between the United States and Liechtenstein in the areas of politics, economics and security, this resolution calls on the United States to strengthen and further its relationship with Liechtenstein. 
   I strongly support this resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would first like to commend our distinguished colleague, Mr. Nadler of New York, for introducing this resolution. The resolution before the House honors one man, but it also honors all that he symbolizes in the name of human rights and freedom of worship. 
   Before the Holocaust, the Jewish population of the Society Union numbered 5 million. After the war, only 2 million remained. The pain of these Holocaust survivors was compounded. They became the targets of a ruthless and systematic campaign to strip them of their communal rights and Jewish identity. 
   This resolution pays tribute to a remarkable man who stood up for these victims of brutality. Jacob Birnbaum launched an effort, which turned into a groundswell, to protest the Soviet Union's abhorrent efforts to extinguish the religious, cultural and communal identity of the Jewish people. 
   His movement began in 1964 as a humble yet bold student group organized to march on the Soviet Union to the United Nations. Over the years, the group conducted rallies in New York and Washington, circulated petitions, and used every possible means to keep world attention on the plight of the Soviet Jews. This social activism snowballed into the solidarity marches of the 1970s that gathered millions of individuals to fight for the cause. 
   Birnbaum also worked with the authors of the historic Jackson-Vanik amendment to help free Soviet Jews looking to emigrate. In this way, he helped to elevate the movement so that the U.S. Federal Government had to pay attention and to act. But his dogged and determined work continued, even as the Soviet bloc crumbled and anti-Semitism flared in incidents across the region. Mr. Birmbaum continues to work with educational institutions for former Jews as part of the ``Let My People Know'' campaign. 
   Through the years, Jacob Birnbaum has received numerous honors for his services to mankind. He deserves this further accolade on behalf of a grateful Congress for engaging so energetically in a cause that we have long supported, helping to free Soviet Jews from oppression and to help them thrive. 
   To Jews in Russia and the former Soviet Republic, the name Jacob Birnbaum refers not only to one dedicated man but to the very cause of freedom itself. 
   I support this resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Thank you very much, Chairman Lantos. And thank you, Chairman Skelton, for crafting this resolution and giving us the opportunity to discuss the war. And I want to thank our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has been steadfast in moving this Congress and this country towards an honorable exit from our occupation of Iraq. 
   We are now 6 months into President Bush's vaunted escalation of the war in Iraq, and we are not seeing progress. Recently, the Washington Post reported that U.S. military commanders are increasingly relying on Sunni militias to fight insurgent groups. Our military officers are giving these militias weapons and intelligence and setting them loose. 
   Mr. Speaker, just a few months ago, the President told us he needed to escalate the commitment of the United States soldiers to Iraq to disarm ethnic militia. Now, we are arming them? Just a few months ago, the President told us that ethnic militias were undermining the security and stability of Iraq. Now, they are the guarantors of the stability and security of Iraq? 
   When the President's strategy for victory involves arming the people who, just a few months ago, were our sworn enemies, it becomes difficult for any of us to explain to our constituents what our troops are still doing there in Iraq. 
   The troops have done their job, and in an honorable way, but they will not be successful if the President cannot decide what the mission really is. And I remember him several years ago saying ``mission accomplished.'' I am sure we will hear from a number of people here that we need to give the escalation more time, that we need to wait until September. I'm not willing to do that, Mr. Speaker. I'm not willing to explain to the families of the soldiers who will die between now and September that it took an extra 3 months to figure out the President's plan, and there has been no strategy given to us for success.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Chairman, childhood obesity is a growing problem in our country. We already know that obesity leads to a greater risk of heart disease, diabetes and a host of other cardiovascular problems. 
   According to data from a California physical fitness testing program, among fifth, seventh and eighth graders in Los Angeles County public schools, 22 percent of students are overweight. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Los Angeles high schools, 16 percent of students were overweight and 18 percent are at risk of becoming overweight. 
   Mr. Chairman, this alarming trend in childhood obesity is not only a problem for Los Angeles, but for our Nation. Seventeen percent of our Nation's children aged 12 through 19 are overweight. Overweight children and adolescents are more likely to become obese as adults. 
   If we want to reverse this trend and effectively reduce childhood obesity, we need to ensure that school breakfasts and school lunch programs clearly communicate the dangers of obesity and the importance of nutrition and physical fitness. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased that the Chair has agreed to take the Jackson-Lee amendment to underscore the importance of this issue.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, I want to give a special thanks to Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones for 
   coordinating this. She certainly has shown her leadership ability in everything that becomes her responsibility. And I thank you for the time. 
   I want to very quickly add my remarks to those of my colleagues referencing the Jena Six. I was horrified to see us take a step backwards into a period of time when there was fear and hatred displayed on people's faces and in their actions. And certainly we know that with every crime committed there is a punishment. 
   But the symbol of justice in this country of ours, the United States of America, is a symbol that has a scale and a blindfold, because justice should be blind. And in a country that uses the rule of law as its guide post, how is it that we become so unjust when we are dealing with our young people? 
   Certainly, things happen and anger builds up and children do things that are illegal and sometimes foolish. But rather than looking at them as adults, let's apply the law to them as young people and apply it equally so they can learn their lesson. 
   With a stroke of the pen and destroying the lives of six young men, I think that sends the wrong message to the world. We are asking other countries to model their forms of government after ours here in America. And I would give a caution. We have made too many mistakes, and I would say don't take our mistakes as part of our Western-style democracy. They are truly mistakes of man, not mistakes of law. And so I would hope that, after the demonstrations, after the fury, justice will take place and people will be treated fairly. 
   Mr. Speaker, our American health care system is failing. According to the Census Bureau, the number of American children who lack health insurance has reached a new high, 8.7 million. Worst of all, that number has actually increased by 1 million just over the previous 2 years. Meanwhile, our gross domestic product during that same period increased by $1.5 trillion. So at the same time our economy was growing by that amount, 1 million more children were losing their health insurance. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely shameful that, in a Nation as wealthy as ours, we leave so many children sick and vulnerable. It is shameful that the richest Nation in the world has an infant mortality rate that ranks 35th, higher than any other rich nation. It is shameful that while we vote for tax giveaways for the richest Americans, the poorest, most vulnerable Americans are left in the lurch. 
   I believe we were sent here to do more than just apply Band-Aids to this situation. I think we have the responsibility to make sure that every American, and certainly every child, can see a doctor when they are injured or fall ill. Politics is often about compromise, but which children should we decide not to allow the deserving health coverage? Which of us would be willing to choose between our own children, saying one can be healthy but another must be ill? I think this is a false, immoral choice; and I do not believe we should accept anything less than full coverage for every American child. 
   In my district, the economics range from the dangerously poor to the superrich. And I say ``dangerously poor'' to describe the impact of poverty on children's health. Poor children are at risk from disease, from crime, from poor education, and many other negative influences that stem from a poverty environment. This list goes on. 
   When we talk about homeland security, we really mean the people on the land. So providing a health delivery system for all our children is the only way to guarantee a strong Nation of future Americans. So let's invest in our children rather than in war that can take their lives too early, so regardless of income levels, our children have a birth right to grow up healthy and strong to face the challenges of a rapidly changing world. 
   Thank you, STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES and Mr. Speaker, for the time allowed.
