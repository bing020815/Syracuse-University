<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, for all of your help in bringing the Employment Verification Amendment Act, H.R. 6633, to the floor today. This legislation is the result of a lot of hard work from Members on both sides of the aisle, and I appreciate the fact that Members have joined together to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Basic Pilot Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification Program, also known as E-Verify. I particularly appreciate that this legislation calls for investigations into various aspects of E-Verify and ensures that we safeguard Social Security. 
   E-Verify was one of three employee verification pilot programs created in 1997, and it has remained a voluntary program at the Federal level for 11 years with actually very few employers enrolled. However, recent actions at the State and the Federal levels are increasing demand on E-Verify and the Social Security system that it relies on. In the last 2 years, over a dozen States have passed employee verification laws, and some, like my home State of Arizona, have mandated E-Verify for all employers and imposed severe sanctions against those who do not comply. 
   The administration is also increasingly requiring E-Verify's use. On June 6, 2008, President Bush signed an amendment to an executive order requiring more than 200,000 Federal contractors to use E-Verify. 
   E-Verify relies on the Social Security Administration's data and systems to verify the citizenship and Social Security numbers of all newly hired individuals for their eligibility to work. According to the GAO, 100 percent of E-Verify queries are first checked against the Social Security database. The need to reauthorize the E-Verify this year presented us with an important opportunity to focus on key components of our Nation's immigration crisis, that is, the need for an effective Federal employee work authorization system.     
   I have been very clear that the current E-Verify system needs to be replaced or reformed. We need to create a mandatory Federal system that is both reliable and effective. 
   Americans from across the country all agree that our farms, our factories, and other businesses should not abet the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States by providing them a place to work. Yet the Federal Government has failed on many accounts to enforce existing immigration laws. That forces local and State governments to do the Federal Government's work. Employment verification is vital to solving our immigration crisis, and that is why we are here today. Right now, the only options for States is E-Verify. It is still, though, a voluntary pilot program with some obvious flaws. As I have testified to three House committees, we can do better. 
   But while this debate continues, E-Verify will expire this November. That is why I have introduced the Employee Verification Amendment Act to extend E-Verify, but only for 5 years. By reauthorizing E-Verify for 5 years instead of the 10, we can move to a Federal mandatory system more quickly. Within 5 years or less, the Federal Government must develop a mandatory system that operates uniformly across all 50 States. This is critical to fixing our broken immigration system. 
   Developing the best mandatory system possible requires us to understand the pitfalls in the current E-Verify system, and that is why this bill includes some studies into how E-Verify impacts small businesses and accurately confirms workers' eligibility. 
   Congress has to learn from the experience of employers and employees in States like Arizona. We are on the front lines of this immigration debate. Lessons learned from Arizona will help us develop a mandatory program that can identify undocumented workers in an efficient manner without fostering identity theft or violating workers' rights of United States citizens. 
   This bill also requires DHS to provide timely and appropriate payments to Social Security. In order for E-Verify or any employee verification system to work, the Social Security database and system has to have the funding that it needs to handle the increased demand created by a verification system. 
   The Social Security protections in this bill will keep E-Verify operational. They will also prevent interference with Social Security services to seniors, people with disabilities, and also to survivors. The AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare sent letters to the Ways and Means Committee reflecting these concerns. 
   Before I close, again I want to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank Representatives Michael McNulty, Sam Johnson, Lamar Smith, and Ken Calvert as well as for their leadership on the bill and all of the staff's hard work. 
   Illegal immigration continues to be a major problem for the United States of America. The Employee Verification Amendment Act is a step forward towards solving one aspect of the problem. This is the best approach at this critical time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  
   AARP, 
   Washington, DC, July 29, 2008. Hon. CHARLES B. RANGEL, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Hon.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, there are three critical priorities that this Congress faces: our independence from foreign oil sources, addressing global warming, but also American competitiveness. I believe that solar energy technology offers one of the best solutions to challenging these great, great problems that we have. 
   Now, as the House takes up this energy independence bill, I commend the commitment that this legislation makes to solar energy. This bill authorizes new research and development into solar technologies. The bill authorizes programs to help train a qualified solar workforce to install and maintain these technologies, not just in Arizona, but across the country. This bill also contains some tax incentives from my Renewal Energy Assistance Act that will help solar become more affordable, not just to homeowners, but also to businesses. This is what is so critical to spur the innovation and investment that is vital to the creation of our reliable solar market for the country, not just Arizona. But with over 350 days of sunshine every single year, it is critical that we harness the power of the sun. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. I thank the gentleman from Vermont. 
   The high costs of fuel are being felt throughout my southern Arizona district, and people are really hurting out there right now. 
   To bring down the cost of oil--this is pretty common sense--what we're going to have to do is force those big oil and gas companies to increase their production. That means drilling on the 68 million acres of Federal land that is already under control from these big oil companies. 
   Today, we're going to vote on H.R. 6515, the Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands, or Drill Act. This bill is going to require both oil and gas companies to start using their Federal leases both onshore and offshore, and if they don't use it, they should lose it. 
   It will also accelerate the leasing process in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, and that's an additional 20 million acres. We have to be realistic, and I don't think the American people are being fooled. It's going to take 5 to 7 years before we benefit from increased drilling. 
   That's why we're also calling on the President to immediately release a small amount of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The hardworking taxpayers of my district have paid for that reserve supply to be used in a time of crisis. And when I talk to my constituents across the over 9,000 square miles of my district, we know because they agree that $4 to $5 a gallon is a crisis. 
   So I urge the President to take action on the SPR, and I also ask my colleagues to join with me in passing H.R. 6515. We have to address this energy challenge, stabilize our economy immediately, but then look to the future in terms of renewable energy. And in Arizona, solar energy is certainly the key to that.

<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I do not support the minority's effort to weaken the impact of extended unemployment benefits for Americans. In this economic downturn, our workers should be able to receive the same 13-week extension granted to workers exhausting the regular 26 weeks of unemployment benefits in other states. 
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since January 2001, only 5.3 million jobs have been created nationwide. In Arizona, an average of 1,470 jobs have been lost each month for the past 6 months. Only 389,700 new jobs have been created since January 2001--or 4,480 new jobs per month--as compared with a total of 691,700 new jobs during the previous decade--or 7,950 per month. 
   This year, Arizona's job losses have been concentrated in construction and housing-related industries, including real estate and finance, but they are beginning to appear across a wide range of industries as this economic decline continues. I support the benefits provided by H.R. 5749 because according to the Congressional Budget Office, they are a cost-effective and fast-acting means of stimulating the economy. Every $1 spent on unemployment benefits generates $1.64 in new economic demand. 
   I will vote ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 574 the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act, and do not support the minority's efforts to undermine effective economic relief for Arizonans.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (PROHIBITION ON SALE BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OF PARTS FOR F-14 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1441, a bill that will put an end to military surplus sales that may inadvertently be helping to sustain Iran's Air Force. 
   First, I would like to thank Chairman Lantos and Chairman Skelton for their leadership on this issue. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this critical national security issue. 
   The background to this problem begins in the 1970s when our country sold F-14 Tomcats to Iran's pro-Western secular government. Iran was a close ally of the United States at the time and needed the capabilities of the F-14 in a dangerous part of the world. Times have changed, unfortunately. And Iran has now called for the destruction of Israel and is refining uranium in what many observers from the non-proliferation community believe is an attempt to develop the fuel necessary for an atomic weapon. 
   Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and is likely responsible for arming insurgents in Iraq. Iran has ignored the calls of the international community for greater transparency in its nuclear power research and development, and the United Nations Security Council recently imposed stricter economic sanctions on Iran as a result. 
   When the United States Navy retired the F-14 fleet last September, that left Iran as the only nation still flying those aircraft. Iran has been trying to get around United States sanctions and export controls to secure the parts necessary to keep the F-14 flying. Recent  undercover investigations and reports have made it clear that Iran may have been successful. 
   Following an undercover investigation, the GAO reported in 2006 that acquiring surplus military hardware not properly demilitarized is disturbingly easy. 
   In January of this year, the Associated Press reported that front companies were able to secretly purchase military parts for resale in Iran. Iran is the only nation still using the F-14. There are no other legitimate buyers overseas. 
   In order to address this issue, I worked with my colleague from New Mexico, Mr. Pearce. And after a joint trip to Israel, we introduced H.R. 1441, which will prevent the United States Government from selling approximately 10,000 parts that are unique only to the F-14 Tomcat. 
   This legislation will prohibit the military, as well as any other private company, from selling F-14-specific parts. It is also, Mr. Speaker, a complete ban on all international sales of parts specific to the F-14. 
   We cannot take the risk that components unique to the F-14 could be resold to Iran. The text of this bill was included in the fiscal year 2008 defense authorization bill, H.R. 1585, as section 1049. 
   The House Armed Services Committee approved the language in its markup of that bill, and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs has already marked up the specific bill and has reported it favorably. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must take the responsibility to ensure that our military hardware never falls into the hands of nations hostile to the United States and can never be used against our men and women in uniform and not used against our allies. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1441. 
   I include for the Record an exchange of letters related to this bill between Chairman Skelton of the Armed Services Committee and Chairman Lantos of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   June 8, 2007. Hon. TOM LANTOS, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 1483, amending the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act. 
   Early this year, I introduced the Santa Cruz Valley National Heritage Area Act with Congressman Grijalva. I am pleased that our bill has been included in H.R. 1483. 
   By designating the Santa Cruz Valley as a National Heritage Area, this beautiful and thriving region will receive modest Federal support for promoting the area's history, cultural resources and indigenous wildlife habitat. We are ensuring that the Santa Cruz Valley visitors can experience the unique watershed and diverse societies it has supported, Native American tribes, descendants of Spanish ancestors, American pioneers, and, now, members of our diverse Sonoran Arizona communities. 
   Widely supported from Marana, Arizona, to Patagonia, the Santa Cruz Valley will protect private property rights and public use of this federally managed land. 
   So I support this bill. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the underlying bill to support preserving Arizona's National Heritage.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for fully funding the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, also known as SCAAP, at its authorized level for fiscal year 2008 at $950 million. 
   This program, which reimburses State and local governments for the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants, is vital to border States such as Arizona, where we disproportionately pay a higher amount than our fair share of incarceration. 
   Underfunding SCAAP places a significant cost burden on our local law enforcement, stretching their resources and hampering their ability to protect our communities. 
   All of the counties in my district, Pima, Cochise, Pinal and Santa Cruz, are reimbursed less than 10 percent of the amount of incarcerating illegal immigrants. This places an unfair cost burden on our local communities. Given the importance of homeland security and law enforcement, it is absolutely essential that we receive full funding for SCAAP. I believe that Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle would agree that reimbursement should be a Federal priority.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, with the completion of the first 100 hours, I stand here today to discuss an issue of critical importance to southern Arizona, and that is our illegal immigration crisis. 
   Let me point out two recent events. On January 12, a Border Patrol agent had a deadly altercation with an illegal immigrant crossing into our district. That investigation is going on at this moment. A couple of weeks ago, members of the National Guard unit assigned to work with the Border Patrol were threatened by an armed gang that came into our country and then left. That incident is being looked at. 
   While many questions still surround these recent incidents, one thing is crystal clear: Now that our 100 hours are over, we must address the illegal immigration crisis and secure the border today. 
   We are putting our Border Patrol and the National Guard under tremendous strain. It is our responsibility to provide them with the necessary resources and the tools they need. 
   Fighting for a comprehensive immigration plan must be a priority for this Congress, Democrats and Republicans working together.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled today to speak on this final piece of legislation of our first 100 hours and perhaps the most important piece of legislation, the CLEAN Energy Act. 
   In the early 1960s, in response to the Russians when they launched Sputnik, President Kennedy decided to send a man to the Moon. And remember his words. He said: ``We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade, not because it's easy, but because it's hard.'' And we did it and we led in science and math and engineering, and it was greatness for our Nation. 
   These policies led to a major technological breakthrough that benefited  both our military and our economy; and now America faces a greater challenge than ever. How we respond to this challenge will have lasting effects not just for the American people but for the entire world. We put our national security at risk when we are reliant on unstable regimes, Middle Eastern oil, Latin American oil. We put our economy at risk by not adequately investing in science and math and engineering and technology, and we put our world at risk when we ignore the real threats of global warming. 
   Ending America's addiction to foreign oil, investing in renewable energy, and achieving clean energy independence is the Apollo mission of our generation. This will not just result in better jobs and the creation of hundreds of thousands of new economic opportunities for our citizens, but a more stable and a more sustainable world. The CLEAN Energy Act is a meaningful first step in our new mission, and I look forward to working with both Republicans and Democrats in achieving this goal.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a historic first step for this United States Congress; it's a step towards energy independence. 
   The energy bill that we're considering today recognizes a tremendous renewable resource that we literally have at our fingertips, the power of the sun. This bill includes my provisions to authorize new research and development into solar technologies. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize our energy production, not just in southern Arizona, but across this Nation. 
   As we develop these new technologies, we're going to need qualified workers to install and maintain the latest solar technologies. That is why this bill includes training programs specifically for solar technology. 
   But this bill is only a first step. I'm disappointed that we're not passing the House's fiscally responsible renewable energy tax policies and the tax incentives that go with this legislation. Those are the incentives that are really going to spur energy innovation, so we're going to continue to work for those. 
   I support this bill today, but we have a lot more work that we have to do. Mr. Speaker, I urge support on both sides of the aisle.

<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (HONORING THE GOAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF ASTRONOMY -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. I thank the gentleman. 
   Next year will be the 400th anniversary of when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei first pointed a telescope into the night sky. Galileo did not invent the telescope, but he was the first one to use it for astronomy. The observations he made ultimately revolutionized humanity's understanding of the solar system and of the universe. 
   Though his telescope was crude, certainly by modern day standards, he was able to see craters and shadows and mountains on the Moon. He also saw the planet Venus go through phases just like our moon does. And he saw moons orbiting the planet Jupiter. He saw all of this at a time when conventional wisdom held that all celestial objects orbited our planet, the planet Earth. These discoveries marked the beginning of modern astronomy. 
   It is because of the importance of these discoveries that countries all around the world have chosen to recognize the 400th anniversary year, 2009, as the International Year of Astronomy. This celebration of astronomical discoveries is designed to increase interest in astronomy and science. Throughout next year, a wide variety of events  and activities and meetings at parks and museums and other public spaces will promote a greater understanding and appreciation of astronomy and science throughout the United States and throughout the world. 
   It is only befitting that the United States is taking a lead role in this international celebration, because today the United States is at the forefront in astronomical research. We have built telescopes that would astound Galileo and his contemporaries. We have telescopes on earth with mirrors 400 inches across. We also have telescopes that orbit our planet far above the earth's surface. Indeed, NASA's space-based telescopes, including Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, Chandra, and many others, regularly produce images that amaze and inspire people around the world and yield scientific discoveries on everything from the formation of stars and the solar systems to the fate of our universe itself. 
   Now, I am particularly excited about the opportunity to use the International Year of Astronomy to engage and inspire young people in mathematics and science generally and particularly. I am pleased that the 110th Congress has come to great lengths to increase our Nation's emphasis on science and math, most notably by passing the America COMPETES Act last year. But we can always do more. And nothing captures and engages the mind of students, young and old alike, than the process of discovery. This is the fundamental essence of astronomy, and it is my hope that the events and the activities sponsored by the International Year of Astronomy will inspire many new young people to embrace worlds that will open them through the study of math and science.     
   Astronomy has a strong history in my southern Arizona district, and one of the brightest stars we have is Dr. Roger Angel, a professor of astronomy and recipient of a MacArthur Foundation genius award. In Dr. Angel's own words, ``from the study of astronomy, students today can learn about energy in all of its forms, as well as gain an appreciation for the beauty of the universe. They learn practical tools needed to address the energy and climate crisis. Astronomy know-how even has practical value. I am using it to figure out good ways to harness the sun's energy on Earth with big, telescope-like mirrors.'' 
   Thus, we see an example of how students today can build a foundation, and exactly the kind of scientific understanding and technological skill that we need to solve some of society's most pressing problems, climate change, global warming, and our energy needs in the future. 
   In the United States, some key organizations sponsoring, promoting and organizing events and activities for the International Year of Astronomy include the American Astronomical Society, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the Astronomical League, the American Association of Variable Star Observers, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. 
   Ultimately, astronomy is the study of everything that is not on Earth. It appeals to our sense of wonder and curiosity and our place in the vast cosmos. The German astronomer Johannes Kepler, whose laws of planetary motion are still used today said, ``The treasures hidden in the heavens are so rich that the human mind shall never be lacking in fresh nourishment.'' 
   It is those treasures of the heavens, and the men and women who study them, that we will celebrate and honor and discover in 2009 with the International Year of Astronomy.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Chairman, in this period of economic downturn, we must ensure that we are doing everything we can to support American small businesses. We also have to protect our hard-working taxpayers. 
   American small businesses still to this day remain the backbone of our economy, and that is why I am offering this amendment today to H.R. 5819, the SBIR Reauthorization Act. 
   Madam Chairman, this amendment will guarantee that businesses that are awarded funding from the small business research and development programs in this bill have their primary business operations located in the United States. The amendment ensures that we continue to provide support to American-owned businesses and reiterate our commitment to protecting American jobs. 
   Since its inception in 1982, the Small Business Innovation Research program, SBIR, has helped small businesses compete for Federal research and development awards. Eighty-five percent of businesses competing in SBIR are small firms employing 20 or fewer persons. And the program has generated an impressive 50,000 patents over these 25 years. 
   I have seen the success of SBIR awards in my district at the high-tech, highly creative Breault Research Organization in Tucson, Arizona. 
   As we expand this program, we must keep responsible taxpaying, job-creating organizations like Breault Research in mind. We have to ensure that truly American-owned companies are winning these valuable awards. We should not be funding R&D for businesses that will develop their U.S. taxpayer financed ideas here, then those ideas turn into jobs overseas. The goal of this reauthorization bill is to boost U.S. small business innovation and competitiveness and thereby boost U.S. competitiveness. 
   As a former president and CEO of a small business, I know how difficult it is to compete in today's environment, I know how hard it is to grow a business. And that is why I am offering this amendment, to protect hard-working, ambitious American businesses to fulfill the underlying bill's goal to foster American competitiveness. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (MOTORCYCLE SAFETY AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, in my home state of Arizona we have 150,000 registered motorcycles. 
   With over 300 days of sunshine in our state every year, you can imagine why so many Arizonans choose to ride their bikes! 
   There are many other reasons why motorcycles are so popular, but one explanation is simple economics: the rising cost of gas. 
   Motorcycles offer a more fuel efficient--and cheaper way--of getting around. 
   On average, motorcycles can get between 40 and 75 miles per gallon of gas. And even as gasoline prices are hovering near $3.75 a gallon in many parts of the country, motorcycle riders can fill up for less. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, motorcycles consume 56 percent less fuel per mile traveled. 
   Many people are now taking the plunge to own and ride a motorcycle regularly. Over the past decade, U.S. motorcycle sales have more than tripled. They are growing in popularity as a fun and fuel-efficient alternative. 
   As a member of the House Science and Technology Committee, I am committed to working with all my constituents and colleagues in Congress to move our country forward and continue our tradition of international leadership on environmental Issues. 
   And I am proud that, as a motorcyclist for over 20 years, I am leaving a smaller footprint on our earth by just riding my bike. 
   But, I do have concerns about road safety and that drivers sharing the road with me aren't looking out for my well-being. That is why I introduced House Resolution 399, recognizing the importance of motorcycles and supporting the goals of ``Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month.'' 
   Motorcycles have a higher rate of fatal accidents than automobiles. U.S. Department of Transportation data for 2005 shows that for motorcycles, 75 fatal crashes occur per 100,000 registered vehicles--four times higher than for cars. 
   H. Res. 399 encourages riders to always wear helmets and other protective gear, to never drink and ride, and to be properly licensed and trained. It also serves as a reminder to all riders and motorists to always share the road respectfully. 
   These are important messages for all road users and timely information for motorcyclists in many areas of the country gearing up for the upcoming riding season. 
   I, for one, am ready to dust off my boots, grab my helmet, and get on the road! 
   Happy ``Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month.''

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think it's important to really focus on the substance of this bill, and I rise today in strong support of this Homeland Security bill. 
   I represent southern Arizona. My district, the 8th Congressional District, shares 120 miles with the country of Mexico. We are facing a security and immigration crisis in my district and across the Nation. The flood of illegal immigrants and drug trafficking continues to place an undue burden on not just our health care system but our schools, our first responders and on our local law enforcement. 
   Currently, the Tucson sector is the most porous section along the U.S.-Mexico border. On average, every day the Border Patrol apprehends about 2,000 illegal immigrants and approximately 2,500 pounds of drugs. While most illegal immigrants are coming here for economic opportunities and don't want to do harm to anyone, probably about 10 percent are involved in criminal activities. 
   Nationally, the Border Patrol arrests 1 million illegal immigrants annually and seizes over 1 million pounds of marijuana and 15 to 20 tons of cocaine. 
   Smugglers' methods, routes and modes of transportation are potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by terrorists attempting to do the American people harm. 
   Border security must be strengthened, and all of the options for accomplishing this must be on the table. Success requires a multifaceted approach. We need to build fences, we need to deploy sensors, we need to utilize the latest technologies, such as UAVs, and take advantage of advanced technology in terms of detection. 
   I'm pleased that this legislation makes border security a priority and provides the funding that we badly need along the U.S.-Mexico border. The improved border security that this bill will fund is a crucial component in passing comprehensive immigration reform that is tough, practical and effective. I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass legislation later that includes components of border security, along with comprehensive immigration reform. 
   Now, the bill that we are discussing today provides $8.8 billion for the Customs and Border Protection agency, which is $50 million above the President's request, and $647 million, nearly 8 percent, above fiscal year 2007. It provides funding for 3,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and this will bring the total number of Border Patrol agents up to 17,819 by the end of fiscal year 2008. 
   This bill also funds the SBI, the Secure Border Initiative. This is going to be rolling out in Sasabe in southern Arizona, and it funds this initiative at the President's requested level of $1 billion. It requires the Department of Homeland Security to justify how it plans to use these funds to achieve operational control of our borders. 
   So I urge my colleagues to pass and I urge the President to sign this very important legislation. Our border communities urgently need this funding to stem violence and lawlessness and prevent terrorism that could possibly impact the United States along the southern border. 
   I urge the Members on both sides of the aisle to move forward on this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I intended to offer a clarifying amendment to the underlying bill. As currently constituted, funding is appropriated for Customs and Border Patrol to construct, renovate, equip, and maintain buildings and facilities necessary for enforcing our immigration laws. 
   My amendment would have added the word ``structures'' in addition to facilities and buildings. This minor change would have made it clear that the Customs and Border Patrol can focus on the physical infrastructure needs of our border security apparatus with the funds appropriated by this bill. 
   Securing our borders, as we know, requires a multifaceted approach. We need to do more than just maintain facilities and buildings. We need to build fences. We need to deploy sensors, and we need to take advantage of all the advanced technology and equipment that is being developed right now. 
   Currently, the Tucson sector that I represent has more apprehensions than all other sections of the border combined. Every single day our Border Patrol apprehends, on average, about 2,000 individuals and over 2,500 pounds of drugs.     
   This is the most porous part of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
   While most illegal immigrants come here to look for work and opportunities, approximately 10 percent are involved in criminal activities. So, border security must be strengthened, and all options for accomplishing this must be on the table. 
   Nationally, the Border Patrol arrests about 1 million illegal immigrants annually, seizes about a million pounds of marijuana and 15 to 20 tons of cocaine. Smugglers' methods, routes and modes of transportation are potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by terrorists attempting to bring weapons into our Nation. The Border Patrol must be allowed to deploy and sustain an appropriate mix of personnel, equipment, technology and border infrastructure in order to protect our Nation. 
   As Congress moves forward in this process, I urge my colleagues to allow the Customs and Border Patrol to take the necessary steps in order to secure our border and to secure our citizens. This would expand the opportunity for Customs and Border Patrol to secure our Nation and protect our communities.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. This week, Congress is grappling with grave economic issues, issues that are facing our Nation's economy, and we're all being called upon right now to ensure that America's financial situation is secure. But today we also have an opportunity to look beyond the present and ensure that America's future is strong, and that's what this energy tax bill is all about. 
   In particular, I want to call your attention to the solar tax credits. Solar power is clean, it's domestic, it's renewable, it's going to bring us closer to energy independence and provide us with powerful economic benefits across our great Nation. 
   According to a recent study, an 8-year extension of the solar ITC could lead to more than 440,000 jobs and attract $232 billion in investment. Not only is that serious economic stimulus, it will foster a cleaner, safer, and more sustainable world. But without the solar ITC being signed into law this year, it will not happen. 
   We have to pass this bill. We must work with the Senate. We must work with the White House.

Meeting this challenge requires the comprehensive approach on the floor tonight: drilling, conservation, and renewable power. 
   I am particularly pleased that this bill contains an 8-year extension of the  solar investment tax credit, or the ITC. Solar power represents one of our Nation's best hopes for a clean, secure, and sustainable future. It will provide powerful economic benefits in my district in southern Arizona but to the rest of the country as well. 
   According to a new study by Navigant Consulting, an 8-year extension of the solar ITC could lead to more than 440,000 permanent jobs and attract $232 billion in investment through 2016. 
   I thank the leadership. I thank the chairman. I thank those who have worked so hard at listening to the people of southern Arizona and across this country about this newer, brighter future.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the College Student Relief Act, legislation that will cut interest rates in half over the next 5 years. 
   We live in an information-driven world where a college education is more vital than ever. Yet financial barriers will prevent millions of American high school graduates from realizing their full potential and getting the  education that they need. This legislation will help middle- and working-class families afford to send their children to college at a time when the cost of college, particularly in Arizona, is skyrocketing. 
   The average subsidized loan debt for tens of thousands of students in my home State of Arizona is around $15,000, a staggering amount for someone entering the workforce. This new act will save students in Arizona an average of $4,700, a substantial difference. 
   We must focus on preparing young Americans like those we have in the gallery today to be competitive in this 21st century global economy. Ensuring access to higher education is critical. This is a goal that is supported by the American people.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   If there is one thing that we here in Congress can bank on, it's that the sun is going to come up each and every day. Solar power is a domestic form of renewable energy, and increasing its use will be good for our environment, good for public health, good for our national security and good for our economy. 
   I hail from the great State of Arizona, of course, which is rich in sunshine, but every single State in our country receives enough sunshine to make valuable use of solar energy. In addition to all the societal benefits that I mentioned, solar power is also a solid property investment. Solar panels installed on homes or offices enable families or businesses to reduce and often eliminate electricity bills. They often pay for themselves in just a few short years. Solar panels can increase the resale value of a home or a business. Solar products are becoming more efficient and more attractive all the time and, in fact, there are several examples where the solar panels are actually built into and blend with regular roof tiles. 
   Unfortunately, many consumers are not aware of some of these benefits of solar. They're not aware of the improvements. A challenge for the solar industry to advertise and promote this has been addressed by another industry that I believe that we can learn from. The agriculture industry pioneered a mechanism called the check-off program, and they did this to increase generally an awareness of a product rather than a particular brand. These programs are federally created and they are a proven way of increasing consumer awareness of a category of products. Almost two dozen programs have been created, and some of these we know very well. For example, in the milk industry, the Got Milk? campaign. Beef. Cotton. Pork. The wide familiarity that we can all name in these campaigns is a solid testament to the effectiveness of raising consumer awareness. And increased consumer awareness is exactly what the solar industry needs in order to increase the demand for products here in the United States, which will be to the benefit of the entire country. 
   I therefore offer an amendment that would create a check-off program for the solar industry. This amendment has been explicitly requested by the solar industry. It is structured to incur no cost for the government. All costs are borne by the solar industry, yet individual companies have the ability to opt out of the program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a proven idea with a good track record. It will address global warming, energy independence, American competitiveness, and I believe it's a winning proposition. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Again, this is an amendment that was brought to me by the Solar Energy Industries Association. The solar companies in Arizona that I have worked with are all in favor of this amendment. Again, it's a voluntary program where the companies can choose to opt out if they so choose. But it has been successful, Mr. Chairman, in many other industries. And the  agriculture industries that I mentioned are good examples. 
   I am certainly willing to work with my friend from Texas as this bill moves forward, but I do think that there are some real benefits to offering this amendment.

First, our dependence on foreign oil; second, climate change; and third, America's innovation and the fact that we are not as competitive as this country needs to be. One of the best solutions to these three major problems is solar energy. 
   The investment tax credit, Mr. Speaker, the ITC, will expire at the end of the year. At home in southern Arizona and across this great Nation, free energy radiates from the sky almost every day of the year. Across my district, residents, businesses, utilities, and individuals are all working to do their part to take advantage of that sunshine. But major projects, large projects, but also small projects, will not move forward without the extension of the ITC. 
   Southern Arizonans are willing to do their part. We here in Congress have to do ours by working across party lines and working in the Senate to ensure that the ITC is extended. This is critical for our country, for our competitiveness, for climate change, and for ending our dependency on foreign oil.

   I am proud to be a Member of a congressional body that, first, recognizes the fact that global warming is happening, but is also willing to take action to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and foreign energy. 
   In our first year, we passed the Energy Independence and Security Act which authorized a number of renewable energy programs. That legislation, I think, was a good first step towards moving us towards energy independence. But what is missing today is the passage of the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act. 
   I come from the great State of Arizona, a State known for a tremendous amount of sunshine. Just last week, plans were introduced to build the world's largest solar power plant in our back yard. It's going to be big enough to power over 70,000 homes. But a project like this will not be constructed without the solar Investment Tax Credits. 
   In recent years, the solar industry has been one of the fastest growing industries in the country. It creates high-quality jobs; it provides us with tremendous energy independence; and it addresses global warming. Our Nation cannot afford to have these vital tax incentives sunset like they're set to do in 2008 unless this Congress acts.     
   For our Nation, for our planet, but, most importantly, for our kids who are  going to inherit this planet that we leave behind, it is critical that we pass this legislation and we urge our colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation as well.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as the President and CEO of my family's small tire business, I know the challenges that small businesses face in America, not just to thrive but truly to survive in a rapidly increasingly global economy. Small businesses are truly the backbone of a strong and vibrant community, and women are major economic contributors since we constitute over 45 percent of small business employees. 
   That is why I strongly support H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act, because it recognizes women's valuable role in the workplace. 
   It is also important, though, to make sure this legislation is fair. So today I'm offering an amendment that will clarify the legal standard for punitive damages as requiring malice or reckless indifference. This commonsense amendment means that businesses will not be subject to punitive damages unless they act with malice or reckless intent. This standard mirrors the burden that applies in other civil rights laws. 
   Today, as we close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act that have allowed women to continue to be underpaid for equal work, we must do so fairly. It is unacceptable for society to undervalue the work that women do and underpay us for equal work. According to the United States Department of Labor, American women are earning 74 cents for every dollar earned by a man, taking women 16 months to earn what men earn in 1 calendar year. This disparity is not just unfair, but it is also a major economic concern for millions of hardworking American families. 
   Closing the wage gap will also have a long-term impact on women's economic security especially during their retirement years. Women, of course, are living longer. Men are living longer, too, but women longer than men. Over time, lower wages translate into less income that counts for calculating pension and Social Security benefits. Older women are less likely than older men to receive pension income. And when they do, they only receive one-half of the benefits that men do. 
   As a cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, I am proud to join with 229 of my colleagues in showing strong support for this legislation. 
   I urge the House to pass this amendment that has been endorsed by the United States Chamber of Commerce. It is time that America, the land of equal opportunity, recognize equal pay between men and women. I am proud to be part of this historic effort. 
   I'm particularly proud that my mother is here in the gallery today to witness this historic act of Congress. 
   So thank you, Congresswoman DeLauro, for your tireless effort over so many years, and Chairman Miller as well, for continuing to fight for the people that are truly underrepresented in so many ways.

The mental health needs of the generation of combat veterans that we are creating will face this country for decades to come. 
   We must realize that the nature and scope of warfare has changed, bringing a new level of stress to combat deployments that is fundamentally new. Even in the Green Zone of Baghdad soldiers are repeatedly attacked and regularly attacked. 
   The troops must cope with ongoing severe stress for months to come. Experts tell us that extended periods of stress like this, with no way to alleviate it, create the conditions where PTSD is most likely to develop. 
   According to a recent report in the New England Journal of Medicine, 95 percent of troops in Army and Marine units report having been shot at during their deployment, and 95 percent report seeing dead bodies, 89 percent report being ambushed or attacked. One in five is currently suffering from depression, anxiety or stress while deployed. Twenty percent are now facing marital problems, including divorce or legal separation from their spouse. The after-effect of these extended and highly stressful combat deployments will continue to affect their families, the military and our communities for many, many years to come. 
   I believe that we need to shift towards preventive care. What we know from our experience is that PTSD not being treated can start a downward tragic cycle of addiction, isolation and despair. This bill improves a mental health training for military case managers working with outpatient facilities like Walter Reed so they can identify problems early. 
   This way we can help provide treatment before returning servicemen are discharged and left to fend for themselves. This bill also creates critical new funding to best identify practices. Mental health is critical for our troops, and I am very interested in passing this legislation.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight a very important issue facing this country that is addressed in this legislation: mental health care for our troops. The mental health implications of extended, and repeated combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan are now only beginning to be understood. 
   Among Vietnam-era veterans, the lifetime rate of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, sometimes taking decades to appear, is about 30 percent. According to the VA, the current rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is already 20 percent.  
   The mental health needs of the generation of combat veterans that we are creating will face this country for decades to come. We must realize that the nature and scope of warfare has changed, bringing a level of stress to combat deployments that is fundamentally new. 
   Even the Green Zone in Baghdad is attacked regularly, and the lives of troops stationed there are literally at risk every single day of their deployments. The troops must cope with ongoing, severe stress for months on end. Experts tell us that extended periods of stress like this, with no way to alleviate it, create the conditions where PTSD is most likely to develop. 
   According to a recent report in the New England Journal of Medicine, 95 percent of troops in Army and Marine units report having been shot at during their deployment, and 95 percent report seeing dead bodies. Eighty-nine percent reported being ambushed or attacked. 
   One in five is suffering from depression, anxiety or stress while deployed. Twenty percent face marital problems including divorce or legal separation from their spouse. 
   The after-effect of extended and highly stressful combat deployments continues to affect military communities and families long after the service member has returned home. 
   I believe the most important shift is to move toward preventative care. What we know from decades of experience is that PTSD, left untreated, can begin a tragic downward spiral of addiction, isolation and despair. 
   This bill improves the mental health training for military case managers working with outpatients at facilities like Walter Reed, so they can identify potential problems early. This way, we can help provide treatment before returning servicemen are discharged and left to fend for themselves. 
   It authorizes critical new funding to identify best practices and build up our clinical knowledge of PTSD and how best to treat it. And it creates a mechanism to improve the transition from the DoD health system into the VA system, so that service members will not fall through the cracks. 
   Not every American chooses to wear the uniform and serve this country. Not every family stays up lonely nights and waits for a father, husband, mother, wife, or child to come home. Not everyone hears the call of their country and says `send me.' But for those who do, we owe it to be there for them when they get back. 
   I will be proud to vote for this legislation that supports our troops and brings a new focus on critical mental health issues.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. I thank the gentleman. 
   I rise today to raise serious concerns about the amendment to H.R. 1585 that would require background checks for all civilians entering military installations. 
   I certainly appreciate the need to secure our installations, especially considering the recent events in your home State of New Jersey. But I would like to bring a unique situation to your attention. 
   My southern Arizona district is home to Fort Huachuca, a critical national asset that is home to Army Intelligence and Electronic Testing and was recently designated the Joint Center of Excellence for Human Intelligence Training. 
   Fort Huachuca occupies over 73,000 acres of rugged desert terrain. The geography of the area forces the citizens of Elgin and Canelo, along with the surrounding communities, to rely on access through the fort to get to their ranches and homes. This amendment would cause significant hardship to the surrounding community that has had access to the installation for decades. I believe that this is not a unique situation, and there may be other circumstances where the restrictions placed on military installations could be onerous.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, last week, I introduced the Combat Troops Tax Relief Act. From Fort Huachuca in Arizona to Iraq and Afghanistan, members of our armed services make the defense of our great Nation their number one priority. With unflinching honor and dedication, our military families inspire us by sending their husbands and their wives and their sons and daughters off to war to protect our freedoms. 
   My bill calls on Congress to honor their patriotism and commitment to the military families with more than rhetoric. This bill would give them concrete tax relief. This Congress is setting new priorities, including policies impacting military families. This bill does more by cutting taxes for middle-class military families. It increases the standard tax deduction for our soldiers and protects military families' eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care Tax Credit. 
   Military families in southern Arizona and across the country deserve nothing less.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act. 
   Small business, as we all know, is the lifeblood of our communities. Small businesses are responsible for creativity, innovation, and community investment. I honestly believe that a community that has strong small businesses is a strong and vibrant community. 
   This legislation is going to give small businesses in my home state, southern Arizona, a chance to be competitive with federal contracts, whether it's in Oro Valley down to Green Valley or Tucson all the way to Bisbee and to Douglas. 
   For example, OfficeSmart in Sierra Vista, was founded in 1993 by Glenn McDaniel, a veteran, along with his wife, Diane. OfficeSmart has 12 employees and nearly 1,000 commercial customers in southern Arizona. They compete for federal contracts and to provide office supplies to Ft. Huachuca. 
   This bill is going to keep federal contract benefits targeted at local small businesses like OfficeSmart in local communities. It also honors our commitment to disabled veterans. 
   We know with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there will be more and more veterans. This legislation also kick-starts the SBA's Women's Procurement Program. 
   As a former president, CEO, and small business owner myself, I know the importance of small businesses and how difficult it is to compete. I strongly support passage of this bill and I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of passage of H.R. 6049, the Energy and Tax Extenders Act. 
   Back home in Arizona, each and every day practically, we have free energy that radiates from the sky. An Arizona utility company recently proposed a plan to take advantage of that sunshine by building one of the world's largest solar power plants, 280 megawatts. This project will inject millions of dollars into the State and regional economy, and once it's complete, will produce enough electricity to power 77,000 homes. 
   This exciting announcement comes with a caveat. If Congress fails to extend the 30 percent solar tax investment tax credit, this plant will not be constructed. The same stipulation has been given for a variety of solar projects across the Southwest. 
   H.R. 6049 provides those vital extensions for renewable energy tax credits which include solar energy, and it will be the fourth time that the United States of House of Representatives has acted on this issue. 
   I have repeatedly pushed for passage of these extensions because I know  that they're essential for the solar industry in our country. They will spur innovation, decrease our emission, and improve our energy independence. 
   With technology improving, many solar industry leaders furthermore believe that solar energy is on track to be cost competitive with fossil fuels by 2015, if not sooner. But to achieve the goal, we have to act today before the current energy tax incentive expires. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Energy and Tax Extenders Act. This is an important piece of legislation.

   Located in beautiful Willcox, Arizona, the National Day of the Cowboy organization works to increase national support for the proclaimed ``Cowboy Day,'' and to publicize news and information about the resolution and campaign, so that active participation in celebration of the National Day of the Cowboy continues to grow each year. 
   Many thanks to Bethany Braley, executive director and publisher of the National Day of the Cowboy organization, for her tireless vision to remind future generations of the cowboys' contribution to America's rich western heritage. 
   While the U.S. Senate has recognized the National Day of the Cowboy in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, H. Res. 984 represents the first time that the U.S. House of Representatives has officially recognized the contribution of the cowboy and cowgirl to America's culture and heritage. I am pleased to be a part of the 4th Annual National Day of the Cowboy designation. On June 20, 2008, the National Day of the Cowboy resolution also passed in the Arizona State Legislature, making Arizona the first State to pass the resolution. 
   Our legendary cowboy and cowgirl are embraced and respected by people the world over as symbols of rugged individualism. Each represents a commitment to explore, work hard and seek adventure while demonstrating the personal determination to survive. He/she is loyal to an honorable code of ethics as well as persistent and tenacious in the face of any challenge. 
   In honor of cowboys and cowgirls worldwide, I encourage Americans to observe the National Day of the Cowboy on Saturday, July 26, 2008, with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Hardrock Mining Reclamation Act. Long overdue, the time for mining law reform has finally arrived. 
   The 1872 mining law was enacted 40 years before Arizona was even a State. At that time, it encouraged the development and the expansion of the American West. My district of southern Arizona had a town of Bisbee that during the turn of the century actually had its own stock exchange and was the largest community from St. Louis to San Francisco. The copper star on the State of Arizona's flag symbolized the importance when we achieved statehood of the copper industry. 
   However, times have changed. Today's West now depends on the health, as well as the conservation, of our fragile environment as much as it relies on mining. 
   H.R. 2262 is a solid first step. It provides impact assistance to mining communities and establishes a practical and a modern approach to reclaiming and restoring the land as well as water resources. 
   As this legislation progresses, I further encourage Members to look specifically at the royalty provisions. We  do not want to undermine the financial viability of U.S. mining. Our modern, high-tech economy continues to depend on minerals, and this is the importance of making sure that we have a hardrock mining industry that is strong and able to supply all of these minerals. 
   I commend Chairman Rahall for his work. I commend Chairman Costa for crafting a new mining law that reflects modern values, as well as goals that benefit taxpayers, the public lands, as well as the mining industry. 
   This is an important piece of legislation, long overdue; and I encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to support it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you Ranking Member Hall. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act. In 2005, a bipartisan group of congressional legislators came together and asked the National Academies for a list of the top 10 action items that policymakers must take in order to assure that America stays globally competitive. 
   Their report, which was reduced, called ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' found that the U.S. would stand to lose our global competitiveness if we did not act immediately. One of their recommendations was to invest in research in an effort to ``sustain and strengthen the Nation's traditional commitment to long-term basic research that has the potential to be transformational to maintain the flow of new ideas that fuel the economy, provide security, and enhance the quality of life.'' This bill does exactly that. 
   This legislation provides early-career awards for scientists and engineers at the National Science Foundation and at the Department of Energy. Young researchers and scientists can shift paradigms, break out of traditions, and think of new ideas within their field; and it is this outside-of-the-box thinking that we must promote. 
   The early-career awards in this bill awards young scientists for engaging in both high-risk, but also high-reward, research that is transformational and innovative. 
   This bill does not fund all science. This bill focuses on fostering the most innovative of elements in the scientific enterprise. With countries such as India and China becoming more and more competitive, we have to take every action possible to ensure that the United States of America stays globally competitive. 
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for bringing this bill forward. I am honored to be a sponsor.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member Hall. 
   I rise today to enthusiastically express my support for H.R. 362, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. 
   The purpose of this legislation is to improve our national corps of teachers in both math and science, both by recruiting new teachers and also by supporting the current ones. To build a world-class science and technology workforce, we need to have a world-class math and science education system, and H.R. 362 will help accomplish this goal. 
   According to the Nation's report card in 2005, only 30 percent of eighth graders performed at or above the proficient levels in math. Only 32 percent of eighth graders and 18 percent of 12th graders performed at or above the proficient levels in science. 
   America must do better. The National Academy's ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report, presented to us in committee, states that ``without fundamental knowledge and skills, the majority of students scoring below proficient'' levels will ``lack the foundation for good jobs and full participation in society.'' 
   America must invest in this national teaching force, especially in rural and poor areas. 
   Karen Nicodemus is president of Cochise Community College in my district in Arizona. She states that although the shortage of high-quality and high-qualified math and science teachers cuts across all educational systems, we feel it in the rural areas more than in other areas. We do a disservice to our brightest students in high school in those rural and poor areas by not investing and making sure that we have a qualified workforce. 
   To remain competitive in the 21st-century global economy, it is critical that we reform math and science education in America. All children, especially those in rural and in poor areas, should have the opportunity to become leaders, should be able to take our country to the next level. 
   It is an honor to be on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, I am speaking out today in strong opposition of the President's veto of the KidsCare bill, also known as SCHIP here in Washington. I am profoundly disappointed that we were not able today to override the President's veto. 
   In the State of Arizona, there are over 264,000 children that currently do not have health insurance. That's about one out of every five kids. Across the country, it's estimated that over 1 million children do not have health insurance. 
   I am deeply concerned, in addition, because of the slowing of the economy, about the fact that we're going to see unemployment rates increase. And just last week, the Joint Economic Committee came out and stated that ``worsening economic conditions will likely create substantial increases in demands in States' Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs.'' 
   The JEC specifically linked employment woes to demands for programs like KidsCare. Nationwide, they projected that between 700,000 and 1.1 million children per year will be added to the enrollment numbers for Medicaid and SCHIP due to the slowdown in the economy. That makes acting to ensure a strong SCHIP or KidsCare program in Arizona and across the country absolutely critical, but it also reveals how out of touch the President is and how willing he is not just to disregard our children, but to disregard the future of our Nation. 
   As the universal health care debate continues, there should be no debate about health care for kids. Kids can't work; kids can't afford to pay health insurance premiums, and that's why I'd like to thank the 259 colleagues on both sides of the aisle for voting today to reauthorize KidsCare. 
   Democrats and Republicans alike must stay united for the children of our country. We are their representatives; we are their voices, and we must speak out for them. That is precisely why I am speaking here today. It is why I will continue to speak out here in Washington and back home in Arizona and why I am not alone. I am joined by thousands and thousands of voices across southern Arizona in calling for Congress and the President to fully reauthorize KidsCare. 
   In this economic climate, we must not fail to recognize health care as one of the most costly economic challenges confronting businesses, confronting families, and confronting the children of our country.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, thank you Congresswoman S&#225;nchez. I appreciate your tireless work for ensuring that the Criminal Alien Assistance Program, or SCAAP, is a strong, fully-funded, functional program. 
   SCAAP is vital to my district in Southern Arizona. There, along 114 miles of our 2,000 mile boundary with Mexico, Federal, State, county and local law enforcement are on the frontlines defending our border. 
   Last year, 387,000 undocumented immigrants were apprehended in Arizona. And an average of 1,000 illegal immigrants per day were arrested and deported from Tucson. This year, over 180,000 have been apprehended. 
   The Tucson Sector, which includes my district, is the most porous section of the entire U.S.-Mexico Border. More than 48 percent of the Nation's drug traffic enters our country through Southern Arizona. 
   Securing our Nation's borders is the Federal Government's exclusive jurisdiction. However, communities through Southern Arizona and the Nation face extraordinary costs from incarcerating undocumented criminals. 
   SCAAP reimburses States and localities for costs associated with illegal immigrants who commit crimes in our communities. 
   I am pleased to be a cosponsor of H.R. 1512. This legislation would expand SCAAP's scope. It will ensure that states are more appropriately compensated for the high costs of incarcerating undocumented aliens. 
   Please join me in supporting our State and local law enforcement by voting to responsibly expand SCAAP by passing H.R. 1512.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, an important piece of legislation. 
   A few years ago, Arizona had been a national leader in home prices. With the growing subprime mortgage crisis, Arizona is now experiencing increasing record foreclosures. In May, new foreclosures in my State were 141 percent higher than they were just 2 years ago. 
   Some mortgage lenders are working responsibly with homeowners to adjust their mortgages to fairly reflect the decreased home values. They are adjusting their lending policies in response to the current housing market. Congress has to do the same. We should not penalize homeowners by taxing them their discharge debt. 
   This bill encourages market-based decision; it creates fundamental tax fairness. This bill responsibly helps Arizona families avoid foreclosures and to remain in their homes. Fewer foreclosures will help stabilize property values and protect our local and our regional economies. 
   I proudly cosponsored this bipartisan legislation that is endorsed by the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, and the Mortgage Bankers Association.

<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (RESPONSIBLY RESPONDING TO GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, rapidly rising gas prices are a serious concern in my home district of southern Arizona. It's a serious concern across the Nation, but I think it's important that we recognize that today's prices are the result of policies that have been put in place for many years and, in fact, for many decades. There are responsible actions that we can take now to address the problem. Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, also known as ANWR, is not one of them. In recent weeks, some of my colleagues have called for opening up the areas off of coastlines and in ANWR to drilling. 
   Current Federal law prevents drilling in these specific areas. Claims that opening these areas would increase drilling, would increase supplies, would bring down the prices have been made all across the House here. They would have us believe that there is nowhere else to drill in the United States except in the areas that are currently off limits to drilling. They claim that we need to increase domestic supply, and if we want to do that, our only option is to open up these incredibly sensitive environmental areas. 
   This information, Madam Speaker, is blatantly wrong. The oil industry has not tapped all of its drilling options. It holds leases for drilling on lands that have not yet been utilized. In the last 4 years, the Bureau of Land Management has issued over 28,000 permits to drill on public land. However, at the same time, they have only opened up or have actually drilled on fewer than 19,000. So that means that companies are effectively stockpiling 10,000 drilling permits not currently being used to increase domestic oil production for our Nation. 
   Of the over 47 million acres of onshore Federal lands currently leased by oil and gas companies, only about 13 million acres are currently in production. Now, the trend offshore is similar where 44 million acres are currently leased but where only 10.5 million acres are actually currently in production. Counting onshore and offshore leases, oil and gas companies hold drilling rights to almost 68 million acres of Federal land and waters that the oil companies are not drilling on. 
   Based on today's production rates on Federal lands and waters, we can estimate the result if oil and gas companies were to tap all 68 million leased but currently unused acres. Our country could produce an additional 4.8 million barrels of oil and 44.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas every single day. That would nearly double the total U.S. oil production and increase natural gas production by 75 percent. It would also cut U.S. oil imports by more than a third. 
   Finally, that amount is more than six times the estimated maximum daily production from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Six times. Calling for drilling in ANWR, I believe, is an attempt to hide years of poor energy policies that showed more support and more sympathy for the big oil and gas companies than for hardworking Americans.     
   We do have serious energy challenges in our country, and I agree that increasing domestic supply should be part of the solution. We do not, however, have to drill in some of the most pristine and environmentally sensitive areas in America to solve this challenge. 
   We have millions of acres of resources available to us right now, and we must insist that they get used. That's why I am joining with many of my colleagues to promote practical policies to solve the gas crisis. 
   Two responsible and reasonable bills that have been introduced offer some solutions. The first is H.R. 6251, the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act. It's a bill that would force the oil and gas companies to either produce on their Federal leases or give them up. 
   The second bill is H.R. 6256, the Responsible Ownership of Public Lands Act. This is a bill which will help lower gas prices by compelling the oil companies to begin producing oil and gas on public lands that they are currently holding but not using. It will also use an escalating fee on land that oil companies have leased but are not using for production. Both of these bills would provide some strong incentives for the oil companies to stop stockpiling these leases and begin using them. 
   We would also help reduce the demand of oil and gas by investing in a new energy economy, revenue raised by these fees will be invested in renewable energy and energy efficiency programs to help reduce our dependency on oil. So while we continue to develop renewable energy solutions like solar energy, we have to continue to power our economy today. 
   That means yes, we will need gas, we will need oil, but we will need them at an affordable price. We must require that the oil and gas companies use the Federal resources that have already been given to them. By increasing domestic production on leases they already hold, they can lower prices at the pump. 
   That's why I support H.R. 6251, H.R. 6256, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in backing these intelligent proposals.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, in the week before we adjourned for the holidays, Congress, in a bipartisan effort, passed, and the President signed, the Energy Independence and Security Act. This bill, which is now law, represents a major stride forward towards a clean energy future. I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving this historic and very important legislation. 
   It was a good first step, but we are not there yet. The real meat of an effective energy package, which was not included in the legislation, must be the extension of critical tax incentives. These are essential for the solar industry to really take root and flourish. This is one of the reasons why I introduced H.R. 3807, the Renewable Energy Assistance Act, to improve and extend vital tax incentives for solar energy. These incentives will spur innovation, decrease our carbon emissions, and reduce our dependency on foreign energy. 
   In this time of economic uncertainty, it is important that we provide this critical stimulus so that we can move forward on these renewable energy efforts. We have to act this year, before the end of 2008. Doing so will get America back on track and working toward a better and brighter future.

   This legislation includes important safety improvements that will positively impact railroad workers and passengers. 
   H.R. 2095 recognizes that railroad workers have tremendous responsibilities. Americans rely on them to transport commercial goods that are critical to our economy and to keep passengers and the public safe. The bill promotes a safer and healthier work environment and requires railroad companies to devise and implement fatigue management plans. 
   Additionally, this bill will ensure that railroad employees who handle hazardous waste moving through our communities are properly rested and alert. 
   I am pleased that concerns about the safety of locomotive engineers are reflected in H.R. 2095 which calls for a formal study of locomotive cab design. This study will take into account the health effects of locomotive seats, diesel-fume inhalation for lead and trailing locomotives, and other cab working conditions. 
   H.R 2095 also includes protections for whistle-blowers who report unsafe conditions and personal injuries.

   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Chairman, we have before us today an excellent piece of legislation, the Wounded Warriors Assistance Act, that I believe will help untangle problems in military health care such as the ones that we recently saw at the Walter Reed Hospital. This legislation came before us in the Armed Services Committee recently, and I am convinced that the provisions will dramatically improve the treatment for our brave, wounded servicemembers and their families by the Department of Defense health care system. 
   One issue of particular importance that was addressed in this bill is the mental health services and screenings that we will provide to our troops. I want to thank Members for supporting my amendment, that directly impacts mental health treatment for our men and women in uniform. 
   Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are creating a brand-new generation of veterans, many have seen extreme stresses of war. According to the VA, post-traumatic stress syndrome rates are starting to appear about 20 percent. You look back during the Vietnam War era, those rates were close to 30 percent. So, I believe we are just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg. 
   PTSD is an issue that will face thousands of American combat veterans for years into the future. This legislation will help ensure that these soldiers don't face this problem alone. 
   I am proud to vote with my colleagues from the Armed Services Committee to report this bill favorably to the House. I will be very pleased to vote for this outstanding piece of legislation when it appears here on the House floor. I want to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter, for bringing this piece of legislation forward, and, of course, the staff of the Armed Services Committee for their dedication to this issue. 
   In closing, not every American signs up to put on the uniform. Not every American puts their life on the line for our principles and our values. But for those Americans that do, we owe it to be there with them when they need help.

<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the 179,000 children in the State of Arizona who need Congress to stand up for them. 
   Ten million American children need SCHIP, known as KidsCare in my home State of Arizona, because it changes their lives. For example, when Collin Bollinger was born, his mother, Sherry, did not have health insurance. Sherry was gainfully employed, but she could not afford her company's high insurance premiums and did not qualify for Medicaid. After Collin's second birthday and a series of ear infections, Sherry scraped and borrowed enough money for private insurance to cover Collin at the high cost of $150 per month. At times, Sherry chose her son's health care over paying the rent and having a full dinner. 
   Then she discovered the KidsCare program; her premiums then fell by 90 percent per month. With the money that Sherry saved, she could even afford her own health insurance. Now Collin is a straight A student. He plays football at Cienega High School and leads a happy and healthy life. His mother credits KidsCare.

<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (TOUGH, PRACTICAL, EFFECTIVE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM PACKAGE NEEDED -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for the very first time in this distinguished Chamber representing the Eighth District of Arizona. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have made some major accomplishments this week, but one area that particularly pertains to my district and to the State of Arizona has not been addressed, and that is the crisis in illegal immigration. 
   For too long, Congress and Washington have failed to act. We must secure the border now. My district and the State of Arizona have paid a heavy price for this burden. We know it in our schools, our hospitals and our law enforcement agencies. 
   We must move this year with a sense of urgency to pass a comprehensive immigration reform package that is tough, effective, and practical. We need to increase border security using modern-era technology, radar, drones, electronic surveillance. There must be more Border Patrol agents and more support for those Border Patrol agents. 
   We also need tough employer sanctions for those employers who are knowingly hiring people illegally, and a guest worker program, so that people can come in and work legally, safely, and return back to their home countries. 
   Working to pass such measures will be my priority in this 110th Congress, and I look forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle on this important issue.

<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (BUSH BUDGET ZEROES SCAAP FUNDING -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, tonight I would like to take a few minutes for folks here in Washington to focus on southern Arizona. There, along 114 miles of border in my district, Federal, State, county, and local law enforcement are on the front lines defending our border. 
   Arizona faces unimaginable immigration and border security challenges. Last year, over 387,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended in Arizona, and an average of 1,000 illegal immigrants per day were arrested and deported from Tucson. 
   The Tucson sector, which includes my district, is the most porous section along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. More than 48 percent of the Nation's drug traffic enters our country through southern Arizona. 
   This Monday, the President released his fiscal year 2009 budget proposal, and once again his budget failed to include any funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, also known as SCAAP. 
   The President refuses to recognize the importance of SCAAP funds. Without this funding, States and localities will be financially overwhelmed by costs that are the Federal Government's sole responsibility. 
   Securing our Nation's borders is this government's priority, in my opinion. However, communities through southern Arizona and the Nation face extraordinary costs that are unfortunately being carried by them for incarcerating undocumented immigrants. 
   Because of limited Federal contributions, the bulk of these costs are being borne by some very small counties. Some of these counties are also some of the poorest in the Nation. They are currently already operating under very slim budgets and staffing. This is why it is so important and so appropriate that the Federal funding be included. 
   SCAAP was created by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. It is designed to reimburse States and local municipalities for the arrest, incarceration, and transportation costs associated with illegal immigrants who commit crimes in our communities. 
   Under Federal law, the Federal Government has two options. It can either take undocumented criminals into Federal custody or it can compensate State and local jurisdictions. 
   We are facing an immigration crisis here in Arizona. We are underfunding SCAAP, and the President is continuing to overburden our State and local governments. He is hampering the State's ability to protect our communities and uphold our laws. 
   SCAAP funding is particularly important to communities like Bisbee and Douglas and Sierra Vista, those communities along the 2,000 miles of our southern borders, those States and local governments that incur greater costs than other jurisdictions. 
   Over the past several years, these communities have exceeded SCAAP reimbursement funding by hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact, most counties along the U.S.-Mexico border are currently being reimbursed less than 9 percent of their cost. 
   Just today, Mr. Speaker, in our Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I heard from a number of Federal agencies about the President's Merida Initiative. 
   I believe it is unacceptable that the President would refuse to reimburse our local law enforcement agencies, while asking Congress to spend $1.44 billion in assistance to Mexico and Central America. We need to invest our dollars in local law enforcement before we spend billions of dollars across the border. We have to prioritize the safety of our American communities first. We have to take the appropriate steps to ensure that SCAAP funding is in place, especially to border States like Arizona, and that it remains a Federal priority. 
   I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle to reject the President's cuts to SCAAP funding. Arizona, like many States, is currently facing a budget shortfall. Every dollar reduction in SCAAP reimbursement means a dollar less in Arizona or another State that they can spend on essential public safety services. So please join me in supporting our State and local law enforcement agencies by adequately funding the SCAAP program in the House fiscal year 2009 budget.

<DOCNO>Ms. GIFFORDS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Speaker, as Members of the 110th Congress we are about to cast one of our most important votes yet. Americans in my district of southern Arizona and across the country want their Representatives to bring closure to the United States' involvement in Iraq. This vote is the first step towards doing precisely that. 
   A few weeks ago President Bush gave a nationally televised speech to the American people to announce his new way forward for Iraq. But it sounded strangely familiar. The President acknowledged that his policies and plans in Iraq had failed to yield the promised results, and yet his only suggestion was to do more of the same. 
   During my first few weeks in Congress serving on the House Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have been listening, learning, asking tough questions. I have participated in many hours of hearings and briefings with top administration officials. 
   Those people include Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace, Secretary of the Army Francis Harvey, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former Congressman Lee Hamilton, co-chairman of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group commissioned by the President. 
   Since being sworn into Congress, I have also been reading dozens of letters sent to me by my constituents, flying home to my district almost every single weekend to meet with concerned citizens. 
   Recently I attended a returning warrior event in Arizona for Reservists coming back from combat. And last week I visited Walter Reed Hospital here in Washington, D.C. to speak with wounded soldiers and their families. 
   These collective experiences have made me more confident than ever that the global war on terror and the situation in Iraq are more complicated than President Bush seems to realize. Common sense dictates that in order for any plan to succeed it must require the Iraqi people to calm the sectarian violence and unify behind a workable political structure. 
   The President's plan fails to acknowledge the lack of willingness and capacity by the Iraqi political and religious leaders to achieve these necessary goals. Sectarian factions are divided more than ever. Without the serious involvement and motivation of the Iraqi people, the President's proposals to send more American troops into harm's way amounts to little more than having 21,000 more soldiers stay the course. 
   This I cannot support. The President should consider the views of many active and retired military generals who advised him to change his strategy in Iraq. Instead of adding more soldiers, he should instead focus on some of the best recommendations set forward by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group that he commissioned. 
   These recommendations include keeping Iraq rapid reaction and special operation forces in Iraq to strike al Qaeda militias, setting performance benchmarks for the Iraqi Government and holding them accountable, providing economic assistance to Iraq that will help create jobs, strengthen infrastructure, and improve the Iraqi capacity to be independent and stable. 
   Last but not least, beginning a new dialogue with Iraq's neighbors because they need to be part of the solution. The basic message of the Iraq Study Group and other credible experts and strategists is that the situation in Iraq is a political not just a military crisis. 
   The President's military escalation plan without a political component is bound to fail. Along with all other patriotic Americans, I strongly support our men and women in uniform who are risking their lives to protect and defend our Nation. 
   Our Armed Forces must have the tools, the training and the support that they need to be successful in any mission. I have serious concerns, Mr. Speaker, that our Army, Marine Corps, along with Guard and Reserve forces are being stretched too thin.     
   Instead of sending 21,000 more young American soldiers to Iraq as part of that same failed strategy, the President should focus on the Global War on Terror. Failure is not an option. America must prevail against many serious threats around the world, whether in the Middle East or elsewhere. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will vote to support the resolution before this body because our brave men and women in uniform deserve a strategy that honors their sacrifices. The President's plan does not do that.

<TEXT>
   Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, I would like to submit for the Record the following concerns and suggestions regarding certain sections of S. 2284, the Senate version of the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act. These specific concerns were expressed to me by officials from the town of Marana, Arizona. They relate to the potential adverse effects these sections could have on the Marana community. I urge my House and Senate colleagues to take all of these concerns into consideration while negotiating the final version of this bill. 
   The specific concerns relating to Section 6 are the reason I voted ``no'' on the Republican Motion To Instruct Conferees that was offered on the floor today.
