<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan stimulus package. This bill will provide tax relief for over 1 million Nevada families who will receive an average rebate of over $800. 
   With the unemployment rate in my State climbing above the national average to a 5-year high of 5.8 percent, this timely support will help these families weather the financial storm while they search for and find new employment. 
   I'm also especially supportive of the provisions of the bill that address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of foreclosures in the country. The increased funding for mortgage counseling, along with new higher loan limits for loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA, will help thousands of Nevadans avoid foreclosure and keep their families in their homes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the gentleman for giving me so much time.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (COMMENDING THE MEMBERS OF THE NEVADA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD AND AIR NATIONAL GUARD -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Ellsworth, for giving me a few moments of his time in order to sing the praises of Nevada's National Guard. I particularly want to thank my colleague from Nevada, DEAN HELLER, for having the good sense and good taste to introduce this resolution honoring our National Guard. I am very grateful to him for that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution and in deep gratitude to the members of the Nevada National Guard who have made so many sacrifices to serve our country and my home State of Nevada. 
   Since 9/11, more than 1,850 of our soldiers have mobilized to support the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. That's 64 percent of our Nevada Guardsmen deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. As we speak, 263 Nevada National Guard members are serving on active duty in support of a number of operations around the world, with 136 of them currently serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   These brave men and women have had to endure years of separation in long and difficult tours of duty overseas. Their service takes an enormous toll on them and their families, and this resolution is just a small token of our appreciation. Some of them have made the ultimate sacrifice, and for that we will forever be in their debt and the debt of their loved ones. 
   I want to highlight the actions of just one of these brave soldiers. Specialist Douglas Pierce of the 221st Cavalry was recently presented the Army Commendation Medal with Valor for his actions in Iraq on June 3, 2007. Specialist Pierce was providing escort security when his convoy came under attack. After escorting the convoy out of danger, Pierce returned to the area under enemy fire to provide medical aid to wounded soldiers. He didn't have to go back into the area, but because of his brave action, one of the soldiers he assisted is alive today and recovering at Walter Reed Hospital. 
   I am also proud that this Congress is giving back to those like Specialist Pierce who have served our country so bravely. We recently updated the GI Bill for the 21st century, increasing education benefits for those who have served since 9/11, including reservists and members of our National Guard. We have once again restored our promise to our veterans by guaranteeing a 4-year education for those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and providing members of the National Guard with the tools they need to succeed in the workplace. And, at long last, we have finally given the same benefits to our National Guardsmen as we have long provided the rest of our Armed Forces. 
   Mr. Speaker, the debt we owe to our soldiers can never be fully repaid, but I hope this Congress, and I'm confident that this Congress, will continue to support them as much as we possibly can. 
   I urge support for this resolution. Before I yield back, I want to thank my colleague from Nevada once again, Mr. Heller, for introducing this resolution. I appreciate it, and I know the Guardsmen and their families do as well.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the subcommittee chairman for that very lovely introduction. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important resolution, in support of a U.S. ally and a fellow democracy. 
   For ever 50 years, Taiwan and the United States have enjoyed a strong political and economic partnership. Taiwan is our eighth largest trading partner with almost $60 billion in bilateral trade. In the last two decades, we have watched Taiwan blossom into one of the world's leading democracies, holding a number of open, fair, and internationally approved elections. Its constitution guarantees fundamental freedoms and civil liberties and ensures all citizens have a voice in local and national affairs. 
   Mr. Speaker, in an age of terrorism and political violence, it is absolutely imperative that the United States stands up for peaceful and free countries around the globe. We must make certain our fellow democracies can determine their own destinies at the ballot box without fear of attack or violence. And as this resolution states, we must continue to provide Taiwan with the ability to defend itself, to safeguard the expansion of democracy on that island and in its region in the coming years. 
   Taiwan is a vibrant democracy, a trusted ally, a strategic partner of the United States. It is imperative, I repeat, that we signal our support for the world to see that America stands with its fellow democracy and will defend against any threat of military aggression. 
   I urge support for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this important legislation. For too long, our Nation has depended on the old way of doing things, on corrupt dictators, on non-renewable and polluting sources of energy. 
   With this bill today, We stand at a crossroads: we can either continue down the old, failed road, or we can move ahead with new ideas that wean us off foreign oil, clean our skies, and ensure that our children inherit a cleaner, safer world. 
   In my home State of Nevada, our legislature has required that by 2015, 20 percent of power sold to Nevadans is derived from renewables. Already, energy providers have built or planned half a dozen major solar power projects in order to meet the requirements. Nevadans are looking to the future and so are our fellow Americans. 
   This bill is a great first step toward securing our energy independence. It provides the right incentives to energy providers to move to cleaner, renewable sources of energy. It sets realistic standards for utilities to provide renewable energy sources. It sets higher fuel efficiency standards so we can stop relying on corrupt dictators for our energy needs. 
   We are far from being energy independent, but today's bill is a good place to start, and I urge my colleagues to look to the future rather than the past. Let's break from our old ways and support this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Employee Free Choice Act. I think it is very important for people listening to know that this piece of legislation does not take away the right for a secret ballot. It adds an additional right and a protection of a card check. In addition to that, even though that is what the other side is focused on, it adds other protections that are necessary to protect a worker's right to organize in this country. 
   This country is filled with wonderful employers, and certainly my district has about the best employers that you could find anywhere. But there are abuses and there are problems that this piece of legislation addresses. 
   I have a woman from my district, Anishya Sanders, who is here in Washington this week to tell her story, and let me very briefly tell you about her. 
   She has worked as a traffic control flagger for 3 years, helping to make sure that everyone gets around construction sites safely. In Las Vegas, that is a big deal, because every road is a construction site. This is a woman who has fought for the right to unionize and we should pass this on her behalf. 
   Anishya, a single mother of five, has fought to form a union because she needs health insurance so she can take her children to a doctor when they are sick, because she wants to be paid enough to provide for her children's basic needs, and because she wants to be safe at work. 
   Anishya coordinated the effort that led to a majority of employees at her company choosing to form a union. Instead of respecting the employees' decision, the company fired two workers and has harassed and intimidated Anishya and others. Under the current system, these workers are treated like second-class citizens. 
   It is up to us to protect workers against the injustice that has been done to Anishya and her coworkers. I urge my colleagues to support the Employee Free Choice Act so that all Americans can freely decide whether they want to organize in order to negotiate for better working conditions.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Visclosky for his assistance on this issue and Congressman Hobson for his agreement to accept this amendment.  
   My amendment is based on a simple concept--the Department of Energy, or any government entity for that matter, should not be using taxpayer funds to ``educate'' the children of America about one side of a very complicated and contentious issue. The Department of Energy's Web site includes a section called the ``Yucca Mountain Youth Zone,'' featuring the cartoon character Yucca Mountain Johnny, along with games and activities designed to convince kids that the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is a good idea. 
   My position on Yucca Mountain should not be a mystery to any member of this body. I have long opposed the plan to bury nuclear waste in the Nevada desert following what I consider to be a process based on politics rather than sound science. But I recognize that reasonable people can disagree about such an important issue. What I do not accept, however, is that the Department of Energy can get away with trivializing a very serious debate by using a Nuclear Joe Camel to promote Yucca Mountain to children. 
   My amendment would eliminate funding for the Yucca Mountain Youth Zone Web site. Regardless of whether you support Yucca Mountain or oppose it, all members of the House should agree that this Web site is not an appropriate use of taxpayer funds. 
   If the Department of Energy really wants to remain in the cartoon business, I suggest they come up with a new character that would educate our children on the need for clean and renewable energy--how about Solar Sally or Geothermal George? In any case, I urge my colleagues to join me in dumping Yucca Mountain Johnny.  
   What I would like to do right now, in accordance with our agreement, is yield to Mr. Visclosky.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, Congress has taken several steps to shore up the Nation's economy, including passage of the economic stimulus bill that provided millions of Americans with rebate checks and measures to help homeowners struggling to stay in their homes. This legislation is an important next step. 
   The once recession-proof economy of my district of Las Vegas has not been spared the effects of this downturn. In fact, Nevada has been hit harder than any other State by the foreclosure crisis, and currently our unemployment rate is above the national average. 
   With gas prices and the cost of food skyrocketing, fewer visitors are coming to Las Vegas. That means that more workers are going to be laid off. It is, therefore, absolutely critical that Congress step up and pass an extension of unemployment benefits. 
   I support the bill we are considering today because it will help thousands of hardworking Nevadans get by until the situation improves and they can return to work.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the chairman of the VA Committee for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. I listened to what Mr. Boswell had to say. He is the prime sponsor of the bill. I heard him in committee and I heard him again on the floor, and I appreciate so much the fact that he has brought this to Congress' attention. And a special thank you to Joshua's family and his parents. I am not sure if my child had committed suicide after his service in Iraq that I would have the strength to not only go on as they have, but to try to bring PTSD to the attention of the American people and actually do something about it. 
   I want to share why this is important to me and why I am supporting this bill. More than 1,600 Nevada veterans have returned from serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of these brave men and women suffer from PTSD. Nationally, one in five veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are suffering from PTSD; 35 percent have been diagnosed with some sort of mental disorder. It is vital that our veterans receive the help they need to deal with this condition. 
   A few years ago a constituent of mine, Lance Corporal Justin Bailey, returned from Iraq with some physical injuries as well as a diagnosis of PTSD. He struggled with addiction to legal prescription and illegal drugs. After consultation with his parents, he checked himself into the West L.A. VA facility where he was given five additional prescription drugs, including  methadone, without proper oversight. The next day, the man was dead. 
   I can't understand, it is incomprehensible to me why a facility would give anyone with a substance abuse problem a 30-day supply of medication unsupervised under a self-medication policy. This devastating loss of life could have been and should have been prevented. This is a systemic problem in our VA system, and that's why this issue needs immediate attention. 
   One other quick story, if you can call it a story. About a month ago I called a grandmother in Pahrump, Nevada. It is a small town outside of Las Vegas. Her grandson lived with her. He came home from his first tour of duty in Iraq, and he was messed up mentally. He was suffering from PTSD. It was apparent to anybody who spoke to him. He didn't want to go back. He felt he couldn't handle it. He was emotionally and physically drained, and he begged not to go back. 
   So the military's response was they gave him Prozac because he was depressed and they sent him back to the front lines in Iraq. The day he got back to Iraq, he blew his brains out. That is a very difficult thing to come to grips with if you are the grandmother of a grandson who begged you not to let him go back to Iraq. 
   We have problems with PTSD. It is imperative that we provide adequate mental health services for those who have and are currently sacrificing for our great Nation. This bill takes a step in the right direction in providing our veterans with the health care they have earned.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I had prepared remarks, but I am going to set them aside and submit them for the RECORD, because as I was listening to the debate, I couldn't believe my ears as speaker after speaker on the other side of the aisle came up and attacked this relatively simple piece of legislation, talking about how it doesn't go far enough and it doesn't do this and it doesn't do that, when they have had at least 6 years to actually do something about the energy crisis in this country. 
   When they had the opportunity to do something, they came up with that god-awful 2005 energy bill, where 93 percent of the tax subsidies went to oil, gas and nuclear, and only 7 percent went to alternative energy sources, so that we could develop these alternative energy sources, harness the Sun, wind, Moon, not the Moon, although maybe if we had enough money, we could try that too, geothermal, all of these possible alternative energy sources. And what did they do? Seven measly percent of the tax subsidies went to that. 
   I would suggest that we have a golden opportunity to do something, and I  urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. It is a good first step.  
   Mr. Speaker, in 2005, Congress passed energy legislation intended to promote secure, affordable and reliable energy. This was an important goal, because many of us realized that to keep our Nation safe, we must break our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Unfortunately, instead of focusing on the promotion of clean, renewable energy sources, the 2005 energy bill gave substantial subsidies to the oil and gas industry. I voted against this bill because it made no sense to give incentives to an industry that was enjoying record profits. 
   Today, oil and gas companies continue to rake in high profits while Congress fails to offer substantial incentives to alternative energy investors. In the absence of effective federal policy to promote investment in renewables, many states have passed their own incentives. 
   In my home state of Nevada, the legislature has required that by 2015, 20 percent of power sold to Nevadans come from renewables. Nevadans are already seeing results from this mandate--last June, construction began in Las Vegas on the largest solar power installation in the country built by a public agency, and five other solar projects are planned for southern Nevada. 
   I am supporting H.R. 6 today because it is a great first step toward securing energy independence. In the last Congress, I introduced a bill to promote renewable energy production, and I reintroduce this bill in the 110th Congress. We are far from being energy independent, but today's bill is a good place to start, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) for yielding, and a special thank you to Mr. Waxman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here today in support of a resolution that I have reintroduced that would promote the goals and ideals of creating a day in honor of the women of America's suffragist movement. 
   The goal of this resolution is to recognize the anniversary of the inaugural women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. The suffragists are role models who inspired an entire generation and continue to inspire generations of young American women, just as they have two young women from the State of Nevada, Hannah Low and Destiny Carroll, who started their own petition drive to pay tribute to the efforts of these great suffragists. 
   Hannah Low and Destiny Carroll presented a petition to me with hundreds of signatures from their fourth grade class in support of creating a day to recognize the achievements of our brave suffragists. 
   I cannot tell you how proud I am of Hannah and Destiny, and I thank them for serving as an inspiration for this resolution. 
   While it may seem unbelievable to us now, it was not that long ago that women did not have the right to vote in our great Nation. On July 19, 1848, the first public appeal for women's suffrage was made, and a new movement was born for equality. 
   We owe these suffragists a debt of gratitude for their efforts in their fight to give women the right to vote and to be full participating members in our Nation's political process. I hope that recognizing the anniversary of the inaugural women's rights convention in 1848 will keep alive the memory of the struggle to win the fundamental right, the right to vote, for women. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (CELEBRATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Earlier today, this House passed the concurrent resolution recognizing the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel and reaffirming the bonds of close friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel. 
   I was not yet born in 1948 when the State of Israel declared its independence, but I grew up and was born into a family where the fact that Israel had been created meant everything to us, and I want to share with you why that is. 
   I am the granddaughter of immigrants to this country that couldn't speak English. My mother's side of the family comes from Salonica, Greece. Prior to World War II, there was a vibrant Jewish community in Salonica. Over half the population, 80,000 people, were Jewish. By the time the Nazis finished with the Jews of Salonica, there were only 1,000 out of the 80,000 Jews left. 
   On my father's side of the family, we who come from the Russian-Poland border, the entire culture, a vibrant culture that had existed for over 1,000 years, was exterminated along with most of the Jewish population of Poland. 
   I grew up hearing stories from my grandmothers about what it was like in the countries that they came from and how happy they were to be Americans, to be Jewish Americans. My family had a profound sense of patriotism and pride in being Americans, but they also, and we also, are Jewish. 
   And the fact that there is a country uniquely belonging to the Jewish people said something to us about the ability of surviving so that anything like what happened in World War II never happened again. 
   A couple of years ago, I had the privilege of attending the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. I had never wanted to go to Auschwitz before because of all of the horrors that took place there during World War II: People systematically slaughtered for the very mere fact they were Jewish; starved, killed, exterminated, gassed. 
   But I did go to this commemoration. And I was told by the late Tom Lantos, my dear friend, a story while we were sitting there. Two weeks before this commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Israel Defense Force had their own commemoration. And the head of the Israel Defense Force got up at Auschwitz, and he said the following words. He said to the members of the Israel Defense Force who were there participating in this ceremony, We are 60 years too late, but we are here now; and with that, four Israeli jets buzzed over Auschwitz. 
   That symbolism was not lost on anybody sitting there. If Israel had existed 60 years ago, perhaps hundreds of thousands of Jews could have been saved and kept from the gas chambers. 
   If I wasn't Jewish and Israel didn't mean so much to me in a highly personal way, as an American, I would celebrate the birth of Israel and its existence. The modern State of Israel has rebuilt a nation, forged a new and dynamic democratic society, created a thriving economic, political, cultural, and intellectual life despite the pain of war and almost constant terrorist attacks, attacked in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, and all the time moving forward and expanding their economy, expanding their way of life, living in a thriving and vibrant democracy.     
   Our strongest ally, America's strongest ally on the planet is that little State of Israel; votes with us all the time in the United Nations, supports us, and we, in turn, support it because it is mutually beneficial to both the United States and to the State of Israel. 
   It would be my fervent dream that before the next anniversary of Israel, that there would be a Jewish State of Israel living side by side in peace with a Palestinian state that was also democratic, with a free press, free speech, and a vibrant economy and a way of life where people could reach across those divides and live a better life together. 
   And with that, I yield back the balance of my time with great pride in the 60th anniversary of the creation of the State of Israel.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentlewoman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution of which I am a proud cosponsor. In the summer of 2006, we witnessed a major breakthrough in the troubled history of this divided island. After years of conflict, both sides committed themselves to the reunification of Cyprus based on a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation and political equality. By agreeing to these principles, they recognize the status quo is unacceptable and that continuing it only hurts both the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities. 
   In connection with this agreement, we are all pleased to see the Cypriot Government take a number of confidence-building measures, demolishing walls and even providing free health care to Turkish Cypriots. 
   This summer, my family and I traveled to Cyprus and had the pleasure of enjoying the legendary Cypriot hospitality. While I enjoyed the beauty and serenity of the island, I was most struck by the openness and warmth of the people there, who treated my family and me with the greatest regard. It is cruel that such a warm and hospitable people should continue to be subjected to this conflict. 
   We were simply appalled by the state of the ``green line'' area. It is a blot on an otherwise breathtaking country. It is time that the Turkish troops remove themselves from this island so that, at our next visit, Cyprus will once again be a peaceful and unified island free of occupation. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for both sides to come together to execute the July 2006 agreement. The principles have been laid out and all that we need now is implementation. I urge support for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Filner and Mr. Miller for their steadfast support for this legislation, and Ms. Baldwin for bringing this to our attention for quite awhile now, waiting for us to act, and act we should. 
   As Mr. Filner is well aware, having been to my congressional district, southern Nevada has one of the fastest growing veterans populations in the country, with nearly 218,000 veterans living in Clark County. And when I first started serving in Congress, I only had 160,000 veterans, so our veterans population has increased quite dramatically. It is even more important that former service men and women have the health care and benefits that they have earned. 
   I am a cosponsor of this legislation which would allow veterans who have complete loss of sight in one eye due to a service-connected injury to receive increased disability compensation if they lose sight in the other eye, regardless of whether that loss of sight is service connected. 
   For some reason, and I don't understand why, the VA has a higher threshold for determining blindness than any of the States and for the Social Security Administration. Because of this, veterans like my constituent, retired Army Major General Roy Kekahuna, are not covered for deteriorating vision in both eyes, even though they are considered legally blind. 
   Let us through this legislation demonstrate our true appreciation to our veterans for their sacrifice on behalf of this Nation by meeting our promise to provide them with proper health care and by passing this important piece of legislation.

   H.R. 1284, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, will help our service-disabled veterans and their survivors maintain the purchasing power of their benefits in 2008. 
   Now, everyone that has spoken before me has been quite eloquent, and you don't need for me to reinforce all of the statements that they have already made. But I would like to let you know how this affects the people that I represent. 
   Last year, over 31,000 veterans and survivors received disability compensation or pension payments from the VA in the State of Nevada. The action we are taking here today will help the Nevada veterans and families who depend on these VA benefits. No amount of money can adequately compensate our veterans for the loss of their health, or families for the loss of a loved one. It is important, though, that these benefits do not lose their value over time, and that we demonstrate our genuine appreciation for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of our Nation.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, 20 years ago Congress declared that my home State of Nevada would become this Nation's nuclear garbage dump. The legislation is known in the State of Nevada as the ``Screw Nevada Bill.'' 
   Two decades later, the families I represent remain overwhelmingly opposed to having toxic nuclear waste buried 90 minutes from their homes, businesses, and where their children play. They have seen the mismanagement at Yucca Mountain, the lack of quality assurance and recent scandals where workers admitted to having falsified work on the site. 
   Nevada families know that there is currently no canister capable of storing nuclear waste for thousands of years and that, once inside of Yucca Mountain, corrosive elements will cause the canisters that do exist to rapidly fail, corrode, releasing radioactivity into nearby water supplies. Moms and dads fear thousands of truckloads of nuclear waste barreling down the highways of southern Nevada, home to more than 2 million families and a destination that attracts more than 40 million visitors a year. They have seen over the past 25 years how promises for ``fair treatment'' and ``sound science'' have been trumped by raw politics. And in 2002 they watched as Congress ignored Nevada's objections and declared that Yucca Mountain should go forward in spite of serious unresolved scientific issues that linger to this very day. 
   The circuit court of appeals decision that threw out the 10,000-year EPA radiation standards, there is a reason that they threw it out. Currently, no radiation standards exist for Yucca Mountain because they would have to find radiation standards for a 300,000-year time, leaving most of us to wonder if the financial status of the nuclear industry is more important than protecting the public safety and lives of American citizens. 
   Fortunately, Nevadans are not alone in opposing Yucca Mountain. Across this Nation, communities that face decades of nuclear waste shipments have raised their voices in opposition to Yucca Mountain. They share our concerns about terrorist attacks or an accident involving this lethal cargo. One nuclear waste spill could threaten thousands of lives, shut down rail lines and highways, and cost millions of dollars to clean up. Who is going to pay for that cleanup? 
   Post-9/11 we know all too well that there are those who will stop at nothing to strike at this Nation. Terrorists seeking to release radioactive materials or to secure a dirty bomb could target these waste shipments for attack, making each train or truckload a disaster waiting to happen. Our communities do not have the resources and our first responders simply do not have the training to deal with this threat. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are more reasons to oppose Yucca Mountain. This literal hole in the Nevada desert has already cost taxpayers $12 billion, and the sky is the limit when it comes to future spending: $100 billion, $200 billion, $300 billion? Nobody can tell us and nobody knows. The last time the DOE updated the cost analysis for Yucca Mountain was 2001. The Department of Energy said in 2006, and again this year, they will provide updated cost analysis. They haven't yet done that because they don't know. The DOE's failure to provide us with an up-to-date life-cycle cost analysis for this project is just one more reason to oppose this multibillion dollar boondoggle. 
   And here is another: Yucca Mountain is even further away today than it was 20 years ago when we first started down this path. After $12 billion in spending, Yucca Mountain is now so far behind schedule that it will not even open until 2020 or beyond. Remember, it was supposed to be 1998. Meanwhile, the last shipments will not even leave the nuclear reactor sites until 2047. That is 40 years from today. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have a better solution. The first step is to keep nuclear waste where it is now in hardened dry-cask storage containers that can be secured for the next 100 years. End Yucca Mountain before we waste another $200 billion to $300 billion. And then, finally, find a real solution to securing this Nation's nuclear waste. 
   I urge you to vote to cut wasteful spending at Yucca Mountain, protect 50 million Americans in the communities all across our Nation who will be in danger from nuclear waste shipments and the families who oppose plans to turn Nevada into a radioactive garbage dump. 
   Before I yield back, I want to thank both Mr. Hobson and Mr. Visclosky for yielding me this time. I appreciate their courtesy that is of monumental importance to the people I represent, the citizens of Nevada, and those who are living on these very dangerous transportation routes.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague for this very thoughtful amendment. 
   The Yucca Mountain project is a failure. Twenty years after Nevada was unfairly singled out as the proposed dumpsite for this Nation's radioactive garbage, the only waste at Yucca Mountain is the $12 million that has now been wasted on this ridiculous proposal. 
   Plans for Yucca Mountain threaten the safety of the families I represent and the lives of 50 million Americans who will be at risk from shipments of toxic radioactive garbage headed to Yucca Mountain. One spill involving this deadly nuclear waste could make people sick, die, and shut down our roads and railways, and cost millions to clean up. 
   Nuclear waste shipments are also prime targets for terrorists looking to unleash radiation on unsuspecting communities or to steal material needed to make a dirty bomb. Current plans call for thousands of nuke waste shipments on America's roads and railways, each one vulnerable to a handheld missile or 9/11-style suicide attack, the results of which could be devastating. 
   Decades of ``mobile Chernobyls'' passing by homes, schools, hospitals, houses of worship, each an accident waiting to happen. And believe me, Mr. Chairman, our first responders have no training and no resources needed to deal with incidents involving these nuclear waste shipments.  
   We talk about money and saving money by putting more money into Yucca Mountain? We have absolutely no idea how much Yucca Mountain is going to cost because there is no cost estimate. We have no time estimates. We have no radiation standards. We don't have canisters that currently exist that can store this nuclear waste and not have the nuclear material leach into the groundwater that is going to pollute all of the Southwestern United States water supplies. 
   Now, if we want to do something for the American people, let's end this ridiculous folly before it costs us any more money. We have the power to do it in Congress. It is time that we stop this ridiculous proposal.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (NATIONAL OSTEOPOROSIS AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to especially single out Chairwoman Schakowsky for her concern and her leadership on this issue. 
   I rise today in support of recognizing May as National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. Osteoporosis and low bone density affect more than 44 million Americans over the age of 50. Many are unaware of their risks for osteoporosis and therefore never take the steps that are necessary and relatively easy to prevent this disease. 
   Like many Americans, I had no idea that I was at risk for developing osteoporosis. When I was running for Congress in 1998, I was first diagnosed with this disease. Fortunately, since I received a proper diagnosis, within 10 months of receiving the diagnosis and getting the proper treatment, I was able to stop my bone density loss and my bones actually began to strengthen again. 
   Now, it became very apparent to us once I was diagnosed that my two grandmothers more than likely had osteoporosis. As they aged, they became more bent over and they started breaking bones, but we just thought that was part of old age and we never imagined, because in those days you didn't get tested for that sort of thing, that they both probably suffered from osteoporosis as well. 
   Because of my personal experience with osteoporosis, I'm committed to ensuring that Americans are aware of the importance of strong bones so they can reduce their chances of developing the disease, and that's why I have introduced House Resolution 369, the Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Act. Among the resolution's goals  is to bring attention to the importance of building strong bones during childhood and adolescence. Up to 90 percent of peak bone mass or optimum bone strength is acquired by age 18 in girls and age 20 in boys, which makes childhood and adolescence the best time to invest in your bones. 
   This resolution also addresses the importance of eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, participating in weight-bearing exercises and choosing a lifestyle without smoking or alcohol consumption. Each year, as Chairman Schakowsky has already stated, there are more than 2 million osteoporotic fractures costing about $19 billion a year. 
   I strongly urge my fellow citizens to visit their doctors, get screened for osteoporosis; and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and other pieces of legislation that are providing for bone density screening. Rather than cutting this important part of preventative care, we ought to be enhancing it, and I urge support of this resolution and others that affect the health and well-being of our fellow Americans.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman for obtaining this position. I know he is going to do a remarkable job. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution and in support of a United States ally and a fellow democracy. 
   For over 50 years, Taiwan and the United States have enjoyed a strong political and economic partnership. In the last two decades, we have watched Taiwan blossom into one of the world's leading democracies, holding a number of open, fair, and internationally approved elections. Its constitution guarantees fundamental freedoms and civil liberties, and ensures all citizens have a voice in local and national affairs. 
   Mr. Speaker, in an age of terrorism and political violence, it is absolutely imperative that the United States stand up for and stand with peaceful and free countries around the globe. We must make certain that our fellow democracies can determine their own destinies at the ballot box without fear of attack or violence. 
   This resolution calls on our government to reaffirm its unwavering commitment to Taiwan's democracy and security. One way for us to do this is to support this election and avoid being seen as taking sides. Only by standing firmly with a democratic Taiwan can we uphold the principles, our principles, of promoting peace and democracy worldwide. I urge support for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him very much for his leadership on this important issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 2005, Israel voluntarily withdraw from the Gaza Strip. Making incredibly painful concessions, the Israeli Government forced its own citizens to abandon their homes, businesses, and synagogues in Gaza in the hope that the Palestinians would use this opportunity to build a functioning state, to demonstrate that they were capable of self-governance. 
   Instead, Hamas burned down those homes and businesses and used Gaza as a missile launching pad to attack Israelis who live on undisputed Israeli territory. Hamas does not want a Palestinian state. Its mission is to destroy Israel. That is painfully clear. 
   First, it was Sderot, just a few kilometers from the Gaza, a constant barrage of short-range, imprecise missiles falling indiscriminately and occasionally hitting a school or a home or a child in Sderot. 
   Now Hamas has longer range missiles acquired from Iran, and they have now hit Ashkelon, a thriving city of 120,000 men, women, and Israeli children. What next? Tel Aviv? Jerusalem? How many Israelis have to die before Israel is justified in defending its citizens? 
   Instead of applauding Israel for standing up to Hamas, the world denounces this democracy at every turn. When the Israelis finally cut off, after much provocation and extraordinary constraint, cut off the water and electricity to Gaza in an effort to weaken Hamas' grip, the world called it a human rights violation. And when Israel goes after Hamas, a terrorist organization that purposely puts its own civilians in harm's way and has vowed to destroy Israel, they are called war criminals. Abu Mazen likened Israel's action to the Holocaust. Abu Mazen is a Holocaust denier, and he has the audacity to liken survival of the State of Israel to the Holocaust? What nation in the world provides electricity and water to its enemy so they can lob missiles back at them? 
   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Israeli Government for standing up to Hamas and for doing what every state would  do in their position: defend their citizens. And I find it astonishing that the United States Congress must periodically affirm Israel's right to exist and Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks. I urge support for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, I also would like to thank the chairman of our full committee, Mr. Filner, for being so supportive, and the chairman of our subcommittee, Mr. Michaud, for helping to make this legislation a reality today. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to be part of this important piece of legislation. 
   Nationally, one in five veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD. Twenty-three percent of members of the Armed Forces on active duty acknowledge that they have a significant problem with alcohol. Veterans must receive the help they need to deal with these conditions. 
   The effects of substance abuse are devastating, including significantly increased risk of suicide, exacerbation of mental and physical health disorders, breakdown of family support, and increased risk of unemployment and homelessness. Veterans suffering from mental health problems are at increased risk for developing a substance abuse disorder. 
   A constituent of mine, Lance Corporal Justin Bailey, was a 1998 graduate of Las Vegas High School. Upon returning from a tour of duty in Iraq, he was diagnosed with PTSD and was discharged from the Marines in 2004. He developed a substance abuse disorder, and with the encouragement of his parents, checked himself into a VA facility in west Los Angeles to get the treatment that he needed and recognized that he needed. 
   He sought treatment for a drug abuse problem, and yet he was given five additional medications on a self-medication program. With those five additional medications in his system, Justin overdosed and died on January 26, 2007. 
   The loss of a child is devastating enough, but what made matters worse is the way that Justin's parents were treated by the VA. They were treated with indifference and apathy at the West L.A. facility that their son died at. They were handed Justin's belongings in a trash bag. 
   Last August, 8 months after Justin's death, the Baileys returned to Los Angeles to meet with the Chief of Staff at the West L.A. facility. They came away from the meeting feeling that the Chief of Staff had been completely unprepared and seemed out of touch with the needs of the veterans. The Chief of Staff went so far as to state that his staff didn't know how to treat veterans of the Iraq and Afghan war because they were young, and the staff was not tough enough on these younger veterans, they tended to give them anything they asked for. 
   I'm very pleased that the committee included my amendment to require the VA to conduct a review of all residential mental health care facilities, including domiciliary facilities, and agree to rename the bill in Justin's honor. I know this means a great deal to Justin's family. 
   Passage of the Justin Bailey Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Prevention Act will help to ensure that we have the mental health resources and substance abuse treatment programs needed to care for our veterans. The assessments of residential mental health facilities required will help us to learn how well the VA is performing and what we can do to improve these services, including expanded availability at VA hospitals. 
   The availability of treatment for PTSD, including substance abuse disorder counseling, will save many lives. This must remain a top priority. 
   A review of the services provided to our veterans is needed to ensure that what happened to Justin does not happen to anyone else ever again. 
   It's imperative that we provide adequate mental health services for those who have sacrificed for our great Nation and those who continue to serve. 
   I wholeheartedly support H.R. 5554 and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to welcome Rabbi Felipe Goodman to the United States Congress. His credentials are as impressive as his spirit and his commitment. I know because not only is he my rabbi, he's my close personal friend. 
   Born in Mexico City, he is an alumni of Mexico City's University of the New World and obtained his master's degree from the Jewish Theological Seminary. Ordained in 1996, Rabbi Goodman now leads one of the most vibrant and fastest-growing conservative congregations in the United States, Temple Beth Sholom in my hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada. 
   In his 10 years of service, his congregation has grown from 100 to more than 700 families. He has built an entire new campus and is building a new home for its thriving school. 
   On January 5, 2007, 1 day after his 40th birthday, Rabbi Goodman became a United States citizen. 
   Rabbi Goodman is the co-author of ``Hagadah de Pesaj,'' which is the most widely used edition of The Pesach Hagadah used in Latin America. 
   Singled-out by international leaders for both his ideas and hard work, Felipe became vice president of the World Union of Jewish Students. 
   He is one of 12 members of The Rabbinic Cabinet of The Chancellor of The Jewish Theological Seminary and serves as a member of The Joint Placement Commission of The Rabbinical Assembly, The United Synagogue and JTS. The Seminary recently appointed him to the Joint Retirement Board of The Conservative Movement. He's a former member of The Executive Council of The Rabbinical Assembly and its Nominating Committee. 
   But more than any degree or honor or appointment, he is an important, warm, caring, and respected spiritual and religious leader in Las Vegas, Nevada, a devoted husband to Liz; a wonderful father to Yoshua, Daniela, and Ariela. 
   I am honored to have him here with us in the House today and honored to call Rabbi Felipe Goodman my rabbi and my friend.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Before I give my prepared remarks, I'd like to say that one of the reasons that I am so supportive of the Democratic proposal is because it does not have nuclear energy reliance which has a nuclear waste problem that no one has been able to solve. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this important legislation which will help our Nation move towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. 
   This bill provides necessary tax incentives for electricity produced from renewable resources, including wind, solar and geothermal. These incentives will provide badly needed assistance to clean renewable energy companies in my home State of Nevada and throughout the country that are working to diversify our Nation's energy portfolio and clean up our environment. 
   Power from the sun and wind and geothermal are unlimited. And these  entrepreneurs are ready to build and expand our renewable energy resources as soon as we in Congress give them the tools they need to move forward. 
   Energy independence is not just an environmental issue or an economic issue, it's a national security imperative. We pay exorbitant prices for oil from countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, who support and finance terrorism and terrorist attacks on America and our allies. We must stop funding both sides of this war on terror. By encouraging the development of renewable energy and energy independence, this bill helps move this country in the right direction. 
   Our Nation has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, and yet our energy future is being held up on the fantasy that we can drill our way out of our energy problems. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to move ahead and grow our clean energy resources instead of relying on old 20th-century technologies like nuclear, that is not clean or safe or inexpensive, or industries like oil that pollute our air and contribute to global warming to satisfy our Nation's energy needs. 
   Let's invest in our energy future by supporting this good piece of legislation.

   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on these important issues. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to provide incentives for clean, renewable domestic energy production, to improve our energy security, and to extend provisions that provide vital tax relief to parents, teachers, college students, small businesses and millions of other middle class Americans. 
   The energy provisions in this bill will allow my home State of Nevada to become an even stronger leader in the field of renewable energy. In a State that has a renewable energy standard and sunshine almost every day of the year, our entrepreneurs are anxious to secure the 8 years of solar energy tax credits contained in this bill, while our public utilities will finally be able to claim that credit as well. 
   Instead of capping solar tax credits at $2,000 for residential property owners, this bill will allow home owners to recoup 30 percent of their solar energy installation costs as a tax credit. 
   Solar is just one renewable energy source in this bill. There's also tax credits for wind, geothermal and biomass. The time is long past due for these important tax credits to be extended. 
   This legislation also renews a number of expired individual and business tax credits, and will ensure that the residents of Nevada and other States that do not pay a State income tax are treated fairly and allowed to deduct State and local sales taxes instead.     
   It's also important to note that the tax relief in this bill is fully paid for and will not add a single dollar to the national debt. Now, that's good fiscal policy. 
   I urge support for this bill, and I urge the Senate and the President to do their part to enact this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this important issue. 
   Madam Speaker, when Israel declared its independence in May, 1948, seven Arab nations immediately attacked the fledgling country and sought to drive Israel into the sea. Simultaneously, many of the same Arab nations forced their own Jewish citizens to leave their ancestral homes, making refugees out of nearly one million people. 
   The issue of Jewish refugees from Arab lands speaks to one of the fundamental problems of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Many Arab countries have refused to accept the existence of Israel,  while cynically exploiting the Palestinian refugees in their war against Israel. Arab leaders willingly agree to confine the Palestinians to squalid camps where terrorism and extremism and hate are bred instead of resettling them and welcoming their Palestinian brothers to their own oil rich lands. They claim a ``right of return'' for Palestinian refugees in the hope that they will flood Israel in order to undermine and ultimately destroy the Jewish State of Israel. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution begins to set the record straight, while setting out a balanced approach to address the refugee issue, all refugees. 
   Any peace plan must look at both sides of the refugee issue in an equal way. We must acknowledge the Jewish refugees from Arab lands, be aware of the hidden agenda behind a Palestinian ``right of return'' and expose the obstructive role played by both the Arab nations and the United Nations in the refugee issue. We must find just solutions for all refugees in this conflict, redressing the grievances of all sides while retaining Israel's integrity as a Jewish state.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for introducing this legislation. I am a granddaughter of immigrants to this country that couldn't speak English. They had no education when they came to the United States. The only thing they had was a dream, and that dream was that their children and their children's children would lead a better life here in the United States. 
   My father has a 9th grade education because he had to quit school in order to support his widowed mother and five brothers and sisters during the Depression. So my father had no education and my mother graduated high school, but the one thing they stressed in our home was that their children would get a good education. 
   Now, my dad was a waiter all the years I was growing up. And if it hadn't been for Federal loans to help me get through college and law school, I guarantee I wouldn't be sitting here as a Member of the United States House of Representatives. 
   For the people I represent, most of the students that attend college in Nevada are first-generation college-goers, just like I was. Their parents work in the casinos, they work in the service industry, and they didn't get an education, but they want their kids to. So these are the people that we are talking about. 
   There are almost 11,000 students that are similarly situated to what I was when I was a student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. There are 11,000 of them that are depending on these Federal subsidized loans. Of those 11,000, they are going to benefit if we pass this legislation to the tune of $2,300 over the life of that loan. That is a substantial amount of money when you are a first-generation college-goer and your family works as a waiter or waitress or a keno runner in a Nevada casino. 
   I cannot understand how anybody would think cutting an interest rate in half would not be a benefit to these students. I wholeheartedly endorse this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

   When I was a freshman Member of Congress about 10 years ago, a very senior Member, Tom Lantos, came to me and asked if I would be willing to be a member of the Human Rights Caucus. I, of course, would not hesitate for a moment if Tom Lantos asked me to in fact participate. It was, and has been, among one of the most rewarding experiences I have had in Congress, and I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to an absolutely extraordinary man and dear friend, Tom Lantos, than to create this Human Rights Commission in his name, and I support this resolution wholeheartedly. 
   But when I think of Tom Lantos, I also think of the last resolution that Congress took up a few moments ago marking the 70th anniversary of Kristallnacht, The Night of Broken Glass. In many ways Kristallnacht marked the turning point in the history of European Jewry.     
   Tragically, too few nations, including our own, dared to speak out or even thought to speak out against this horrific pogrom. As a result, the Nazis concluded that the world would stand by and do nothing as they committed atrocities that the world had never seen before. Indeed, after Kristallnacht, they intensified their genocidal operations, ultimately leading to the gas chambers and the Final Solution. 
   Sadly, the Nazis were proven right, that the world would stand by and watch a feeble response that has been repeated far too often since that horrific night in 1938. 
   Madam Speaker, the grim anniversary of Kristallnacht reminds us that evil must be confronted forcefully and early, or else these unspeakable acts will be repeated again and again. 
   I think, given the fact that we will be creating a Human Rights Commission in Tom Lantos' name, that perhaps because of this bold move on the part of Congress, that a Kristallnacht could never and should never be able to happen again. I support both resolutions.

   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his strong and very important leadership on this issue. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this important resolution stating our position on the Durban Conference. Seven years ago, we watched in disgust as a conference on racism, a very important issue which demands the world's attention, was diverted into a hate fest against Israel and Jews everywhere where participants and outside groups attempted to paint Israel as an ``apartheid state'' guilty of ``crimes against humanity.'' This kind of inflammatory speech does nothing to help the Palestinians. And it certainly does nothing to help those who are truly oppressed by racist regimes. 
   We now hear of new attempts to hijack the review conference to be held next year. The Organization of Islamic Conference says they want to highlight ``new forms of racism'' such as blasphemy against Islam while continuing to focus on spewing anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist hatred. We must stop these cynical attempts to divert attention away from the human rights abuses in places like Iran and Saudi Arabia and put the spotlight squarely where it belongs, on real forms of racism, slavery and xenophobia, which is what this conference is supposed to be about and which it should be about.

And yet we cannot get this administration to tell us if they in fact will deliver the arms that they have already promised to Taiwan. Will they allow Taiwan to acquire the weapons they need, or will this administration continue to curry favor with the Chinese and refuse to help our democratic ally in its time of need?

   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this issue. Madam Speaker, I rise as a strong cosponsor of this legislation. 
   While the Holocaust may have ended over 60 years ago, its effects are still very much felt today, and it is essential that we do not allow the victims of those horrific crimes to continue to be victimized by the circumstances that surround this issue today. 
   Many survivors of the Holocaust have still not received proper restitution for their looted property, and the time is long past due to say ``enough.'' And let us take action on behalf of these survivors and the victims of the Holocaust. 
   I would like to share with my colleagues a story of a constituent of mine, Dina Babbitt, who I have been working with for the last 10 years to get her property back, her rightful property back. Dina was a 20-year-old young lady when she and her mother were interned in Auschwitz. Now Dina had a talent. Dina was an artist. Even at the age of 20 her talent was obvious. 
   Joseph Mengele saw her work on one of the walls of the children's barracks where she had drawn a picture of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to cheer up the children that were in the children's barracks in Auschwitz. He singled her out, and what he started doing is, he would point out people that were interned at Auschwitz, the prisoners  that were interned, and he would direct her to draw their pictures. And she would draw the picture. He didn't want to take a photograph because he couldn't get the color of the skin right, and she would draw the picture. After she drew the picture he would kill the inmate. Now Dina says she learned to draw very slowly at that time. 
   She was liberated, and she and her mother fled Auschwitz. She eventually came to the United States of America where she worked at Disney Studios for well over 30 years of her life. 
   She received a telephone call 25 years ago from the Polish Government. They said they had found artwork that they believe she had created and would she come to Poland to authenticate it. She became so thrilled that she could have something to give to her children and her grandchildren so that they would have a piece of her. 
   She is convinced, and I believe this, too, that the artwork is the only thing that saved her and her mother. She was a Czechoslovakian Jew; 3,600 Czechoslovakian Jews were interned in Auschwitz, only 22 survived. Dina and her mother were two of the 22 Czechoslovakian Jews that survived their time in Auschwitz. 
   She went to Poland. She authenticated that those are my pictures, and they refused to give them to her. To this day, the Polish Government has not negotiated with Dina Babbitt one bit so she could get one or two or three of her pictures. There are seven that currently exist.

   I tell you this with all the passion that I could muster, that this woman should be able to get her property, her rightful property. This isn't even a purchase that she made that has been stolen from her. This came from her own hands, and I think it is time. That is why I so strongly support this resolution that people like Dina Babbitt, it is time, the time is long since past for Dina Babbitt and so many others to receive their just compensation. 
   I urge support for this resolution. I look forward to the time that the Polish government and the Lithuanian government actually take positive steps to restore the treasure and the possessions of these people who have suffered so much.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of energy independence, national security and weaning ourselves off of Middle Eastern oil. 
   It is sheer madness that--6 years after 9/11--we still rely on unstable and dictatorial regimes like Saudi Arabia to feed our oil habit. They have shown time and time again that they care nothing for international peace, peace in the Middle East or helping us find a solution for the debacle in Iraq: We know they use our oil dollars to fund terrorist organizations like Hamas, and Sunni insurgents in Iraq. And yet we still send them billions of dollars a year in oil revenues, because we are so dependent on their oil to fuel our energy needs. 
   We are funding both sides of the war on terror. No country on Earth has ever successfully fought a war against itself. This bill is a step in the right direction by funding alternative, clean energies that will set America on the path to energy independence. 
   With Mr. RANGEL's leadership, my colleagues and I on the Ways and Means Committee have expanded and extended the tax credits for plug-in hybrid vehicles, cellulosic alcohol, ethanol and biodiesel. 
   This package also promotes alternative fuels by providing assistance for the installation and conversion of E-85 fuel pumps and the production of flex-fuel vehicles that run on renewable fuel. Another provision encourages the domestic development and production of advanced technology vehicles and the next generation of vehicle batteries and plug-in hybrid vehicles. 
   Our addiction to oil has gone on long enough. It is time we declare independence by harnessing the Sun, wind, geothermal, biomass and other clean renewable technology, so that future generations of Americans won't have to rely on our enemies to satisfy our energy needs.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I want to return the compliment to the gentleman from New York. This is an issue that has been in the forefront of his mind and actions since he came to Congress. And I thank the sponsor of the legislation, Mr. Hastings, for bringing it to us today. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution and in the hope that this archive will help the world remember the crimes committed in the Holocaust and ease the pain of those families who lost loved ones in the Holocaust but to this day have no idea what happened to their families and their family members. 
   We, unfortunately, find ourselves in an age where the absurdity of the Holocaust denial is on the rise, when the leader of Iran seeks to recreate Hitler's acts, and when anti-Semitic conspiracy theories are finding fertile ground all over the Internet. 
   At the meeting of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue last October in Las Vegas, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, laid out for us the troubling resurgence of global anti-Semitism, not only in Europe and in the Middle  East but even here at home. Conspiracy theories flourish, claiming Jews control the media and the banking industry and Jewish lobbies have too much power, the same old canards that have existed for all too long. Mr. Foxman reminded us that these words and theories, often serious anti-Semitism disguised as ``anti-Zionism,'' are too often used by terrorists and hate groups to justify their actions. 
   I'm sorry to say in a newspaper article in the Rebel Yell at my alma mater, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, just this week there was a horrible anti-Semitic and anti-Israel screed written by a misinformed student that has created shock waves across the Las Vegas community. 
   As chairman of the Transatlantic Dialogue, I believe that I speak for all TLD members when I say how grateful we are to our friends across the Atlantic who have worked so hard to open these archives. 
   It is my hope, as this resolution states, opening the historic record will be a ``vital contribution to the world's collective memory and understanding of the Holocaust.'' We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like the Holocaust ever happens again, not in Europe, not in the Middle East, not in Africa, not anywhere. 
   And I thank the gentleman again.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding and for giving me the opportunity to control the time on this issue. I rise today not only as a friend of Greece, but also as a daughter of Greece. My mother's family immigrated from Salonika, Greece, and I am very proud of my Greek-Jewish heritage. 
   Greece has been a strong ally of the United States, standing by us in our struggles against Nazism, and now in the struggle against Islamic extremism. Greece paid an extraordinarily high price for their opposition to the Nazis, and we are forever grateful to them. 
   Before World War II, half of the population of Salonika, Greece, around 80,000 people, were Jewish. After the Nazis finished with Greece, there were only 1,000 Jews left in Salonika. The reason 1,000 Jews survived is because their Greek neighbors protected them, saved them, hid them; and for that I am grateful as well. 
   Greece continues to be a top contributor to NATO and a leader in the Balkan region. The resolution before the House today extends our best wishes and congratulations to the people of Greece, whom we look to as our forebearers in democracy. I am proud to cosponsor this resolution, but I hope it is our first word on our friendship with Greece, and certainly not our last. 
   I urge this House and this administration to strengthen our relationship with Greece by including them in the Visa Waiver Program. By designating Greece as such, we will send not only a message of friendship, but a message of thanks to the Greek community, which is so deserving of our friendship and our gratitude. They have met the criteria to become a visa waiver country and only await our approval on their application. 
   On this anniversary, let us take concrete action to strengthen our bond with them and send a message of thanks to our friends in Greece. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, as Veterans Day approaches, the timing could not be more appropriate for Congress to be considering the HEART Act. This legislation will help veterans and their families, and it will also show them that their fellow citizens appreciate their service and honor their sacrifices for our country. 
   Nevada has one of the fastest growing veterans populations in the country, and I have seen firsthand the economic hardship that extended military deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan have caused. The HEART Act will allow more families to qualify for the earned income tax credit or to make penalty-free withdrawals from retirement plans in time of true economic need to help ease the burden of deployment. 
   Nevada has suffered 59 deaths during the global war on terror, including 46 in Iraq. I support the provisions of this bill that will allow the spouses of those who sacrificed their lives to be better able to plan for their futures and those of their children. 
   As a member of both the Ways and Means Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I strongly support this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2176. 
   I believe this bill will lead to an unprecedented expansion of off-reservation Indian gaming by offering a blueprint to any Indian tribe that wants to circumvent the laws regulating Indian gaming in order to build a casino outside the boundaries of its sovereign territory. 
   And let me show you, Mr. Speaker, what I'm talking about. We are looking at the two Indian reservations that have requested this special interest legislation. The land they are talking about is hardly an ancestral part of their reservation. It is 350 miles away from their ancestral lands where they already have a casino. 
   As a Las Vegas Representative in Congress, I do not oppose gaming. I can attest to the positive impact that gaming can have on a community. I have no problem with other communities trying to replicate the Las Vegas experience, and I support the right of tribes to participate in gaming on their reservations, as both of these tribes already do. 
   But the bill we are considering today is an attempt to circumvent the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, using a bogus land claim, a bogus land claim that has already been tossed out of State court and Federal court, and the result if this bill passes will be two new off-reservation casinos more than 350 miles from the lands of these two tribes. 
   Now, why are they coming to Congress? Because they have lost in State court. They have lost in Federal court. They do not comply with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. So what do you do if you want a casino 350 miles away from your reservation? You find a friendly Congressman to introduce special interest legislation in Congress.

   Ms. BERKLEY. How do we know this land claim is bogus? In his testimony before Congress in 2002, the chairman of the Sault Saint Marie Tribe called this land deal ``shady,'' ``suspicious'' and ``a scam,'' until his tribe partnered up with the shady, suspicious land deal, and all of a sudden switched his position. 
   But more than 60 tribes across this country have announced their opposition to H.R. 2176, in which Congress for the first time would allow a tribe to expand its reservation into the ancestral lands of another tribe for the express purpose of gaming. 
   This bill is opposed by the Department of the Interior, the NAACP, UNITE HERE, and a unanimous House Judiciary Committee. To sum up the issue: Congress is being asked to pass special interest legislation benefiting two tribes, each of which already has  gaming, based on a suspect land claim that has already been thrown out of court, so they can open casinos hundreds of miles from their ancestral lands, in direct competition with existing facilities.  
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here today with Chairman Conyers and Congresswoman Kilpatrick to share my opposition to H.R. 2176. I believe this bill will result in an unprecedented expansion of off-reservation Indian gaming by offering a blueprint to any Indian tribe that wants to circumvent the laws regulating Indian gaming in order to build a casino outside the boundaries of its sovereign territory.

And beyond that, if this bill becomes law, any one of the more than 500 recognized Native American tribes can argue that they have the right to sue private landowners in an attempt to bargain for gaming somewhere else. 
   How do we know the land claim is bogus? In his testimony before Congress in 2002, the chairman of the Soo Saint Marie tribe called it ``shady,'' ``suspicious,'' and ``a scam.'' Soon thereafter, his tribe became a party to the deal and switched its position.

   If this bill is brought to the floor, I will strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in strong opposition to H.R. 2176. I believe this bill will lead to an unprecedented expansion of off-reservation Indian gaming by offering a blueprint to any Indian tribe that wants to circumvent the laws regulating Indian gaming in order to build a casino outside the boundaries of its sovereign territory. 
   This debate is not about the right of American communities and Indian  tribes to participate in gaming. I have no problem with other communities trying to replicate Las Vegas' experience, which has been so very successful, and I support the rights of tribes to participate in gaming on their reservations as both of these tribes already do. But the bill we are considering today is an attempt to circumvent the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by using a bogus land claim, a bogus land claim that has already been tossed out of both Federal and State courts. 
   Now, our proponents say that we are here because we want to improve a legitimate land claim and want to have justice for our Indian friends. Well, justice has already been served. This bogus claim has been thrown out of Federal court and State court. 
   The result, if this bill passes, will be two new off-reservation casinos more than 350 miles from the lands of these two tribes. And 350 miles is a very substantial amount. It is from Washington, D.C. to Cleveland, Ohio. And beyond that, if this bill becomes law, any one of the more than 500 recognized Native American tribes can argue that they have the right to sue private landowners in an attempt to bargain for gaming off their reservations. Let's circumvent the Indian gaming laws, come directly to Congress, and Congress can end up spending all of our time approving Indian gaming casinos on every street corner in every American city. 
   How do we know this land claim is bogus? Because the chairman of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe called it shady, suspicious, and a scam until he joined with the other tribe and switched his position. 
   More than 660 tribes are opposed to this legislation in which Congress, for the first time, will allow a tribe to expand its reservation into the ancestral lands of another tribe for the express purpose of gaming. This bill is opposed by the Department of the Interior, the NAACP, UNITE HERE, more than 60 tribes across the United States, and by a unanimous vote of the Judiciary Committee.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of this important legislation. 
   Everyone in this body knows about the atrocities being committed in Darfur. Congress has already labeled them a genocide, and the administration followed suit shortly thereafter. 
   Last year, we passed the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, which seeks to give teeth to our declarations and clamp down on the Sudanese government. And yet, despite all of this activity, the horrors continue. The Sudanese regime still has not gotten the message that the United States is serious about stopping the bloodshed. 
   Many countries continue to view the situation as ``business as usual.'' China is the largest foreign investor in Sudan and continues to provide the Sudanese blood-soaked government with interest free loans. They are even engaging in arms sales, despite the clear evidence of massacre, rape, destruction, displacement and genocide. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we are serious about stopping the bloodshed in Sudan, we cannot allow business to continue as usual. The Chinese government and governments throughout the world need to start getting the message: If you continue to invest in murderous, blood-thirsty regimes, if you continue to invest in Sudan, there will be consequences, there will be very serious consequences.  
   I urge support for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding. And I would like to particularly thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Frank for their extraordinary efforts on behalf of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, this amendment and the overall housing package we are considering today will help millions of Americans and significantly improve the economic situation in my State of Nevada. In recent years the vibrant economy and rapid growth in my district of Las Vegas combined to make the city appear immune to economic downturn. This foreclosure crisis has shown that this is no longer the case. 
   Nevada has had the highest statewide foreclosure rate for well over a year. The surge in foreclosures has led to huge inventories of unsold homes. This, in turn, has led to massive layoffs of the construction industry and other housing-related fields. Nevada, which has been a land of economic opportunity, the fastest-growing State in the Nation, now has an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent, which is, I'm sorry to say, well above the national average. 
   This amendment takes several steps that will help both current and prospective homeowners as well as increase affordable housing opportunities. Current homeowners will be helped by the creation of a standard deduction for property taxes, which will lower Federal taxes for taxpayers who don't itemize and by freeing up funds to refinance certain subprime loans. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers creates a great incentive to get families into properties that are currently sitting vacant due to foreclosure or that have been sitting on the market for long periods of time due to excess unsold inventory. The bill also takes steps to increase affordable rental housing, another critical need in Las Vegas. 
   I'm hopeful that the combined efforts of this amendment and other provisions of the package will be to alleviate the current housing crisis and help turn our Nation's economy around. I proudly support the intent and the substance of this legislation. I urge adoption. 
   And I must say I think it's insulting to the American people when they hear that there are Members on the other side of the aisle that support the bill, support the intent, but are voting against it because they didn't get a procedural motion to vote on. 
   Let's do what's best for the American people and stop this ridiculous infighting that nobody out there cares about. They care about staying in their homes. They care about protecting their families. And, quite frankly, they don't give a hoot whether somebody has a motion to recommit to vote on.

Almost 98,000 low-income seniors in Nevada will benefit from improvements in Medicare savings programs and low-income subsidy programs as well. 
   Passing this bill is also necessary to ensure access to physicians for Medicare patients. The CHAMP Act restores funding necessary to reimburse the doctors for their services.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I want to thank my good friend from New York, Anthony Weiner. As usual, I am not sure that my presence is needed here. You have done such an eloquent job explaining the situation as it is. I am afraid I have to agree with our colleague, Mr. Wexler, and pronounce the little town the way he does, but the sentiment is the same. 
   I wish you were with us, Mr. Weiner, 3 weeks ago when there was a congressional trip to Israel. We had the opportunity to go to Sderot and see for ourselves firsthand exactly what you are speaking of. I want to share with you my impressions. I have been to Israel 15 times, but that was the first time that I had ever gone to that little border town and met the people, heard what they had to say, but I did. I am glad that I had the opportunity so I could share it with you and our colleagues now. 
   We met in a strategic area of Sderot where we were able to look into the Gaza. It is less than a mile away. They live Palestinian and Israeli next door to one another. We met with a family who has lived there for a number of years and has endured the 2,000 rocket attacks that have taken place, that have been perpetrated against the citizens of this community for the last 5 years, 2,000 rocket attacks. The last one, as you said, happening as late as today as children were going to school. 
   Now, Hamas and Islamic jihad have the timing down pretty well if they don't have the accuracy, because the rocket attacks, the missile attacks, on this small Israeli town take place in the morning hours when children are headed to school and parents are headed to work. Then there's a lull. If there is going to be another attack, it is usually when people are coming home from work and their children are coming back from school. 
   We met a family from Sderot, a wife, a mother and her children. I listened to this mother tell us what it is like on a daily basis, the fear she has every time she sends her children out to walk to school, how they can't go outside and play for fear that there will be an incoming missile that might indiscriminately hit any one of them on any given day. The very inaccuracy of these rockets make them something to fear. After the last attack that she told us about, she grabbed her child, and she fell on him in an effort to save him. When it was over, the little boy looked at his mommy. He said, ``Mommy, don't ever fall on me to save me again. Because if anything was going to happen to you, what would I do without you?''     
   The children of this little town are suffering in more ways than you and I can possibly imagine. While it is true that of the 2,000 attacks in the last 5 years, eight people have died, and I have been told only eight people is not so bad, three of those eight were children, if you are one of the eight, or their families, it is not bad, it is devastating. And if you are the parent or grandparent of one of those three children, whose only crime was being an Israeli child walking to school one day, it is a horrible, horrible thing to endure. 
   So the fact that there hasn't been the mayhem and the injuries that are visible to the eye doesn't make this any worse because of the psychological damage to the people of this community and to their children, many of who suffer from PTSD. 
   I sit on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. We listen to testimony of our troops coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from PTSD. As horrible as that is, we understand it. We expect it. It is going to happen. But as a 5, 6, 7 year-old kid, to be suffering from PTSD, from not being able to sleep at night for fear that there is going to be a rocket attack on their home, afraid to go to school, afraid to sit in your classroom, parents losing their jobs because they can't stay at work when they hear that siren go off, they want to rush to the school where they know that their children are studying, for the hope that if, God forbid, anything happens, they can save their child, that is not a way to live. Nobody should live that way. 
   The reason that the Congressional delegation met with this family and others in this little town was because they wanted to share with us what was going on because they feel they have been forgotten, not only by their own government, but they wanted their government and the United States, their most reliable ally, and the people of this world community to recognize what is going on, and to help them, help them in some way. They implored us to do something to stop these rocket attacks. 
   Now, you mentioned the fact that about 2 years and 3 weeks ago on August 15th Israel unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza. It became untenable to secure 7,000 settlers from 1.4 million Palestinians, so the Israelis made a decision in the name of peace to unilaterally disengage from the Gaza. 
   The hope was this, Mr. Weiner. The hope was that the Palestinian people in the Gaza would recognize they had a golden opportunity to demonstrate to the world that they were capable of governance and they would use this opportunity to repair the infrastructure, build schools, start healing their economy, build housing and hospitals for the Palestinian people, make it possible for 1.4 million Palestinians to have a future, a dream of their own that wasn't mayhem and killing and corruption.  
   Unfortunately, we have not seen that. What we have seen, and it is more and more with each passing day, is that Hamas is using the Gaza and the Palestinian people as a human fortress as they continue to and increase lobbing rockets and missiles into Israel from strategic locations in the Gaza. 
   Why do the Palestinian people have to continue to suffer and live under these conditions? Are there no Palestinian leaders willing to step up and say this is not what I want for my children, it is not what I want to do to Israeli children? We have an obligation to be so much more than a launching pad against Israeli border towns like Sderot. 
   What are the Israelis expected to do? The people of Sderot are demanding that the Israeli government do something, that they stop this carnage, this mayhem, this indiscriminate killing and damage. 
   Well, we can examine the options of the Israelis. 
   They can go back into Gaza, as you stated. I don't think that is a viable option. The Israelis don't want to reoccupy the Gaza. They can launch strategic attacks against those locations that the Kassam rockets are being launched from. But, as you know, they can be launched very quickly, and the perpetrators disappear within moments. And if they do that and accidentally hit an innocent Palestinian family, there would be hell to pay for that. So that isn't the best possible option either. 
   So, what is left? The Israelis provide the water and the sewage system and the electricity and power to the Gaza for 1.4 million Palestinians to enjoy some quality of life. They can cut those services off and 1.4 million Palestinians can suffer, because Hamas and Islamic Jihad have used their fellow Palestinians as nothing more than a cruel shield behind which they launch indiscriminate attacks against innocent Israeli civilians, men, women and children, and then they use the Palestinian people as buffers to protect them from any retaliation that the Israelis may wish to do in order to protect their own people.

You know, when the Saudis come with this plan, and look, any peace plan is better than no peace at all, but let us keep in mind, in addition to the fact that Israel is no longer in Lebanon, and, remember, Hezbollah supposedly was created in an effort to get the Israelis out of Lebanon. The Israelis have been out of Lebanon now for 8 years and it doesn't  seem to matter. Hezbollah is thriving. They are arming and attacking Israelis on the Israeli side of the border. 
   You quite rightly said the Israelis unilaterally got out of the Gaza. When it comes to the 1967 borders, let us remember, when Israel made peace with the Egyptians in that very historic moment of opportunity in the Middle East, the Israelis gave back the Sinai to the Egyptians that they had acquired in the 1967 war. They gave it back with all the oil and everything else. They said peace is more important to us than this land. You can have it. 
   Remember prior to the 1967 war? The West Bank was part of Jordan. Jordan controlled the West Bank. It was Jordanian territory. And then after a number of years, the Jordanians gave it to the Israelis. They didn't want to deal with the problems. So when we are talking about 1967 borders, does that mean that Jordan is going to take back the West Bank and deal with the problems that currently exist in the West Bank? 
   There was a reason that the Palestinian people turned to Hamas. They had a corrupt leader, a murderer, a terrorist in the name of Yasser Arafat. The billions and billions of dollars that the Europeans gave to the Palestinians through Yasser Arafat, that the Americans gave, in an effort to improve the lives of the Palestinian people, did not go to help the Palestinian people. Not one child got educated. Not one person's wounds or one person's illness was cured in a new hospital. Not one road was built. Not one business was created. 
   That money went into bank accounts that Arafat's widow is now living on, and rather nicely, I would say. Out of desperation for the corruption of Yasser Arafat's political party, Fattah, the people, the Palestinian people looked to Hamas, a terrorist organization, to get their basic rights met, their basic needs met. Hamas was providing social services, unemployment benefits to the unemployed, clothing to those that were not clothed, food to those that were hungry, instead of the legitimate Palestinian Authority. There is no wonder that the Palestinian people turned to Hamas. 
   But what we see in Hamas is a terrorist organization that refuses Israel's right to exist, that rains terror on border towns like Sderot, only because they can't get to the bigger towns because of the security and that security fence that the entire world condemned Israel for building in an effort to protect its own citizens from terrorist attacks. 
   So, now we are at a crossroads. The Palestinian people don't have to continue to support Hamas. Right now, the Gaza is a no-man's land. What few Christians are left in the Gaza are being subjected to forced conversions. Hamas is indiscriminantly walking the streets shooting at point-blank range any former member of Fattah. And the Palestinian people are caught in the crossfire. 
   It is time for the international community to speak as one voice in an effort to bring peace to the Palestinians and to the people of Israel, and the place to start is in Sderot.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. When I was part of this congressional delegation a few weeks ago, and maybe last week you heard the same thing, it was the Israeli Government that was promoting providing resources for the Palestinians. They want the American Government to support Abu Mazen. They want us to prop up the Palestinian people because they know this might be the last opportunity they have for peace. 
   And you brought up a really good point. I can't say that the Egyptians and the Israelis love each other and sing Kumbiya by the camp fire. The same thing with the Jordanians. This is not a warm peace; it is a peace. You don't have to love thy neighbor, but you can live side by side in peace. I think that is what we should be going for. 
   If I thought for a minute these indiscriminate attacks on Sderot and other  border towns was an effort to create a Palestinian state, maybe I could understand that, as addled as that is. But this has nothing to do with creating a Palestinian state; this has everything to be the elimination, dare I say extermination, of the State of Israel. That is what strikes fear in my heart.

   Ms. BERKLEY. As I said earlier, Hamas is walking around the streets indiscriminately shooting anybody that had anything to do with Fatah. They're consolidating their power, power to do what I haven't got the slightest idea. 
   But I wanted to tell my colleague, who we had a pleasure of sharing this experience that I think he will remember when we all got back on the bus, there were a lot of people that were misty-eyed. I think it was a shock to most of us to see what these people are going through on a daily basis. 
   And I looked around at our colleagues, and these are pretty sophisticated politicians. They've been in office for quite a while in different capacities, but I think everybody was taken aback and shocked and very touched by the families that we met and felt the pain that they go through on a daily basis. It was an important message for us to see.

One of the ministers that we met with said this about the conferences, and again, the Israelis are pushing any type of peace and support that they can get with the Palestinians. But they said, they want us to meet, so we'll meet, but if they refuse to recognize Israel's right to exist, what are we meeting about? Will they allow us to exist? What compromise do you make with people that don't recognize your right to exist? Do you compromise that you could exist for 20 more years, 30 more years, 50 more years? There's no compromise to be made with people that don't recognize that you are a person with a right to exist.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership on this and so many other issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a former utility company attorney, I rise in strong support of this important legislation which will help our Nation and my home State of Nevada to move towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. 
   I am very proud of my State of Nevada. Our legislature has passed a renewable energy portfolio. It mandates that by the year 2015, 20 percent of the power sold to Nevadans must be produced from renewables. 
   Energy providers in the State of Nevada have built or planned half a dozen major solar power projects in order to meet this requirement. And that's just solar. There is also wind, geothermal, and countless other projects that can and will help lessen our dependence on fossil fuel with the passage of this bill. 
   This bill provides substantial tax incentives for energy produced from renewable resources, including wind, including solar, geothermal, biomass, many other possibilities. These incentives will provide badly needed assistance to companies that are working hard to diversify our energy resources, improve the economy by creating green jobs, and clean up the air we breathe and our environment. 
   I believe energy independence is an economic issue, an environmental issue, and a national security imperative. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time that our Nation stop depending on corrupt dictators and nations that finance and support terrorists and terrorism around the planet to satisfy our energy needs. We pay exorbitant prices for foreign oil from countries who support and encourage terrorist activities around the world. We must stop funding both sides of this war on terror. By encouraging the development of renewable energy and energy independence, this bill helps move this country in the right direction; $102 for a barrel of oil is reason enough for everybody in this body to support this bill. This package is good for Nevada. It's good for our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Tax Collection Responsibility Act. This bill will prevent the IRS from using private debt collectors to collect Federal income taxes when current contracts have expired. 
   Private debt collectors have proven to be very poorly equipped for the job. This change is important to protect taxpayers' privacy. Coming from Las Vegas, I have never been a great fan of the IRS. IRS abuse in Las Vegas is legendary. The only thing worse are private debt collectors that have harassed, threatened and intimidated the taxpayers in my district and throughout the United States to collect back taxes and to also collect a hefty fee. The IRS ought to do its job of collecting taxes and Congress ought to do our job by giving them the resources the IRS needs to do its job. 
   The bill also proposes implementation of a 3 percent withholding requirement on government payments to vendors. This requirement will cause significant administrative and financial burdens on local governments. As a local government that spends more than $100 million per year on vendor products and services, Clark County, Nevada, would be required to withhold 3 percent of payments to businesses. Under the new requirement, companies that contract with local government would be terribly and unfairly penalized. This could result, it will result in cash flow problems for small businesses and ultimately higher prices for all consumers. This bill will postpone the 3 percent withholding requirement to give the Treasury Department time to study the impact of this provision on local governments and taxpayers before it is implemented. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation for both reasons that I have stated.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight in support of this bill. I want to thank Chairman Edwards and Ranking Member Wamp for their extraordinary efforts on behalf of this Nation's veterans, and for including report language on veterans burial benefits.     
   I'm deeply concerned about the eroding value of plot allowance and burial benefits provided to our Nation's veterans. Because the benefits are not indexed to inflation, their value continues to diminish each year. As a result, families and State veteran cemeteries have been left to cover the increasing costs of burying their loved ones. The VA simply must assess the need to increase the plot allowance of burial benefits to cover the same percentage of burial benefit costs that were covered in 1973 when these benefits were first initiated. 
   I appreciate the fact that the chairman has included the report language in the report the need for increasing burial benefits for our veterans. 
   I'm also pleased that the committee recognizes the importance of veterans' mental health and substance abuse services. This is an issue of great importance to me. I had a constituent by the name of Justin Bailey. He volunteered to serve this Nation, he was sent to Iraq, he served with honor and distinction. And when he returned, he developed a substance abuse problem. At the suggestion of his parents, he checked himself into a VA facility, and even though he was suffering from a substance abuse problem due to PTSD and other mental health issues, he was given more medication while he was in the VA facility. And he ultimately ended up overdosing while he was in the care of the VA. 
   Unfortunately, Justin is not an isolated incident. There are thousands of young men and women returning from service overseas that come back with a mental health problem or substance abuse problem or PTSD. I'm very delighted that this committee and Chairman Edwards have recognized that this is a crisis and this bill increases funding for mental health and substance abuse services for our veterans. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman Edwards and Ranking Member Wamp for recognizing the importance of these issues, and I would like to urge my colleagues to support this legislation without reservation and without continuing to add on things that do not belong in this bill and are not germane. 
   Let's stand up for our veterans, and let's stand up for them this evening. 
   I yield back.

   Ms. BERKLEY. It gives me great pleasure to introduce a spiritual leader in Las Vegas, Nevada. Rabbi Shea Harlig was ordained in March of 1988 from the Central Chabad Yeshiva in Brooklyn, New York, and since December of 1990 serves as the spiritual leader of Congregation Chabad in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
   He is the founder and regional director of Chabad of Southern Nevada, a major Jewish outreach organization in Las Vegas with five locations. Its programs include daily services, nightly adult education classes, Hebrew school and day camps, chaplain at the State and county prisons, bimonthly column for the Las Vegas Israelite, crisis counseling and financial assistance to members of the community. Rabbi Harlig is the kosher supervisor of five local kosher restaurants, markets and catering facilities. He is also the founder and dean of the Desert Torah Academy Day School, which has an enrollment of 175 children, preschool through eighth grade. 
   On a personal note, I have known the Rabbi since he came to Las Vegas. He has made an extraordinary contribution to the spiritual life of Las Vegas, Nevada. His impact is felt throughout the community. I am absolutely delighted to welcome him to our Nation's capital, Washington, D.C.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the AMT Relief Act, a bill that's going to provide tax relief to millions of middle-income Americans. 
   If this legislation is not passed, more than 128,000 Nevada taxpayers will see their taxes increase by the AMT. This includes more than 30,000 people in my district who were never intended to pay this tax, and they elected me to make sure that they don't. 
   Now, I believe the alternative minimum tax should be eliminated, but until it is, this bill provides the necessary temporary solution to protect 23 million Americans who would be hit cruelly by an increase in the AMT in 2007. 
   This bill also ensures that more working parents will be able to benefit from a refundable child tax credit. Currently, some of the families who would benefit the most from the $1,000 refundable credit actually make too little to qualify. This bill lowers the income barrier, allowing all eligible families earning more than $8,500 to benefit. 
   It's also important to note that the tax relief in this bill is fully paid for and will not add a single dollar to the national debt. That's fiscal responsibility.

   Small businesses are the backbone of our nation's economy, and I am pleased that today we are considering a few common-sense provisions that will lessen the tax burden our small businesses face. 
   I am especially supportive of the language that will have a direct impact on the restaurants in my district. The bill will allow restaurants in Las Vegas and across the country to continue claiming the full tip credit despite any increase in the federal minimum wage. 
   I strongly support increasing the minimum wage and was proud to vote in favor of legislation this House passed as part of the Democratic majority's first 100 hours. I am hopeful that passing this bill will help move the process along in order to achieve this important goal.

   I don't have any long Treasury reports to read to you, and I'm not here to tell you what should have been, what we could have done, should have done, would have done. But I'm here to talk on behalf of H.R. 5719 because there are some important components and provisions of this bill that, when taken together, will make future tax days more fair and less strenuous for the average American taxpayer. 
   H.R. 5719 contains provisions to ensure that taxpayers receive all the tax benefits they're entitled to. This bill will increase outreach to help taxpayers benefit from the earned income tax credit and find unclaimed refunds, effectively lowering taxes for many Americans. I think this is a good provision. 
   This bill also prevents the IRS from using private debt collectors to collect Federal income taxes. Private debt collectors have proven to be poorly equipped for the job, actually costing the IRS and taxpayers 37 million more than they have collected. This change is an important move to protect taxpayer privacy. And as a taxpayer and as a citizen, I want the government and the IRS to do its job and not send this responsibility out to someone else. 
   I'm also very supportive of a provision to postpone implementation of the 3 percent withholding requirement on government payment to vendors. This requirement will cause significant administrative and financial burdens on local governments, unfairly penalizing companies, and raising prices on consumers. I think this is a good provision in this legislation. 
   The bill also helps protect taxpayers by requiring the IRS to notify individuals if unlawful use of their identity is detected by cracking down on Web sites that try to defraud people through use of the official IRS logo.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   There is no denying that Iran's bloodthirsty regime would gladly destroy the United States, annihilate Israel and destabilize Iraq. Iran's hand in terrorist activities around the Middle East is clear. Iran's President continues to threaten Israel. I believe he stated he would wipe Israel off the map. And he continues to pursue nuclear weapons so he can dominate the Middle East and threaten his neighbors. 
   We have tried to stop Iran from obtaining those weapons. We have increased sanctions on firms that do business with this dangerous regime. We have worked with our allies and the United Nations. 
   And yet with all of these efforts, just yesterday, we learned that the sanctions have done precious little to impede Iran's march towards obtaining nuclear weapons.  
   According to the IAEA, and by Iran's own bravado, Iran is now beginning to enrich uranium on a far larger scale than ever before. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is not the time to be tying our hands on Iran. We all seek a peaceful solution. No one wants another war. But if we don't take a tough stance on Iran and maintain the threat of military action, Iran will get the message that we don't care if it gets nuclear weapons. It will allow the most dangerous regime in the world to continue its quest for regional and world domination, and destroy the only democratic country and the United States' most reliable ally in the region, Israel. I urge opposition to this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the great State of New York and my good friend from the State of Florida for introducing this important resolution. For too long, dictators and despots have hijacked the United Nations in order to serve their own purposes. They cynically target Israel in order to shift attention from their own brutality, passing countless resolutions condemning Israel without uttering a word about what is going on in Burma, the Sudan or North Korea. 
   Madam Speaker, while we congratulate Israel today for a great achievement, I am still very worried the U.N.'s condemnations of Israel helped to stoke the fires of global anti-Semitism. For better or for worse, the world looks to the United Nations to set standards for human rights, and when instead it singles out Israel for constant recriminations, the U.N. becomes a platform for burgeoning anti-Semitism around the world and anti-Israel rhetoric. Last week I chaired the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue in my hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada. Among the many issues we discussed with our friends from the European Parliament was the alarming rise of global anti-Semitism. Abe Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League briefed us on the widespread belief in the Muslim world that Israel and the Jews committed the 9/11 terrorist attack on this country. He told us about Malaysia, where there are no Jews, and yet where the president of that country blames the Jews for the economic problems in his country anyway. 
   In Europe, since 2000, there has been a surge of anti-Semitic incidents. Even here at home, a few misguided and uninformed people say the Jews are somehow responsible for the war in Iraq. I am extremely concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism globally, and it is not unrelated to what goes on at the United Nations. I am afraid the U.N.'s rhetoric serves as a great recruiting tool for terrorists and anti-Semites when it condemns Israel and uses old anti-Semitic canards to do it. 
   Madam Speaker, it is surely a step in the right direction that Israel is chairing a U.N. committee. We are right to congratulate Israel for this great achievement. It is about time. But so much more must be done as this resolution states. Today, with this resolution, we call on the United Nations to officially and publicly condemn anti-Semitic statements made at its meetings and hold United Nations member states accountable when they make such statements. We must fight back against the growing scourge of global anti-Semitism and growing anti-Israel rhetoric while we continue to fight for Israel's greater recognition at the United Nations. 
   I thank the gentleman from New York for his leadership on this issue, among many others.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this important resolution, and I thank the gentleman from New York for his continued leadership on this important issue. We often throw around compliments on the floor of the House thanking each other, but in this case, it is truly warranted. The gentleman from New York has been a giant on these issues, and I thank him so much for that. 
   Lebanon is at a critical juncture in its history. On the cusp of upcoming elections, it can go the way of democracy; or it can go the way of violence, terrorism and dictatorship. We therefore must stand side-by-side with the forces of democracy in that country and protect it from those who seek to unfairly and violently influence the results of their free election. 
   Two years ago at the United Nations, the world called on Syria to remove its troops from Lebanon and recognize Lebanon's independence. While perhaps most of Syria's troops are out of Lebanon, its continued dangerous influence is undeniable. 
   Syria's proxies in Lebanon have waged a campaign of terror throughout the country against those who oppose its interference. They have bombed,  they have rioted, they have assassinated, and they have terrorized, and it is undeniable Syria's hand is behind it all. 
   Iran too has involved itself in Lebanon with its support of Hezbollah, a terrorist group whose military is stronger than the Lebanese Army. Iran has threatened unspecified consequences if the anti-Syrian majority has the gall to freely elect its own president. It has launched attacks against Israel to destabilize the region and the Lebanese Government. Hezbollah continues to bring arms shipments in from Iran through Syria with impunity. 
   Lebanon's stability could be the key to the future of the Middle East. If the Lebanese can establish a democracy in their country, then it would spread to other countries in that region, Syria's influence would be weakened and Iran's plans for regional supremacy and control would suffer a serious setback. The supporters of terrorism know this, Madam Speaker. That is why they have unleashed this campaign of terror to stop Lebanon's development and influence its upcoming election. 
   We too must unleash our own campaign to support the forces of democracy and freedom and stability. We must not let the forces of democracy be defeated or intimidated in Lebanon. The Middle East hangs in the balance, and we must not back away from a growing democracy that needs our help. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this important issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution and in support of the human rights movements worldwide. This movement for Soviet Jewry demonstrated that a small group of people who are dedicated and committed to principle can make an enormous difference, not only in their home countries but throughout the world. 
   Just this past weekend, I attended a meeting in Philadelphia where Natan Sharansky spoke. Sharansky has been a hero to so many of us in the United States in his struggle for freedom from Soviet oppression. He and his fellow refusniks embody the spirit of determination and unbelievable courage to stand up for human rights and freedom and demand that Soviet Jews be able to leave the Soviet Union and immigrate to Israel or the United States or other countries of their choice. 
   Sharansky told us the movement for Soviet Jewry not only freed him and other refusniks, but that it set in motion the process that ultimately brought down the Soviet Union. By demanding human rights for some, we hastened the demise of one of the most repressive, most dictatorial regimes in history. 
   This movement demonstrated that human rights questions do not exist in a vacuum separate from larger questions of global politics or trade. We have a tremendous capacity to be global leaders by tying questions of human rights to other issues that we deal with in the international arena, whether in trade or the environment or immigration policy. While we do business with other countries, we should not, we must not, turn a blind eye to human rights abuses. It is as true today as it was 40 years ago. 
   While human rights are trampled on in so many parts of the world, from Darfur, North Korea, to the Arab world, we look to the movement for Soviet Jews as a shining example of how we as a country can succeed in bringing human rights issues to light through citizen activism for the greater good. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I was in Philadelphia listening to Natan Sharansky, they showed films of the March on Washington for Soviet Jewry, and it put me in mind of the fact that Members like Mr. Waxman who were here 20 years ago were in the forefront of this fight. 
   As a point of personal privilege, the next speaker on our side of the aisle, Mr. Eliot Engel, Congressman from New York, before he was a Member of Congress, he was on that stage fighting for the basic human rights and dignity of Soviet Jews and human rights worldwide, as was our very good friend Jerry Nadler. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back, and I thank the gentleman once again for bringing this to the floor of the House for a vote.

And I support this bill to provide incentives for clean domestic renewable energy production. It will improve our energy security, extend vital tax provisions, and provide tax relief to parents and teachers, college students, homeowners, small businesses, and millions of other middle-income Americans.

   Currently, some families who could benefit the most from the $1,000 refund and for a child tax credit actually make too little to qualify. This bill ensures that more hardworking parents will be able to benefit from this credit.

   Ms. BERKLEY. I want to thank Chairman Berman for yielding some time, and my dear friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Congresswoman from Florida, for being the prime sponsor of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the victims of the July 18, 1994, attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Argentina. I remember being rocked to my very core when I learned of this unprecedented and ruthless attack against innocent members of the Jewish community in Argentina when I first learned of it 14 years ago. 
   This vicious attack, which killed 85 innocent people, has been linked strongly to Hezbollah and to the government of Iran. We know all too well that Iran's saber rattling has become far more alarming of late. Hezbollah is gaining strength in Lebanon and anti-Israel, anti-Jewish groups have threatened Jewish targets all over the globe. 
   It is therefore vital we do everything we can to bring the perpetrators of this attack to justice. With this resolution, we applaud Argentina's efforts and urge our own President to provide law enforcement support to the government of Argentina. We also call on the Saudi regime to stop turning a blind eye to this growing threat and choose to help, rather than hinder, those who are fighting terrorists in their Middle East neighborhood. 
   Lastly, and perhaps most important, we ask all the nations of the western hemisphere to stand together in calling Hezbollah what it truly and really is, a terrorist organization, and not just a political party. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I urge support for this resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (MORTGAGE FORGIVENESS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Blumenauer for his leadership on this issue. 
   I rise today in support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. This legislation represents an important step in helping homeowners caught in our Nation's housing crisis. The people I represent have been hardest hit by this crisis. It pains me to say that the State of Nevada currently has the highest rate of foreclosure in the Nation. In Nevada there is one foreclosure for every 163 households. That is three times the national average. 
   Unfortunately, many of those who lose their homes to foreclosure are hit with the added insult of a surprise tax bill. This occurs when a home has decreased in value and the amount owed is more than the current value of the home. The difference between the amount owed and the actual value of the home is considered forgiven debt and, therefore, taxed at regular income. With interest rates on hundreds of thousands of mortgages about to reset and home values in decline in many areas, this foreclosure tax is likely to be a growing problem. 
   This bill will help protect homeowners from this tax by providing a permanent exclusion of the discharged debt as long as the mortgage was on the primary residence. 
   And for those who fear that this legislation will bail out wealthy land speculators who have made bad investments, let me assure you that the relief provided in this bill is targeted towards those losing the very roofs over their heads, their family's home, and not to real estate speculators who made bad bets. 
   Additionally, this bill will extend the tax deduction on private mortgage insurance to provide an additional measure of tax relief to homeowners. Lowering the cost of mortgage insurance by keeping this tax deductible will help ensure that more borrowers are choosing mortgages they can actually afford. For some of my constituents this tax savings will mean the difference between being able to stay in their homes or becoming one of thousands facing foreclosure and loss of their family home. 
   For those on the other side of the aisle who are criticizing the pay-for in this bill, not one, not one of them has come up with a sensible and honest alternative or solution to the pay-for that is included here. 
   I think this is a good piece of legislation. I urge support for this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, despite the disaster of the Bush-Cheney energy plan, House Republicans continue to insist on the same old energy policy that favors bigger profits and more breaks for Big Oil. Rather than working across the aisle to provide much-needed relief at the pump, House Republicans have blocked every effort to responsibly invest in renewable energy and take the one action that would have brought down gas prices immediately, releasing oil from the government's own stockpile. 
   This week House Republicans will have an opportunity to prove that they really do support all-of-the-above energy strategies. We hope to bring a comprehensive energy package to the House floor that promotes efficiency, conservation, invests in renewable sources of energy, and responsibly increases domestic supply by opening portions of the Outer Continental Shelf to drilling. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have a choice to make this week. They will stand by their own words by supporting this legislation or they will once again support Big Oil.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlelady for yielding to me and for her leadership. And I thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Crowley) for his leadership on this and so many other issues, and my dear friend, Mr. Bilirakis, who has done such a remarkable job in the time that he has been in Congress.  
   I rise today as a proud cosponsor of this resolution, but I am deeply troubled that it even needs to exist. 
   It is often said that a society can be judged by the values that they teach their children. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to say that there is no more fitting commentary on Hamas and its principles than the shocking hate-filled television programming they broadcast to indoctrinate their children. For those who still believe, contrary to everything else, that Hamas is merely a political organization or a social organization, they should look no further than their television sets to see a Mickey Mouse look-alike teaching children how to wear explosive belts, or Bugs Bunny teaching children to kill and even eat Jews. This is absolutely outrageous uncivilized behavior. And far from laying the groundwork for peace, Hamas is sowing the seeds of yet another generation of terrorists who value martyrdom and death above all else. Instead of protecting their children, they are putting them in harm's way. 
   Indeed, just this weekend during a cease-fire with Israel, Arab media reported that Hamas is continuing to conduct military exercises in residential areas. It is just further troubling evidence that they are all too eager to put their children in the line of fire. Instead of teaching their children mathematics and geography or really enjoying a Mickey Mouse and a Bugs Bunny character, they teach their children how to fire missiles and maximize casualties, and using cartoon figures to do it. 
   I submit to you today that true peace will only come to the Middle East when terrorist organizations like Hamas stop indoctrinating their children with hate, stop treating their children as cannon fodder, and start building a positive, stable future for their children. 
   I urge support for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the gentleman from New York. I know that he has been an outstanding voice on this issue for as many years as I can remember. Long before I came to Congress to serve with him, I would watch him on C-SPAN as he spoke about this issue, and serving with him, I admire him all the more. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this important resolution. When we talk about peace in the Middle East, we so often get caught up in the specific details that we rarely discuss the fundamental problems in that region. Unlike our country, or Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East, most countries in that part of the world have very little freedom of the press and therefore very little accountability to their people. 
   Such restrictions on free speech serve those Middle Eastern autocrats very well, keeping their populations in line and focusing the anger of the street outside of their own borders. The populations there have very little choice but to believe the daily insults that many state-run newspapers heap on our country and on Israel. They have no other avenue by which to get their news. So instead of rebelling against their own corrupt dictators, the people of the Middle East flood their streets to burn American and Israeli flags, with little or no hope that they can change events in their own countries that are controlled by these dictatorial regimes. 
   Mr. Speaker, such restrictions on speech not only condemn the people of the Middle East to intellectual poverty and ignorance, they make peace harder and harder to achieve. And it is not only the media, it is also the textbooks that need to be changed. From the Palestinian territories to Saudi Arabia, Middle Eastern children are taught that Jews are monkeys and snakes and worse, and that Israel must be destroyed because it has no right to exist. Such education, both in school and in the newspapers, and such disinformation, cannot create possibly a condition for peace. 
   With this resolution today, we can send a clear message to the Middle East that we, the United States of America, stand with those who seek a free press, those who want to bring out the truth and let freedom ring throughout the Middle East. 
   To quote the resolution itself, by passing this we will affirm ``the universal rights of all persons to freely and peaceably express themselves, to publish and advocate for their nonviolent beliefs, and to petition their government for redress of grievances.'' 
   I thank the gentleman again, and I urge support for this resolution.

   The ultimate goal of our Nation's child welfare system is to promote safe, stable and permanent homes for America's most vulnerable children. The provisions of this bill will help to accomplish this by allowing States to continue foster care assistance for kids up to the age of 21, authorizing Federal assistance to relatives assuming legal guardianship of children for whom they have cared as foster  parents, and extending and improving the Adoption Incentives Program.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in the strongest possible opposition to this amendment. 
   In his misguided zeal to identify a high-profile example of wasteful Federal spending, the author of this amendment has instead provided me with an opportunity to sing the praises of a member of my community who has used his personal and professional success to help those that are less fortunate. 
   In 2001 Andre Agassi opened a charter school in Las Vegas, the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy. It is in one of the most disadvantaged areas in my congressional district. Agassi Prep currently serves students in grades K-10, with grades 11 and 12 being added in the next 2 years, for a total of 630 students when enrollment is complete. The first class will graduate in 2009. The student body is 96 percent minority. 
   This earmark, which I thank the gentleman for highlighting, would go to the Andre Agassi Prep's Technology and Multimedia Initiative and will increase the use of computer technology in math, science, reading, and language instructions.     
   This is exactly the type of environment we should be encouraging for all of our students in all of our schools. 
   Andre Agassi has been a tireless advocate for this academy and for numerous other philanthropic endeavors, including the Boys and Girls Clubs in Las Vegas, raising more than $60 million and contributing a substantial amount of his own money to improve the lives of children, youth at risk in my community. There is nobody that has done more for people in this community, my community, than Andre Agassi. 
   The only reason we're talking about this project on the floor today is because a famous name is attached to it. But whereas my colleague on the other side hopes to find a celebrity asking for Federal handouts rather than digging into his own pocket, he has instead highlighted a model citizen and a leader who has tried to make a difference and convince others to do the same. 
   It is one of the fastest growing areas. This is a very important earmark. I am proud to take this earmark. I will defend it with all my strength and ability. 
   At this time, I would like to yield whatever time is remaining to my colleague from Nevada, Jon Porter.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Chairman, Congress created the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation program in the FY 2001 Defense Authorization Act. This program compensates workers who were exposed to nuclear radiation while on the job within the Department of Energy and who later developed cancer and other illnesses. 
   While the program was a step toward righting the wrongs that these hard-working Americans had to suffer, there have been many problems since the enactment of this program. Many DOE workers have had difficulty proving that their cancer was directly caused by the radiation they were exposed to in the line of duty. The years-long process that the program requires workers to go through to prove they deserve compensation is intrusive and drawn-out. 
   This is an issue that directly affects my constituents. The Nevada Test site is an area larger than the State of Rhode Island, located about 65 miles north of Las Vegas. After years of exposure to nuclear radiation, many DOE workers who were employed at the Nevada Test Site during Cold War nuclear testing are now battling several forms of cancer, and many have already passed away. Unfortunately, many of these workers have also been turned away from Federal compensation. 
   However, there is an alternative for workers to qualify for Federal compensation. Workers at other Energy Department facilities across the country have been designated as part of the Special Exposure Cohort (SEC). Workers at these locations qualify for EEOIC benefits without going through an arduous and bureaucratic process. Since the creation of the program, Nevada Test Site workers have petitioned to be included in the SEC, but have only succeeded in part. Currently, only NTS workers who worked at the site between 1951 and 1962 are part of the Cohort and therefore automatically qualify for benefits. This only accounts for one third of all NTS claimants, leaving a large group of former Federal employees who are awaiting the compensation they deserve. 
   Madam Chairman, I understand this appropriations bill is not the time to designate Special Exposure Cohorts. However, it is imperative that we as a Congress act on this issue before it's too late: before the victims of nuclear radiation are gone. Before their families are left behind without their loved ones. This is long overdue and we must act now.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Good morning, Madam Chairman. 
   I rise today in support of an amendment that would require the CIA to issue a report on providing retirement benefits to former employees of Air America. 
   From 1950 to 1976, employees of Air America faithfully served their country doing their part to help win the Cold War. Air America was a government corporation covertly owned and operated by the Central Intelligence Agency. Under the guise of a civilian airline, these pilots conducted flight operations in various countries, including China, Laos, Korea and Vietnam on behalf of the Department of Defense and the CIA. 
   Unfortunately, since it was a closely held secret that Air America was a government-owned corporation, these men and women have never been credited for their government service. That means they can not receive government benefits, retirement benefits for their efforts. 
   The amendment I am offering today would require the Director of National Intelligence to submit a report to Congress on advisability of providing Federal retirement benefits to U.S. citizens employed by Air America while it was covertly owned and operated by the CIA. These brave men and women should receive the long denied benefits they earned for their service to their country. 
   I urge you to support this amendment that will bring attention to the overlooked dilemma of Air America employees. 
   Thank you, Madam Chairman, and I thank the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Reyes.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill that provides tax relief to parents and teachers, college students, homeowners and to millions of other middle-income Americans. If this legislation is not passed, more than 128,000 Nevada taxpayers will be slammed by the alternative minimum tax. This includes more than 30,000 people in my district alone. 
   I believe the alternative minimum tax should be eliminated, but this bill provides a necessary temporary solution to protect over 20 million Americans who will be hit by the AMT in 2007. Nevada residents will benefit from the extension of the deduction for State and local sales taxes contained in this bill. For homeowners, this bill extends the tax deduction for private mortgage insurance, and it provides relief to those who lose the roof over their heads by eliminating the foreclosure tax. 
   This bill ensures that more hardworking parents will be able to benefit from the child tax credit. But, most important, the tax relief in this bill is fully offset and will not add a single dollar to the national debt.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ms. Brown for introducing this. 
   This is essential that we provide the necessary resources for those areas in our country that have a high number of tourists. Las Vegas is home to 1.9 million residents, but at any given time, we have over 300,000 visitors. 
   Now, God forbid anything should happen, they are not in the formula, but they are the ones that are going to be most needy because they are away from home. They do not know how to access facilities. We need to provide for these people, and I suspect that that is the case at all tourist destinations.  
   I rise in support of this amendment, which ensures that we take tourism into account when calculating a city's homeland security risk level. The Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) addresses the homeland security needs of high-threat, high-density Urban Areas, and assists them in preventing, and recovering from acts of terrorism. 
   Las Vegas, my district, is a rapidly growing city, but it is even bigger when you add the 40 million tourists who visit our city every year. These tourists are particularly vulnerable because they are far from home and aren't familiar with our city. Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have made it clear they intend to attack our most vulnerable populations, where they can do the most harm to our economy and our confidence. 
   The areas Mrs. BROWN and I represent are dependent on tourism and the dollars they bring in. It is therefore essential that tourists be included in any risk assessments for homeland security. 
   And yet, last year, Las Vegas was left off the list entirely due to various data errors and thoughtless criteria. Over 100,000 tourists per day were completely overlooked. I worked with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that Las Vegas was ultimately included, but there is no guarantee it couldn't happen again. 
   Thankfully, this amendment would make sure that--by law--tourism would be taken into account when calculating risk. It's the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do and it's the safe thing to do. I urge support for this amendment and thank the gentlewoman from Florida.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I represent the fastest growing senior population in the United States. Many of the seniors that I represent have no other income than their Social Security check. Many need multiple medications. Many cannot afford the medications that they need. 
   It never made any sense to me that we had a Medicare system that enabled seniors to go to a doctor but, when the doctor prescribed the medication that they needed, many seniors were unable to afford the medication that the doctor prescribed. So I was a great advocate for a prescription medication benefit for older Americans. 
   The Republicans' prescription medication so-called benefit that was passed at 6 o'clock in the morning as we sat here or stood here watching in horror as arms were twisted and threats were made on the other side of the aisle in order to garner enough votes to pass this dog of a piece of legislation, it has never benefited enough seniors that were in desperate need of affordable medication. So if it didn't benefit our seniors, whom did this legislation benefit? It benefited the pharmaceutical industry. 
   The bill that was passed was so bad that it is hard to point out the worst part of it. But if I were a betting woman, and coming from Vegas I am a betting woman, I would say that the worst, the absolute worst, section was the one that prohibits our government from negotiating with drug companies for lower drug prices for our seniors. It doesn't take a genius to know that allowing the government to negotiate drug prices will lower the cost. It is common sense. The VA has been negotiating for years, and it saves our veterans millions of dollars. 
   We should be encouraging our government to negotiate lower prices instead of allowing our drug companies to increase the costs.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, almost 4 years ago our brave men and women in uniform defeated the armed forces of a brutal tyrant, and he has been brought to justice. 
   In the years since Saddam's fall, our troops have won thousands of battles, taken numerable objectives, built schools and utility systems, and provided all types of humanitarian relief in countless villages, towns, and cities ravaged by sectarian violence. But now our fighting men and women are thrust into a civil war that pits religious and ethnic factions against each other. Lurking amid Iraq's civilian population, they mercilessly kill their fellow Iraqis. 
   These fanatical killers plant thousands of explosive devices and crouch in thousands of ambush positions to attack our troops, who seek to replace senseless sectarian violence with a measure of stability so that the dysfunctional and deceitful Maliki government can survive. To fight and die in the middle of an Iraqi civil war fueled by centuries-old religious hatred is not why we sent our troops into harm's way. 
   Our troops have stepped up for 4 years. They have paid the price in blood. Now is the time for Iraqi authorities to step up. If they are ever to do so, it will be only after they understand that it will be their blood, not the blood of young Americans, that will be shed to stop the horrific sectarian violence that is tearing Iraq apart. 
   Throwing 20,000 additional Americans into the carnage of a Sunni-Shiite civil war can only allow the Iraqi Government to continue to shirk its responsibility for the security of its own people, as they continue to use our troops to eliminate their adversaries rather than sitting down and negotiating with them to share power and oil revenue. 
   After the election, the President said he heard the concerns of the American people and he promised a new plan for victory, but what he has proposed is merely a continuation of the same failed policy. Sending 20,000 more American troops to Iraq will do nothing to further the cause of victory. It will only prolong the agony. 
   Our mission in Iraq remains dependent on a viable Iraqi Government with both the ability and the will to confront the extremists that are tearing that country apart. The Maliki government has demonstrated neither the ability nor the will to take the action necessary to bring an end to this sectarian bloodshed. 
   The Members of his government at the highest levels and Maliki's strongest supporters are using their office to aid the insurgents and are directly involved in the sectarian violence gripping and destroying Iraq and killing our troops. 
   At a time when we should be doing everything we can to promote diplomacy in the Middle East, our attention to resources have instead been focused  on a civil war in Iraq which threatens to envelop the surrounding nations and further inflame the region. 
   The effect of this open-ended conflict on our military preparedness cannot be overstated. We have zero active duty or Reserve brigades in the United States that are combat-ready. One quarter of our troops deployed in Iraq are National Guard and Reserves. Our Guard units are stretched so thin, only 30 percent of their essential equipment remains. These units are the ones we depend on in case of domestic emergency. By further extending our commitment in Iraq, we are compromising our safety here at home. 
   In my home State of Nevada, one-third of our Guardsmen have served in Iraq, and with this surge they will face the possibility of further tours and extended time away from their families. 
   I commend our troops for their bravery in carrying out their mission. They have not let us down; we have let them down. We cannot ask them to continue their sacrifice while we wait for the Iraqi Government to step up. 
   I remain opposed to a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and I realize the grave consequences we face if our mission fails. But that does not mean that I will give a blank check to the President for a surge when he has not given us a clear understanding of why such an increase is needed or how it will help us succeed. 
   President Bush has yet to put forth a strategy that outlines where we are going, how we are going to get there, how long is it going to take, how much is it going to cost, and at what sacrifice to the American people. He must define the meaning of victory before it is too late. ``Mission accomplished.'' ``Bring them on.'' ``Stay the course.'' And ``we will stand down when the Iraqis stand up.'' Our campaign slogan is not ``thoughtful strategies for victory.'' 
   The President has failed to make the case for sending 20,000 more U.S. troops into a civil war with an open-ended mission and a bull's-eye on their back. I say yes and thank you to our troops, and I say no to the surge. I ask my colleagues to join me in doing the same for the good of our families, our military and our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this important legislation which expands mental health services for PTSD and substance use disorders, among other initiatives, for the brave men and women who have selflessly served our nation. 
   Nationally, one in five veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffers from PTSD. Twenty-three percent of members of the Armed Forces on active duty acknowledge a significant problem with alcohol use. It is vital that our veterans receive the help they need to deal with these conditions. 
   The effects of substance abuse are wide ranging, including significantly increased risk of suicide, exacerbation of mental and physical health disorders, breakdown of family support, and increased risk of unemployment and homelessness. Veterans suffering from mental health issues are at an increased risk for developing a substance abuse disorder. 
   A constituent of mine, Lance Corporal Justin Bailey, was a 1998 graduate of Las Vegas High School. Upon returning from a tour of duty in Iraq, he was diagnosed with PTSD, and was discharged from the Marines in 2004. He developed a substance abuse disorder and checked himself into a VA facility in West Los Angeles. After being given 5 medications on a self-medication policy, Justin overdosed and died on January 26, 2007. 
   Justin's parents were treated with indifference and apathy at the West LA facility. They were even handed Justin's belongings in a trash bag. Last August, 8 months after Justin's death, the Baileys returned to Los Angeles to meet with the Chief of Staff at the West LA VA Hospital. They came away from the meeting feeling the Chief of Staff had been completely unprepared and seemed out of touch with the needs of veterans. He even went so far as to state his staff does not know how to treat veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan because they are young and the staff is not tough enough on the younger veterans--giving them anything they ask for. 
   I introduced the House companion bill to S. 2162--the Mental Health Improvements Act, H.R. 4053--because it is imperative that we provide adequate mental health services for those who have sacrificed for this great nation and those who continue to serve. I am so thankful that the House is considering S. 2162 today. 
   Passage of this bill will help to ensure that we have the mental health resources and substance abuse treatment programs needed to care for our veterans. 
   The assessments of residential mental health facilities required by the bill will help tell us how well the VA is performing and what we can do to improve these services, including expanding availability at VA hospitals. 
   The availability of treatment for PTSD, including substance use disorder counseling, literally saves lives--so this must remain a top priority. A review of the services provided to our veterans is needed to ensure that what happened to Justin does not happen to anyone else. 
   I am grateful that this bill also contains the final authorization for the new Las Vegas VA Medical Complex that is so desperately needed in Southern Nevada. The complex will feature a 90-bed inpatient hospital, 120-bed nursing home for veterans, and an outpatient clinic. The complex will be over 900,000 square feet and is scheduled to open by mid-2011. 
   I want to thank both the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees for working together to come to a compromise on a bill that contains many vital initiatives for our veterans. I whole-heartedly support S. 2162 and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the AMT Relief Act. While I strongly believe the alternative minimum tax should be eliminated, this bill will provide a necessary, temporary solution to protect the more than 25 million Americans who would otherwise be hit by the AMT this year. 
   If this legislation is not enacted, more than 138,000 Nevada taxpayers will see their tax bill increased by the AMT. This includes more than 32,000 hardworking Las Vegas families who were never intended to be affected by this tax. 
   I am also pleased that the bill contains language to help those who face gargantuan alternative minimum tax liabilities on stock option income that they never actually received. I have several constituents in my district affected by this so-called ISO AMT, including one citizen who received a $1.2 million tax bill on a $30,000 stock option gain. This provision will help make these individuals whole. 
   With the current economic downturn, the rising cost of food and gas, increased unemployment and people losing their homes due to mortgage foreclosure, the last thing Las Vegas needs is a tax increase on thousands of middle class families. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, as co-chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I rise in strong support of this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, for too long, we have allowed China to dictate our relationship with Taiwan.  If anything, it should be the other way around. Taiwan consistently holds free and fair democratic elections. Taiwan respects human rights and labor standards. Taiwan is a free, democratic nation. 
   As the greatest democracy in the history of the world, we have an obligation to support other democracies and nurture them around the globe. We must be a beacon, a light to the world, showing the way forward for other democracies. Only then, will democracy finally flourish--and only if we show the way. 
   Mr. Chairman, our priorities are backwards when we place China's concerns ahead of a democratic country's. We must end these arbitrary and archaic restrictions on our relations with Taiwan. I urge support for this amendment.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to particularly thank our subcommittee chairman, NITA LOWEY. I think she has done a remarkable job throughout the day and during her entire service in the United States Congress. 
   And to my good friend ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, I want to thank her for her leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, the time has come to put an end to the shenanigans at the United Nations. While murderous and dictatorial regimes in North Korea, Zimbabwe, and Sudan have starved and burned and raped and killed hundreds of thousands of their own countrymen, the United Nations Human Rights Council focuses its attention on the only democratic country in the Middle East: Israel. Israel, with a free press, a country with free elections, a vibrant economy, and an open society; a nation that has to defend itself from terrorists and terrorism, terrorists who would wipe it from the face of the Earth if they had half a chance. Now that is a human rights issue worth looking into. 
   Mr. Chairman, the United Nations' Orwellian hypocrisy on human rights is so well known it has become a cliche. This body must take a stand against this mockery of a Human Rights Council. Let us cut off funding for this shameful and outrageous organization.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana for his leadership on this issue. I am proud to associate myself with his efforts though I believe it does not go far enough. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask my colleagues when we will learn from our mistakes? 
   Did we learn anything when Arafat took our money and stashed it in his Swiss bank accounts instead of providing for his own people? 
   Did we learn anything when Fatah was exposed as nothing but a corrupt gang of thugs? 
   Did we learn anything when Abu Mazen refused to rout Hamas when he had the chance and showed that his backbone is no stronger than a wet noodle? 
   Did we learn anything when Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza and Fatah failed to build one school, one hospital, one road, did one thing to improve the lives of its own people, but still came to us with their palms open for more money? 
   Did we learn when the Palestinian Finance Minister Salam Fayad admitted that hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid had been siphoned off, thanks to corruption and malfeasance? 
   Mr. Chairman, let's stop throwing good after bad. We should cut off funding to the corrupt and ineffectual Palestinian Authority. If I have learned anything it is this: If the U.S. gives Abu Mazen 50 cents or $50 million or $500 million more dollars he will be incapable of uniting the Palestinian people, leading the Palestinian people or bringing peace to a very troubled part of the world. I thank the gentleman from Indiana again for addressing this important issue and I yield back.

   Ms. BERKLEY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today on behalf of Mr. Weiner, Mr. Crowley, Mr. Ferguson and myself to offer an important amendment to cut off funding to the Saudi Arabian regime. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are many reasons that we need not be sending foreign aid to Saudi Arabia. First, Saudi Arabia does not need our money. They are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with a GDP of over $286 billion a year. With poor countries begging us for help, why are we giving money to this oil-rich kingdom? Is not 60, 70, $80 a barrel enough? 
   Second, Saudi Arabia exports and funds terrorists and terrorism. Need I remind anyone in this body that 15 of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi? But the story goes on. By 2005, over 2,500 Saudi youths had entered Iraq to wage jihad against the Americans. That's waging jihad against us. By last month, 3,000 Saudis had been killed or captured in Iraq. Why are all these Saudis fighting in Iraq? Because their government is financing and teaching terrorism. 
   Israeli officials believe that over half of Hamas' budget comes from Saudi Arabia. Just this week, two indictments were served against Saudi charities that are accused of funding Hamas. Their textbooks still teach Saudi children that Jews are apes, Christians are pigs, and that every other religion other than Islam is false. Their newspapers print anti-Semitic cartoons depicting the Jews as thiefs, and, most insulting of all, as Nazis. Already this year our State Department has counted 14 human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, including beatings, arbitrary arrests, violations of religious freedom, and limitation on workers rights. 
   The Saudis are not our allies. They are not our friends. King Abdullah called our invasion of Iraq an illegal foreign occupation. Those are not the words of a friend. 
   Mr. Chairman, we cannot trust them and we should not fund them. That is why every year more and more Members of this body vote to cut off funding to the terrorist regime. And yet, despite all this, the funding for Saudi Arabia has increased. Let me repeat that. It has increased each year because of an obscure loophole in the Foreign Assistance Act, up to $1.5 million in 2006. Well, this year we're closing that loophole. Our amendment will ensure that funding to Saudi Arabia is cut off once and for all. 
   Enough is enough. Let's come to our senses and end this senseless promotion of terrorism. I urge support for the Weiner-Crowley-Ferguson-Berkley amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Who seeks time in opposition?

   Ms. BERKLEY. I want to thank the gentlelady from New York and thank Mr. Wolf. It's nice to be on the same side of an issue for a change, and this is certainly one that I appreciate your support. Perhaps next year we can work on an amendment that will be even stronger than this. I quite agree with you. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs. Berkley). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I rise in strong support of this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, is it too much to ask, after nearly 60 years, that Israel's neighbors recognize its basic right to exist. There is simply no reason for the U.S. to be funding entities that do not recognize Israel, the Middle East's only democracy and our staunch ally. 
   Mr. Chairman, we can argue about the Palestinian Authority and whether we should fund that corrupt and ineffectual government. But there should be no debate when talking about terrorist organizations whose singular purpose is to wipe Israel off the map. 
   We must send a clear and firm message to Hamas and Hezbollah: as long as you are committed to Israel's destruction, we will commit ourselves to not aiding your survival. End of story. 
   I thank the gentleman for his clear sighted amendment.

<DOCNO>Ms. BERKLEY. (YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BERKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn in the strongest possible terms President Bush's latest attempt to resurrect the fatally flawed Yucca Mountain Project in my home State of Nevada. 
   This past Tuesday, the White House ordered the Energy Department to seek reintroduction of the so-called Fix Yucca Bill. 
   In a nutshell, this special interest legislation guts key safety and environmental rules, makes it harder for Nevadans to challenge Yucca Mountain, gives the green light to a water grant in the middle of the Nevada desert where there is no water, and increases the amount of deadly nuclear  waste that can be buried outside of Las Vegas, a major metropolitan area in the western United States where 1.7 million people reside. 
   In calling for passage of this bill, the Bush administration has renewed its attack on Nevada, and their goal is simple: open Yucca Mountain at any cost. 
   Mr. Speaker, this proposal isn't about safety and it isn't about science. It is not about protecting our communities from shipments of nuclear waste. This legislation is all about using political muscle to ram through changes to the rules of the game in order to ensure that nuclear waste comes to Nevada. 
   The reason they need the bill is clear: Yucca Mountain is all but dead as a result of scientific uncertainties, of bloated budget, and total mismanagement. The proposed dump is decades behind schedule and has already cost upwards of $12 billion according to the figures published this January by the General Accounting Office. 
   Outgoing Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner Ed McGaffigan, not exactly a great friend of the State of Nevada, recently said that it will take until 2025 or beyond before Yucca Mountain is completed. But more importantly, he said it is time to ``stop digging'' at Yucca Mountain and look at alternatives because the system that created this abomination is so flawed that nuclear waste will never be stored in Nevada. 
   Clearly, this legislation, which was introduced last year and went absolutely nowhere, is a last ditch effort to try and bring Yucca Mountain back from the brink of total collapse. Make no mistake about it, Yucca Mountain's days are numbered. Working with my colleagues in the House and with my Nevada counterpart, majority leader Harry Reid, we will ensure that this dangerous and misguided bill never reaches the President's desk. 
   Despite claims to the contrary, Yucca Mountain has never been proven safe, and there will be no way to keep thousands of shipments of nuclear waste secure as it travels across our roads and railways. 
   Among the changes included in the White House bill is a provision that seeks to eliminate the current restriction on the amount of waste that can be stored inside Yucca Mountain. Right now, it is 77,000 tons. They want to double that. Lifting this cap would enable more nuclear waste to be dumped in Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and would increase the number of waste shipments that would have to travel along America's roads and railways. 
   I am also concerned that this bill is designed to try and pave the way for President Bush's plan to allow nuclear waste from other nations. It is bad enough they want to stick nuclear waste from across the country in Nevada; now they want to take other nations' nuclear waste, ship it to Nevada for burial at Yucca Mountain. 
   Right now there is a limit on the nuclear waste that can be stored at Yucca Mountain. If the President has his way, Nevada will become the world's nuclear garbage dump. 
   Another provision in the bill will make it easier for Congress to spend billions on dumping nuclear waste in Nevada, with little or no oversight to protect taxpayers. Billions of dollars have already been wasted on this hole in the middle of the Nevada desert, and the truth remains that Yucca Mountain is no closer to opening today than it was 20 years ago when Nevada was unfairly singled out as the only State to be considered as a location to bury nuclear waste. That is known affectionately in the State of Nevada as the Screw Nevada Bill. 
   Funding for this disaster waiting to happen does not deserve special treatment. Yucca Mountain should have to compete with our Nation's needs to fund homeland security, education, clean energy, health care, Social Security, and the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. There should be no special budget treatment for Yucca Mountain, and Congress should exercise its full oversight authority, something we haven't seen for a while, on runaway spending on this failed project. 
   This brings me to the fact that we have not seen an updated cost estimate for Yucca Mountain for years, despite the rising cost of fuel and construction projects and labor. I suspect that Yucca Mountain could ultimately cost hundreds of billions of dollars before we are through. Is this where you want to stick our taxpayers' dollars? I don't. 
   The answer to this Nation's nuclear waste problem is not Yucca Mountain. The answer is to keep waste on-site where it is now produced in so-called ``dry cask storage.'' 
   I urge all of my colleagues to take a good look at this and make the right decision for our country and for our taxpayers.  
   This system is already in use in nuclear power plants, has the blessing of nuclear regulators and will keep waste safe for the next 100 years in hardened emplacements guarded by the same security precautions in place to keep nuclear power plants safe. 
   I say to my colleagues: Do not fall for false claims that Yucca Mountain can be ``fixed'' by sweeping aside important health and safety protections or through a water grab that turns Nevada's water law on its head. Or by lifting the cap on the amount of waste that can be stored at Yucca Mountain so that Nevada can become a global nuclear garbage dump. 
   Keep nuclear waste on-site, preserve the rules now in place to protect families and the environment, protect your right to scrutinize the billions being squandered on a hole in the Nevada desert and reject calls to support the reintroduction of the so-called ``Fix Yucca'' legislative package.
