<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Payne and Ranking Members Ros-Lehtinen and Smith for their excellent leadership on global health issues and on this AIDS bill. 
   I support H.R. 5501 because it is so very necessary. The statistics are staggering. In 2007, there were nearly 35 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. In that year alone, 2.5 million people became infected with HIV, 420,000 were children under the age of 15. And most tragically, there were 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 children under the age of 15. 
   But Mr. Speaker, this is not only about statistics. This is about the child who must stay home from school to take care of her siblings when a parent dies of AIDS. We're talking about the mother, the mother who, because she lacked prenatal care, passed the disease onto her unborn child. 
   Today we can make a difference. We can say that one more diagnosis of HIV, one more AIDS death, one more malaria case is absolutely unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and take a strong stand against this horrific pandemic.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (SETTING A FIRM TIMETABLE FOR IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, support is growing, finally, for setting a timetable for the responsible redeployment of American troops and military contractors from Iraq. Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki supports a timetable. A majority of the Iraqi Parliament supports a timetable. Both Houses of Congress have voted for a timetable. There is growing evidence that the majority of the Iraqi people support a timetable. And the American people certainly support a timetable. 
   Even the administration, which has spent more than 5 years turning a deaf ear to the American people, can finally hear the steady drumbeat of support for a timetable. Last week the administration agreed to what it called a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals in Iraq. This kind of statement is actually better than ``stay the course,'' which we have heard like a broken record from the White House for years. And it represents a victory for those who have been demanding a new direction in Iraq. 
   But the administration's position still falls far short of what is needed. A general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals is far too vague. When would the time horizon be reached? Nobody knows. 
   What is an aspirational goal? Nobody knows. 
   I believe the fuzzy wording is deliberate. It is obvious that the administration wanted to say something that sounds like a withdrawal but isn't a withdrawal. The loopholes in the administration's position are big enough to drive a truck through. I am afraid that a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals may just be another way of saying ``permanent occupation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we need clarity in our policy. We need to set a firm timetable for redeployment and a firm date for complete redeployment. These dates should be set in a way that ensures the safety of our troops and guarantees that the redeployment will be orderly and responsible. And we need a clear statement that there will be no permanent U.S. bases in Iraq. 
   A firm timetable for redeployment will accomplish many important goals. It will return full sovereignty to the Iraqi people. It will give the Iraqis incentives to step up the pace for political reconciliation. It will hasten the day that the Iraqis are capable of taking full responsibility for their own security. It will take an enormous strain off our own military, which has been stretched to the breaking point by the occupation of Iraq. It will relieve the strain on our overburdened military families. It will help to stabilize the Middle East, and help the United States to be a more effective broker in peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians.     
   It will allow us to focus on a solution for Afghanistan, a solution that can win the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. It will allow us to take billions of dollars that are being spent on the Iraq occupation and use that money instead for domestic needs and to help the American people deal with current hard times. 
   It will open the door for regional and for international partners to come into Iraq and to help with the reconstruction of that shattered nation. It will restore America's moral leadership in the world, and it will make us a more credible leader in the fight against terrorism. It will send a signal to the rest of the world that America is ready to be America again. That means a nation which respects the rule of law, that has compassion of the people of the world and that prefers peace over war. 
   Mr. Speaker, the administration's time horizon isn't enough. After more than 5 years of occupation, the only thing that should be on the horizon is a firm timetable for redeployment. That's what the American people and the Iraqi people want.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (WHERE'S W? -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, last night this House was host to the President for his final State of the Union address. Like all past Presidential speeches in this Chamber, it was historic. But this time it may have been historic because of what it did not achieve and what it left unfinished. 
   Forget all of the unfulfilled commitments on education, health care, environmental conservation, employment, energy efficiency, worker protections and immigration. Let's just look at the record on foreign policy. The state of that union? Dismal. 
   Upon taking office in 2001, this administration promised a new kind of international engagement, one based on partnerships and regional alliances. 
   We didn't exactly get what we bargained for, unfortunately. And the recent administration tour through the Middle East just about summed it up. 
   Remember those children's books, ``Where's Waldo?'' We had a case of ``Where's W?'' Let's start our tour in Israel and the Palestinian-controlled lands. 
   After nearly two terms of ignoring the real crisis in the region, the administration tried to make a last-ditch effort at a peace agreement: first by hosting a summit, one that wasn't expected to achieve anything, and then by a visit to the region. No ideals were outlined, no real road map was sketched out. To be generous, it was a half-hearted effort. It greatly saddens me, Mr. Speaker, that such an important opportunity was squandered. The Israeli and Palestinian people deserve more. They deserve a chance to at least hope for peace. 
   Next stop on the Where's W? trip, Kuwait and Bahrain. In Bahrain, the political opposition faces arrest, torturers are granted immunity, and a woman must go before family, not civil courts, family to fight back against violence and abuse.  
   In Kuwait, the world saw how Kuwaiti justice is carried out when al-Azmi was hanged inside the Interior Ministry complex in Kuwait City on December 21. 
   Next stop, the United Arab Emirates. This is the land where noncitizens are a subclass of people. They have very few rights. They face huge obstacles and discrimination. 
   Oh, and another thing, women can't pass on citizenship to their children unless their husband is a citizen. What does that mean? It often means insurmountable barriers to education and employment. 
   Now we are on the home stretch. Where in the world is W?     
   Saudi Arabia. The country with the choke hold on international energy markets, the homeland of the majority of the 9/11 terrorists, the land where women cannot legally drive a car yet. Sure, there is a proposal on the table to give women this right, but I wouldn't hold my breath. 
   How did the United States President clearly demand the rights of all Saudi people? By walking hand in hand with members of the Saudi royal family. That sounds like a strange negotiating tactic to me. 
   And the final stop on this regional tour, Egypt. Let's just look at what Amnesty International has to say about Egypt. We have longstanding concerns on systematic torture, deaths of prisoners in custody, unfair trials, arrests of prisoners of conscience for their political and religious beliefs or for their sexual orientation, wide use of administrative detention and long-term detention without trial, and use of the death penalty. 
   This, Mr. Speaker, was a tour of wasted opportunity and flagrant disregard for the most basic human rights. 
   So what will the President's legacy be in the Middle East? What is the state of that union? Not good. Not good at all. 
   We have a seemingly endless occupation of Iraq destabilizing the region. Osama bin Laden is still missing. We have the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
   Opportunity after opportunity for regional stability has been squandered and our standing in the region is embarrassingly low. But know this: This Congress will continue to demand an end to the occupation of Iraq and a return to sensible and sustainable policies in the Middle East. We will not stand by while the clock runs out on this administration.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Chabot for the time and for their leadership on human rights issues as well as Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen. I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1370. 
   In about a week, all eyes will turn to China. Athletes from around the world will converge on Beijing, except, it appears, seven of the 10 Iraqi athletes who are not allowed into the country for some reason. Many world leaders--such as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and German Chancellor Angela Merkel--are taking a very bold step next week by boycotting the opening ceremonies. I am still hoping that our President will reconsider his decision to attend in light of China's poor human rights record. It's no secret, Madam Speaker, that China has long sought to sweep its human rights violations under the rug. With the help of western companies, the Chinese government blocks or scrubs Web sites that it deems as troublemakers. Sites like CNN and certain Google searches are being censored. Try looking up Tiananmen Square while in China. No pictures of the 1989 student protest, certainly not the iconic picture of one man facing down a tank. In fact today many students at Beijing University couldn't even identify the photo. 
   Madam Speaker, as Chair of the Workforce Protections Subcommittee, I'm especially concerned about the treatment of Chinese workers. We have learned that reeducation labor camps and dire working conditions are the norm, not the exception, in China. This year's Olympics offered China the opportunity to turn a corner, but instead China turned backward. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and call on the President to stand up for human rights in China.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS AND THE OUT OF IRAQ CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Out of Iraq Caucus sponsored a very important meeting this morning to review the dire situation in Iraq and to explore ways to end the occupation. At this event, we heard from Dr. William Polk, one of America's leading experts on the Middle East. 
   Dr. Polk taught Middle Eastern history, politics, and Arabic at Harvard before joining the U.S. State Department's Policy Planning Council responsible for the Middle East and responsible for North Africa. Later, he became professor of history and founding director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago. 
   Dr. Polk is the author of many books, including the recently published book entitled, ``Violent Politics, a History of Insurgency, Terrorism, and Guerilla Warfare from the American Revolution to Iraq.'' To write the book, Dr. Polk studied insurgent movements throughout world history. He found that they were motivated by many different causes, including race, religion, culture, economics, and language, but he found that they all had one thing in common, an opposition to foreign occupation. 
   Dr. Polk's research has clear implications for our policy in Iraq. It tells us that the American occupation of Iraq can never solve the country's problems. Only the Iraqis can solve Iraqi problems. And it tells us that the only policy that now makes sense is to withdraw our troops in an orderly but rapid way, and couple that action with a carefully constructed program that will help the Iraqis to pick up the pieces and to rebuild their country with the help of the regional international community. 
   The lesson of history is clear, Mr. Speaker; yet, our leaders in the White House continue to follow a disastrous course of foreign occupation. Their blindness has put our Nation on a very dangerous course. The administration has called for an enduring relationship with Iraq, meaning many years, perhaps even decades, of American military involvement. 
   If the administration has its way, babies now in diapers will grow up and march off to Baghdad while the neo-cons who crafted our Iraq policy play golf in their retirement communities.  
   The administration's policy of endless occupation will cost us trillions of dollars and countless casualties. It will lead to the deaths of countless Iraqi civilians and surely force millions more to become refugees. Meanwhile, al Qaeda will continue to hatch its plots against the United States in their safe havens far from Iraq. 
   It is clear that Iraq will never stabilize and find peace while we are present. Our occupation of Iraq prevents Iraqis from finding solutions to their own problems, and it prevents the regional and international diplomacy that is absolutely needed to help them reconcile and to rebuild. 
   The timely withdrawal of American troops is the essential first step in solving the Iraqi problem. So long as our troops and military contractors are there, the situation can only and will only get worse. 
   In the days ahead, I and others will urge Congress to move to end the occupation. Congress has the power of the purse. We must pass a bill requiring that all spending related to Iraq be used for only one purpose, and that is to fully fund the safe, orderly, and responsible withdrawal of all American troops and military contractors. 
   If we fail to do this, we will have failed the American people, who sent us to Congress last November with a clear message: End the occupation of Iraq. And we will have failed our country morally, we will have failed our country politically, and certainly we will have failed it economically. 
   It is time, Mr. Speaker, to do what we know is right and what is best for our country: bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the military announced yesterday that the number of monthly U.S. combat deaths fell to the lowest point in a year. Military and administration officials touted this as a success. 
   Is this the way we're measuring success in Iraq these days? Sixty-four brave members of our military forces were killed in September. And that is a success? That is something to brag about? 
   Tell that to the 64 families who will have to celebrate the holidays without their loved ones this year. Tell that to the children who lost a parent. Tell that to the mother who prayed every single day for the safe return of her child. 
   That is not a success, Mr. Speaker. That is a tragic loss of life. We have lost over 3,800 brave men and women in uniform in the occupation of Iraq. At least 28,000 have been wounded. How many is too many before the administration sees the errors of its ways? I can't begin to guess. 
   And what about the Iraqi families? Press reports indicate that nearly 1,000 Iraqis were killed during the month of September. Tens of thousands were displaced from their homes in September. 
   Is this another success of the administration? Tell that to the children who can't go to school, to the hospitals trying to treat patients without a consistent supply of electricity, to the families who just want to live a normal life. 
   The international community, the so-called coalition of the willing, sees the writing on the wall. In fact, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown just announced that 1,000 British troops will leave by the end of the year. 
   And speaking of milestones, Mr. Speaker, the number of coalition partner deaths recently reached 4,000. Enough is enough. 
   This Congress must, we must take bold steps to bring our troops home and to help the Iraqi people return to their lives. Only when the United States military presence, troops and contractors leave Iraq will the real healing and national rebuilding begin. 
   We don't need any more reports. What we need is action. We need the Commander in Chief to support the troops. We need him to bring our troops home, not in a year, not in 10, now. And we have seen that this administration will not redeploy the troops unless Congress forces its hand. 
   Eighty-four Members of the House have sent a letter to the President saying that we will only support spending bills that fully fund the safe, orderly and responsible redeployment of our troops and our military contractors. No more, no less. 
   Join us in our resolve. Support our troops. Bring them home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (OCCUPATION OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the Government Accountability Office issued a report on Monday that should worry every single Member of the House. The GAO said that the government isn't moving quickly enough to ensure that radioactive materials don't get into the hands of terrorists. 
   Last year the GAO ran a sting operation to see how easy it would be for anyone to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to buy enough radioactive materials to create a dirty bomb. They set up a bogus company with only a post office box number and got the license within a month. 
   The government then promised to tighten up on its requirements for the purchase of radioactive materials, but the GAO report found this effort is still years behind schedule. So while the government takes what looks like its sweet time, we live under the threat of a dirty bomb that could kill many Americans and devastate our economy. 
   But as outrageous as this situation is, it is only a prime example of how our country's real security needs are being ignored. 
   Another example is the occupation of Iraq because the administration continues to have tunnel vision when it comes to Iraq. While the administration devotes most of our military resources and troops on the occupation of another country, an occupation that actually makes no sense whatsoever, it is blind to the real threats to our security in Afghanistan. 
   Even Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has admitted that we are focusing on the wrong place. Earlier this month he said, ``I don't have troops that I can send into Afghanistan until I have a reduced requirement in Iraq. We don't have enough troops in Afghanistan to hold, and that is key clearly to the future of being able to succeed in Afghanistan.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, al Qaeda is growing stronger along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Even Ryan Crocker, our ambassador to Iraq, admitted when he testified before Congress in March that stopping al Qaeda in Afghanistan should be our top priority, not the occupation of Iraq. 
   Yet we have five times more troops in Iraq than Afghanistan. That doesn't make military sense; it doesn't make common sense. 
   We can have two reactions to this tragic situation. We can scratch our heads and wonder at the folly of it all, or we can take action. Of course I prefer action. That is why I have offered a SMART Security plan which would defeat terrorism through strong international alliances, aggressive diplomacy, improved intelligence, and initiatives to address the root causes of terrorism. 
   In addition, I and my colleague, Representative BARBARA LEE from California, asked Members of Congress to sign a letter to Prime Minister al-Maliki of Iraq last week. Thirty-one Members signed the letter, and I thank them. 
   The letter states, ``We, the undersigned Members of the United States House of Representatives, support the sovereign right of the government of Iraq to insist that any security agreement between the United States and Iraq include a timetable for the complete redeployment of U.S. Armed Forces and military contractors out of Iraq.'' 
   Prime Minister al-Maliki has called for such a timetable. We should work with him to make it happen. This is a great opportunity to end our disastrous and counterproductive occupation of Iraq. 
   Yesterday, The Washington Post released a poll that shows that 63 percent  of the American people believe that the war in Iraq was not worth fighting. Let's listen to the American people, Mr. Speaker. Let's bring our troops and military contractors out of Iraq, but let's not repeat the same military folly in other parts of the region.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Chair, actually I am going to speak today as a former human resources manager and human resources professional for over 20 years. I know what it takes to manage competitive and productive workforces; and believe me, I know the difference that paying a decent wage, having health and retirement benefits make in a worker's life, and how work performance is enhanced when workers know that a full workday results in pay that they can actually afford to live on, to raise their family on. 
   Unfortunately, today workers are facing falling wages, they are facing fewer benefits, and that is a fact that is directly related to the disappearance of our middle class here in the United States of America. 
   Since union workers earn about 30 percent more than nonunion workers per week, are almost twice as likely to have employer-sponsored health benefits and defined pension plans compared to only one in seven nonunion workers, the ability to organize will make a huge difference in bringing our middle class back. 
   Madam Chair, H.R. 800 is the prescription that we need to right a weakened middle class, bring it back to health again. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, support American workers.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, it is getting to the point where I am almost afraid to pick up the newspaper every morning because day after day, there is more grim news out of Iraq and the Middle East. More revelations about the scandalous mismanagement of this war and its aftermath. More evidence that the current administration is jeopardizing our national security. 
   There has been a lot of rhetoric here on Capitol Hill about who supposedly does and does not support the troops. I personally believe we should call a moratorium on ``support the troops'' demagoguery until the conditions at Walter Reed Hospital finally reach the level that our veterans deserve. 
   It is positively disgraceful, Mr. Speaker. After risking life and limb for our country, our soldiers are sent to a moldy, rodent-infested facility where they receive inadequate care. And today, we read that Walter Reed officials were aware of problems and heard complaints, but largely ignored them. 
   The squalid living conditions of Walter Reed are just one symptom of a completely ineffective and unaccountable bureaucracy. According to the Washington Post, nonEnglish speaking families have a difficult time getting the information and services they need. One mother of a soldier said, ``If they could have Spanish-speaking recruits to convince my son to go into the Army, why can't they have Spanish-speaking translators when he is injured?'' Her point is telling. It appears that our government is very eager to sign you up, but much less enthusiastic about communicating with you once you have been shot down. 
   Meanwhile, conditions in the Middle East are rapidly deteriorating. The most disturbing recent news is that the Taliban and al Qaeda, remember, they are the ones who bear direct responsibility for 9/11, these folks are on the rebound and they are stepping up the violence in Afghanistan. They are so emboldened that they launched a suicide bomb attack right outside the Air Force base where the Vice President was staying during his recent trip to the region. 
   Curiously, that same Vice President seems to think it is those of us who want to end the Iraq occupation that are validating the al Qaeda strategy. That was the line he used in attacking our Speaker last week. Well, I think the Vice President isn't in a position to throw stones, Mr. Speaker. First of all, al Qaeda didn't have anything to do in Iraq until the administration launched its pre-emptive strike nearly 4 years ago. Furthermore, it was this administration that had bin Laden sounded at Tora Bora and let him get away. And it is this administration that has taken its eye off the ball in Afghanistan, diverting resources from a nation-building project to pursue the ideological fantasy of conquering Iraq.     
   The new director of national intelligence, Mike McConnell, told the Senate Armed Services Committee this week: ``Long-term prospects for eliminating the Taliban threat appear dim, so long as the sanctuary remains in Pakistan, and there are no encouraging signs that Pakistan is eliminating it.'' 
   And whose fault is that, Mr. Speaker? Not the Speaker of the House. 
   Unbelievably, when the White House spokesman was asked about the Pakistani Government's failure to cooperate, he answered: ``We're often asked to give our report cards on other heads of state. I'm not going to play.'' 
   We have sure come a long way from the tough talk of 2001. Remember how we were told that those who harbored terrorists would be treated just as harshly as the terrorists themselves? 
   Journalist Spencer Ackerman assesses the Afghanistan situation this way: ``After two wars, we're in some sense right back where we were before 9/11 itself: unable to invade the territory where al Qaeda possesses a stronghold and groping for alternatives, while the intelligence community puts out warnings about the urgency of the threat. Except this time,'' he continues, ``our entire national security apparatus is overtaxed from the strains of two wars, wars that were supposed  to significantly diminish, if not remove, the very threat that's regaining strength.  
   Mr. Speaker, we must not lose our nerve. It is the responsibility of this body, carrying a mandate from the American people, to correct the grievous mistakes and reverse the disastrous course of this administration. 
   We must devote ourselves to democracy-building, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must bring our troops home from Iraq. And once they're home, we must treat them with the dignity and respect they've earned.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday all of my colleagues and I took the oath of office as a Member of this great House of Representatives, swearing to support and to defend the Constitution of the United States of America. I take this responsibility very seriously. 
   I take my responsibility to my constituents very seriously, and sometimes that means standing up to the executive branch when I believe it is in error, when it has gone too far or is openly ignoring the wishes of the people of America. This is what our founding fathers expected of the Congress, and, quite frankly, this is what the American people expect from the Congress. 
   Today I stand here and give my 174th 5-minute special order speech calling for an end to this misguided occupation in Iraq and calling on the President and all of my colleagues to support our troops by bringing them home. Already, over 3,000 American troops have been killed in Iraq, at least 44,000 have been wounded. Reports indicate that anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 Iraqis, it is probably more, have lost their lives. 
   How many more families must grieve? How many more children must be orphaned? How many? 
   The voters sent a clear message on November 7 that Congress must stand up and say no more. The Iraq Study Group also sent a message. I was clear that the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. Even President Bush finally admitted last month that we are, and he said, we are not winning in Iraq, although he also said we are not losing. 
   Enough Washington double-speak. It is time for action. How about a plan for the future of Iraq from President Bush? We have already spent nearly $400 billion on this occupation, and yet he is asking for $127 billion more. We already have 130,000 troops on the ground, and now we hear that he wants to send even more. He is calling it a surge. Let us be honest here, sending in more troops to clean up the mess the President has already made is an escalation. Enough is enough. No more fuzzy math, no more sloganeering, no more troops dying, no more. 
   Soon I will introduce a comprehensive package to bring our troops home while supporting Iraqi sovereignty. I urge my colleagues, please work with  me to bring this real and workable bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, the voters have demanded an end to President Bush's occupation of Iraq. They don't want more talk, they want a real plan. They want a plan that will bring our troops home. This is our mandate, and this is the oath we swore to yesterday.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, 9 days ago, 11 innocent Iraqi civilian were killed in an incident involving American military contractors. The circumstances surrounding the tragedy are not clear, but what is clear is that not enough attention has been paid to civilian deaths in Iraq. 
   By the most conservative count, over 73,000 innocent Iraqi civilians have been killed since the occupation began. Just about everyone agrees that the real figure is much higher, since many deaths aren't even reported. But even if you accept the low 73,000 figure, you can see how catastrophic the occupation has been to Iraqi society. 
   The population of the United States is about 12 times greater than that of Iraq, so 73,000 Iraqi deaths are comparable to over 875,000 American deaths. That is more than the population of Cleveland and Kansas City combined, or Atlanta and Omaha combined. This 875,000 is more than the population of an entire congressional district. 
   I would also like to call my colleagues' attention to the article in The Washington Post this morning concerning civilian casualties in Iraq. The article points out that the Pentagon's official count of civilian casualties in Iraq shows an increase over the course of this year. This is in stark contrast to the charts that General Petraeus showed us in his testimony earlier this month, which only showed the narrower category of civilian deaths. This is further evidence, Mr. Speaker, that General Petraeus' testimony was part of an overall administration spin campaign to convince this Congress and the American people to keep their support for ``stay the course'' in Iraq. 
   Iraqi civilians are also suffering, because the violence has forced over 4 million of them to become refugees. The U.N. referred 11,000 refugee applicants to the United States for processing by the end of this fiscal year. In February, the United States promised to admit 7,000. Then that number was downgraded to 2,000. But, so far, only 1,035 refugees have been admitted, and the fiscal year expires in 5 days. This situation is like so many others we have seen during the occupation of Iraq. The administration makes big promises about what it can achieve, then retreats from its promises, and then fails to deliver altogether. 
   To make our refugee record even worse, the Government Accountability Office has reported that the number of condolence payments the United States Government pays to families of dead or injured Iraqi civilians plunged by 66 percent from the year 2005 to 2006. The condolence payments are, at most, $2,500, $2,500 per incident. Would any one of us consider $2,500 to be a condolence payment for the death of a beloved child or spouse? No, Mr. Speaker, we wouldn't. 
   This Congress will have failed America, both morally and politically, if we allow the occupation to continue and ignore the suffering of the innocent. We have only one real tool that we can use to end the occupation, the power of the purse. We must not appropriate another dime for the continuation of the occupation. Instead, we must fully fund the safe, orderly, and responsible withdrawal of our troops and the estimated 180,000 military contractors who constitute an even larger army than our 160,000 troops. This is what the American people sent us here to do, and we have a moral obligation to do it. We have an obligation to bring our troops home.

This bill invests $35 billion in our children, providing health insurance for an additional four million children and bringing the total number of children covered by SCHIP to ten million. This bill will also help states provide millions of children with the dental and mental health services they so desperately need. 
   While this is a very good bill, it is not perfect and I hope it will serve as a starting point in a larger conversation about how we find a way to ensure coverage for everyone, but particularly for children and low income seniors, the most vulnerable amongst us. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to come to an agreement on how to increase coverage to the level the House bill provided. Additionally, I would like to join my colleagues in covering legal immigrant children and pregnant women, which the House bill ensured. Finally, I hope that the House and Senate will agree upon a strong Medicare bill that rolls back payment cuts and addresses payments based solely upon where a physician practices. This has made it incredibly difficult for physicians in Sonoma County to continue to see Medicare patients. The House bill addressed the geographic inequity and is a great starting point for a conversation about how to address this serious issue. 
   Additionally, as the Chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, I am proud to support the language in this bill that will provide military families with the protections they need in the workplace. For the first time since Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) fourteen years ago, this bill will amend FMLA to provide the spouse, child, parent, and closest blood relative of an injured service member with six months of unpaid, job protected leave to care for their injured loved ones. Congressman GEORGE MILLER and I worked closely with Senators CHRISTOPHER DODD and HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON to ensure that the provisions of H.R. 3481, the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act, were included as part of the final compromise reached between the House and Senate, and I commend the Democratic Leadership for their strong support for our Nation's wounded warriors and their families. Military families should never have to risk losing their jobs in order to meet the needs of their loved ones, and with this bill, we are one step closer to fulfilling our promise to them. 
   Passing this bill will mean a real investment for our children and I hope that we consider it a starting point for a conversation about covering every child.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (PRESIDENT SHOULD OVERRULE PROPOSED NEW STRATEGY OF GIVING WEAPONS TO SUNNI ARAB GROUPS -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, tonight I rise to demand that President Bush take immediate action as Commander in Chief to overrule a proposed new strategy in Iraq, a proposal that may put our troops in even greater danger in the days ahead. 
   The New York Times reported this morning that our commanders in Iraq are now planning to give weapons to Sunni Arab groups, weapons that may turn around and be used against our very own troops. 
   In the past, these Sunni groups have been allied with al Qaeda and have actually been suspected of being involved in attacks upon our troops. So why are we doing this? According to the Times, our commanders have reason to believe that the Sunnis have split with al Qaeda and are now ready to fight on our side. Well, it could be true, but this strategy is fraught with terrible peril for our brave men and women in combat. 
   The Times reports, ``Critics of the strategy, including some American officers, say it could amount to the Americans arming both sides in a future civil war. The United States has spent more than $15 billion in building up Iraq's Army and police force, whose manpower of 350,000 is heavily Shiite. With little sign of a political accommodation between Shiites and Sunni politicians in Baghdad, there is a risk that any weapons given to Sunni groups will eventually be used against Shiites.'' And I must mention, our troops will be stuck in the middle, dying for what? Because there is the possibility, says the Times, the weapons could be used against the Americans themselves. 
   Let me repeat that last sentence, ``There is also the possibility the weapons could be used against the Americans themselves.'' That's what the Times had to say. 
   But first, Madam Speaker, we sent our troops into battle without the proper body armor or vehicle armor. Then we put them in the middle of a bloody civil war they were never trained to fight. Then, when many of them got wounded, we gave them terrible medical treatment at home. Now this is the latest outrage. 
   Madam Speaker, I do not condemn our commanders in the field for making this decision. They are taking this risk because they are desperate to implement President Bush's hopeless, foolish surge policy, but the surge has not worked, is not working and will not work. 
   As the Times reports, ``An initial decline in sectarian killings in Baghdad in the first two months of the troop buildup has reversed, with growing numbers of bodies showing up each day in the capital. Suicide bombings have dipped in Baghdad, but increased elsewhere, as al Qaeda groups, confronted with great American troop numbers, have shifted their operations elsewhere.'' 
   There's only one way, Madam Speaker, out of this. We must bring our troops home, and then we must work with the Iraqi people and we must work with them in a peaceful way to reconstruct their devastated Nation. 
   Last month, a bill that called for starting the withdrawal of our troops within 90 days received 171 votes in this House. Some pundits were surprised that it received that much support. I wasn't. Opposition to this President's failed foreign policy is growing all over America, and those voices are eventually being heard in this body more and more every day. 
   Madam Speaker, if American troops are harmed by this new war strategy, then the American people will hold the President accountable. But if we in this House condone it as well, or remain silent, then we will be responsible, too. 
   Our job is to force this administration to fully fund the plan to bring our troops and our contractors home, home where they are not positioned in the middle of a civil war.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lantos, chairman of the committee and my Bay Area neighbor, for working so closely with me to bring this resolution to the floor today. As the only Holocaust survivor in the Congress, his support of this resolution means very much to all of us, and particularly to me. 
   H. Res. 226 is a resolution to recognize American government officials who played a critical role in the creation and activity of the War Refugee Board in an effort to help rescue Jews and other persecuted minorities during the years of the Holocaust. 
   Because of their actions and because of their bravery, an unknown number of people were saved from the horrific reign of Adolf Hitler and his followers. Specifically, we are commending the actions of Secretary of Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Josiah DuBois and John Pehle for their dedication and devotion to helping rescue Jews and other persecuted minorities during the Holocaust. 
   To many, World War II and the Holocaust may seem long, long, long ago. For others, however, this is a memory which will be imprinted in their soul forever. Six million Jews were killed under the brutal and evil reign of Adolf Hitler while many countries turned a blind eye to their ethnic cleansing and genocide. 
   During this dark time, some brave men and women stood up and demanded that every person, no matter their ethnic background, be treated justly and humanely. The people serving the War Refugee Board sent a historic cable to the diplomatic missions ordering that ``action be taken to forestall the plot of the Nazis to exterminate the Jews and other persecuted minorities in Europe.''     
   They developed new programs to increase the flow of Jewish and other refugees from Nazi persecution to neutral countries. 
   After the horror of the concentration camps and extermination campaigns were revealed, the world said ``never again.'' 
   And yet, Mr. Speaker, we look around the world to see hauntingly similar events occurring, particularly in places like Darfur. Mr. Speaker, if we truly wish to honor the memory of the Holocaust victims, we must come together to stand up in the face of bigotry and hatred all around the world today. The action of the War Refugee Board is an amazing example of courage, human kindness, and compassion. 
   Today, we rise to recognize their service to this country and to humankind. We rise to remember the Jews and minorities who perished under a reign of terror. But it is with hope that we look to the future, a future of peace and human dignity where ``never again'' means never again. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Chairman Obey, for the time. 
   Today the Congressional Progressive Caucus held an event called ``Winter Soldier.'' We listened to the veterans of the Iraq occupation, and they told us about what it's been like over there and what they've learned. The meeting actually followed in tradition of hearings first held during the Vietnam War. The forum gave veterans who have firsthand experience a chance to tell their stories. It was a solemn, thought-provoking event. What these men and women saw, what they've experienced, is really heartbreaking. 
   But today we have it in our power, we have it in our power to put an end to the tragedy that is the Iraq war. Today, this Congress will decide if we will give the President a blank check to continue his endless occupation of Iraq, or if we will fund redeployment and reconciliation and if we will do something for the refugees in Iraq. 
   The American people have been clear in their demands. They want to end the occupation, not extend it. They want us to bring our troops and military contractors home. They want us to reaffirm our commitment to the Iraqi people.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (WINTER SOLDIER -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, earlier today the Congressional Progressive Caucus held an event called ``Winter Soldier'' where we honored our men and women in uniform who have returned as veterans. And then this afternoon, we were given another bite at the so-called apple, as if we were continuing the honor of these winter soldiers. 
   What happened this afternoon, what happened less than an hour ago was an amendment on the House floor to fund the Iraq-Afghanistan war until June of 2009 failed. It did not pass. It failed. Now, that is the way to honor winter soldiers: stop paying for the President's debacle, for the failed international policy, for the damages that  are being caused to our soldiers across the waters. That is the way to make up and honor winter soldiers. 
   So what is a Winter Soldier? In 1991, a courageous group of veterans of the Vietnam War took their cause to Washington in an event called ``Winter Soldier.'' Today, we honored that tradition, and we looked at a new generation of veterans and a new warfront, Iraq. 
   The event, which was organized with the Iraq Veterans Against the War, got to the heart of the issue: how this endless occupation is affecting our men and women in uniform and the Iraqi people themselves. 
   In recent months, we have heard from General David Petraeus, we have heard from Ambassador David Crocker, and we've heard a lot from the administration, all armed with PowerPoint presentations and colorful posters attempting to convince us that after 5 years we are finally making progress in Iraq. 
   That's what made this morning so unique. This was an opportunity to hear not from the military's top brass but directly from the very soldiers who put their lives on the line to carry out the administration's policies. 
   Today's event was a continuation of Winter Soldier hearings that were organized earlier this year at the National Labor College in Silver Spring, Maryland. Over 3 days, dozens of veterans shared their personal stories and testified about their own experiences on the ground in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   These weren't pundits or analysts talking about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the abstract. These were the stories, these were the testimonies of the men and women who had experienced the horrors of war up close and personal. 
   As I listened to the testimony this morning, I was struck that while each witness brought a unique and very personal perspective towards the occupation of Iraq, there was one consistent thread that connected each and every testimony: that despite the valor and sacrifice of our troops, and at almost every level, the administration's strategy in Iraq has failed and continues to fail. 
   What a great response to these wonderful soldiers because today's vote says exactly what we need to say: put an end to this war, reject a blank check to extend this occupation into another year, concentrate on funding the redeployment of our troops and the redeployment of our contractors. 
   We owe nothing less than that to those brave men and women in uniform and those who have been there before them, and we also owe nothing less than that to the Iraqi people.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman on the Rules Committee for yielding to me. 
   I rise in support of this bill and in support of the promise that comes with funding embryonic stem cell research. 
   Millions of Americans suffer from diseases for which we might actually find a treatment. Millions more watch family and friends suffer while we deny a chance for a cure. How can we tell a parent watching a child suffer from cancer that we aren't going to do every single thing possible to save that child? How can we tell a child that we won't try to put a halt to the ravages of the Parkinson's disease from which a father or mother is suffering? How can we tell a teenager that there is a chance we could repair a damaged spinal cord so that the teen can walk again but we aren't going to pursue it? How can we tell someone with a family member with Alzheimer's disease that we won't try every single thing possible to fight it? 
   In my own district, the Buck Institute on Aging is doing great research into lifesaving research with embryonic stem cells. Just recently, they received a grant from the State of California to continue their great work. Private research facilities and States are on the forefront of research, and the Federal Government must join them. 
   Today, we have an obligation. We have an obligation to the people of this country to support research that could prevent suffering, that could save countless lives. Federal funding for research in stem cells is vital. It is vital to making real progress as quickly as possible to find real cures. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill that will certainly have long-lasting effects in improving the health and the well-being of millions of Americans; and I, too, want to thank Congresswoman Diana DeGette from Colorado for being such a leader in the stem cell debate.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (A MATTER OF TRUST -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, in the current issue of the ``New Yorker'' magazine, veteran reporter Seymour Hersh lays out the shame that was Abu Ghraib and the efforts at the highest levels to sweep it under the carpet. 
   Former Army General Antonio Taguba takes this very brave step to share details of his meetings with former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other administration officials in the wake of the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib. In May, 2004, photos of abuse at the American-run prison were made public by CBS and other media outlets. 
   We can all recall the inhumane treatment and degradation depicted. What was included in the photos and videos were not interrogations. They were humiliating and often horrible acts of violence. 
   Months earlier, before the photos emerged, General Taguba had filed a report outlining the ``numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuses that were inflicted on several detainees and systemic and illegal abuse.'' 
   In fact, the first report sent to senior Pentagon officials came in January of that year. The response? A senior general in Iraq brushed off the report saying that the victims were ``only Iraqis.'' According to the article, General Taguba found that Lieutenant General Sanchez, the Army commander in Iraq who had visited the prison several times, knew exactly what was going on. 
   Despite many reports contradicting him, Secretary Rumsfeld himself clung to the claim that he saw the photos and video of the abuse only days before testifying before Congress. He said he first learned of the problem in late January or early February. His memory seems to be a little fuzzy in this regard. And in response, who did he send to oversee prison in Iraq? Major General Jeffrey Miller, the commander at Guantanamo. 
   If this were a movie plot, Mr. Speaker, it would seem ludicrous. Unfortunately, this is part of our real history in the occupation of Iraq. 
   And our commander-in-chief? It is unclear when he first learned of the situation at Abu Ghraib, but by most accounts it was months before the notorious pictures hit the airwaves. This is absolutely disgraceful. 
   It appears that the administration has no shame when it comes to the continuing abuse of human rights abroad and at home right here in America. Is this the legacy we want to leave in the Middle East? A preemptive strike against a nation which did not have weapons of mass destruction? A civil war that is tearing a nation apart? Our standing in the world at an all-time low? The loss of over 3,500 brave service members? 
   This did not have to happen. The administration willingly misled this Nation into an occupation that cannot be won. 
   The acts at Abu Ghraib could have besmirched the honor and reputation of all of the troops who serve each day with distinction and courage, but thankfully it did not, because the American people know and understand that the acts of the few and of the top leadership who endorse those acts should not be visited on those who so bravely and selflessly serve. Our troops have shown great valor in the face of unbelievable challenges. This Congress honors them and the sacrifices they have made. 
   That said, it is well past time that this Congress stands up and says, enough is enough from this administration. The American people are frustrated with the lack of progress on ending the occupation and bringing our troops home, and rightfully so. 
   This fight may be difficult, but it is our obligation. I ask my colleagues to demand that not another day goes by without a real effort to bring our troops home and to return the sovereignty of Iraq to its people.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE SURGE AND IRAQI FORCES -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, you will recall that the hallmark of the  President's so-called surge, the escalation of troops into Iraq, was that Iraqi forces would actually be on the front lines, while American troops would be providing support. 
   In fact, a White House fact sheet from the day the President announced escalation, says that the primary element of the strategy is to let the Iraqis lead. 
   Well, the escalation has begun, and not only are they not leading, we are lucky if they even show up. That is right. Reportedly, as many as 50 percent of the Iraqi troops expected and needed for the Baghdad operation aren't reporting to duty. This doesn't bode well, Madam Speaker. American troops will now bear the brunt of what promises to be deadly, violent, urban warfare. 
   We are now finding out that the escalation will be twice as large as the President has said, requiring 48,000 additional troops, as opposed to 21,000, as originally announced by the President. Now, if Iraqis aren't prepared for the fight, it is easy to imagine still more U.S. soldiers being sent into the grinder. The surge has barely begun, and already, it is failing. 
   It is clear, furthermore, that the Maliki government is powerless to live up to its promises. Maliki himself owes much of his political authority to one of Iraq's most powerful militia leaders. So how, exactly, is he going to keep Iraqi communities safe from the militias? 
   On their way out the door, General Abizaid and General Casey warned that increasing force levels just absolves Iraqis of the responsibility for their own security, and they were absolutely right. 
   In the State of the Union address, the President said, and I quote him, `` ..... it's time for [the Iraqi] government to act. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad ..... They pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction ..... and they need to follow through.'' 
   If they don't, where is the ``or else'' in the President's words, and where are the consequences if they don't meet these benchmarks and honor these commitments? 
   Madam Speaker, it is time for fewer carrots and more sticks. Edward Luttwak of the Center for Strategic and International Studies put it succinctly. He said, ``it's time for the Iraqis to make their own history.'' Or, in the words of Luttwak's New York Times op-ed piece yesterday, he said, ``To Help Iraq, Let It Fend for Itself. `` 
   There is only one solution, a quick military withdrawal from Iraq. I have a bill that was sponsored by 33 other Members of Congress that will do precisely that. H.R. 508, the Bring Our Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act will do exactly what we need. It will take our troops out of harm's way and force Iraqis to secure their own country. We won't leave them high and dry. The bill calls for an international stabilization force, but one that would come only at the request of the Iraqi government for no more than 2 years, and with other nations taking on the burden as well. 
   H.R. 508 will have our troops home in 6 months, leaving behind no permanent military bases and turning over control of the Iraqi oil to the Iraqi people. We will not abandon Iraq. We will continue to be a partner in the reconciliation and reconstruction, but it is time for us to end the military occupation that has failed so tragically. There are no good answers here, but one thing is for sure: There is nothing more our soldiers can do to bring peace to the streets of Baghdad or any other part of Iraq. If anything, our continued presence is aggravating an already combustible situation, which, in fact, we created. We created this situation with our invasion in the first place. Madam Speaker, it is time for Iraqis to defend Iraq, and it is time for American troops to come home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 2768, the S-MINER Act. The health and safety of miners is too important to ignore or to delay, and it is vitally important that we act now, not tomorrow, not in another year, to pass this critical legislation. 
   I want to commend Chairman Miller for putting together comprehensive legislation that actually tackles the problems plaguing mining for many, many years. 
   With this legislation, we can prevent the appalling loss of life that we have had in the past couple of years at Sago, at Darby, at Aracoma, and most recently at Crandall Canyon in Utah. 
   Since the year 2006, about 80 miners have been killed at their workplaces. And that is in the 21st century. Don't forget, this is the 21st century. 
   Now it is true that working conditions for miners have improved over the years, and we have come a long ways since the turn of the last century when thousands of miners died every year. But miners, who provide a valuable service to this country at great danger to themselves, are still dying as a result of incidents that were preventable had everyone been following the law. 
   And black lung, a disease we thought had pretty much been eradicated, is back with a vengeance. This is absolutely unacceptable. 
   I have heard on numerous occasions that miners love their jobs. So our job for them is to keep them as healthy and safe as possible so they will return home every night to their families at the end of the working day and that they will return safe and healthy. 
   The Subcommittee on Workforce Protection, which I chair, had a hearing on this legislation in July. And the S-MINER Act actually puts teeth in the MINER Act which Congress passed in 2006. Let me mention a few provisions which I think highlight why this legislation is so very important. 
   For example, while we know that true wireless communications systems are not yet fully developed, technologies do exist that greatly improve communications between miners below ground with those on the surface. The MINER Act requires that wireless communications systems be installed, but not until the year 2009. Miners can't wait until 2009. And the S-MINER Act mandates that miners have communication capabilities now instead of having to go without until the most perfect system has been developed. 
   One of the things that is so outrageous, as I said, in this day and age is that black lung is back, a disease everyone thought was eradicated. This legislation, the S-MINER Act, requires the use by each miner of a personal dust monitor so that exposure to coal dust can be cut in half. And because the committee recognizes it could be a burden for mine operators to provide this equipment to their employees, the manager's amendment authorizes $30 million for MSHA to pay for those devices. 
   In addition, the Crandall Canyon disaster showed us once again that retreat mining is a perilous activity, and this legislation requires MSHA to closely review these plans. 
   Another thing the families of miners told us was that miners were afraid to come forward to report safety and health violations. So this legislation provides for a miner ombudsman to be appointed to process complaints and assist whistleblowers with their cases. 
   And finally, this legislation requires that physicians be created at MSHA to be in charge of communicating with families and the community while a rescue effort is going on. 
   In developing this legislation, we have done our utmost to reach out across the aisle and to all interest groups, including industry, to come up with a bipartisan bill. 
   While industry does not support this bill, and shame on them, many of their concerns are reflected in the current legislation and in Mr. Miller's manager's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is the 21st century and we must have 21st century solutions to adequately protect miners in this country. Vote for the S-MINER Act.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (SCOOTER LIBBY CONVICTION -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, last week brought news of the conviction on four counts of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to Federal investigators of the Vice President's former Chief of Staff, Scooter Libby. 
   It is easy to forget exactly what this case was about and its precise bearing on the ongoing bloody chaos in Iraq, so I think it is important to refresh our memories. 
   What did Mr. Libby lie about? He lied about his alleged role in blowing the cover of a CIA agent named Valerie Plame Wilson. And why would Scooter Libby or anyone else in the White House even consider doing such a thing? Political retribution, of course. Valerie Wilson's husband, Ambassador Joseph Wilson, had been a public critic of the Bush administration's march to war. He had traveled to Africa at the behest of the CIA and concluded that there was nothing to the President's claim, made in the State of the Union no less, that uranium from Niger was helping Saddam Hussein build a nuclear weapon. 
   Ambassador Wilson dared to question the White House on a critical matter of policy, indeed a matter of war and peace. He dared to suggest that they had taken the Nation to war under false pretenses. So they destroyed his wife's career, and in so doing may have imperiled our national security. 
   Remember, this is the administration that guards information so closely that it considers its secrets sacrosanct, that has lectured others for leaking classified information, but they had no qualms about divulging sensitive information about someone else, someone who uses her undercover status to help protect the Nation. Why did they out her? Because she is married to someone who leveled a legitimate and accurate criticism at the White House. 
   It just goes to show, Mr. Speaker, they were willing to stop at absolutely nothing to discredit anyone who undermined their case for war, a case that was based on exaggeration at best, and outright lies at worst. 
   After the Libby verdict was rendered, a former national chairman of the Republican Party tried to pooh-pooh the matter by telling the USA Today, and I quote him, ``When you get down to it, it was one case involving one guy.'' 
   Similarly, the Washington Post concluded its editorial by saying that the Wilson-Plame case and Mr. Libby's conviction tells us nothing about the war in Iraq. I couldn't possibly disagree more. Mr. Libby wasn't lying about whether he revealed Valerie Wilson's favorite color. Mr. Libby's conduct was part of a campaign of deceit intended to shut down any and all objections to the war. And why did they need a campaign of deceit? Because there was no legitimate reasonable cause for war without the specter of weapons of mass destruction, without the disgraceful scare tactic of warning that we don't want, and they said this, the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud. 
   It is the responsibility of Congress now to delve even deeper into the manipulation of pre-war intelligence. I am eager to hear Mrs. Wilson's testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Friday, and I hope this is just one of many such inquiries. 
   Even as we are currently immersed in a debate right here in the House about how to end our occupation of Iraq, it is critical that we hold people to account for the mistakes and the misdeeds that launched this disastrous war and cost 3,200 Americans their lives. 
   Justice was done in the case of Mr. Libby, but I hope when it comes to Iraq we can bring about justice in a broader sense, by restoring Iraq's sovereignty and letting its people determine their own future, by becoming a reconstruction partner and not a military occupier in Iraq, by promoting stability in the region instead of being a catalyst for violence, a catalyst for terror, by completing a fully funded withdrawal from Iraq and bringing our troops home at last.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, from the very beginning of the war, which is now an occupation, in Iraq, the Bush administration has not kept faith with our troops. Whether it was sending them into combat without the proper body armor or failing to provide wounded veterans with proper care at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, this administration has turned its back on our brave men and women time and time again. 
   Another example of this outrageous mistreatment is the Pentagon's ``stop loss'' policy. A very disturbing article about ``stop loss'' appeared 3 days ago in the Chicago Tribune. Actually, it should be required reading for every single Member of this House. The article says: 
   ``As the United States moves into its 5th year in Iraq and escalates troop levels there, the Pentagon has kept combat units manned by forcing as many as 80,000 soldiers to stay in uniform in war zones even after their enlistment obligations have been met or their retirement dates have passed. 
   ``The policy, known as ``stop loss'' ..... has sparked ..... a spate of lawsuits and in backlash in the ranks. 
   `` ..... The vast majority of troops find that stop loss means one thing: Instead of beginning new lives in the civilian world, they are headed back to Iraq for their second, third, or even fourth combat tour, a practice critics say amounts to nothing less than an involuntary draft. 
   `` ..... Suzanne Miller, a Jacksonville lawyer whose son expects to be stop-lossed this summer, said, `I like ..... to call it indentured servitude ..... you have no control over your own destiny and are being forced, under threat of prison, to work for an employer you no longer want to work for.' '' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to stop mistreating our troops and the families who wait so patiently for their return.  We need bold action to bring our troops home. 
   Last month this House had the opportunity to take such bold action. We had a bill before us that would have fully funded a safe withdrawal of our troops and defense contractors starting within 90 days. This bill also would have provided for the social and economic reconstruction of Iraq so that the Iraqi people could look to their future with hope. And it would have supported diplomatic efforts and multinational efforts to restore security in Iraq. That plan of action made sense. 
   But instead of taking bold action, the Congress took the same old action and gave the President every single thing he wanted in the supplemental spending bill. There is no timetable for withdrawal, and the President doesn't even have to hold the Iraqi government accountable for failing to meet the benchmarks in the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, every third grader in America is being held accountable for meeting his or her reading and math benchmarks under No Child Left Behind. We are demanding more from our 8-year-olds than the Iraqi government. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people didn't send us here to go all wobbly in the knees and weak in the stomach when the moment of truth arrived. They sent us here to stand up to the President to end this war, and that is what we must do. 
   So let us begin to restore the good name of the Congress by overturning the original authority for the war. Congress didn't authorize this President to use U.S. troops to police a civil war, which is what Iraq has come to. 
   From here on, there must be one benchmark and one benchmark only. The orderly, fully funded, and fully protected withdrawal of our troops. They have done their duty. Now it is our time to do our duty for them.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. Everyone deserves access to the best possible opportunities, which include a college education. No student should be denied a college education because he or she can't afford it. That's why we must continue to find ways to increase student access to financial aid to ensure that students and their families have every possible opportunity to acquire a college education. 
   We can't let the current credit crisis limit any student's opportunities to receive a college education. This bill would give the Secretary of Education the tools to help schools in need find a lender and give students access to the money they need to attend school. To keep America competitive in the global market, we must continue to ensure that every student receives access to the best possible college education. 
   This bill serves as a preventative measure and goes a long way towards averting any possible crisis in July or August when our Nation's students and their families are looking for ways to pay for the next school year. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5715.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S MIDDLE EAST POLICIES -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to bring to the House's attention a potentially, very dangerous new turn in the administration's policies in the Middle East. In recent weeks the administration has been stirring up the pot on Iran again, and that has caused many Americans to worry that the administration is getting ready to launch another attack in the region, this time in Tehran. 
   In fact, there's more than enough evidence to show that the administration may be laying the groundwork for military action. In an interview last month, the President said that the Iranians, and I quote him, he said, ``the Iranians have declared they want to have a nuclear weapon to destroy people.'' 
   That would be troubling, Madam Speaker, if it were true. But the Iranians haven't said anything of the kind. It is shocking to me that our Commander-in-Chief would make unsubstantiated and misleading statements about a subject as important and as serious as nuclear weapons. 
   Another troubling sign came last month when Admiral William Fallon retired. Admiral Fallon was a bulwark against the Iran hawks in the administration, and his departure raised fears that he was, first, forced to retire, and that next, the rush to war was on. 
   And several weeks ago, Vice President Cheney said that he has ``high confidence'' that the Iranians have an ongoing nuclear enrichment program. Of course, the most recent national intelligence estimate reported that the Iranians stopped working on a suspected nuclear weapons program 4 years ago. 
   And finally, General Petraeus told Congress last week that Iranian-backed special groups now pose the greatest long-term threat in Iraq. 
   For years, the administration told us that the main enemy was al Qaeda or Sunni insurgents, or Shiite militia. Now they tell us, forget them; it's Iran. In my mind, this raises legitimate concerns that the administration may be inventing new excuses to stay in Iraq by trying to convince the American people to support war against Iran. 
   Madam Speaker, I too am concerned about Iran. The Iranians should stay out of Iraq. They should not develop nuclear weapons. No country should develop nuclear weapons. But if we want Iran to behave well, we must stop threatening to attack them. Instead, our first line of defense must be engagement and aggressive diplomacy. 
   The absolutely essential first step in that process must be the redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. How can we expect Iraq's neighbors to cooperate in stabilizing the region while we insist on an open-ended foreign occupation with 140,000 troops and tens of thousands of military contractors? 
   Ending the occupation will allow us to launch a broad initiative to bring the nations in the region to the table, to address the relevant, the political, the economic and the security issues. 
   And Madam Speaker, when it comes to Iran's nuclear challenge, we must retake the high moral ground in the United States of America. When we turn our backs on nuclear nonproliferation, abandon the comprehensive test ban treaty and develop new nuclear weapons of our own, under what circumstances can we tell another nation to abandon their nuclear dreams? 
   The American people do not want a wider conflict in the Middle East. They want our leaders to spend every waking moment working to bring peace to the region. This is not the time for heated rhetoric, for bullying and new threats. It is time to try the one thing we haven't tried, diplomacy.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE ADMINISTRATION HAS LEFT THE HOMELAND VULNERABLE TO ATTACK -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, for a long time now, we've been waiting for the administration to make an announcement about troop withdrawals from Iraq. Well the big day came last week, and it went over like a lead balloon. The President said that he is going to leave troop levels basically steady. 
   Mr. Speaker, the administration's decision to ``stay the course'' in Iraq is absolutely unacceptable. The American people know that invading Iraq was a mistake in the first place. And they want to bring all of our troops out, not just token forces. 
   The President said that he can withdraw a handful of troops without the surge because the surge has been a success. But when he leaves office, troop levels will actually be higher than it was before the surge. That leads me to ask a simple question. If the surge has been so successful, why do we need more troops after the surge than before it? 
   The President also said that normal life is returning to Iraq. Try telling that to the 4 million Iraqis who are still refugees and not able to return. Half of them are children. 
   The President also told us that civilian deaths are down. Try telling that to the relatives of the 1,200 civilians who were killed in Iraq this summer. 
   And what is an acceptable number of civilian deaths? This summer, an average of 13 Iraqi civilians were killed every day. If that happens in any State or any city in America, we would call it a crime wave. But if it happens in Iraq, the administration seems to think it's something to celebrate. 
   The administration has also been telling us for a long time that the occupation of Iraq is making America safer. But that claim doesn't hold up, either. The independent and bipartisan Partnership For a Secure America issued a report last week which says that America is still ``dangerously vulnerable to chemical, biological and nuclear attacks.'' It also said that ``the threat of a new, major terrorist attack on the United States is still very real.'' 
   And a joint report issued last week by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Committee on Homeland Security found that the administration has not delivered on a myriad of critical homeland and national security mandates. It is clear, Mr. Speaker, that the administration's single-minded obsession with the occupation of Iraq has left our homeland open to another attack, an attack that could be much worse than 9/11. 
   Today we commemorate the terrible anniversary of that terrible day--not today, last week we did. It is outrageous that after 7 years we can't say that our citizens are safer than they were that day. And the administration's decision to stay the course in Iraq will only continue to make things worse. 
   The only solution is to set a firm timetable for the safe redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. Giving the Iraqi people back their sovereignty will allow us to work with the international community to rebuild that shattered country. Iraq needs electricity, schools, roads, hospitals and water. And America needs to invest in  health care, renewable energy, education and jobs. Those aren't just domestic needs. They are critical parts of our national security. 
   The administration, Mr. Speaker, has tried to solve all of our problems with military force alone. That strategy has been a miserable failure. We cannot bomb or torture our way to victory in the fight against terrorism. We must work to end the poverty and the despair that caused it. The sooner we learn that lesson, the safer America will be.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (MISSION NOT ACCOMPLISHED -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to commemorate an important event in the ongoing occupation of Iraq. On May 1, 2003, 4 years ago today, President Bush, the Commander in Chief, strode across the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln and declared that the United States mission in Iraq was accomplished. 
   Mission accomplished. Mission accomplished? I don't think so. Let's review what has and what has not happened in Iraq since May 1, 2003. 
   American troops were not met in the streets with flowers as welcoming liberators. Instead, they've met with sniper attacks and IEDs. 3,351 American servicemen and women have given their lives, and nearly 25,000, probably more, have returned home seriously wounded. 
   This administration has hidden the caskets of those who have perished, and forced the wounded to rehabilitate in mold-infested, rotting facilities. Are those actions of a grateful Nation? Does this mean mission accomplished? 
   What about the weapons of mass destruction? Where are they? Nobody knows. Even former head of the CIA, George Tenet, is now backing away from his ``slam dunk'' comment. 
   Yellow cake? Aluminum tubes? Al Qaeda ties to Saddam? An ousted CIA agent and a jail term for a senior administration official? It is as if this administration has been living in Alice's world of Wonderland. 
   The mission is yet to be accomplished. An accomplished mission would have brought peace and democracy to the Iraqi people. Neighborhoods would be free, not walled off, and a bomb would not have been set in the Iraqi Parliament building. 
   Estimates range upward from 50,000 Iraqis killed and tens of thousands of refugees fleeing to neighboring countries like Syria. This is not how to promote peace and democracy. 
   Let's see. Thousands, tens of thousands of refugees, and the United States allowed 7 or 8 Iraqi refugees into our country last month. We've made all those refugees happen, and we are doing nothing to help them. 
   It takes a small protection force to go to the market in Baghdad, and the Secretaries of State and Defense must make surprise visits to Iraq because their security might not be insured otherwise. 
   So I have to ask, Mr. Speaker, what mission was accomplished? The destruction of the Iraqi infrastructure? The mass exodus of the educated and wealthy from Iraq? The mission of alienating the United States on the global stage? The rise of hatred in countries who might have been our ally? 
   This is unacceptable, and the American people know it. They sent that message loud. They sent it clear last November, and it echoes unheard in the White House. 
   What is clear, Mr. Speaker, is that this mission is not accomplished. The ultimate mission to be accomplished is to bring our troops home. Then we can say, ``Mission Accomplished.''

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. I want to thank Chairman Payne and Congressman Barbara Lee for bringing this important issue before us today. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise as a cosponsor and in support of H. Res. 272, which celebrates the end of what was one of the most horrific and immoral human rights abuses in history, slavery. 
   The slave trade must be remembered. It has to be remembered for its brutality, for its inhumane cruelty, and for the injustices that it caused millions of families. I say families, because for every one of the more than 12 million Africans forced from his or her homeland, subjected to the Middle Passage, that terrifying journey on slave ships, overwhelmed by disease and left in famine, every one of those folks left a family behind in grief or they were separated by slave traders. These human beings taken from their homeland and stripped of their freedom suffered more than a loss of their humanity and of their families, however; many times they lost their very culture, their language, their religion and their true homeland. 
   It is important to remember that many of those captured in the slave trade did not survive the journey. Indeed, for every 100 slaves who reached the new world, another 40 died in Africa or during the Middle Passage. 
   This resolution, H.R. 272, is important because it recognizes the injustices of the transatlantic slave trade and the historical significance of its abolition. In order to come to terms with slavery and the impression of black Americans in our past, it is also important that we acknowledge not only the historical events of the slave trade and of slavery, but also its legacy, its lasting effects on the lives of every single American. 
   We see even today the long-term consequences of slavery in the persistent inqualities between black and white Americans, the economic disparities, poverty rates, and the discrimination that still lives in our country today. Educating and teaching future generations about the historical wrongs of the slave trade can help because it could help prevent such crimes against humanity in the future, but it will also identify many forms of slavery that still exist, forms that we pretend aren't there. 
   So I urge my colleagues, support H.R. 272.

That is why I am particularly proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, H. Res. 100, a resolution that brings the same kind of commitment to the women and girls of Guatemala. The supporters of H.

   Since the year 2001, 2,000 women and girls have been murdered. We are saying that it's beyond time for the Guatemalan government to stand up against these inexcusable and inhumane acts. They are acts of violence, and they must punish the offenders. We want them to put the resources necessary toward providing for investigations and for DNA testing. 
   Today, with this resolution, this Congress stands up and offers more than our condolences. We offer our support. We stand with the women and the girls of Guatemala, and we pledge to bring safety and justice to them. We want their government to work with us to that end.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (HONORING THE CAREER AND RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF FRANCES E. ALLEN -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Con. Res. 95 honors a pioneer in the world of computing, Dr. Frances Allen, the first woman awarded the A.M. Turing Award by the Association for Computing Machinery, ACM. The Turing Award is widely considered to be the Nobel Prize of computing. By being the first female recipient, Dr. Allen has set the bar as a role model for women everywhere who aspire to a career in math and science. 
   As a scientist at IBM since the early 1960s, Dr. Allen pioneered new technologies which serve as the basis for complex theories which are widely used today throughout the computer industry. She is regarded as a pioneer in the field of optimizing compilers and has developed several programming languages that have advanced the field of computer science. 
   Dr. Allen also helped create one of the first automatic debugging systems, and developed the advanced code-breaking language known as Alpha, which revolutionized how computers talk to each other and make computer programmers more efficient. 
   As computer science was ramping up in the early 1980s, Dr. Allen founded the Parallel Translation Group, the PTRAN, to study compiling for parallel machines. Subsequently, this group was recognized as one of the top research groups in the world dealing with this issue, and as a result, Dr. Allen was the first woman to be recognized as an IBM fellow in 1989. 
   In addition to her outstanding scientific achievement, Dr. Allen has also been an inspirational mentor to younger researchers and a leader within the computing community. 
   With the Nation's information technology workforce suffering from a lack of qualified candidates, it is all the more important, Madam Speaker, that Dr. Allen be recognized as the first female recipient of the A.M. Turing Award to show what women can accomplish. 
   It is certainly telling that women who earn more than half of all undergraduate degrees in this country and make up more than half of the professional workforce represent only 25 percent of all high-tech workers. In fact, the percentage of women graduating with degrees in computer science has fallen from 37 percent of total graduates in 1985 to just 15 percent in 2005. With grim statistics like these, it is clear that we are going to close the gap and ensure that information technology sectors have enough workers only if we get young women into this workplace. And Dr. Allen has done just that. 
   As a member of the Advisory Council of the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, her goal has been to increase the participation of women in all aspects of technology. With her accomplishments in computing, it is clear that Dr. Allen lives up to the goals she sets for others and is a role model for women in science and technology. 
   Madam Speaker, Dr. Frances Allen has succeeded at the highest levels of math and science. It is clear that she deserves recognition for all of the tireless work she has done to promote women's roles in computing. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, not only in congratulating Dr. Allen on her success, but to show that this Congress supports an increased presence of women in science and technology. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IT'S UP TO CONGRESS TO TAKE THE WHEEL -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the President is famous for saying that he is the decider, but earlier this week we found out that when it comes to Iraq the American people want Congress to be the decider. 
   A poll conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 62 percent of the American people say that Congress, and not the White House, should have the final word as to when to bring our troops home. The poll also found that 78 percent of the American people believe that the President is not willing enough to change course in Iraq. Nearly 60 percent favor withdrawal of our troops, and nearly two-thirds believe that the troop surge will not make things better. 
   And perhaps the saddest thing of all about this, Mr. Speaker, is that the great majority of Americans who have served in Iraq, or who have had a close friend or relative serve there, disapprove of the way the occupation has been handled. 
   These findings represent a complete repudiation of the President's policies and leadership, but it also poses a great challenge to Members of Congress. The American people are looking for us to lead. But so far, we've let them down. We haven't done what the American people sent here us here to do: end the occupation and bring the troops home. 
   Yes, it's true that this House voted earlier this month to begin withdrawing our troops within 120 days. That was an important step forward, but it doesn't force the President's hand because there aren't enough votes in this House, yet, to make the bill veto-proof. 
   I know that my colleagues across the aisle are waiting for General Petraeus to issue his report of the surge in September before they decide what to do about Iraq, but I don't know why we're waiting for a report when the report that really matters has already been issued, the National Intelligence Estimate, which we received last week. 
   It showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that al Qaeda is the greatest threat to America, and it is operating out of Pakistan, not Iraq. By getting caught in the crossfire of a civil war in Iraq, we have been fighting the wrong enemy in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
   But despite all logic, the administration keeps digging us in even deeper. The press is reporting today that the American command in Iraq has developed a new plan that will keep us fighting and dying there for years more, and at least 2 years more. 
   This is the worst possible action to take, Mr. Speaker, because it sends the message that our involvement is open-ended. It says to the Iraqi government, you don't have to lift a finger to take responsibility for your country's security because Americans will do the job for you. 
   Six-and-a-half years later, this administration has pursued an arrogant, go-it-alone foreign policy. It told our allies and the rest of the world to get lost. So it's not surprising that it wants Congress to get lost, too. 
   But we are a coequal branch. We have a clear mandate from the American people. The American people are telling us, the President is driving us over the cliff. So it's up to the Congress to take the wheel. 
   Our duty is clear, Mr. Speaker. We must act now to put our country and the world on a better and safer course. We must bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE FUTURE FOR CONGRESS AND IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, today is a very solemn day for our Nation. The House just voted to pass a bill that will continue to fund the ongoing occupation of Iraq. I know all too well how my colleagues anguished over their decision, but we must be clear what this vote means. 
   The supplemental, the largest in the history of our country, will pay for the President's escalation, an escalation that he calls a surge that we voted against just a few weeks ago. 
   It will include benchmarks and requirements that the administration can waive with the bat of an eye; and, most importantly, it could keep our troops on the ground for another year and a half at least. 
   Let's remember that the public did not elect Democrats to bring our troops home in 2008. They elected us to bring them home now. 
   I am truly and sincerely sad to say that as we debate the future of our troops, our troops are being targeted by terrorists, are being wounded by IEDs, and the most tragic and heart-breaking part of all, they are dying, and they are killing. 
   The American public knows the simple truth, Mr. Speaker: You can't be against the occupation and vote for this supplemental of at least $100 billion. The Democrats were elected in November because the American people want us, are expecting us, and are demanding of us that we bring our troops home as soon as possible. They do not trust the administration to do the right thing. They want us to hold the administration accountable. 
   We must stand up to an administration that has lied to get us into this war and will keep lying to keep us in it. It is sad when a Nation cannot trust its Commander in Chief to put the lives of the troops above his political legacy. But in that position, a Congress must take real and enforceable steps to bring an end to the occupation. 
   I have come to this spot over 195 times to speak about the unmitigated disaster that is Iraq. This is my moral obligation and that of our country. 
   To those who are watching and wondering about the future of our Iraq policy, I say: I will not stop, I will not rest, and I will not back down in my fight until every single last soldier and marine is home safe with his or her family. 
   This fight is far from over. Over the next several months, we will revisit this issue many, many times. I will work with my colleagues to make each measure stronger and each measure more effective and to bring our troops home to their families earlier rather than later. It is with their families that they belong. Today will be marked in history. I know that the future of our standing in the world and the future of Iraq depends on us being bold and brave and taking the actions that will bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (MARKING THE END OF THE 4TH YEAR OF THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. First of all, I would like to thank the gentleman from New York for this Special Order and for including me and allowing me to speak once again on this House floor about this war and this occupation of Iraq. 
   On the evening of March 19, 2003, speaking from the Oval Office, the President of the United States started his address to the Nation with these very words, and I quote him. 
   ``My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.'' Here we are, 4 years later, and it's fair to ask, indeed, it's incumbent upon us to ask, have we disarmed Iraq? 
   Well, first off, as we all know, there are no weapons of mass destruction to disarm, so that whole entire premise was flawed. 
   The question we have to ask is have we made Iraq safer? We may have deposed Saddam Hussein, but with insurgents, militias and vigilantes terrorizing Iraqi neighborhoods, some of them with the tacit support of the Iraqi Government, it's impossible to say we have disarmed Iraq or made its people and communities more secure. 
   Have we freed Iraq's people? Well, I can think of at least 60,000 Iraqis for starters who haven't been freed. That's the most conservative estimate of Iraqi civilian deaths over the last 4 years, at least 60,000 killed for the cause of their so-called liberation. 
   Many of those who have escaped death live in fear of it, afraid to go to the market or send their children to school, if there is still a school for them to attend. 
   Too many Iraqis live in communities without electricity, without sewage or basic services. Have we freed them? 
   What about those who are so flush with freedom that they have chosen to flee their own country? I am talking about the 1.5 million-plus Iraqi refugees. Why don't we ask them if they feel free?  
   Have we defended the world from grave danger? Indeed not. One study by the Center for Security Studies at New York University Law School concludes that the rate of fatal Muslim terror attacks worldwide has increased by a factor of seven since the Iraq war began. I repeat, that is seven times as much terrorism since we started this occupation, more people call it a war, but it is really an occupation, because this occupation that they keep telling us is the central front in the war on terror is not getting rid of terror. 
   It's clear our Iraq policy has had a major impact in the war on terrorism. Unfortunately, it appears to be helping the wrong side. 
   So to go back to the President's statement of exactly 4 years ago, it would appear he has accomplished none of these three tasks, tasks he claimed to have begun that night 4 years ago. Iraq is not disarmed, its people are not free, and the world is more dangerous. It was never supposed to get to this point. You remember this was going to be quick, it was going to be painless. We are going to finish these guys off without breaking a sweat, remember. 
   On the very same day that President Bush spoke in front of the Mission Accomplished banner, prominent neoconservative Richard Perle actually published an op ed in a major national newspaper entitled ``Relax, Celebrate Victory.'' The cost? Don't worry, they told us, Iraq oil revenues will cover the entire thing. 
   They fired the top White House economic adviser for daring to suggest that the war had cost as much as $200 billion. What would they have done to him if they had known he was underestimating it by a few hundred billion dollars? 
   We have to ask our colleagues who authorized the President to launch the preemptive strike on Iraq, is this what you voted for, to invade a country that had no weapons of mass destruction, no link to 9/11; to occupy that country for 4 years, helping foster a vicious insurgency and fan the flames of civil war? 
   If you had known these things, and if you had known that it would cost us over 3,200 lives to date, and upwards of $400 billion, uncounted civilian deaths, and between 35,000, as the Pentagon tells us, or over 200,000, as reported by the Veterans Administration, wounded, we have to ask, can you look the American people in the eye and say you would have done the same thing all over again knowing what you know now? 
   If your answer is no, if you believe the war has been a mistake, then it makes absolutely no sense to let it continue any longer, and it makes even less sense to hand the President an additional $100 billion with which to pursue the same disastrous policy. 
   Our troops have done their job. They and their families have sacrificed more than enough. They have been forced to dig for scrap metal in order to armor their vehicles. They have endured substandard care, bureaucratic delays and squalid conditions at Walter Reed Hospital. They have been betrayed by the grievous mistakes of their civilian supervisors and superiors. 
   Support our troops. Bring them home. 
   I have four grandchildren who weren't born 4 years ago. They have never lived in a world unclouded by this shameful, destructive and unnecessary occupation. I fear that if this Congress doesn't act, they will be living with these consequences well into their adult lives. It is for them, for the America they will inherit, that I want this war to end. 
   It's time to act boldly. Americans are crying out for leadership, for their elected representatives to hear their frustrations about Iraq and to move decisively in response. 
   This is a gut-check moment. Do you want it said about the 110th Congress that it failed the test of history, that it continued to send young Americans to kill and be killed on a mission that did nothing to enhance our national security or promote U.S. foreign interests? Do you want it said that we made a tragic mistake; even worse, that we blindly rubber-stamped a failed policy that has ignited a civil war and inspired a new generation of terrorists? 
   The Iraq policy of the last 4 years has proven ruinous and misguided at every turn by any objective measure. As a matter of humanitarian obligation and political accountability, it's time to change course. 
   In the name of national security, fiscal responsibility and basic human decency, we must get our troops out of Iraq and bring them home by the end of this year. Bring them home for the holidays. 
   I thank you again, Mr. Hinchey.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (LACK OF POLITICAL PROGRESS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, last week the New York Times reported that Iraq is falling well short of the political progress they were supposed to have made by now. Still no constitutional reform. Still no local elections. Still no final action on a law governing distribution of oil revenues. Still no reversal of the de-Baathification laws. 
   The Bush administration is now saying that their military escalation needs time to work and that these political goals will not be met until the end of the year. 
   I think it is clear what is going on here. What we have is another tactic by the White House in an attempt to run out the clock until January of 2009 when they can hand over the reins and make Iraq look like someone else's problem. 
   The President has said that the military commitment to Iraq is not open-ended; yet all evidence is to the contrary.     
   The supporters of this war, a group whose numbers are dwindling by the day, tell us the next 6 months are critical. This really is the last chance for success. Time and time again, deadlines are established and not met, but there are no consequences, nor is there accountability. I am of the belief that the Iraqi Government won't get its act together until it is forced to govern on its own, until it is no longer propped up by the presence of more than 150,000 American soldiers. 
   As it is now, as long as we continue with this military occupation, Iraqis have absolutely no incentive to push for democratic reform. As the Times article indicated, the President has waved off these concerns, accusing those of us who want to apply deadlines, pressure of being part of a culture of instant results. 
   Instant results? I am sorry, the President has had 4 years and more than $400 billion to make this work. Besides, it is this administration that assured us we would be greeted as liberators, that democratizing Iraq would be a cinch, that there would be hardly any sacrifice at all. Now that they have turned out to be monumentally wrong, they are wanting to know why we are demanding answers 4 years later. 
   I, for one, am tired of being told to be patient, especially when this body is asked to write another enormous check for this war, especially when my country is becoming a global pariah, especially when we learn that our Iraq policy has increased the threat of terrorism, especially when Americans are dying by the thousands, and those lucky enough to make it home alive  face a mountain of red tape, substandard care, rodent-infested living quarters at Walter Reed. 
   I believe we must move toward a fully funded military withdrawal now, not in August of 2008, not at some future date to be determined by the President. End the occupation and start bringing the troops home so that every last one of them can be out of Iraq and with their families in time for the holidays.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (REPEATING THE MISTAKES OF VIETNAM -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, you have been doing a wonderful job up there today. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today for the 180th time in the last few years to challenge the Congress and the President to end the destructive, violent, senseless military occupation of Iraq. 
   A generation ago, Madam Speaker, Democratic and Republican Presidents alike entangled the Nation in a foolish and unnecessary war. Even after a decade, and thousands upon thousands of American casualties in the jungles of Vietnam, our leaders could not bring themselves to publicly admit what most Americans knew; that the United States was asking its youngest and bravest to risk life and limb on an unwinnable mission. 
   Today, our President is repeating this American tragedy. President Bush said that his goal is to win in Iraq. But he has offered no clear idea of what he means by this or how it is achieved. He just knows he doesn't want to lose. 
   The bipartisan Iraq Study Group concluded that the United States cannot win in Iraq; that the only question is how best to exit. Iraq is mired in a civil war, and even though we helped ignite it, we have very little influence on its outcome. You can't expect American soldiers as brave, as intelligent, and honorable as they are to solve a religious and sectarian conflict that stretches back centuries. 
   Whether we stay or leave, the Iraqis will be the ones to decide their own fate. Yet President Bush is sending 20,000 more American lives into mortal danger, and spending $100 million a day just to avoid the humiliation of admitting that his policy has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning. I think most Americans would prefer the wounding of Presidential pride to the wounding of thousands more of their countrymen and women. 
   That is why I joined my distinguished colleagues, Ms. Waters and Ms. Lee, yesterday in introducing the first comprehensive legislation that will quickly, within a 6-month time frame, end the occupation and bring our troops home. 
   In addition to military withdrawal, the Bring Our Troops Home and Solvency of Iraq Restoration Act would accelerate training of a permanent Iraqi security force during the 6-month transition. It would authorize, only upon the Iraqi government's request, a 2-year U.S. support for an international stabilization force, which would be combined with economic and humanitarian assistance. 
   Our bill would also prohibit the construction of permanent U.S. military bases in the country; ensure Iraqi control over its own oil supplies; and guarantee full health care funding, including mental health, for U.S. veterans of military operations in Iraq and other conflicts. 
   It is not enough to stand up and speak out against the President's new escalation plan. I am concerned not just about the 21,000 soldiers that are already being deployed as an add-on to this occupation, I am losing sleep over the 130,000 who are already there. I want to see them returned, and I want to see them returned safely to their families. It is not just the President's escalation of this policy that is unconscionable, it is the policy itself. 
   That is why our new bill is the answer. That is why it is time to end the occupation now. I fear that in 3 months he will ask for yet another chance to make his plan work and ask more American families to sacrifice. He will tell us once again that he must win. But, really, it will be about saving face, running out the clock until January 2009 when he can make this some other President's problem. 
   Our more than capable young men and women in Iraq have shown great courage, and it is time that our leaders in Washington showed some courage of their own and stopped trying to defend the indefensible. It took a long time to muster that courage in Vietnam. It is time we have that courage here.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I am a proud member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am a member of the Progressive Caucus and the Out of Iraq Caucus, and I have been working to bring our troops home since before we sent them there. 
   Mr. Speaker, the decision to send more brave Americans into the Iraq grinder is an act of staggering arrogance for the President. Nearly two-thirds of our people think this is a deeply flawed, tragically misguided policy. They get it, Mr. Speaker. They can see that more troops won't stop the sectarian violence, because it is our very military presence that ignited this sectarian violence in the first place. 
   The human cost in Iraq has been devastating. By some estimates, several hundred thousand Iraq citizens have died, died for the cause of their own so-called liberation. No wonder a majority of Iraqis want the occupation to end. 
   As the late columnist Molly Ivins put it, ``Iraq is clearly hubris carried to the point of insanity. It is damn hard to convince people you're killing them for their own good.'' 
   I hope that an overwhelming vote in favor of this resolution will compel the President to rethink his Iraq policy. But, if not, this body will have no choice but to take further steps. Ultimately we must do more than send a message. We must send a convoy of military planes to bring our troops home. 
   Together with my colleagues, Congresswomen LEE and WATERS, I have offered a plan to end the war once and for all. Our bill is H.R. 508, the Bring Our Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act. H.R. 508 would complete a fully funded military withdrawal from Iraq within 6 months of enactment, because our military and their families have given enough for this policy that is only increasing the terrorist threat and doing damage to our national security. The bill would accelerate the training of Iraqi Security Forces during that 6-month period. And because Iraq is not yet ready to defend its people against thugs, insurgents and militias, our bill calls for an international stabilization force to help keep the peace in Iraq. But it would stay only for 2 more years and would deploy only at the request of the Iraqi Government. 
   Because we have already poured enough of the people's money down this sinkhole, H.R. 508 would prohibit any further funding to deploy U.S. troops, but would provide the resources for a safe withdrawal of all of our U.S. military personnel and contractors. 
   The proposal would also provide for humanitarian aid and major investments to rebuild Iraq's physical and economic infrastructure, because taking our troops out of Iraq doesn't mean abandoning Iraq.     
   We can and we must go from military occupier to reconstruction partner. 
   Our proposal expressly prohibits the construction of U.S. military bases in Iraq because it is that kind of permanent occupation that fuels the rage and anti-American jihadists in the Middle East. 
   Iraq should belong to the Iraqis, and that includes Iraq's resources. So under the terms of our bill, the United States would forfeit any proprietary claim to Iraqi oil. 
   Finally, H.R. 508 guarantees full health care funding, including mental health benefits, for U.S. veterans in military operations in Iraq and other conflicts. It is the least, the very least, we can do to express our gratitude and repay their sacrifices. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must never, ever forget what war does to bodies, to minds, to families, to communities and to the human soul. The victims of war are not pieces to be moved around on a chess board. They are our fellow citizens in a global village that gets smaller every day. They are our brothers. They are our sisters. They are God's children and have as much right to human dignity as you or I. 
   The one thing I desperately hope we have learned from the Iraq nightmare is that we must find more sensible, humane ways to keep America safe and resolve global conflict because, if we do not, given the kinds of weapons that are available today, I fear that we are putting the entire planet on a path toward destruction. 
   I fear most of all for our children. ``War,'' said Martin Luther King, Jr., ``is a poor chisel to carve out tomorrow.'' Mr. Speaker, tomorrow belongs to our children. So, for their sake, we must find alternatives to war. We must protect America by relying not on our basest impulses, but on the most honorable and humane of American values, our love of freedom, our desire for peace, our capacity for global leadership, and our compassion for the people of the world.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (ADMINISTRATION GETS TWO THUMBS DOWN -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, the holiday movie season usually begins each year around Christmas Day, but this year the holiday movie season has begun early. It began this week, in fact, when the administration premiered its new movie entitled, ``Iraq: The Sequel.'' 
   As you will recall, the first Iraq movie began with the administration warning us about weapons of mass destruction and mushroom clouds. Then we invaded Iraq where we discovered that the weapons of mass destruction didn't exist. But the administration kept coming up with new reasons to keep the occupation going. 
   The American people gave this first Iraq two thumbs down, but that hasn't discouraged our leaders in the White House. They have been busy writing the same exact script for ``Iraq: The Sequel,'' which is all about Iran. 
   In this movie, the administration warns us about Iranian weapons of mass destruction, in this case a nuclear weapons program. Then it gives us new visions of mushroom clouds by warning us about World War III. Then we discover, as we did last week, that the nuclear weapons program does not exist. In fact, it was suspended back in 2003. But the administration continues to come up with new reasons to keep the crisis going. 
   Yesterday we were told that Iran was dangerous, Iran is dangerous, Iran will be dangerous. So the administration's drumbeat for war in general, and against Iran in particular, goes on. Before we go back to the dark days, Madam Speaker, the dark days of shock and awe, I have a few questions to ask. 
   First, why did it take 4 long years to discover the truth about the Iranian nuclear weapons program? Was this another example of intelligence being manipulated for political purposes? 
   Why did the administration warn us in October that Iranian nuclear weapons could start World War III when the Director of National Intelligence went to the White House in August to say that Iran's nuclear weapons system ``may be suspended''? 
   There is nothing, nothing more reckless and irresponsible than to terrify the world about World War III when there is no basis for it. 
   Why did the administration continue to use threatening language yesterday? Yesterday, when the truth was already known. Instead of looking for opportunities for peace, this administration continues to look for ways to keep tensions as high as possible. 
   My last question, Madam Speaker, is why does the administration seem so intent on wrecking America's credibility? By doing so, this administration has made the world a much more dangerous place and has undercut our own national security. We are like the boy who cries wolf. No one will believe what we say now, and that means we cannot lead the world effectively against terrorism and towards peace. 
   The movies of ``Iraq'' and ``Iraq: The Sequel'' have both bombed. We need a new plot, a plot that begins with responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq, which would be the essential, responsible first step. 
   When we do that, we can begin to bring together all the parties in the region that have a stake in keeping a lid on violence and reducing tensions. We must change course because that is the only way to regain the moral leadership. And we must reshape events, and we must reshape them in ways that are favorable to the United States and to peace around the world.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, we were reminded about just how fragile our waterways are when a ship ran into the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and spilled 58,000 gallons of oil into the San Francisco Bay. The spill spread and soiled the pristine beaches of Marin County, in my district. It also threatened the Point Reyes seashore and restoration projects in Richardson Bay and San Pablo Bay. 
   Thousands of volunteers, including many of my constituents, spent countless hours cleaning up. Fishermen volunteered their boats and their time to help with clean up efforts. Without their help, the cleanup efforts would have taken much longer, more birds could have died, and more of the oil would have been unrecoverable. 
   Unfortunately, not enough training sessions were offered and many potential volunteers were turned away from helping with the clean up efforts because they lacked the necessary training. We need to learn from this and provide more training opportunities and better utilize potential volunteers. 
   As we move forward, we must also look into new technologies to prevent spills and protect water and beaches. In Marin County, booms across Bolinas Lagoon and Drakes Estero failed and left these areas vulnerable to oil spill contamination. We need to ensure that we have enough equipment to respond quickly and effectively, especially for areas somewhat distant from spill mobilization centers. We also need to ensure that we have enough people trained to handle this equipment and manage the response efforts at these sites. 
   Thank you, Speaker Pelosi and Representative Tauscher for your leadership on this resolution. Thank you to my constituents and to all the volunteers who assisted with clean up efforts.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 597, to reauthorize the Postage Stamp for Breast Cancer. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women and the leading cause of cancer death among women under the age of 40. Research is key to improving breast cancer prevention, detection and treatment. In the 9 years the stamp has been sold, it's raised more than $40 million to fund breast cancer research around the country. In those nine years, great strides have been made, but we can do more and that's why we should support the extension of the breast cancer stamp. 
   In addition to this important legislation, we need to do more to prevent breast cancer deaths in women under the age of 40. Approximately 11,000 women under the age of 40 will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, of which nearly 1 ,300 will die. However, most research, education, and prevention efforts are focused upon women over the age of 45. That's why I introduced the Annie Fox Act, H.R. 715, named after a young woman in my district who was diagnosed with breast cancer and died at the age of35. This bill will authorize research into the causes of breast cancer in younger women and educate them about the risks of breast cancer. 
   It is important that we not only continue to fund research and education over the ages of 45, but that we also do so for our younger women so that they may live long, healthy lives. I applaud the passage of this important legislation and look forward to working with my colleagues to pass H.R. 715, the Annie Fox Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, it has been said that we will all be judged by how we treat the least among us. Nowhere is that more true than in Iraq. 
   Two international headlines tell us of the devastation that is now Iraq. The first: ``Silent Victims: What Will Become of Iraq's Children?'' 
   And the second: ``World Ignoring Iraqi Refugees.'' 
   These headlines from CNN and the BBC, respectively, tell of the Iraqi victims of the occupation. While our brave men and women in uniform have done so much to try to improve the lives of average Iraqi families, the policies of the Bush administration have failed them and failed the Iraqi families in this regard. 
   A recently released report from the U.N. found that nearly two million people have been displaced by the occupation of Iraq. Many of these refugees are seeking homes within Jordan and Syria. The report estimates that a quarter of these refugees are children, children who lack education opportunities and a normal, safe childhood. 
   It seems like the so-called mission is far from being accomplished. Iraqis are begging to leave Iraq's violence and instability. Thousands upon thousands of applications for residency in the United States have been denied, even for those who served alongside our troops as translators and as guides. 
   Four years ago the President promised an Iraq flourishing under a stable democracy. When children are afraid to go to school and parents are fearful of even taking a trip to the local market, President Bush's promise adds up to a total failure. 
   One child, a fourth grader, who was profiled in the CNN piece said: ``They killed me father and uncle in front of my eyes.'' He was unable to continue because he broke down and he sobbed. This is the legacy that we are leaving for Iraq's future generation. 
   It is clear that our presence in Iraq is bringing more violence and more instability. Our presence may have given rise to a strong and deadly terrorist movement within the Iraqi civil war. Let's be honest. It is well past time to bring our troops home and let the Iraqi people regain their sovereignty. 
   Let me be clear: we must not withdraw our support of the Iraqi people. We should be investing in the political, fiscal, and social infrastructure of Iraq. We must help to provide for the most basic needs, including education, electricity, drinkable water, sanitation, and security. In the now famous words: ``Mr. President, you broke it, you buy it.'' 
   My colleagues, it is time to bring our troops home. It is time to restore hope for the Iraqi people. It is the very least that we can do.

   I rise in support of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act. My district is just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, Marin and Sonoma Counties. We've been leaders in bringing environmental education into schools for quite some time now. These wonderful educators have done this through programs like the School Garden Projects and the Students and Teachers Restoring a Watershed, the STRAW project. These programs have given children hands-on opportunities to learn about the environment, and it's given teachers an opportunity to integrate other subjects; they integrate math and science and writing so students see real world applications in what they are learning. 
   This bill will help States. It will help them expand efforts to promote environmental education in our Nation's schools, and to promote efforts to teach our children to be good stewards of the Earth, and, in turn, they teach their parents, quite often. 
   Environmental education is a great way to tie together all the important subjects and lessons for growing up, while also teaching students about the environment, how to play a key role in preserving it for our future, for their future and for their children's future. 
   As we look for the best ways to prepare our children for the future, we cannot forget that the best education teaches the whole child.     
   Children must continue to have access to all subjects, including environmental education. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, let me say you look wonderful up there in that chair. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about the forgotten victims of this war: the children and the legacy we leave them. 
   Today, I placed a pair of baby-sized shoes on my front office door. They were presented to me by the pro-peace organization Code Pink. These tiny shoes symbolize the passing of one of the tens of thousands of Iraqis who have been killed over the past 4 years. Her name is Aisha al Tarish, and she was 2 years old. 
   But these shoes also symbolize the children here in the United States who will grow up without a parent because he or she died while fighting so bravely in our Armed Forces. 
   What too many are ignoring in this debate is the toll that this occupation of Iraq is taking on children here at home, in Iraq, and around the world. In fact, my 7-year-old grandson recently asked his dad, he said, Daddy, what do the children in Iraq do when bombs are going off? 
   How do you answer that? My son said, I think you ought to talk that over with your grandma, Teddy. 
   Why are we ignoring the legacy of fear of death and of insecurity? So many children are growing up in a world that has been at war since they were born. They can't feel secure. In fact, just going to school for an Iraqi child every day is a risk. And that is the risk that Teddy pointed out to us. 
   I know, as a grandmother, this is not the world I envisioned for my grandchildren and for their children to come. It seems like President Bush is pushing forth in Iraq absolutely despite opposition from every corner because he wants to protect his standing in the world. 
   What legacy are we leaving for the world's children? Our presence in the region is leaving a legacy of occupation and hate. 
   An administration that refuses to negotiate and refuses diplomacy gives rise to a legacy of war and the very terrorism we want to defeat, and one of the saddest legacies of all, a generation of veterans and their families without medical care, without mental health care, without jobs and businesses to return to, without homes. 
   This is not the legacy this country was built upon. It is not the legacy I intend to leave for our children. 
   The only answer to this is stop this misguided occupation. If we really want to offer a future of hope to the children of America and the children of Iraq, we must bring our troops home now. We must help the Iraqis. We must help them establish a working infrastructure, and we must help them establish a security force. We must fully fund our commitment to our veterans. 
   This month I introduced H.R. 508, the Bring the Troops Home from Iraq and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act. This is a real and comprehensive plan to accomplish these goals, to provide a safe and secure future for the youngest victims of this war. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill, to send the message that we will stand up for the troops, we will stand up for those victims and those voices who have been ignored for too long: the children.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (H.R. 5925, RECONCILIATION FOR IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, there is an old saying: Everybody complains about the weather, but no one ever does anything about it. That is pretty much what we are doing in Iraq. 
   In testimony before Congress and from press conference to press conference, administration officials have said that the most important item on our agenda for Iraq, right after security, is reconciliation. In fact, U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said before the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee that reconciliation is perhaps the most critical challenge that Iraq faces right now. Even the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel of recognized leaders in foreign policy and governing, wrote that: National reconciliation is essential to reduce further violence and maintain the unity of Iraq. And its report recommended that diplomats work to energize countries to support national political reconciliation in Iraq. 
   But this is not just the goal of the United States, Madam Speaker. The Iraqis themselves are calling for reconciliation. Before a meeting of the United Nations, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said, and I quote him, he said, ``Reconciliation lays the foundation for political, social, economic progress, and the security that we strive for.'' 
   This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue, Madam Speaker. It isn't a Sunni or a Shia or Kurd issue. It isn't an American or Iraqi issue. Reconciliation is an issue that has something to do with all of us. It is the pathway for stability and peace in Iraq, and it is the pathway throughout the region. 
   One news agency has dedicated itself to providing real resources, training, and assistance for reconciliation in Iraq. Since the year 2004, the United States Institute of Peace, the USIP, has been working in Iraq at the national and local level building peace  community by community and neighborhood by neighborhood. USIP has focused on preventing sectarian violence at the local level, developing leaders in schools, universities, government, and civil society, promoting the rule of law, engaging women in public life, and increasing regional stability. All this with a tiny staff, only three USIP staff members and eight Iraqi staffers. 
   Despite the scarcity of resources, 120 Iraqis have been trained to be reconciliation facilitators. They will go into communities to help to work towards real solutions, making neighborhoods safer, promoting transparency and accountability, and so much more. The work they do is amazing and it is awe inspiring. 
   Sadly, the resources available are meager in comparison to what we are spending to wage war. That is why it is time to bring our troops and private contractors home, to give Iraq back to the Iraqi people. And that is why I, along with my colleague from Connecticut, Christopher Shays, introduced H.R. 5925, International Partnership for Reconciliation in Iraq Act of 2008. This legislation will ensure that USIP will have the funding and support it needs to continue and to expand. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to do something: Cosponsor the bill, H.R. 5925, so that we can work with the Iraqi people, so we can work within the international community, and we can reconcile that area. I urge you to cosponsor H.R. 5925. Enough talking about the problem. It is time to do something.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. I want to thank Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Mica for this piece of legislation because, Madam Chairman, it's going to take a big change in how we do business if our country is going to meet our energy demands for the future. 
   While the Republicans in Congress and President Bush chant ``drill, drill, drill'' to appease, it appears, their big oil buddies, the truth is we can't drill our way out of this problem. What we need is a commonsense solution, solutions like the bill before us today. H.R. 6052 won't solve all of our problems, but it does start the process of getting people to change their habits and get out of their cars by providing them options of transportation that allow them to get to where they're going without driving solo in their cars. 
   It's steps like this that can make a big difference because public transportation is going to play a huge role in solving our energy problems. It will also make a difference in what is going on in our environment. It will help communities not have to build more and more roads, and it will get people where they're going in a very efficient way. 
   Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, to support the expansion of public transportation.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (CONGRESSIONAL WAR POWERS -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Warren Christopher and James Baker released a groundbreaking report on the powers of the Congress and the White House about declaring war. 
   The Constitution is clear that only Congress has the right to declare war. Not only that, but Congress is granted the power of the purse. We in the Congress decide when it's appropriate to enter into armed conflict and then fulfill our commitment by fully funding and protecting our troops. 
   The publication may sound like dry stuff, another commission with another report. But that's not the case. 
   The fact that this report even needed to be written is noteworthy, however. It's noteworthy on its very own. Who would have thought that Members of Congress would need to be reminded of our constitutional duties? But the Baker-Christopher report is absolutely necessary, particularly now, as the administration's drumbeat for war with Iran builds. 
   We have seen over the past years how some have exploited the so-called war on terror to mean war with anyone who does not agree with America. We have heard it before: ``If you're not with us, you're against us.'' Some even question the patriotism of those of us who have spoken up in opposition to some of the misguided policies of the White House, policies over the Iraq occupation, the loss of civil rights and liberties in the name of security, just as an example. 
   Recently, the New Yorker Magazine revealed that the administration sought up to $400 million to fund a major escalation of covert operations against Iran, described in a presidential finding--my colleague was just talking about those--signed by President Bush and designed to destabilize the country's religious leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, you don't need a secret decoder ring to know what that means. How often does a country spend hundreds of millions of dollars to declare peace with another nation? 
   Congress must assert itself. We can't just be waiting around to be ``consulted.'' Consulting, not an open hearing or floor debate, is exactly what got us where we are today. I just don't think that we can sit back and wait for the executive branch to come down here to us and ask our permission. 
   This Congress, and the American people, will not stand for another war. We must strengthen our diplomatic efforts and work at it 24 hours a day. This is not something we can wait until the next administration takes over or until the current one forces our hand. 
   Negotiating with Iran's leaders may not be the ideal situation for some, but for others and most of us know it is the best opportunity that we have. Wouldn't it be nice if we could only talk to our friends? Well, that's not the way it is. We don't need to talk to our friends. We have to talk to those with whom we have differences. We have to talk to our enemies. That's the only way we are going to bring about any kind of disarmament and any kind of nonproliferation because talking to friends won't bring about human rights. It certainly won't bring about regional stability. We must have dialogue with Iran and we must do it now.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, those who support our occupation of Iraq often justify it by saying that there will be a terrible humanitarian crisis if our troops leave. They must have missed the memo about the humanitarian crisis that already exists in Iraq. And they must be blind to the humanitarian crisis that goes on every day right here in America because of the occupation. 
   Last week, the Rand Corporation issued a shocking report which measured the crisis at home. The report found that 300,000 troops who have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or major depression; that's about 20 percent of all the troops who have been deployed. The numbers are truly staggering, but when you add all the family members who are affected, you realize that we will never be able to calculate the full human toll of the Iraq invasion. 
   Mr. Speaker, the study was the first complete analysis of PTSD and depression problems. It should have been conducted by our government, our government, which, by the way, has the greatest responsibility for the care of our veterans, but it wasn't. It was conducted by the Rand Corporation, a private, nonprofit organization. The codirector of the report said one of the reasons that RAND did the study was because the Pentagon didn't, and they wanted to have the numbers. It is outrageous that our own Department of Defense didn't know how many of our veterans were suffering from PTSD and from major depression. How did our government expect to address this health crises if it didn't know the full extent of it? 
   This is another example, Mr. Speaker, of the administration failing our troops. But it's hardly the only example. Over 125,000 veterans of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan are on disability for hearing loss and other hearing problems. One of the chief reasons is the Pentagon's failure to fully anticipate the problem of road-side bombs. The blasts from these bombs cause violent changes in air pressure that can rupture the eardrum and break bones inside the ear. 
   And most tragically, we are learning that the government may be trying to cover up the problem of suicide among veterans. In a trial that opened yesterday, two organizations are suing the Department of Veterans Affairs for failing to provide adequate care to prevent suicides among veterans. An e-mail written by the head of the Mental Health Services for the VA was shown at that very trial. The e-mail referred to approximately 1,000 veterans under the VA's care who attempt suicide every month. And the memo said, ``Shhhh! Is this something we should carefully address ourselves in some order of press release before someone stumbles on it?'' This is incredible. The Veterans Administration is trying to figure out whether to hide the truth from the American people about the extent of the suicide problem among our veterans. What a disgrace. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a solemn duty to care for our veterans, to honor them for their sacrifice, and the best way to honor those who have been injured is to make certain that more aren't injured. That means we must responsibly redeploy our troops out of Iraq. And it means we must get on with the task of helping the people of Iraq to rebuild their lives and their country, and healing the wounds of our veterans right here at home. The administration will not do it. It is up to Congress to do it. 
   We owe it to our veterans, to the American people, to the Iraqi people. And Mr. Speaker, we owe it to ourselves.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (WATER CRISIS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, after the administration promised to bring liberation to the people of Iraq, they have, instead, brought insecurity and despair. 
   Every day a new report emerges about the horrible living conditions in Iraq. One of the latest stories comes from Missan, a predominantly Shia province south of Baghdad. 
   Human rights groups and media reports show that there is a shortage of safe drinking water, and that very shortage may pose a serious health risk. Eight agencies have found that there is a shortage of chemicals for water purification and that many people have been forced to take water directly from the polluted Tigris River. 
   The provincial capital, Amarah, hasn't been able to treat its water supply since early September because they lack the treatment chemicals. 
   This problem, Mr. Speaker, is further complicated by the large number of internally displaced people arriving each and every day. And according to media reports, thousands of refugees have arrived from the central and northern provinces since February 2006, which puts unmitigated pressure on the already strained water system. 
   And according to a U.N. Refugee Agency report, the available water supply only met 60 percent of the needs 1 year ago. It also stated, ``Rural areas rely on drinking water directly from the marshes, water that is highly saline, untreated and often contaminated.'' 
   Recent studies found that only 5 percent of the houses in the province have running water. 60 percent use water pumps, and the rest rely on river water. Is there any wonder why the number of cholera cases are on the rise? 
   But the news reports only say so much. Listen to the local sanitation officials: ``Mains water has not been purified since early September as the chemicals aren't available, and the only truck carrying the material was stolen. 
   ``Families fear cholera will spread to their cities and towns. In Amarah, cases of diarrhea have increased by 30 percent compared to 2 months ago. 
   There hasn't been a proper sanitation system in Missan since before the invasion of 2003. Many districts have poor sanitation facilities, and one can smell the stench of open sewers kilometers away. In some areas of the province, supposedly drinkable water is being mixed with sewage effluent and families have no option but to drink unsafe water. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are spending $2 billion a week in Iraq, and we cannot provide for the most basic needs like safe drinking water. This makes one wonder if the funds are being misdirected, and it makes us wonder if our administration just can't show any leadership on humanitarian projects. It is simply disgraceful. 
   We should help the Iraqi people by giving them back their country, and then we should work with our international partners to help the Iraqis rebuild their physical and economic infrastructure. And we should ensure that the Iraqi people have all they need to survive: clean water, food, electricity, schools, jobs, and a secure future. 
   These life and death problems are not going to be solved at the point of a gun. Putting our brave men and women in uniform on the front lines of a civil war isn't helping. 
   I urge my colleagues to join together to support proposals that bring our troops and military contractors home and rededicate ourselves to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Iraq. 
   It is past time for responsible foreign policy. It is time to bring our troops home now.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Chairwoman, I rise in support of H.R. 3685. 
   Before I came to Congress, I was a human resources executive, and even then, during the 1970s, my company had a policy that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation. It  boggles my mind that it has taken Congress this long to even try to catch up. 
   I acknowledge that today's bill is a good start, but it is just a beginning. Many of my constituents want this legislation to include provisions that were in the original version of the bill and in the amendment that Representative Baldwin will introduce later today. 
   I share the concern that the legislation before us does not protect the transgendered people. Transgendered people are particularly subject to workplace discrimination, and nearly one-half of all transgendered people have reported employment discrimination at some point in their lives. 
   My home State of California is one of a dozen States which already provide this basic liberty, freedom from discrimination based on gender identity. We have done so because we recognize that transgendered people, like all people, deserve protection. 
   Today's bill is not perfect, but please know that today and every day I commit to working with my colleagues to pass this bill and to keep up the fight to expand protection for all peoples.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (GETTING SMART ABOUT IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I have come down to this floor more than 200 times to hold the administration accountable for its actions in Iraq. Since then, we have seen it all, from freedom fries to ``the surge.'' During these dog days of summer, however, we can't relent. We have to join together as never before because this administration is moving in new and even more dangerous directions in foreign policy. Let me give you an example. 
   Several weeks ago, the administration confirmed what I had been saying  for the last 3 or 4 years; namely, that they are determined to maintain tens of thousands of American troops on permanent military bases in Iraq for many decades to come. To support this position, they draw an absurd comparison between the situation in Iraq and the situation in South Korea. South Korea, where U.S. troops have been stationed for more than 50 years. And then White House spokesman Tony Snow said U.S. troops may have to stay in Iraq indefinitely to perform what he called an over-the-horizon support role. Over-the-horizon support role. George Orwell couldn't have said it any better. Call it what it really is, Tony: Occupation. 
   Ever since the administration took us into Iraq, I have tried to get at the heart of what is wrong with this foreign policy, and I believe the answer is this: The administration's foreign policy has failed. It has failed because it sells America short. The administration believes that the only weapon we have to fight terrorism is military power, but by relying on military power alone and ignoring our many other strengths, they have made America much weaker, not stronger. 
   There is another answer: A much different look at diplomacy and foreign policy. First, we must reestablish our moral leadership and regain our standing in the global community by using diplomacy as our first and best resort, and war only as our last resort. President Roosevelt said that the Presidency is preeminently a place of moral leadership, and that is something this administration must learn. 
   Second, we must rebuild our international alliances. We may be a Superpower, but we don't have super powers like Spiderman. So, we need the help of other nations. International cooperation is by far the best way to dismantle terrorist networks, manage globalization, stop the spread of disease and global warming, and fight the poverty that is the breeding ground of terrorism. 
   Third, Mr. Speaker, we must stop using fear as an excuse to justify immoral wars, or as a bludgeon to crush dissent and trash our Constitution. Again, quoting President Roosevelt, the only thing we have to fear, he said, is fear itself. Well, this administration believes that without fear, they can't move their agenda. 
   Fourth, we must end our addiction to foreign oil that pumps billions of dollars into autocratic regimes and props them up. Let's get serious about sustainable energy. And let's export green technology instead of war. 
   Next, we must renew our commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. It is sheer hypocrisy to demand that Iran and North Korea halt their nuclear programs while we talk about developing new nuclear weapons of our very own. 
   And finally, we must take the money we are investing in war and reinvest it in what makes us truly strong: education, health care, jobs, child care, the environment, and nonviolent problem solving. 
   I have offered a national security plan myself which rests on these broad principles. It's called SMART, which stands for Sensible Multilateral American Response to Terrorism. SMART, H. Res. 227, is deadly serious about stopping acts of terrorism. It would beef-up our intelligence capabilities. It would enhance our efforts to cut off financing for terrorist organizations.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE HEALTH OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the World Health Organization released a report that can only be called shocking and appalling. Cholera is on the rise in Iraq and spreading to urban areas like Baghdad and Basrah, and some of the northern provinces as well. 
   As most of you know, cholera is a diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine. People get cholera from drinking water or food contaminated with the cholera bacteria, and it spreads rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. 
   This sounds like a disease of the Third World, not one of a developed and wealthy country, certainly not a country where the United States is propping up the health care system, right? Then why have the confirmed number of cases of cholera risen to more than 2,000? In one week alone, 616 new cases were discovered. The WHO estimates that more than 30,000 people have fallen ill with similar symptoms which may later be confirmed as cholera. 
   This is a shocking epidemic. As a result, the Iraqi Government is considering travel restrictions to limit the spread of this often deadly disease, particularly for children. 
   In a country already crippled by refugees and internally displaced people, the situation grows more severe every single day. Why, as we are spending more than $13 million an hour for the occupation of Iraq, $13 million an hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, can we not join with the international community to provide for the most basic human needs? We are talking clean drinking water and proper sanitation. This is not reinventing the wheel or putting a man on the Moon. 
   Clean water and sanitary conditions, is that too much to ask? I guess it might be for our leader at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, because the administration spews a lot of rhetoric about liberating the Iraqi people. Does that mean crumbling infrastructure, sectarian fighting, a massive refugee crisis, and on top of that, a possible epidemic of cholera? 
   Iraqi families need to start their lives over again. They need their kids to be able to go to school. And they need to start their businesses and reopen them. They want real sovereignty  over their own nation. They want U.S. troops out. 
   Real leadership in Iraq means bringing our troops home and offering humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq. We must join with the international community to provide relief, reconstruction, and reconciliation. This is the only way forward for Iraq. 
   Force and occupation will not rebuild Iraq. It will not provide healthier communities. And most importantly, it will not provide a peaceful future for the people of Iraq. 
   Bring our troops home. Bring hope to our military families at home and the Iraq families yearning for peace.

   Madam Chairman, there has been a concern expressed from some voices in the small business community that title V of this bill will open up small business Federal contracts to be taken advantage of by large corporations and venture capital firms. If this is true, it's obviously a concern, because it would directly cut against the intent of this bill. 
   Can the chairwoman please explain to me the protections in this bill that she believes will prevent large corporations and venture capital firm from abusing the intent of the bill? 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from California for bringing up these concerns. The Small Business Committee is a champion of small business and, as such, has strong protections built into this bill to prevent large corporations and venture capital firms from unfairly benefiting from Federal small business contracts. 
   You will be pleased to know that eligible VCs cannot have more than 500 employees, they cannot be controlled by a large corporation, and they must be based in the United States. In addition, an amendment by Mr. Chabot has been made in order under the rule that will even further strengthen these protections by adding a requirement that no VC can own more than 50 percent of any eligible small business. 
   I am confident that these provisions will protect the intent of this bill and prevent large corporations or venture capital firms from taking advantage of these programs.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (SURGE -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, several months ago the administration announced the so-called ``surge,'' or escalation of troops into Baghdad and the surrounding area. It was claimed by the administration that the escalation of over 2,800 more troops in Iraq was needed to get control of Baghdad and increase the security of the Iraqi people. 
   Just what has been the result of that claim? The exact opposite. Instead of control, we are seeing a surge in violence. We are seeing a surge in bombings and attacks. On one day alone, Wednesday of this past week, 171 Iraqis were killed in a wave of bombings. These were people going about their lives, going to the market, going to work, riding the bus; 171 people. They are not just a number, they are mothers, they are fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, neighbors and, yes, children. 
   The violence and brutality should not be ignored or swept under the rug or become just another statistic. These are people whose lives have been cut short.     
   You have to wonder if anyone in Iraq is safe anymore, especially when a bomber can enter the green zone and the parliament building to bomb the cafeteria. How can we expect Iraqi parents to send their children to school? 
   How could we imagine how much courage it takes just to go to the market around the corner from your home for food? Not to mention the bravery it must take to volunteer to serve as part of the Iraqi security force. 
   Our brave men and women in uniform are doing all they can do to provide security to the Iraqi people. It is not their fault that this security seems to be out of their reach. The fault lies entirely at the desk of one person, the Commander in Chief. 
   He is sending troops back for third and fourth tours of duty, and he has extended those tours by months. How many of those troops were provided sufficient training or body armor? How many are given access to mental health care? And once they make it home, how many were left in the squalor of Walter Reed hospital? This is unacceptable and against everything our country stands for. 
   Poll after poll has found that the Iraqis and the American public want an end to this occupation. Even this Congress has gone on record several times calling for an end to this occupation. 
   The administration seems to be the only one who wants to stay the course, but it is time to face the facts. The mission is not accomplished. We are not winning. More people are dying every single minute and every single hour and every single day we stay in Iraq. 
   I say enough is enough. Bring our troops home. I will not stop, I will not rest and I will not back down in my fight until every last soldier, Marine, airmen and sailor is home safe with his or her family.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, this resolution is sponsored by Representative Matheson from Utah where, just last month, six miners and three rescuers were lost in a mine tragedy at the Crandall Canyon mines. 
   Let me begin by expressing the horror and outrage I felt as I, like millions of other Americans, watched this tragedy unfold last month. First, six miners, working some 1,500 feet underground, were trapped when the mine collapsed. And then three rescuers were killed as they mounted a dangerous operation to rescue their fellow miners. The operation was so dangerous it was actually called off. 
   The Crandall Canyon disaster joins the other mine tragedies that have occurred in the last 2 years. My heart goes out to the families of the lost miners. My heart goes out to the rescuers who were also killed at Crandall Canyon. 
   This tragedy is compounded by the fact that the administration and the mining industry have not taken the necessary steps to stop them. There is a background piece on mine safety actually that has been prepared by the staff of the Education and Labor Committee and is available on the committee Web site. I really hope that Members will access this information. The paper actually provides background on the situation prior to the year 2006, the accidents that year, the enactment of the MINER Act, and the work of the committee so far this year. It also includes a summary of the legislation introduced in June of this year by Chairman Miller, by Chairman Rahall, myself and others that are particularly relevant to the incident in Crandall Canyon. And this piece has some initial thoughts on the lessons of Crandall Canyon. 
   The full committee will be holding a hearing on the Crandall Canyon incident on October 3. Thereafter, the committee will be holding a markup on the legislation on which my subcommittee held a legislative hearing just before the recess. I hope all Members on both sides of the aisle will join us in our effort to bring the mine safety and health laws of this country into the 21st century. 
   But today, we are not here to talk about deficiencies in the laws or in problems with particular mine operators; rather, we're here to honor those whose lives were lost in this tragedy, all those who tried bravely to rescue them, honoring their families and all who lent a helping hand. 
   I know Representative Matheson spent hours at the site and with the families, and I commend him for his hard work and courage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (STOP-LOSS POLICY IS A BREACH OF TRUST -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, for over 5 years, the American people have seen the administration break one promise after another when it comes to Iraq. Now, another promise is being broken. This time, it has to do with the stop-loss policy, a policy that forces soldiers to stay in the military when their unit deploys to Iraq within 90 days of the end of the soldiers' enlistment period. Stop-loss means that troops must continue to serve even when their enlistment period has expired. 
   In January 2007, Secretary of Defense Gates ordered the military services to limit the number of stop-loss troops. For a while, in fact, the order seemed to be working. The number of troops affected by the policy dropped to about 8,500. However, now the number is back up to 11,000, and Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said just last week that the number of stop-loss troops would continue to rise over the next couple of years. 
   Stop-loss soldiers are forced to serve an average of over 6 months more than they signed up for. This creates enormous stress, Madam Speaker, and it also creates great strain on the soldiers and on their families. The multiple deployments that many of our troops face make the hardship even worse. 
   The stop-loss policy is actually a backdoor draft, but it is even worse than that. It is a breach of trust with the men and women who put their lives on the line for our country. They deserve a lot better treatment and a lot more respect than that. 
   The stop-loss policy is causing a great deal of suffering, but our troops and veterans are suffering in many other ways as well. It is easy for some of us to convince ourselves that everything is just hunky-dory with our troops now because Iraq has disappeared from our television screens. But while the conflict may have disappeared from television, it has not disappeared from the lives of our troops and from the lives of their families. 
   Over 300,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Rand Corporation. That is one in five who have served, and an additional 320,000 have sustained head injuries. The great majority of these injuries were sustained in Iraq. 
   Only half of those suffering from depression or post-traumatic stress have sought treatment actually because many fear that it will harm their military careers. And half of those who have received treatment have gotten only ``minimally adequate'' treatment. That, too, is according to Rand. 
   And there was also a very disturbing report in the press today that the Veterans Administration has tested drugs on veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress without telling them about the possible mental side effects. Congress must conduct a full investigation of that report. 
   Most tragically, suicides among members of the Army have been rising steadily during the occupation. In 2007, 150 soldiers committed suicide, Mr. Speaker, compared with 67 in 2004. About a quarter of the deaths occurred in Iraq. And an average of five U.S. soldiers attempted suicide every day in the year 2007. Before the occupation, the number was one per day. 
   However, not everyone is being hurt by the occupation. Some people are doing quite well, thank you, and they've got the money to prove it. Chairman Waxman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has asked the Inspector General of the Department of Defense to investigate ``potentially thousands of criminal cases involving fraudulent contracts in Iraq.'' Hundreds of millions of dollars could be involved.     
   And the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has already reported that millions of dollars in contracts have been wasted. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must hold the administration accountable for every dollar spent in Iraq. We must do everything we can to give our veterans the best possible care. We cannot allow war profiteering to go on while our injured veterans lack the care that they need.

   The first 2 years of the new GI Bill would cost what we spend in 2 days in Iraq. Imagine that. We could provide our veterans with 2 years of the GI Bill for 2 days of what we spend in Iraq. And yet some folks here in the House could not bring themselves to support the provision. All I can say is, what does that say to our brave men and women in uniform? 
   Veterans who have sacrificed for our country deserve to receive our Nation's support. The administration sent them to Iraq, and because they are vigilant and dedicated, very few of us standing here today serving in the U.S. House of Representatives or Senate have sent our sons and daughters over there.     
   We haven't had to watch our kids be killed or wounded. 
   And we must not let our troops down. A prime example of letting them down comes from one of our Nation's top research arms, the National Institute of Mental Health. In a recently released report, the Institute found that the number of suicides among veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan may exceed the combat death toll because of inadequate mental health care. According to the Director of Community Mental Health Centers, hobbled by financial limits, haven't provided enough scientifically sound care, especially in rural areas. 
   We've lost more than 4,000 of our Nation's bravest to deadly attacks in Iraq alone. How can a nation stand by while we lose that many men and women to suicide? It is unbelievable that we would be allowing this to happen. 
   According to a report by the Rand Corporation, soldiers who have been exposed to combat trauma were the most likely to suffer from depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. About 53 percent of soldiers sought treatment during the past year; half of those who received care were judged by Rand researchers to have gotten inadequate treatment. That means about three-quarters of those in need of mental health assistance are going without or are receiving inadequate treatment. Is that how a grateful nation shows its appreciation? 
   Meeting the needs of our returning troops should be how we show our appreciation, and it should be paramount in our fiscal deliberations. But we can go one step further. We can bring our troops home. We can reject the administration's call to send more troops into the theater. Once we fully fund the safe and orderly redeployment of our troops and military contractors, we can focus our efforts on the men and women walking with hidden wounds, the wounds of PTSD. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject a blank check for the administration's endless occupation of Iraq. When the House receives the Senate-passed supplemental, we must oppose any bill that does not truly support our troops. We must oppose any spending that is not dedicated to redeploying our soldiers home to their families. 
   We must bring our troops home. We must end the occupation of Iraq. And we must provide the troops with the care and services they need. We must show them just how much we appreciate their service.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (LISTENING TO THE TROOPS -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, today marks over 1,500 days of the occupation of Iraq. Since that time, over 3,500 brave men and women have given their lives and at least 2,600 have been injured. We have spent nearly half a trillion dollars, but this occupation is about more than just numbers. It is about the lives, both American and Iraqi, that will be changed forever. 
   So many brave men and women heeded the call of the Commander in Chief to rid Iraq of Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction. One could say many of these troops were misled with false or at the very least faulty intelligence. They deserve so much more for their sacrifice and their service. 
   Last month, Santa Rosa Press Democrat, a newspaper in my district, carried a story titled, ``GIs Voice Disillusionment With the War.'' It outlined the frustrations of our troops, some on their first tour, others who have served again and again. 
   One account exemplifies the frustration, and I will read it. ``In 2003, 2004, 100 percent of the soldiers wanted to be here to fight this war,'' said Sergeant First Class David Moore, a self-described ``conservative Texas Republican'' and platoon sergeant who strongly advises an American withdrawal. 
   ``Now,'' he says, ``95 percent of my platoon agrees with me.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is directly from the front. This is not something that has been run through the administration's spin machine. This is the unvarnished truth from the troops in the trenches. 
   One more account comes from Staff Sergeant David Safstrom. According the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, Staff Sergeant Safstrom does not regret his previous tours in Iraq, not even a difficult second stint when two comrades were killed while trying to capture insurgents. He said, ``In Mosul, in 2003, it felt like we were making the city a better place. There was no sectarian violence. Saddam was gone. We were tracking down the bad guys. It felt awesome.'' 
   But now, Mr. Speaker, on this third deployment in Iraq, he is no longer a believer in the mission. The pivotal moment came, he says, this February when soldiers killed a man setting a roadside bomb. When they searched the bomber's body, they found identification showing him to be a sergeant in the Iraqi Army. 
   ``I thought,'' he said, ``'What are we doing here? Why are we still here?''', said Safstrom, a member of Delta Company of the 1st battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division. He had changed his mind. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me be clear, I and every one of my colleagues support the troops. We honor their bravery and we commit to ensuring that they receive all of the promised benefits as a result of their service to our Nation. 
   I believe that the best way we can stand up for our troops is to bring them home. It is past time for a fully funded and safe redeployment. We will not back out of our commitment to the Iraqi people. We will work with them to increase their security forces and to help in reconstruction. 
   But we must face the facts. The situation on the ground may be worse than it ever has been before. Military leaders are conceding that the so-called surge is not working, and it may never. 
   The administration has even said that we needed to look at the situation in Iraq like that of Korea, and we have been there half a century. That is simply not an option. 
   Let's do the right thing. Let's do the sensible thing. Let's bring our troops home. We owe it to them and we owe it to our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the sacrifices of those who have dedicated their lives in defense of our country are an important reminder of the price of freedom. These brave heroes have served this country with distinction, and it is our absolute responsibility to honor them. 
   Memorial Day is an opportunity to reflect on how we must support our troops, which means honoring our responsibility to provide the best protection and support for the men and women who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces. It means honoring our promise to provide lifelong health care and benefits for our veterans when they return home, and it means doing everything we can to bring our troops home from Iraq, out of harm's way. 
   As we reflect on the sacrifices and the accomplishments of our veterans, it's vitally important to reaffirm our support for our troops on Memorial Day. And Memorial Day is an opportunity to commend all who have defended our country and safeguarded the values cherished by every single American. It's a chance to repeat that while we strongly disagree with this administration and its continuing occupation of Iraq, we support our troops. 
   This administration refuses to hear the calls of the vast majority of Americans demanding that we bring the troops home. It continues to believe that the only way forward in Iraq is to spend more money, send more troops for an open-ended debacle. This administration maintains its strategy for delay and denial, refusing to plan for an end to the Iraq occupation, a blank check and no accountability. 
   As the administration stubbornly refuses to accept that we cannot win an occupation, the men and women serving in Iraq are suffering the consequences of these mistakes. Nearly 20 percent of the soldiers returning from Iraq experience some symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, which puts them at significantly higher risk for suicide and drug addictions. More than 34,000 of our servicemembers have been injured in Iraq, and more than 3,400 have been killed. 
   Sending our soldiers back into an increasingly deadly civil war on extended tours with worn-out equipment is not supporting the troops. We cannot let this neglect for our veterans become the hallmark of the occupation. We must strengthen our commitment to our troops. We must provide them with the support they deserve. 
   That's why I've introduced H.R. 508, the Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act, which will end the occupation within 6 months of passage and will provide for full physical and mental health care for all of our Nation's veterans. Our troops deserve no less. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Memorial Day is an opportunity, an opportunity to celebrate the honorable service of those who were in past wars, those who have served in between wars, and those who are serving today. And we can do that by providing our veterans with the support that they need. It's an opportunity on this Memorial Day to support the troops who are in Iraq by demanding that they come home.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, if the President is going to negotiate trade agreements based on the failed NAFTA model, this legislation is the very least that we can do for our workers who lose their jobs because of international trade and globalization. 
   Mr. Speaker, America faces record high trade deficits and plant closings, and it's our laid-off workers who are the casualties. Strengthening trade adjustment assistance, TAA, isn't the  magic pill. It is not the cure-all. It can only be a help by fixing the flawed trade policy. We will do what our workers need, but we owe displaced workers in the meantime, and we owe their communities around the country the chance they need to regain their economic footing with job training, with health care, and they need to know that it's available to them and how to take advantage of these programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the bill will not prevent millions of workers from losing their jobs, it will give them the tools they need and the tools they deserve until they are once again able to compete in the global workforce.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE VIETNAM WAR REDUX -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the first national protest demonstration against the Vietnam War occurred 40 years ago this month. About 100,000 Americans came to Washington in October 1967 to protest that foreign policy disaster. 
   Vietnam was a war of choice. We invaded a country that never attacked us. We sent our troops into the middle of a civil war that had nothing to do with us. We went to war in a country whose culture or history we did not understand. We had no exit strategy. 
   We went to war after Congress authorized the President to do so. We  found out later that the congressional resolution was based on false information supplied by the administration. 
   The Vietnam War divided our people. It led to the deaths of thousands of American troops and countless innocent civilians. It undermined our moral leadership in the world. We went to war alone. We were isolated from our allies. It was a propaganda victory for our enemies. 
   There is more, Mr. Speaker. We propped up an often corrupt government that couldn't figure out how to rule. We kept waiting for South Vietnamese troops to stand up so we could stand down. The Vietnam War squandered our Nation's treasure. It diverted us from solving our own domestic problems. 
   We said the war was all about spreading freedom. But the people of the country we invaded saw it as a foreign occupation. The occupation went on year after year. It passed from one administration to another. Our leaders kept telling us victory was just around the corner if we put more troops in. It devastated the country we were trying to save. It was a political, economic and moral catastrophe for America. 
   That was Vietnam. But it sounds exactly like Iraq. Today we are repeating the same terrible mistakes in Iraq that we made 40 years ago in Vietnam. Some of the Members of this House who support our occupation of Iraq lived through Vietnam. They have had 40 years to think about it. Yet they still miss the point. The doctrine of preemptive war is not suited to America because we are not warmongers. The American people do not believe in shooting first and asking questions later. 
   There is one other mistake we made back then that I hope we won't repeat, but I am afraid we will. The war in Vietnam spread to another country when we bombed Cambodia. Today, there is growing evidence that the administration is getting ready to spread the war in Iraq to another country. That would be Iran. About a week ago, the administration warned that Iran would face serious consequences if it proceeded on its current course. We all wonder what that means. Does it mean another round of shock and awe? Another country for our reckless leaders to bomb? 
   But the administration needs to consider the ``serious consequences'' that America will face if we attack yet another Middle Eastern country. Our occupation of Iraq has produced a fresh new crop of terrorists. Using military force instead of diplomacy to get Iran to act responsibly will certainly do the same. 
   In 1999, Mr. Speaker, when America was involved in Kosovo, the then-Governor of Texas said, and I quote him, ``Victory means exit strategy, and it's important for the President to explain to us what that exit strategy is.'' That Governor of Texas is now in the White House. But he is not following his own advice. 
   The administration has no exit strategy for Iraq. So it is up to Congress to provide one. We must use our power, the power of the purse, to defund the war. Then we must fully fund the safe, orderly and responsible redeployment of our troops' withdrawal and the withdrawal of all military contractors. Then we must launch a vigorous regional and international diplomatic effort to bring peace to Iraq and help it rebuild. 
   A few years ago, the administration called for an initiative to improve Americans' understanding of history. Our leaders in the White House should start by learning the history of Vietnam.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing time for the opposition. 
   There are some major questions, Madam Speaker, to be answered by a bailout package that fails to address the root cause of the financial crisis facing our Nation, one that does little or nothing to secure the underlying problem of mortgage foreclosure and economic suffering that hardworking Americans are facing every single day. 
   Question one: Where is the comprehensive economic stimulus package that will assist 95 percent of the taxpayers, a package that includes unemployment benefits, food stamps, infrastructure investment, and, of course, foreclosure relief? Stability should come from the bottom up; an economic stimulus package that will allow those in foreclosure to pay their mortgages and stay in their homes, bringing value back to the mortgage-backed securities that are clogging the financial system. 
   Question two: Why isn't Wall Street paying for the mess they created? By reinstating a one quarter of 1 percent surcharge on stock trades, we can raise nearly $150 billion a year from those who have actually caused this mess and profited from it also. 
   Finally, question three: With only 3 months left of this current administration, why are we willing to even make available $700 billion to this administration? President Bush and Secretary Paulson have been wrong from the start on just about everything. If you think they will be responsible with this money, think again. 
   I, for one, will be in opposition of this bailout with these major questions unanswered.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, providing our police forces, firefighters, emergency medical service personnel, and public health personnel with the resources they need to effectively confront and overcome the threats posed by terrorism, natural disasters, and other emergencies requires our continued commitment and dedication. Our first responders work tirelessly to protect and aid victims of disasters across our country. It's our responsibility to make sure they have the support necessary to perform their jobs. 
   The dedicated men and women who serve the people of California's 6th District understand the importance of adequate homeland security resources. Each day, ships arrive to dock in ports throughout the Bay Area, commuters travel across the Golden Gate Bridge and the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, and travelers fly all over the world. In order to best utilize the well-trained first responders in my District, we need to enhance the security of the Bay Area's waterways, expand our ability to better prepare for disasters, and improve our ability to mitigate their effects once they occur. 
   In 2004, Congress provided $4.92 billion in grants for port security and our first responders. Since then, the Bush Administration and the last Republican Congress cut funding for these programs every year, despite the fact that the costs of preparing for new homeland security threats have steadily increased. The President has continued to deny the importance of sufficiently funding our first responders by asking for only $2.55 billion for these grant programs this year. 
   We cannot expect local communities to be the first to respond to an emergency unless we give them the resources to do so. Additionally, we cannot assure safe passage for those traveling into our country, nor that the containers transported aboard the airplanes and ships do not conceal weapons of mass destruction unless we provide adequate funds toward improving the safety and security of both our ports and our airlines. 
   Fortunately, the Homeland Security Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 represents an important step in remedying past failures to support our first responders and to strengthen our national security. This bill provides $4.52 billion for first responder and port security grant programs, $1.97 billion above President's request and $863 million above the total these programs received in Fiscal Year 2007. Specifically, it provides $800 million for firefighter assistance grants, $800 million for urban security grants, and $400 million for port facilities and infrastructure security grants. This bill also eliminates the cap on the number of federal airport screeners that the Transportation Security Administration can employ, which will help to improve security at airports nationwide. 
   In addition to funding measures to address our country's most pressing security vulnerabilities, the Homeland Security Appropriations bill also increases funding for our country's Disaster Relief Fund to $1.7 billion in order to assist state and local governments following a declared disaster or emergency and provides $230 million to modernize over 100,000 flood maps used to determine rates for the National Flood Insurance Program. Additionally, this important piece of legislation will require that all homeland security contracts will be awarded in an open, competitive process, ending the Bush Administration's practice of awarding large-scale contacts to companies with political connections to the White House. Furthermore, this bill will make sure that all funds allocated in this bill can only be used for projects that comply with the Davis-Bacon mandate, requiring that federal contractors pay workers no less than the local prevailing wage. 
   Securing our homeland demands a strong partnership between the federal government, state governments, and local communities, and I commend the Democratic leadership and the members of the Appropriations Committee for their diligence in working to strengthen our homeland security. By allocating our country's resources to where they are most needed, we will be able to better prepare for and respond to disasters that that threaten the safety of the American people.

   The Child Labor Protection Act of 2007 is a narrowly drafted, bipartisan bill that increases penalties substantially for violations of child labor protection provisions that actually cause death or serious injury. Although this legislation does not make the imposition of penalties mandatory, it leaves the decision of whether or not to assess penalties up to the Secretary of Labor, and it provides the Department with an additional enforcement tool to address the most serious labor violations.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IN MEMORY OF LT. GEN. WILLIAM E. ODOM -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Lieutenant General William E. Odom, a great American and a true patriot. General Odom passed away last Friday at the age of 75 after a lifetime of service to the Nation. General Odom was a soldier and a scholar. He was a teacher and the author of seven books on history and international relations. He served Presidents of both parties. He was one of our Nation's top experts on military intelligence. He was a great visionary. And he was among the first to correctly and courageously warn that invading Iraq would be folly. 
   I am proud to say that he was a friend. He generously shared his insight and counsel with me, and I found what he told and shared to be invaluable. 
   General Odom was born in Tennessee and graduated from West Point. He received a Ph.D. from Columbia University and became a leading author on the Soviet Union. After teaching at West Point and Columbia, he served in the Carter administration as assistant to the President for national security affairs. Neither a Democrat nor a Republican, he also served in the Reagan administration as director of the National Security Agency. After retiring from the military, he became a professor at Yale University and a senior fellow with the Hudson Institute. 
   General Odom was a patriot in every sense of the word. He served in Vietnam, and his family has continued to serve. His son was wounded in Iraq. But General Odom also understood that true patriotism meant disagreeing with your government's actions when you think they are wrong. 
   He opposed the invasion and occupation of Iraq long before it began when it was not the popular thing to do and long before most of the rest of the country opposed it. His boss in the Carter administration, Mr. Brzezinksi, had this to say of his early opposition to the invasion, ``Among senior military people, (Odom) was probably the first to consider the war in Iraq a misbegotten adventure. He believed that we're just stoking hostility to the United States in that region and developing an opposition that cannot be defeated by military means.'' 
   In September of 2006, I and several of my colleagues in the House invited General Odom to speak at one of a series of ad hoc Congressional hearings and forums hosted by the Progressive Caucus on Iraq. General Odom described how al Qaeda's recruitment efforts had been seriously weakened by our efforts in Afghanistan, but he said that al Qaeda's recruitments soared after the invasion of Iraq. General Odom said, to (Osama bin Laden), the invasion must have been manna from heaven, probably saving his organization.'' I can't think of any more powerful argument against the invasion and continued occupation of Iraq than what he said. 
   General Odom did not just oppose the administration's policy. He offered a real alternative that could both end the conflict in Iraq and lay the foundation for regional peace. He said, ``No effective new strategy can be devised for the United States until it begins withdrawing its forces from Iraq. Withdrawal is the pre-condition for winning support from countries in Europe that have stood aside, and, other major powers including India, China, Japan, and Russia. It will also shock and change attitudes in Iran, Syria, and other countries on Iraq's borders making them more likely to take seriously new U.S. approaches to restoring regional stability.'' 
   Everyone who knew General Odom knew that he was a tireless worker and a straight shooter. He continued to oppose war virtually up until the day that he died. Just 3 days before he passed away, an op-ed article he co-authored on Iran appeared in the Washington Post. The article opposed the drumbeat of war against Iran and offered a policy of diplomacy that can stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. I hope every Member of this House will read that article.  
   General William Odom was a military man who worked hard for peace. If we had listened to him about Iraq in 2002, we could have saved tens of thousands of lives. I hope we will listen to his words now, because they can save many more lives in the future. General Odom was a great inspiration while he was alive, and I know that he will continue to inspire us in the days ahead.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It is really important that Americans hear every side of the budget argument. That is why I am proud to rise today to bring before the House the Congressional Progressive peace and security budget alternative. 
   The peace and security budget balances by the year 2010, which is 2 years ahead of the Democratic budget, 2 years ahead of the Republican substitute, and light years ahead of the administration's budget, a budget that doesn't balance anywhere in a 10-year horizon. 
   This chart, Madam Chairman, shows the Progressive budget, it shows the Congressional House budget, and it shows the President's budget. Very clear, indeed. This is about domestic spending, and we will get to that later. 
   Now, let's look at exactly what happens when we meet our deficit and when we go into balance. 
   This is the Progressive budget. This is the President's budget. Here we are. Here he is. We are light years ahead of the President's budget, and 2 years ahead of the Democratic budget. 
   The peace and security budget cuts defense spending by $108 billion below the President's budget, all the while keeping America safe. Actually, the Congressional Progressive Caucus budget spends $395 billion on defense. That is a lot of money. At the same time, the CPC alternative increases domestic discretionary spending to $483 billion, and this is this chart. Our spending is $89 billion over the President, $58 billion over the Democrats, and if you can believe this, it is $33 billion more than the social justice groups have been asking for. 
   So here you are. We have the President's budget spending on domestic funding, we have the Democrats, and we have the Progressive Caucus. 
   How do we get there? It's not as hard as you may think. You can vest in domestic programs if you aren't spending precious tax dollars on a misguided occupation of another nation. Because of this, we assume an end to the occupation of Iraq by the end of 2007. This will save us hundreds of billions of dollars in the next year alone. 
   We also roll back the Bush tax cuts for the top 1 percent of income earners. That's people who make over $1 million a year. And we target waste, fraud and abuse at the Department of Defense, including savings of $60 billion a year by eliminating and reducing Cold War era relics that are still being produced in this country. With these savings, we are able to put money where it is most needed. 
   The peace and security budget keeps its promise to a strong public education by fully funding No Child Left Behind, title I, which would expand services about $30 billion a year, and it also fully funds our commitment to special education, to IDEA. 
   Our substitute moves us closer to the promise of a universal health care system by putting $75 billion over 5 years into SCHIP to cover all eligible children. 
   We support a leaner, smarter and more effective national security program by investing in emphasizing greater diplomacy and less combat. Our budget makes the veterans health care an entitlement, including mental health services. 
   The progressive budget invests $30 billion a year over 10 years to completely transform our energy policy to ensure that our children and our grandchildren will have clean and renewable energy sources. 
   And, finally, we increase spending for domestic priorities like HIV/AIDS, section 8 housing, and Community Development Block Grants. 
   Madam Chairman, it is time we stand up and challenge what is possible in a Federal budget. The alternative prepared and brought here today by the Congressional Progressive Caucus does that and does it boldly. It puts money where we need it, it cuts programs that have for so long been sacred cows, and it says to our country, we want to take your tax dollars and invest them in the people of this Nation. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would like to bring to the gentleman from Florida's attention that his budget actually cuts Medicare and Medicaid by $250 billion, taking almost $98 billion out of Energy and Commerce and $154 billion out of Ways and Means. 
   And then when he speaks about veterans and what our budget does or does not do in supporting veterans, I would like to remind him that the Progressive Caucus budget makes veterans' health care, including mental health, an entitlement. It no longer throws veterans out there to be debated every year, whether they deserve what we know we have promised them and they more than deserve. 
   At this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California, Hilda Solis, a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Environmental and Hazmat Subcommittee.

   Madam Chairman, this budget, the Progressive Caucus budget, proves without a doubt you can keep our Nation safe while investing needed necessary funds for domestic programs and you can do it and balance the budget at the same time. Our budget balances before the Democratic budget, before the Republican budget, and the President's budget does not ever balance, it appears. 
   We can do that, and at the same time we fully fund title I of No Child Left Behind, our investment and our promise to IDEA. We make veterans health care an entitlement. 
   Madam Chairman, it is time we stand up to the challenge that is possible in a Federal budget. This alternative provides that challenge to the Democrats and Republicans of the House of Representatives. 
   Please vote for this Congressional Progressive budget. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is the 40th anniversary of the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King was one of the world's greatest champions of peace. He said, ``We must find an alternative to war and bloodshed.'' He often quoted President Kennedy, who said, ``Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind.'' 
   Unfortunately, the administration today seems to have a different point of view when it comes to war. Take, for example, President Bush's video conference with our military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan last month. The President told them the following, and I quote: ``I must say, I'm a little envious. If I were slightly younger and not employed here, I think it would be a fantastic experience to be on the front lines in Afghanistan. It must be exciting for you, in some ways romantic, confronting danger.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I am shocked that the Commander-in-Chief believes that war is some sort of romantic adventure. It isn't. War is hell. War, as President Kennedy said, could put an end to all mankind.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (NEW POLLS REGARDING VIEWS OF IRAQI PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, on the fourth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, several new polls looking at the opinions of the Iraqi people were released. It is important that we heed this call and that we listen to their choices, because it has been 4 years. 
   Some frightening stories were illuminated by the new polls. For example, one in four Iraqi adults have had a family relative murdered in the last 3 years, while 23 percent of those living in Baghdad have had a family relative kidnapped in the last 3 years.     
   More than half of Iraqis have a close friend or relative who has been hurt or killed in the current violence. One in six say someone in their own household has been harmed. Eighty-six percent worry about a loved one being hurt, two-thirds worry deeply. Huge numbers limit their daily activities to minimize risk. Seven in 10 report multiple signs of traumatic stress. The number of Iraqis who describe their lives as good has dropped from 71 percent 3 years ago to under 40 percent today. 
   This is shameful, Madam Speaker. Every day the evidence against President Bush's so-called war plan mounts. It makes one wonder if there is even a plan at all. How much of the Bush Iraq policy has been forced on the Iraqi people? How much real involvement have the Iraqi people had in deciding the future of their own country. How are the Bush policies affecting Iraqi families? 
   I voted against the authorization to go to war. And Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues, whether they voted ``yes'' or ``no,'' now is the time to make a change in direction. Let us empower the Iraqi people; let us restore their sovereignty. 
   Last week, I had the opportunity to testify before the Foreign Affairs Committee about my legislation, H.R. 508, the Bring the Troops Home and Restoration of Iraq Sovereignty bill. This bill is a comprehensive proposal. It has 49 cosponsors, and it will end the occupation of Iraq within 6 months of enactment. It will accelerate the training and equipping of Iraqi military and security forces, preparing the Iraqis to take over their own security after U.S. troops and contractors leave at the end of the 6 months. It will fully fund the health care commitment to our returning veterans. It will make veterans health care an entitlement, something they deserve because, for heavens sakes, they have done so much for us. 
   Additionally, the legislation revokes the President's Iraq war powers, it prevents establishment of permanent bases in Iraq, and it returns the oil rights to the Iraqi people. Actually, it gives Iraq back to the Iraqis. 
   Madam Speaker, our most solemn obligation is to the brave and capable men and women who have been placed in harm's way. This legislation, as I said, guarantees physical and mental health care for U.S. veterans of military operations in Iraq and other conflicts. It is the least we can do. It is the very least we can do to show the gratitude of a grateful Nation. 
   H.R. 508 will fulfill our commitment to our Nation's brave troops and to the Iraqi people. The polls here and the polls in Iraq are clear: it is time to bring our troops home. 
   To those who are watching and wondering about the future of our Iraq policy, I say I will not stop, I will not rest, and I will not back down in my fight until every single last soldier and marine is home safe with his or her family.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, when General Petraeus testified before Congress last month, there was a lot of happy talk from the administration about how much improved things had gotten in Iraq. From the way they talked, you would have thought that Iraq had become a sort of paradise, a middle eastern Shangri-La. 
   But now it's back to harsh reality, and yesterday the administration handed us yet another bill for their senseless occupation of Iraq. This time, the tab is $46 billion in supplemental funding. And this is for Iraq as well as Afghanistan. That's on top of the nearly half trillion dollars we have already spent in Iraq. And make no mistake, this isn't the last bill for Iraq that we will be getting. The administration has no exit strategy. Instead, it has a strategy to keep the occupation going for decades. So the bill will keep piling up until our credit cards are absolutely maxed out. To make matters worse, the administration had the gall to hand us this enormous bill just a few weeks after vetoing the SCHIP bill, which they said was too expensive. 
   Let's examine the White House's logic. Our policy in Iraq is a failure while the SCHIP program is a big success. So you would think the administration would want to cut our losses in Iraq and increase our investment in SCHIP. But, no, it's the other way around. The White House has turned into Superman's bizarro world, where everything is the opposite of what it should be. 
   Yesterday, when the administration announced its funding request, the President said, and I quote, ``I often hear that war critics oppose my decisions, but still support the troops. Well, I'll take them at their word, and this is the chance to show that they support the troops.'' 
   Well, a few weeks ago, the administration had a chance to show that it supported the troops, and it blew it. The SCHIP bill that was vetoed included the bill that I sponsored, H.R. 3481, the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act. This bill amends the Family Medical Leave Act to allow family members of a soldier wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan or any other conflict to take up to 6 months leave from work to care for that soldier. 
   This change in the Family Medical Leave Act is desperately needed by the families of our brave troops. The Dole-Shalala Commission reported that 21 percent of active duty soldiers, 15 percent of reservists and 24 percent of retired or separated soldiers have had family members or friends give up their jobs to care for them while they recovered from their wounds. And 33 percent of active duty soldiers, 22 percent of reservists and 37 percent of retired or separated soldiers have had a family member or close friend relocate, relocate for extended periods of time to care for them while they were in the hospital. So extending the Family Medical Leave Act benefits would help many military families when they actually need the help the most. That's why my bill has been endorsed by the Military Officers Association of America, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, the National Military Family Association, and the National Partnership for Women and Families. 
   The administration's veto of SCHIP was a slap in the face, not only to the children that will not be covered, but to all of these fine organizations. 
   Let's support our wounded troops and their families and let's support our courageous troops in the field in Iraq by rejecting this administration's request for supplemental funding, but, instead, fully funding the safe, orderly and timely redeployment of all of our troops and of all of our military contractors. That way we will be supporting the troops in Iraq. 
   This is what Congress must do. This is what the American people want. And if we fail to do it, we will have failed the American people and our troops.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IRAQ NUMBER 250 -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, this is a moment that I had hoped would never come. I am rising for the 250th time to oppose the occupation of Iraq. It's a sad task, because 250 times means that the occupation has dragged on and on nearly 5 years. 
   I had hoped that my first speech would be my last, or my 50th or even my 100th, but the administration continued to follow its blind and destructive path year after year. As the saying goes, ``All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good people do nothing.'' 
   So, to be sure, I have raised my voice time and time again on this floor to protest the administration's folly and hold it accountable for its reckless actions and its reckless policies. 
   The American people have raised their voices, also, Mr. Speaker. They have said that they want an end to this occupation and a responsible redeployment of our troops. But our leaders in the White House, who first turned a deaf ear to the people of the world when they invaded Iraq, continue to turn a deaf ear to their very own people in the United States of America. 
   What makes this occasion even sadder for me is that I will have to rise many more times before the occupation ends because the administration has made it absolutely clear that it will continue its occupation right to the bitter end of its term in office. 
   And I fear that the occupation may go on long after that. A leading Republican Presidential candidate said that he has no problem with the occupation lasting 100 years. No problem. And this same candidate said the other day, and  I quote, ``There's going to be other wars.'' This is exactly the kind of ``shoot-first, ask-questions-later'' thinking that got us into trouble in Iraq in the first place. 
   Fortunately, the Democratic Presidential candidates have a different mindset, a mindset that uses diplomacy and international cooperation to solve problems, not war. But the current administration is working hard to tie the hands of the very next President. It's negotiating to establish permanent bases in Iraq. And it is planning to keep troop levels absolutely as high as possible. 
   Remember all the sweet talk, Mr. Speaker, last September about possible troop cuts? It was an absolute sham. And what are we getting for the tragedy of Iraq? Are we any safer? Absolutely not. In fact, the director of National Intelligence has warned that al Qaeda is getting stronger in its cozy safe haven in Pakistan, and that they are busy training more and more operatives. 
   A whole new generation is growing up in occupied Iraq. Their memories begin after U.S. forces rolled in. Since electricity and water and basic services have been on the fritz. Since whole neighborhoods have become wandering refugees. Many have never known the cultural gems of their own country. This cannot bode well for the region. 
   Secretary of State Rice has admitted that the Taliban is resurgent in Afghanistan. And the report of the Congressional Commission on the National Guard and Reserves found that there is an ``appalling gap'' in our ability to defend the homeland because of Guard and Reserve redeployments to Iraq. 
   Meanwhile, we are squandering $12 billion per month on the occupation while our economy slides into recession and the American people face the loss of their jobs, their health care, and their homes. Let's be clear, Mr. Speaker, the main reason we are in this recession is because of the senseless and unending occupation of Iraq. 
   And our brave men and women in uniform, what about them? They're paying a very high price for this occupation. Every day, five U.S. soldiers try to commit suicide because the frequency of deployment has put tremendous stress on them and their families. This is simply unacceptable and a national disgrace if we do not act to reverse this trend. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be back on this floor talking about this some more, but this is my 250th time, and I want you to know, it's time that this occupation be over.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (PEACE MARCH ON THE MALL -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, this weekend there was an extraordinary event right outside these windows. I come to the floor this evening to celebrate the hundreds of thousands of people who gathered on the Mall this Saturday because they have had enough of this immoral occupation in Iraq. 
   Groups like Code Pink, United for Peace and Justice, Win Without War, and Peace Action did an exceptional job of organizing the march and rallying their members. We were fortunate to have many celebrity activists in attendance, as well as several Members of the Congress. 
   But what made the event successful was the energy and the passion in the crowd. It was a testament to the power of the grassroots. 
   Hundreds of thousands, from the stage as far as the eye could see, packed on the mall, standing together to send a powerful message that Americans want to bring our troops home from Iraq. 
   Hundreds of thousands standing together to say that 4 years of bloodshed is enough, that over 3,050 lost American lives is over 3,050 too many for a war we never should have started in the first place. 
   Hundreds of thousands standing together to register the disgust with the President's Iraq policy, the staggering civilian casualties, the billions upon billions of dollars wasted, human rights abused, our global credibility shattered, terrorists emboldened rather than defeated. 
   Every objective measure we could possibly use leads to the conclusion that what we are doing in Iraq has been a tragic failure. 
   And everyone can see that, Mr. Speaker, except the President, the President of the United States, who is asking us to sacrifice more of our tax dollars and more lives and limbs so he can win in Iraq. 
   You know what they say: The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results. Fortunately, we have an antidote to this insanity. It is not another Iraq study group. It is not another bipartisan committee to debate and deliberate while more people die. It is not a nonbinding resolution. 
   It is comprehensive legislation that would have all of our troops home safely, out of Iraq, and contractors out of Iraq within 6 months. 
   It is H.R. 508, the Bring Our Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act, which I introduced with my colleagues, Congresswomen Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters, earlier this month. 
   But the real authors of this bill, Mr. Speaker, were the hundreds of thousands of people marching on the Mall this Saturday and the millions more Americans who they represent. By offering H.R. 508, we are giving voice to their will. 
   Many of the marchers came back to Congress today to share their views in person. They want their elected representatives to know how strongly they oppose the continuing occupation and how strongly they support H.R. 508, which would fully fund a safe military withdrawal. 
   The President has challenged us to issue a plan. We have, and people gathered on the Mall this weekend showed their support. Enough is enough. 
   In the name of national security, fiscal sanity and common decency, I ask my colleagues, sign on to H.R. 508 and bring our troops home.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, sensible gun laws and reasonable restrictions are fully consistent with the second amendment. That's what the Supreme Court said when it ruled on the D.C. gun ban in June, and that's what this bill, H.R. 6842 does.  
   However, the proposed substitute amendment to this bill undermines commonsense protections in our Nation's Capital, particularly at a time when gun violence threatens our children and their families. 
   By legalizing semi-automatic assault weapons, repealing criminal and mental health restrictions for owning guns, and ending registration requirements for firearms, this amendment jeopardizes the safety of the families who live in Washington, D.C. and those who visit.     
   This substitute goes so far as to eliminate the vision test for owning a gun and repeals D.C.'s safe storage laws preventing D.C. from prohibiting people from storing loaded firearms near children. 
   Allowing people to go out and buy a gun the day after being released from a mental institution is reckless, not responsible; putting the same weapons in the hands that killed 32 students and faculty at Virginia Tech and 13 students and teachers at Columbine is reckless, it is not reasonable; removing the requirement that they register these guns is reckless, it is not reasonable. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this substitute amendment and support the underlying bill because the safety of every person who steps foot in this city depends on it.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, H.R. 7081. By approving this nuclear agreement, an agreement with India, we will permanently and irrevocably undermine decades of nonproliferation efforts. 
   This agreement says that India, but no other country, can live outside the international nuclear control system. It sets a frightening precedent. If a country is unhappy about the rules on nuclear possession, it can simply go around them breaking them. 
   And what does it matter if India ignores international agreements? Any sanctions? Any punishment? No. Just a lucrative deal with the United States of America. 
   If we approve this deal, we lose our moral high ground, Mr. Speaker. Who are we to be telling any other nation to adhere to the rules when we subvert them ourselves? This is not about our relationship with the people of India; this is about a complete obliteration of the nuclear security regime. 
   The Bush administration is demanding we move with haste without looking back. Sound familiar? 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 7081, stand up for national security, stand up for nuclear nonproliferation.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Chairman, over 20,000 people have died from AIDS in the San Francisco-Bay Area, and AIDS continues to be the second leading cause of premature death in our area. In addition, and it is because of improved treatments, because of programs like the Ryan White AIDS program, nearly 23,000 individuals are currently living with HIV/AIDS, more than at any point in the history of the epidemic. Therefore, it is not the right time for the people in the San Francisco-Bay Area to have any cuts in their AIDS/HIV programs, because it is starting to work but it isn't working well enough, including my own county of Marin County north of San Francisco and the county of San Mateo south of San Francisco. Our communities have the third largest cumulative number of AIDS cases in the entire country. 
   This amendment will recklessly and irresponsibly put the lives of many of our constituents at risk. The very idea truly astounds me, the very idea that these lifesaving programs would be cut, that there would even be an offer to cut them while we are spending $10 billion a month to occupy Iraq just is beyond my comprehension. I have to wonder, what are some people thinking about? What are their priorities? I can tell you my priorities are with the health and the well-being of our constituents. 
   Treatments and support programs and systems for HIV/AIDS have come a long way. Now is not the time to pull the rug out from under the programs that are working and to stop supporting those who are living with AIDS and HIV, particularly in the most affected areas such as San Francisco and Newark, New Jersey. Therefore, I urge my colleagues, please oppose this misguided amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (HONORING THE SECTION 60 MOTHERS -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery is a very special place. It holds the graves of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Section 60 also is the place where a group of remarkable women come together on a regular basis. They are the Section 60 mothers, the mothers of the soldiers buried in that hallowed ground. 
   The Section 60 mothers come to mourn their heroic children, and to honor their sacrifice. They also come to give each other support in their time of grief. They look to each other for comfort because the only person who can really understand a mother who has lost a child in war is another mother who has suffered the same loss. 
   Recently, National Public Radio broadcast two stories about the Section 60 mothers. In those stories, the Section 60 mothers talked about their children. They also described how they found each other and created a circle of support to help each other, to help each other make it through another day. 
   Their words are heartbreaking, yet also inspiring, because these mothers are American heroes, just like their children. I'd like to share some of their words with you today. 
   One mother placed flowers, balloons, and cards on her son's tombstone because it was his birthday. She said, ``These are our babies. When they have a birthday, this is what you do for them, and this is what we still do for them.'' 
   Another Section 60 mother, whose son died 2 years ago, said, ``This is my son, and I just cannot believe that he's gone. I don't want him to ever be forgotten. It's just in the last couple of months in fact that I have been able to say, `My son's death,' and even that sends a chill through me.'' 
   Another mother described the impact of her son's death on her family. She said, ``I look at my surviving children, and it's such heartache for me because they're in so much pain, and I can't do anything about it except just love them. I can't take their pain away. It's excruciating.'' This mother's son was killed on May 8, 2005. It was Mother's Day. 
   Another grieving mother said, ``Our job is to protect our kids, and we would do anything to do that. I feel like I should have just jumped across the ocean and known that he was in trouble. It's irrational, but it's a mom.'' 
   A mother whose marine son was killed in Iraq in 2005 talked about how the mothers are supporting each other. She said, ``We talk and we cry about the heartache. Our friendship has just been so incredible and different than any other friendship that I have ever known because our sons are side by side in that same soil.'' 
   Another mother whose son was killed in Iraq in 2005 said, ``When we go to Arlington, sometimes we are holding the crying mother. And sometimes we are the crying mother. You never cry alone at Arlington. It's a refuge for me. You cannot be strong all the time.'' 
   Another mother described the first time she saw another mother in Section 60. She said, ``She was just crying and saying, `Our beautiful boys.' We just started walking toward each other and we were crying so hard.'' 
   A cousin of one of the soldiers told this story about her fallen hero. ``He  always wore a St. Christopher's medal around his neck. When he died, they couldn't find it. But on the day of the funeral, the colonel came up to my aunt and said that they had found the St. Christopher's medal. When his body was thrown back by the blast, the St. Christopher's and his dog tags were in the hole that the bomb was in.'' 
   Finally, one of the new mothers asked another mother if the pain of losing a child in war ever goes away. This mother had to say, ``No.'' 
   Madam Speaker, we owe the Section 60 mothers our deepest respect and gratitude. They remind us that the war isn't something that takes place thousands of miles away. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are happening to our mothers and families right here in our own communities in America every single day. 
   So let us resolve to go to war only as a very last resort. Every possible alternative to war should always be completely exhausted before we send our great men and women into battle. That is the least we can do for them and the mothers they leave behind.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the World Water Day resolution, H.R. 196, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of Congressman Blumenauer's resolution. 
   The district I represent includes Marin and Sonoma Counties just north of San Francisco. My district is very ecologically diverse. In fact, we are putting new life into our wetlands, we are expanding our wetlands. We have wastewater treatment plants that make it possible for us to send our wastewater and use our wastewater to water our grapes, and we have one of the best grape growing counties in the country. 
   In fact, in my very own backyard, my drip system that waters my yard is controlled by satellite because my town of Petaluma is experimenting. They picked 100 houses and asked us, would we let them use our drip systems as an experimental project; and it will indeed save me money and save water, I am sure. Along with that, many of our commercial and recreation activities in my district are focused around water. 
   So even with programs like this throughout our country, throughout the world, we are squandering. We still squander this precious resource called water. 
   World Water Day raises the profile of the issue. It means that we must keep on working, we must keep on paying attention to safe and sustainable water supplies, and we must make safe and sustainable water available without regard to any economic or any political boundaries. 
   Recently, there has been an entirely renewed attention to global warming, and with that, we are paying more attention to our water resources and what we need to do to keep a safe and liveable world, not just for Americans, not just for Petalumans, but for everyone.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (200TH SPECIAL ORDER ON THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 200th time to express my  disgust and dismay with our Nation's policy in Iraq. And I want to thank Bart Ackeocella, who has helped me with my many, many words calling on the President of the United States to bring our troops home. 
   Forty-nine months after this failed Iraq policy was launched, we are still being told, Be patient. Progress is just around the corner. All of our sacrifices will somehow be worth it. But all that amounts to nothing more than desperate spin. And the American people aren't buying it; neither, apparently, are some top military brass. The administration can't find someone to take the job of war czar, a job that would coordinate the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the recruits for the job, retired Marine General Jack Sheehan, told The Washington Post last week that he would rather spare himself the ulcer, saying of the Bush administration, ``The very fundamental issue is they don't know where the hell they're going.'' 
   How can the administration possibly say that Iraq is on the road to freedom and stability when a bomb goes off inside the Green Zone and kills members of the elected Parliament? If it's not safe inside the fortress of the Green Zone, just imagine what it is like in the streets of Baghdad. 
   How can the administration say progress is being made when the Associated Press reports that dozens of Iraqi police officers were demonstrating outside their Baghdad station chanting, ``No, no to America. Get out, occupiers.'' And now American soldiers can look forward to a few more months of trying valiantly, but in vain, to carry out this misguided mission, as the Pentagon has announced that soldiers' 1-year tours will be extended to 15 months. 
   I ask my colleagues who gave the President the authority to invade Iraq 4 1/2 years ago if they weren't surprised that they voted for an occupation with no apparent end in sight. They absolutely didn't intend for our troops to be caught in the middle of a civil war that our very presence as occupiers has inspired. Four and a half years later, over 3,300 Americans who will never make it home to their families, and all at the cost of more than $375 billion to stop Saddam Hussein from using weapons of mass destruction that he didn't have. 
   This week, Americans sent their 2006 tax returns to the IRS, trusting that our government will send that money back to us in the form of services, benefits, stability and security. So what do we tell them? What do we tell the American people about the staggering costs they are being asked to assume for the occupation of Iraq? Can anyone possibly argue that we have somehow gotten a return on this reckless investment? 
   The National Priorities Project has broken down the Iraq financial burden, assuming a total of $456 billion once the latest supplemental is signed by the President. Here is what it boils down to: $4,100 for every American household; $1,500 for every man, woman and child; $275 million a day; $11 million every hour. Look what we could do with that kind of money: $928 million, 3 days in Iraq is enough to build 100 schools or 5,400 affordable housing units, or provide health care for 144,000 children for the length of the Iraq war. 
   And if national security is what you want to redirect the money toward, we could have used Iraq appropriations for more secure posts, for energy independence initiatives, for nuclear nonproliferation programs, for debt relief in the underprivileged areas of the world. We could have invested in real national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have sacrificed more than enough in lives, in treasure, in national stature and credibility for a mistaken ideological pipe dream. 
   It is time for our leaders to hear the frustration of the American people, frustration with this shameful, wasteful, futile policy. It is time to end this occupation. It is time to bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, the American people have been opposed to the occupation of Iraq and they have been demanding the redeployment of our troops for a very long time now, but the word obviously hasn't reached our Nation's leaders. 
   Last Wednesday, the Secretary of Defense asked Congress to appropriate billions of dollars more to continue the occupation of Iraq. He said that American troops will remain in Iraq for years to come with no end in sight. 
   The occupation has already cost nearly half a trillion dollars, and what have we gotten for that investment? Even General Petraeus couldn't say for sure that our involvement in Iraq has made us any safer when he testified before Congress last month. And the National Intelligence Estimate warned us in July that al Qaeda is using the occupation to energize extremists, raise money, and to recruit and indoctrinate operatives for attacks on the U.S. homeland. 
   Madam Speaker, the way to make America truly safer is to end the occupation, restore our moral leadership in the world, and use diplomacy to strengthen the structure and institutions of international cooperation and peace. That's why it is time to tell our leaders in the White House that Congress isn't going to be their friendly neighborhood ATM machine any more. Congress has the power of the purse. We can use it to force the administration to change course. We must refuse to appropriate one more dime for the occupation. Instead, we must fully fund the safe, orderly and responsible redeployment of American troops and military contractors out of Iraq. 
   Redeployment of our troops is the necessary first step on the road to peace. It is clear that Iraq will never stabilize while American troops and the vast unaccountable army of 180,000 American military contractors are there. 
   Our occupation of Iraq prevents Iraqis from finding solutions to their own problems, and it delays the regional and international diplomatic efforts needed to jump-start a true peace process. 
   The administration has said that it plans to redeploy some troops, but this is just a tactic, I believe, to win political favor. The arithmetic proves it. We began this year with 130,000 troops in Iraq. The escalation brought the level to 160,000. Now the administration says it will bring out 30,000 troops so by next summer we will again have 130,000 troops. 
   So, Madam Speaker, we end up with the same number of troops, but the administration calls it a reduction. I call it fuzzy math. President Bush has created a national mathematics panel to study ways to improve math education in America. That is a really good thing, because the President himself needs help with addition and subtraction. 
   Actually, Madam Speaker, the only way to make sure that our troops are out of harm's way is to proceed right now with a full redeployment and end the fantasy that there is a military solution to this quagmire. 
   If we fail to use our power of the purse, if we continue to spend our taxpayer dollars on this occupation instead of ending it, we will have failed politically, we will have failed economically, and we will have failed morally. And we will have failed our brave troops along with all of the American people. It is time to bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (BRING OUR TROOPS HOME AND HELP IRAQ HEAL -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, today I joined Representatives MAXINE WATERS, BARBARA LEE, and ALCEE HASTINGS in hosting a remarkable photo exhibit reception focusing on the appalling refugee situation resulting from the occupation of Iraq. 
   Renowned photographer, Gabriela Bulisova, traveled to Syria to document the plight of the millions of  Iraqis who have been forced from their homes and from their homelands. The photos show the tragic human side of the international refugee crisis, and in the faces of the children, you see confusion and fear. How do you explain to a child why he must leave his home, her friends, his school? How do you explain where her father is, or why his neighborhood is riddled with concrete and burned-out hulls of cars? 
   Nearly 5 million Iraqis have become refugees because of the occupation and civil war ravaging their nation. International relief organizations believe that 2 million of those 5 million refugees have fled their own nations and have sought safe haven in surrounding countries including Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. 
   The photos in the exhibit were taken in Damascus. They are a glimpse into the lives of the all-too-often nameless and faceless. How can we even think about what it means to have 5 million people without a permanent home? It would be the same as if the entire population of the State of Kentucky or Colorado or Minnesota was suddenly evacuated from its State. No homes, no jobs. A detachment from everything we take for granted: income, schooling, access to financial savings, being close to one's family doctor. Some people even lose the very land upon which their homes are built. 
   The United States State Department made a commitment to assist in the voluntary resettlement, but despite a promise to take in 7,000 refugees in fiscal year 2007, only 1,600 were admitted into our country. In the last 6 months, State has only permitted an average of 400 people a month. At this pace, we're going to miss the target by a huge amount again. 
   We owe the Iraqi people more, Mr. Speaker. Certainly more than broken promises and despair. We cannot solely rely on the good graces of Iraq's neighbors or the assistance of the United Nations. This is a problem that we started, and it is our moral obligation to help resolve it.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (COMBUSTIBLE DUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. This past Monday was Workers Memorial Day. Workers Memorial Day is the day when we remember those who have lost their lives or have been injured as a result of unsafe health and safety conditions in the workplace. On Workers Memorial Day we also recommit to the fight for safe working conditions for every single worker in America. 
   So, Madam Chairwoman, it's fitting that today we are considering H.R. 5522, the Worker Protection Against Combustible Dust Explosions and Fires Act, which was introduced by Chairman Miller and Representative Barrow, a bill that requires OSHA to develop a standard for combustible dust. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill, and I want to commend Chairman Miller and Representative Barrow because they introduced it. 
   Like other Members of Congress, I was absolutely shocked and saddened by the combustible dust explosion at the Imperial Sugar Company in Port Wentworth, Georgia, which resulted in 13 deaths and 60 injuries. My heart goes out to the families of those who died, and my hopes and prayers, all of our hopes and prayers are with those workers who were seriously injured. The survivors have a tough road ahead of them. 
   Unfortunately, Madam Chairwoman, this explosion, like so many other workplace incidents that have occurred lately, could have been prevented. That is the most important part of it. It didn't need to happen. Lives were senselessly lost, and more workers remain in critical condition. 
   That is why immediately after the explosion, Chairman Miller and I sent a letter to OSHA demanding that the agency begin work on a standard for combustible dust. Such a standard was recommended not last year, but longer than that ago, a year and a half ago, at least, by the Chemical Safety Board. That is an independent Federal agency charged with investigating chemical accidents. But OSHA has failed to act on this recommendation, and unfortunately, but not surprisingly, OSHA has failed to respond to our letter in a timely manner. 
   So that is why we in Congress need to act, and we need to act now. We must act just as we did when we passed H.R. 2693, the Popcorn Lung Disease Prevention Act. That was legislation that requires OSHA to issue an emergency temporary standard to regulate workers' exposure to diacetyl, a chemical used in butter flavoring for microwave popcorn and other food products, a chemical that was killing and injuring workers. 
   I wish that we could trust OSHA under this administration to do the job that was laid out for them. But we cannot. So that is why I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 5522. Take care of our workers.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (APRIL FOOL'S DAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, today is April the 1st, a day that also goes by the nickname April Fool's Day. For most of us, this is a day of trickery that only comes once a year. For the White House, it is a day that comes all too often. The mistruths, the lies, the deceptions, whatever you want to call them, keep flowing out of the White House and from its cronies. 
   Just the other day, our very own ambassador to Iraq said, and I quote him, ``I think there has to be an honest discussion of the consequences of Iraq.'' An honest discussion. Now? Why didn't the administration do that 5 years ago, I ask you? Just now we need to put on our thinking caps and get serious about Iraq? We are in the sixth year of this occupation, and Ambassador Crocker thinks now is the time to contemplate what is going to happen in Iraq? This is far beyond a day late and a dollar short. They are 5 years late and one-half trillion dollars short. 
   But this never ending April Fool's Day goes on and on. How about these oldies but goodies: 
   In July 2002, then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had a one-word answer for reporters who asked whether Iraq had relationships with al Qaeda terrorists. His answer was, ``Sure.'' 
   Vice President Dick Cheney in August 2002 simply stated, ``There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.'' 
   On January 28, 2003, in his annual State of the Union, the President asserted that the British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. He continued, ``Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.'' 
   The administration, which has racked up one-half trillion dollars in debt, even made the claim that Iraqi oil would pay for the war and that we would be met with cheers and flowers. 
   Remember that old proverb: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. But, you know what? The American people were not fooled by these statements, and this Congress mustn't be fooled, either. That is why 92 Members of this House have sent a clear message to the President. We signed a letter stating that we will not support any more blank checks. In fact, we said we will only support appropriating additional funds for U.S. military operations in Iraq during fiscal year 2008 and beyond for the protection and safe redeployment of our troops out of Iraq before President Bush leaves office. 
   There is absolutely nothing funny about these tricks that the administration has played on this Nation. April Fool's Day ends today. We must not take any more nonsense from the White House, and we must not sign one more blank check.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS, IDEALS, AND HISTORY OF NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, March was the 20th Annual National Women's History Month. That is why I am so pleased to introduce H. Res. 1021, a resolution to recognize and honor this National Women's History Celebration. 
   In America, women were once considered second-class citizens, whose rights were restricted from voting to property ownership, actually. But here we are today; one woman is a major candidate for President of our Nation and another woman is Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
   Sadly, until the late 1970s, women's history wasn't taught in many of our schools, and was almost completely absent in media coverage and cultural celebrations. That is why the Education Task Force of the Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women, which I chaired, initiated a Women's History Week Celebration in 1978. This celebration centered around International Women's History Day. 
   The National Women's History Project, located in my district, was founded in 1980 by many dedicated women who poured their hearts and their ideas into promoting and expanding the weeklong celebration. With the help of several dedicated women, including Mary Ruthsdotter, Molly Murphy MacGregor, Maria Cuevas, Paula Hammett, and Betty Morgan, thousands of schools and communities joined in the commemoration of Women's History Week by bringing specific lessons on women's achievements into the classroom, by staging parades to engage neighborhoods in the celebration. 
   Their hard work, their dedication paid off. The celebration started a national movement. And in 1981, Congress responded to the growing popularity of Women's History Week by making it a national observance and eventually expanding the week to a month in 1987. Imagine what American history lessons would be today without the inclusion of Harriet Tubman's Underground Railroad operation, or Mary Katherine Goddard, who was the first person to print the Declaration of Independence with the names of all the signers included. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in reaffirming our commitment to the celebration of women's history by supporting H. Res. 1021 that will ensure that our grandchildren and our great grandchildren learn and care about women like Amelia Earhart and eventually of course the first woman President. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Waxman, I want to thank Ranking Member Davis, and Chairman Davis for supporting this resolution, as they have continually supported the efforts of all women. Supporting this resolution will make it impossible to study American history without remembering the contributions of women as well. So I thank you all.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (STOP THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ NOW -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, President Bush delivered a speech in Cleveland yesterday in which he said that ``Congress ought to wait.'' That is what he said; Congress ought to wait for  General Petraeus and his report on the surge in September before deciding what to do about Iraq. 
   When I heard that remark, I thought to myself, I wonder what the President would like us to do while we are waiting? Does he think we should take up knitting? Should we empty out our committee rooms and use them for ballroom dancing lessons? Should we have a sign on the door of the House of Representatives that says, ``Gone Fishin' ''? 
   The President's remark was, of course, outrageous. The American people did not send us to Washington to wait and to do nothing. They sent us here to take action, to end the occupation of Iraq, and that is what we must do. 
   We cannot wait, because American troops continue to die. More than 600 have died since the troop surge began last winter. 
   We cannot wait, because at least 13,500 Iraqi civilians have died since the escalation began, and that is according to very conservative estimates. 
   We cannot wait, because the war is costing a staggering $10 billion every single month, more than $60 billion since the escalation began. 
   We cannot wait, because the violence in Iraq is forcing tens of thousands of new refugees to flee their homes every single month. 
   And we cannot wait, because the escalation has only escalated the violence. April, May and June produced more American military deaths than any other 3-month period since the war began in Iraq. 
   Instead of telling the Congress to wait, the administration should be saying to the Iraqi government, stop waiting. Stop waiting, and start working on the political solutions to Iraq's problems. Our troops have done their part, but the Iraqi government has been either unwilling or unable to do its part, and our leaders seem to refuse to hold them accountable. 
   So we cannot allow the administration to sing that old tune, ``See You in September,'' because the American people have made it clear: They want this occupation to end, and since the administration won't do it, then Congress must. 
   The House will consider a troop redeployment bill this week. I introduced a bill, H.R. 508, way back in January when the escalation first began, to end the occupation. H.R. 508 calls for fully funding the safe, orderly and responsible withdrawal and redeployment of our troops within 6 months, and it guarantees full funding for the healthcare needs of our veterans. 
   The bill also includes provisions to help the Iraqi people get back on their feet, maintain stability and prevent a worsening of the civil war. It would accelerate multinational assistance to Iraq for reconstruction and reconciliation in that shattered land. And because our involvement in Iraq has taught us that we must take a new approach to foreign policy, my bill absolutely rejects preemptive war, which clearly doesn't work. Instead, it calls for diplomatic efforts to help Iraq and help its neighbors to achieve political, not military, solutions to regional problems. 
   Mr. Speaker, the administration has abrogated its responsibilities, and Congress has waited in the wings too long. Now it is time for us to take the stage of history and put America on a new and better course. It is past time to bring our troops home.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, every single American, no matter what circumstances he or she comes from, deserves the opportunity to earn a college degree, but this opportunity should not come at the cost of years of crippling financial debt. That's why the time has come for this Congress to ease the education burden by increasing Pell Grants, reducing interest rates and closing the gap between college costs and financial aid. 
   For the fifth time in 6 years, the college system in California raised tuition. In fact, this fall, students at Sonoma State University in my district will be required to pay nearly $3,000 more a year in tuition. That's a 10 percent increase from their current tuition. 
   We need to do better. We need to work with our colleges to keep costs low. We need to invest in financial aid, and today, we are finally doing that. 
   And it's going to cost $18 billion to help this financial aid increase; $18 billion, about the same as 6 weeks of our occupation in Iraq.

   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rahall for his leadership in bringing H.R. 716, the Santa Rosa Urban Water Reuse bill, to the floor. The Santa Rosa Urban Water Reuse bill is a huge step in the right direction for the City of Santa Rosa. It will help the city increase its reuse of wastewater as an alternative to releasing the water into the Russian River, where my district receives the great majority of our drinking water. The project is especially important in a region that remains arid for 6 months of the year and where droughts pose a genuine threat to humans and endangered species. 
   Under the reuse plan, the City of Santa Rosa will use recycled water for landscape irrigation, allowing the city to conserve valuable water for human consumption and for watershed preservation and enhancement. It is essential that we find new ways to reuse wastewater and prevent further discharge into nearby waterways. This project can help the City of Santa Rosa by making great strides in its water reuse program and give the city an opportunity to help endangered species, and at the same time protect the Russian River from further discharge. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of H.R. 1716, the Santa Rosa Urban Water Reuse bill.

   Like my experience, today there are many, many Americans who are working so hard who are earning the minimum wage who are still coming up short. And, Mr. Speaker, the majority of these Americans are women and most of them have children. They put in a full 40-hour work week. They still live below the poverty line.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (SECURITY FOR AMERICANS AT HOME AND ABROAD -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House passed H.R. 1, a bill instituting the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. I am proud that the Speaker made this her first priority. It was an important first step. It was a step to strengthen America's security. 
   Another step we can take to provide security to Americans at home and abroad is to bring our troops home from Iraq. It is what I have been saying for several years now. In fact, this is my 176th 5-minute special order on Iraq. And it is what the American people demanded on November 7. 
   From the very beginning, our presence and continued occupation has brought strong opposition and violence to Iraq. The Vice President promised we would be greeted as liberators, that the troops would be hailed with cheers and flowers. Instead, the sad thing is our troops are being greeted with snipers, with rocket-propelled grenades and with roadside bombs. 
   Tonight, the President will announce an escalation in the occupation. He wants to send over 20,000 more troops to Iraq. In fact, we have learned just today that those troops are already arriving in Baghdad. He wants to put over 20,000 more troops in harm's way. And for what? 
   Tonight, the President will not announce an exit plan. Tonight, the President will not talk about benchmarks. Tonight, what the President will do is support more of the same. This is just ``stay the course.'' Let's call it what it is: an escalation. 
   A majority of Americans support bringing the troops home. In fact, a recent poll showed that a majority of men and women in uniform support an end to this occupation. And yet the President wants more troops and refuses to put forth a plan to end our military presence there. 
   Well, the American people and the Congress have waited long enough, Mr. Speaker, for the Commander in Chief to do his job. So, on Friday, the Progressive Caucus and the Out of Iraq Caucus will host a forum with former  Senator George McGovern and Dr. William Polk on one such plan. This is a unique opportunity for Members to discuss available options. I encourage my colleagues to join us at this forum on Friday, day after tomorrow, at 9:30 in the Cannon caucus room. 
   We know there is no quick solution to put Iraq and the region back together again. But until we start to seriously consider the plans out there, we are stuck with President Bush's escalation and status quo. And you know what? Because I respect the troops and I respect their families so very much, I refuse to ``stay the course.'' 
   So I tell the President: No, no to escalation. I tell the President: No, no to the status quo. And I say: Yes, yes to strengthening our Nation by protecting those who have already given so very much and bringing them home to their families.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Student Relief Act, which over the next five years will cut the student loan interest rate in half for undergraduate students with subsidized loans. And, I take exception to this Republican rhetoric about what the Democrats could have done under Republican domination. 
   Madam Speaker, Since 2001, tuition and fees have increased by 41 percent, after inflation, at four-year public colleges and by 17 percent (after inflation) at four-year private colleges. 
   Now, we have a chance to act; otherwise financial barriers will prevent more than 4 million students from attending a four-year college and more than 2 million from attending any college in the coming decade. 
   That would be a crisis for millions of hard-working families--but it also would be a crisis for our country's ability to compete in the 21st century economy. 
   In his article, ``It's a Flat World, After All,'' Thomas Friedman argues that America's historical economic advantages have disappeared because ``the world is flat, and anyone with smarts; access to Google; and, a cheap wireless laptop can join the innovation fray.'' No matter where they live in the world. 
   This means we must invest more in our most valuable resource--our people--and this bill would do just that. 
   For example, this bill will save the average student borrower who starts at a four-year college in California next year nearly $2,500 over the life of a loan--and will save the same student who starts in 2011 nearly $5,000 over the life of a loan. 
   Those savings are necessary to make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans and in the life of our country as to success over failure. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (BRING OUR TROOPS HOME AND SOVEREIGNTY OF IRAQ RESTORATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I joined with my good friends, distinguished colleagues and fellow Californians, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE and Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS, in introducing landmark legislation that would bring our troops home from Iraq within a 6-month time frame. 
   The Bring Our Troops Home and Sovereignty of Iraq Restoration Act is the first comprehensive legislative proposal to end the military occupation and provide a framework to help bring stability back to Iraq. 
   One week ago, when he addressed the Nation, President Bush demonstrated to the world that he continues to remain blind to the realities on the ground in Iraq. Instead of putting forth a plan that will withdraw our troops, the President is increasing our military presence, escalating the number of troops by over 20,000. What President Bush fails to grasp is that our military presence is only fueling the insurgency, plunging Iraq further into chaos and civil war. 
   Mr. Speaker, the November elections showed just exactly how fed up Americans are with the President's failed Iraq policy. It is time now to honor that mandate. It is now up to the Congress to catch up with the will of the people. 
   During his weekly radio address on Saturday, President Bush challenged those of us who disagree with him to offer a plan of our own. Today, we have taken up his challenge. 
   The Congress has already appropriated funding that will support our troops and keep this occupation going for at least another 6 months, possibly longer. That funding, instead, should be used to finance an aggressive withdrawal plan that brings our troops home to their families; and our bill would do exactly that. 
   Our plan will also withdraw all U.S. troops and military contractors from Iraq within 6 months from date of enactment. 
   It will prohibit any further funding to deploy or continue to deploy U.S. troops in Iraq. The bill does, however, allow for funding to be used as needed to ensure safe withdrawal of all U.S. military personnel and contractors. Funding may also be used for the increased training and equipping of Iraqi and international security forces. 
   Thirdly, it accelerates during the 6-month transition training of a permanent Iraqi security force. 
   And fourth, it authorizes, if requested by the Iraqi government, U.S. support for an international stabilization force. Such a force could be funded for no longer than 2 years and be combined with economic and humanitarian assistance. 
   It guarantees full health care funding, including mental health for U.S. veterans and military operations in Iraq and other conflicts. 
   In addition, Mr. Speaker, the bill would rescind the 2002 congressional authorization for the war in Iraq, prohibit the construction of permanent U.S. military bases in the country, and finally, ensure that the U.S. has no long-term control over Iraqi oil. 
   We believe that the oil in Iraq belongs to the Iraqi people, and we believe that when this oil goes into the world marketplace, the international marketplace, the U.S. will certainly have access to our share. 
   Mr. Speaker, excluding the veterans' benefits, our plan will cost the American people pennies on the dollar compared to continuing the occupation of 2 more years in Iraq. It will save lives, bodies and minds, and it will give Iraq back to the Iraqis. 
   The Bring Our Troops Home and Sovereignty of Iraq Act is an important step in regaining our country's credibility in the region and throughout the world, and it provides the President and Congress with a comprehensive strategy for responding to the majority of Americans who want our troops to come home.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, today we're going to reauthorize Head Start and reaffirm, through this conference report, our commitment to this very, very valuable program. 
   When I came here 15 years ago, I was insisting that my married children make me a grandmother, and they told me it was just none of my business. But since then, I now have five grandchildren among my four families of young adults, and all of my grandchildren go to preschool. And they are lucky because they have working parents who are professionals who can  pick out very good schools for them and make sure, the oldest child is 7 1/2 , and he's the only one in school, he is a second grader, but ensure that when my grandchildren enter grade school, elementary school, that they know what's going on. I mean, I'm telling you, I can't believe it. These kids read, they write, they know their numbers, they know their alphabet, they can play Monopoly, and they aren't even in kindergarten yet. That's what every kid in America deserves, and that's what Head Start does. 
   Head Start evens the playing field so that the fortunate children in my family aren't the only ones that enter elementary school having read books, having understood that you sit down in a classroom, that you have social needs that you have to learn to deal with when you're a young person and you're going to be dealing with other young people in a classroom situation. 
   I feel so fortunate, but I also feel so thankful that in a very bipartisan way, under the chairmanship of Mr. Miller and the good leadership of Mr. McKeon, we were able to pass legislation that will finally bring to this floor a Head Start bill. 
   We need to increase the Head Start funding, of course. We aren't covering every eligible child in the United States, and we must do that over time. It's hard to do when you're spending $1.5 trillion in Iraq. But we must get our priorities in order, and one of our top priorities must be our children. Our children are 25 percent of our population, but guess what? They are 100 percent of our future. 
   We must support programs like Head Start that ensure that our future, when we become really old people and these young people are running our world and running our Congress, they know what they're doing.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is almost the 250th time I have been down on this House floor to talk about Iraq in the last 2 years. I can't remember, so I say almost how many times it's been. 
   During that time, the American people have been demanding two things, that the Congress step up to our responsibility and bring our troops home, and that we take bold steps to face up to the President by using our power, the power of the purse, to hold him accountable for what is going on in Iraq. 
   Today, Speaker Pelosi is leading the House of Representatives in a bold direction. It is the first time so far that we have tied funding to redeployment. Ninety-two Members of the House have written a letter to the President demanding that no more funding for Iraq go forward without it, meaning bringing our troops home and redeployment. 
   This vote also leads to next year's appropriations where we can use the power of the purse and fully fund bringing our troops home in a very responsible and very timely and actually safe way. 
   This bill is not perfect. It is the boldest step yet, however, and we must support it. I would not support it if we were not tying the funding to responsible redeployment. I would not support it unless there was a start date for the President to begin the redeployment of our brave men and women in uniform. This bill is the beginning, but it is a bold beginning. I think we should consider everything that is in it, and then build on that for the future and get our troops home as soon as possible.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. I want to thank Chairman Kildee and Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon, who was the Chair when we were working on this, and Ranking Member Castle for a bipartisan success. We can be proud of ourselves today. 
   Anyone who has been around small children knows that they're sponges for information, they just sop it up if you make it available to them. And it's widely accepted that early childhood education is absolutely critical to their development and directly tied to their success when they get into school, elementary school, and their ongoing future. So getting children in a structured classroom environment earlier in their young lives provides a critical window of opportunity. 
   Head Start provides our Nation's poorest children with a quality start that puts them on a level playing field with others when they start elementary school. No matter where a child comes from or what his or her background is, Head Start provides an equal opportunity to succeed by starting with a quality early childhood education. That's why I'm glad I'm here today as we authorize Head Start, reaffirming our commitment to this valuable program. 
   This bill expands access to Head Start, it improves teacher and classroom quality, and it strengthens the services children and their families receive when they enroll in the program. 
   The administration, however, can and should do better when it comes to funding. Too many eligible children are still denied an opportunity to participate in a Head Start program because there isn't enough funds. Well, if this administration wasn't spending $500 billion in Iraq, we would have the necessary resources to increase funding to allow for program improvement to give every child the Head Start experience and to increase teacher quality and salaries. It just depends on where we put our priorities. 
   Children are 25 percent of our population, Mr. Speaker, but they are 100 percent of our future. We must provide them with the best possible beginning to their lives. So, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues to increase our Nation's commitment to education for all of our children and to ensure that Head Start remains the successful experience that it is.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (TERRIBLE NEW THREATS TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, we have learned in the last few days and weeks about terrible new threats to our national security and the safety of the American people. 
   On August 29, a B-52 bomber accidentally flew six nuclear warheads across the country with a combined power of 60 Hiroshima A-bombs. Imagine the horror, the destructive power of 60 Hiroshima A-bombs flying over the American heartland on a course that took them near Minneapolis, Des Moines, Omaha, Kansas City, St. Louis, Tulsa and Little Rock. 
   Then, on September 16, we learned that American military contractors in Iraq were involved in the shooting deaths of 11 innocent Iraqi civilians in a Baghdad square. 
   Was it a case of American military contractors gone wild? We don't know for sure yet. But it is becoming increasingly clear that the vast army of 180,000 military contractors in Iraq are not being held accountable for their actions and often make things more difficult for our troops in Iraq. A senior U.S. military official told the Washington Post that the incident in Baghdad was ``a nightmare. This is going to hurt us badly. It may be worse than Abu Ghraib.'' 
   And then on September 22, the press reported that Federal prosecutors are investigating charges that the military contractors involved in the Baghdad incident, Blackwater U.S.A., smuggled weapons into Iraq that may have been sold on the black market and ended up in the hands of terrorists. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must take immediate action to improve our security. The accidental flight of A-bombs over our homeland should remind us that America must return to a policy of nuclear nonproliferation. This administration has abandoned our decades-old commitment to nonproliferation, and that has been a terrible mistake. 
   We must also end the occupation of Iraq. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced today that he will try to strengthen the Pentagon's oversight of the contractors. This is a welcome step, but it doesn't solve the real problem. The real problem is that we need military contractors, because our forces are stretched to the limit in Iraq and beyond. The only solution is to end the occupation. 
   In testimony prepared for delivery before Congress today, Secretary Gates asked for additional funds for the occupation. We must tell him no. The occupation is hurting America politically, economically and morally. The American people deserve better. Congress has the power of the purse, and it is the only real tool we have to force the administration to change course. 
   We should not spend another dime to continue the occupation. Instead, we must fully fund the safe, orderly and responsible withdrawal of all of our troops and all of our military contractors by a date certain. That is the best way, Mr. Speaker, for our country to change course and restore the moral leadership that is the true source of our national security.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Chairman Miller, for this bill and for the work you do for all working Americans. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am truly sorry that Mr. McKeon can't support it. But I am proud to be the sponsor of H.R. 2693, the Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Protection Act, which requires OSHA to issue an emergency temporary standard to regulate workers' exposure to diacetyl, a chemical used in butter flavoring for microwave popcorn and other food products. It is a travesty that OSHA has done nothing to regulate this chemical while workers have fallen seriously ill and have actually died. 
   In 1977, Congress passed OSHA to provide every working man and woman in the Nation a safe and healthful workplace. We gave the new agency charged with the administration the full name of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. 
   We also gave them important tools to enforce the provisions of the law. One of the most important functions that OSHA is charged with is to develop health and safety standards. When it was exercised, this function actually saved the lives and health of many, many workers. 
   For example, in 1978, when OSHA's cotton dust standard was adopted, there were 40,000 cases of brown lung disease annually, affecting 12 percent of all textile workers. Because of OSHA, brown lung was virtually eliminated. OSHA's 1978 standard on lead dramatically reduced lead poisoning. 
   Sadly, Mr. Chairman, there are still millions of workers who suffer from injuries and illnesses while working. One of the most grievous examples of this are workers who are contracting popcorn lung disease from exposure to a chemical called diacetyl used in the manufacture of microwave popcorn and other foods. 
   The Workforce Protections Subcommittee held a hearing on OSHA standards in April. We heard from Eric Peoples, a former microwave popcorn worker, who has popcorn lung. Eric is in his thirties. He has a young family. He worked in a microwave popcorn facility in Missouri for less than 2 years. After that, he had to stop work because he had contracted popcorn lung disease. Popcorn lung is an irreversible and life-threatening respiratory disease. Eric has lost 80 percent of his lung capacity, is awaiting a double lung transplant, and faces an early death, all because he was exposed to diacetyl. 
   A standard regulating exposure of diacetyl is currently needed. While OSHA has known about the dangers of the chemical for years, it has failed. It has failed day after day, year after year to act to make this standard an actual reality. In fact, OSHA has done virtually nothing to protect workers against diacetyl. 
   Now there has been at least one or two other reported cases of popcorn lung in consumers. Wayne Watson, a 53-year-old man from Colorado, has been diagnosed with popcorn lung due to his daily consumption of microwave popcorn over a 10-year period. 
   In addition, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that a 6-year-old child, the son of a popcorn plant employee who has popcorn lung, was showing signs of the disease himself. In that case, when the popcorn plant closed, the company told the employees they could help themselves to any of the company's products. The father took home some butter-flavored oil containing diacetyl and used it for frying food. As a result, this 6-year-old child was exposed to the chemical, and it made him sick. 
   These are unintended and unfortunate consequences when OSHA refuses to act to protect workers. 
   This is true, Mr. Chairman, even though the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers' Association, the industry that represents the food flavoring manufacturers, issued a report warning of the dangers to workers from exposure of diacetyl and recommended measures controlling that chemical. 
   OSHA does not seem moved to meaningful action, even though four of the Nation's biggest popcorn makers have recently announced that they are working to remove diacetyl from their products. In my own State of California, CalOSHA is currently working on a standard to regulate diacetyl. 
   There is a whole list of agencies that I will enter into the Record that are supporting the regulation of diacetyl. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, now is the time for this Congress to stand up for the Nation's workers and vote to pass H.R. 2693.  
   The American Industrial Hygiene Association, the American College of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, the AFL-CIO, the United Food and Commercial Workers, the Teamsters, the Bakery and Confectionary Workers, the American Public Health Association and the American Society of Safety Engineers also support H.R. 2693.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment ensures that OSHA can continue to slow-walk a final rulemaking on diacetyl exposure for all workers. Hundreds of workers are exposed to diacetyl, and they've fallen ill with this debilitating lung disease that, as the chairman told you, was equivalent to inhaling acid. Can you imagine what their lungs look like and why at the age of 30 a young father has to have a double lung transplant, and maybe that won't even save his life? 
   The amendment removes the requirement that OSHA complete final rulemaking within 2 years of enactment of this legislation. 
   Under this amendment, the final rule would not be required to be completed until 2 years after NIOSH makes a finding that there's sufficient data to support a recommended exposure limit. NIOSH has already told us that they know this is something that they support and diacetyl should be and must be controlled. If NIOSH is delayed, more workers, including the workers we're talking about today, will be unprotected. 
   While workers in popcorn and flavoring facilities would be protected under the emergency standard, workers in other parts of the food industry where diacetyl is being used would be left unprotected for an indeterminate number of years. Not days, not months, but years. One food manufacturer, for example, recently announced a new line of artificial butter containing diacetyl despite its hazards to workers. Those workers would lose protections because of the Wilson amendment. 
   This interim rule, Mr. Chairman, covers a narrow band of workers, popcorn workers and flavoring facilities. By slow-walking this final rulemaking, as Mr. Wilson's amendment would allow, other workers exposed to diacetyl will continue to get sick. They will continue to die. 
   Vote ``no'' on any further delay to workplace safety rules.

   I rise today in support of this important resolution and in support of free and fair elections. 
   Bangladesh, the world's third most populated Muslim country, must return to the fold of democracy and uphold the most basic human rights--the right to vote. 
   Over the past 2 years, the people of Bangladesh have lived under a state of emergency. As the resolution outlines, the rights of the press have been curtailed and corruption is running rampant. 
   We all know that a nation can only succeed when it heeds the will of the people. Security--both economic and political--cannot be established while citizens are being ignored and repressed. 
   Bangladesh must hold free, fair, credible, peaceful, and transparent elections. I urge support of House Resolution 1402.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Mr. Pallone, and to the other side of the aisle, for bringing this wonderful bill before us, H.R. 758, the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act. 
   Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women and the leading cause of cancer death among women under the age of 40. 
   Marin County, in my district, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, has the highest rate of breast cancer in the United States of America. Marin's rates are approximately 40 percent higher than national average, and about 30 percent higher than the rest of the Bay Area. 
   My constituents are personally involved in our need to increase the funding for research so that we can learn more about what is causing breast cancer and how best to treat it. 
   We must also pass H.R. 758, the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act, so that we can ensure that doctors are the ones making the decisions about medical care, not health insurance companies, not clerks. 
   This bill, H.R. 758, will prohibit drive-through mastectomies. It will ensure that women receive the best possible care. The last thing a patient and her family needs to be dealing with when trying to fight breast cancer is battling with a health insurance company, battling about covering necessary medical treatment. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 758, the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act, to leave the decisions about the medical care of breast cancer patients to doctors and their patients, not health insurance companies.

   Peace will not be brought about by governments and presidents. Peace will only be achieved when people come together to support a common goal--security and prosperity for all. 
   More than any conference or summit, the work of local and international NGOs have brought the region closer to a non-violent resolution to the ongoing crisis. Their work is invaluable.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, the fabric of our lives and the lives of all Americans has been shaped indelibly by the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King had just 39 years to teach our country the way to achieve racial and economic justice through peace and nonviolence. Although his life was short, his legacy--the rich vision of social justice he inspired--is alive and well 40 years after his death. It is with great pride that I take part in this celebration today, to pay homage to his memory. 
   Dr. King was a leader who focused his efforts on improving the lives of the disadvantaged in our society. He knew that we must be forever attentive to the least privileged, for they are the measure--the only measure that matters--of the depth of our compassion and the strength of our laws. 
   We still have much to learn from Dr. King, as the dreams he envisioned for our grandchildren still resonate in today's America: equal opportunity, freedom from oppression, justice for all. The eloquent cadences of his ``I  Have A Dream'' speech left a lasting impression on America, and we cannot afford to forget his words. For Dr. King's dream, his concrete vision for the future, has yet to be realized. I look forward to working with my colleagues in this Congress to further the realization of his goals and his strong vision.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, along with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Congresswoman Maxine Waters, I will be introducing the Bring the Troops Home and Iraqi Sovereignty Restoration Act. 
   This bill fulfills the voters' November 7 mandate to the Congress. It ends the occupation of Iraq and, at the same time, it strengthens the Iraqi government, and it also meets the needs of our returning troops. 
   It will, one, bring our troops home; two, it will expedite the training of Iraqi security forces; and three, if invited by the Iraqis, work with the international community to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure, while four, fully funding the commitment we have made to our returning soldiers for full health care benefits, physical and mental. 
   The situation in Iraq, Mr. Speaker, gets worse every day, and it is clear that we cannot provide security to Iraqis in the middle of a civil war. We need to bring our brave and capable men and women home to safety and to their families, and we need to help the Iraqi people regain their sovereignty. 
   President Bush does not have a plan to bring our troops home. In fact, if anything, he is escalating this occupation with absolutely no end in sight. Our standing in the region and our standing around the world is at an all time low, and this administration has all but given up on diplomacy. 
   We can no longer wait for the Commander-in-Chief to come up with a plan. We are in the fourth year of this occupation. We have waited long enough. That is why I will introduce the Bring the Troops Home and Iraqi Sovereignty Restoration Act tomorrow. 
   Whether my colleagues voted to support the invasion of Iraq or not, they can now unite behind a comprehensive plan, a plan to bring peace and stability to the region. 
   One of the most important elements of this bill is to live up to the promises made to those who have put their lives on the line for this President's fiasco in Iraq. 
   Our most solemn obligation is to the men and women who have been placed in harm's way. To fulfill our obligation, we must bring them home to their families, while, at the same time, guaranteeing physical and mental health care for all U.S. veterans of military operations in Iraq and other conflicts around the world. It is the least we can do. It is the least we can do to show the gratitude of a grateful Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to stand up for our troops, stand up for Iraqi sovereignty. Cosponsor the Bring the Troops Home and Iraqi Sovereignty Restoration Act.

   The American public knows a simple truth: you cannot be against this war and vote for $100 billion to continue it. 
   The Democrats were elected in November because, as recent polls consistently show, the American people want us, are actually expecting us and are demanding of us that we, the Congress, bring our troops home as soon as possible. They do not trust the President to do the right thing. They want us to hold him accountable. The public didn't elect Democrats to bring our troops home in 2008. They elected us to be bold, to bring our troops home now. 
   Let me make myself very clear. I will not stop, I will not rest and I will not back down in my fight until every last American soldier is home safely with their families.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (NO PLAN B IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker and my esteemed colleagues, one of the most grievous blunders in the whole Iraq debacle was the total failure to figure out what we would do after toppling Saddam Hussein. The architects of this war thought that was the whole task. Mission accomplished. 
   There was no plan for how to manage the aftermath. No plan for keeping the peace in a country with deep sectarian divisions, no plan for how to institute democracy in a society with no democratic infrastructure or institutions. Well, now we see history repeating itself, because The Washington Post reported yesterday that the Bush administration and top military commanders apparently have no idea what the next step is if the troop escalation plan fails, which General Petraeus himself believes probably will. 
   The Post reports that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Peter Pace, told a meeting of the Nation's Governors: ``I'm a Marine, and Marines don't talk about failure. They talk about victory.'' 
   Well, confidence is one thing. Single mindedness is another, and, frankly, if the Bush national security team had a better track record of smart decisions and strategic successes, I might be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. But as it turns out, these folks have been wrong, very wrong, throughout most of this occupation. 
   Indeed, when President Bush announced the so-called surge nearly 2 months ago, he essentially conceded that mistakes had been made and not everything his administration has done in Iraq has gone by design. 
   But as yesterday's Post article points out, we are way beyond plan B. This is more like plan D. There have been many times that we have been told the necessary adjustments are being made to achieve victory, whatever that means, in the context of Iraq. 
   But here we are, 4 years into this war, still spinning our wheels and nearly 3,200 Americans dead, and the ones who come home in one piece sent to military hospitals that are in deplorable conditions, often delivering substandard care. How many more chances does the Bush administration get to make things right in Iraq? I say: none. There is only one solution: bring our troops home in short order as soon as logistically and safely as possible.     
   In a way, actually, all the discussion about whether plan A, B, C, D, is, at best, something of a distraction is like arguing about what was the worst part of a root canal. The fact is, the whole Iraq enterprise was fundamentally flawed from the beginning and never should have been launched in the first place. There is not much we can do now to reverse the unforgivable mistake of this Iraq occupation and the unspeakable damages done, but we can do something to ensure it doesn't last a minute longer. We can here in the United States Congress use our Constitutional powers to ensure that not one more family has to lose a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a mother or father for someone else's ideological mess. 
   It is time, Mr. Speaker. It is time for this tragic chapter in American history to finally end. It is time to bring our troops home.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving me this opportunity to talk about the importance of purchasing domestically grown and processed foods for school meals. 
   We all heard the recent reports about toxic products coming from China--everything from food to toothpaste. The last thing we want is to have any of that making its way into our children's school lunches. 
   Already, Congress has approved legislation encouraging schools to ``Buy American.'' This not only supports our farm communities, but also puts locally-grown products on our students' lunch trays. 
   It serves our farmers and producers as much as it serves schoolchildren throughout this country. 
   I am concerned, however, that the Department of Agriculture has failed to follow directives given to them by Congress. 
   This serious problem surfaced again recently. Earlier this year, at a convention hosted by the School Nutrition Association, one prominent school food display marketed products that were not only produced overseas but also processed overseas. 
   Nancy Montanez Johner, the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, and several other Government officials were there. 
   I hope now that they have seen this problem for themselves, the Department will move quickly to take immediate action to correct it, and stop purchasing foreign agricultural products for use in the School Lunch Program. 
   The Department should be promoting products from our U.S. farmers and producers. The Buy American provision should not be some secret Government provision buried low in the small type. 
   Chairwoman Delauro assured me she would work with me on this important issue.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. I would like to thank the chairman for the time and for this legislation that is bipartisan. 
   When Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act nearly two decades ago, we did so to ensure that persons with disabilities can learn, work, and live their lives just like everyone else. People with disabilities just want the same opportunities as everyone else. And if their disabilities can be reasonably accommodated, we must make it possible and make sure that they are given the chance to do so. 
   By saying that people with disabilities who use medication or prosthetics to manage their disabilities are no longer considered disabled under the ADA Act, the courts have prevented many with disabilities from receiving the protections Congress intended for them. 
   H.R. 3195, the ADA Amendments Act, would ensure that the ADA protects all people with disabilities from workplace discrimination by clarifying the definition of discrimination. This bill further clarifies that individuals who are able to manage their disabilities enough to participate in major life activities, like holding a job, should still be entitled to protections from discrimination. 
   The ADA was passed to ensure that all people with disabilities have equal access and opportunities, and it's time that we bring back its original intent. Today we can do that. It's a matter of doing what is right. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3195, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008.

The United States then is responsible to work internationally to help Iraq rebuild its country, invest in its infrastructure, invest in its economy, invest in its education and help their people with getting their feet back on the ground.

But let me say that we cannot allow this crucial legislation to once again come so close, only to--in the end--be kept so far from those who would benefit from its outcome on a daily basis. 
   Change does not come easily. This is a big step in providing America's world-class researchers with the resources they need to make a difference in the lives of those with serious illnesses. But let us take a moment to weigh the kind of change in federal policy it would take to provide researchers with access to new embryonic stem cell lines, with the kind of change a person faces when he or she hears the words Parkinson's, or diabetes, or spinal cord injury. 
   The debilitating symptoms of these diseases can alter the course of a person's life--not to mention their family's--and change their day-to-day lives in ways it is impossible for most of us to even imagine. I ask you to take a moment to think of the changes you would have to make to accommodate a chronic illness in your life. 
   Our scientists and researchers need new cell lines so they can move beyond the contaminated, and often unusable, lines that were in existence before 2001. Let's transform the way we experience disease in this country and take the first step today by supporting H.R. 3.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, last night we heard from a President who plans to continue in the wrong direction, believing that our military can solve a political quagmire; but every day that we are there, our military presence makes the situation worse. 
   Mr. Speaker, sending more troops will only fuel the insurgency. We don't belong there, and our brave and capable troops need to come home. 
   I ask you: How can we believe a President who had already sent troops to Baghdad before his speech and he didn't mention it? Unbelievably, he is sending troops, and of course he didn't mention this, that don't have the most advanced armor. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, while the President was giving his remarks, the U.S. military was attacking the Iran consulate, the consulate in the Kurdish region of Iraq. As yet, their consul has not heard why from the United States. The President didn't tell us about that attack. 
   It is troubling and it is sad that the President has misrepresented so many facts about Iraq. It seems he can't distinguish between what he wants to believe and what is real. What he is calling sectarian violence is really civil war.  
   He supports the Iraq Government against the death squads when he knows full well that the death squads are embedded in the Iraqi Government. He claims that he is following the Iraq Study Group's recommendation to get a win when the study group has said there is no way to win and that the only question is how to best leave. 
   The President wants a win. To that end he is sending 20,000 more Americans into harm's way and spending $100 million a day to get that win. In 3 months, don't kid yourself, he will be asking for more to get a win. This is immoral. 
   What the President doesn't realize is that America wins when we follow our ideals, which means we fight for freedom when our freedom is at stake and we only ask American troops to lay down their lives when our country is in danger, not to give the President a win. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, let me repeat, there is no military solution to this political problem. The United States is not going to determine the fate of Iraq; only the Iraqis will determine their fate.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (BRINGING RECONCILIATION TO THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to announce that Representative CHRIS SHAYS of Connecticut and I have introduced an important bipartisan bill in the House today that can help bring desperately needed reconciliation to the people of Iraq. The bill is called the International Partnership for Reconciliation in Iraq. By the standards of the Federal Government, it is a tiny outfit. But few government agencies have delivered more bang for their buck or done so much with so few people. 
   The USIP Institute has an impressive track record of conflict management and peace building in the Balkans, the Philippines, Nigeria, the Sudan, Rwanda and other parts of the world, including Iraq. 
   This bill is vitally important, because, as Ambassador Ryan Crocker has said, ``reconciliation is perhaps the most critical challenge that Iraq faces right now.'' Our bill would encourage reconciliation by supporting the work of a remarkable but unheralded organization called the United States Institute of Peace.     
   The Institute was established by Congress 24 years ago today. It has 142 employees and a budget of $32 million. It has been successful because it is unique. There is no other organization like it. It is a center and a clearinghouse for best practices in preventing and dealing with conflict. Its staff includes many of the world's top experts in conflict resolution and peacebuilding. These incredibly dedicated experts travel to some of the world's most violent places to facilitate reconciliation efforts on the ground. 
   And the Institute is impartial, it is nonideological. Its only axe to grind is peace. That is why USIP has gained the respect and trust in all sides in conflict. In fact, you can say the Institute is one of the world's top brand names when it comes to making peace. 
   In Iraq, the Institute has been working to inspire reconciliation at the regional, at the national, and at the community levels. It has been particularly effective in the city of Mahmoudiya, which has been called the Triangle of Death. There, it has worked to bring Sunni and Shiite factions together. Its work has been so effective that the U.S. Army's provincial reconstruction teams have asked the Institute to help with reconciliation efforts in other parts of Iraq. Not bad for an organization whose annual budget is less than what we spend in Iraq every 3 hours. 
   There is an excellent article on the Institute's work, Madam Speaker, in the current issue of the National Journal, and I urge all my colleagues to read it. 
   The bill that Representative Shays and I introduced today would provide assistance to the Institute to do the  following in Iraq: Prevent violent conflict, promote post-conflict stability and development, increase conflict management capacity, promote tolerance and forgiveness, and facilitate regional dialogue. 
   We believe that the Institute's work will also encourage nations from outside the region to get involved. Reconciliation in Iraq has become something like the weather: Everyone here in Washington talks about it, but no one can really do anything about it. We just sort of sit around and wait for the Iraqi government to meet their reconciliation benchmarks. Then, when they don't, we make speeches. 
   This bill is an opportunity to do something about reconciliation by supporting an organization that knows how to get the job done. And this bill we can all get behind, because no matter where we stand on the Iraq issue we all support reconciliation. 
   I am proud to join with Representative Shays in asking all of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this critically important bipartisan bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (WAR IS NOT THE WAY TO STOP TERRORISM -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, ever since 9/11, the current administration has relied on military force alone to fight terrorism. This policy has been a disaster. There have been over 34,000 Americans killed or hurt in Iraq, but we aren't any safer. And now our troops in Afghanistan are facing a growing insurgency. 
   The lesson we must learn from all this is that we cannot bomb and torture our way to friendship and cooperation around the world. We must eliminate the root causes of terrorism, which are poverty and despair. And to do that, we must focus on helping Nations like Iraq and Afghanistan to make social, economic, and political progress. 
   Former Congressman Charlie Wilson is an actual expert on this subject. Congressman Wilson represented the Second District of Texas from 1973 to 1997. He was the subject of the popular recent movie, ``Charlie Wilson's War.'' The movie shows how Wilson helped the Afghans to beat back the Soviet invasion in their country in the 1980s. 
   Charlie Wilson understands that military force alone is not the answer to the world's problems. He believes that diplomacy and development assistance are actually the best answers. 
   Charlie described his position in an op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post last month. The op-ed is entitled, ``Charlie Wilson's Peace,'' and I hope that every Member of the House will read it. 
   Wilson writes that after the defeat of the Soviets, his request for funds to rebuild Afghanistan was turned down. The result was a disaster for America. 
   Wilson writes, ``Instead of intensifying our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts, we simply walked away, leaving a destroyed country that lacked roads, schools, and any plan or hope for rebuilding. 
   ``Into this void marched the Taliban and al Qaeda. Had we remained engaged in Afghanistan, investing in education, health, and economic development, the world would be a very different place today.'' 
   I want to repeat, Mr. Speaker, Wilson's point because it is an important one. He says that al Qaeda became more powerful because the Afghan people did not receive the right kind of assistance from the United States. Yes, we gave them weapons, but we left them in rubble, and that's where terrorism grows. 
   Wilson goes on to say that ``we cannot afford to aspire to anything less than defeating poverty, disease, and ignorance wherever they exist. It is a relatively small but incredibly effective investment that helps ensure our future national security and economic prosperity.'' 
   Charlie Wilson's experience in Afghanistan, Mr. Speaker, was over 20 years ago, but it is a real lesson for us today. It tells us that we won't defeat al Qaeda just by increasing the number of our troops in Afghanistan. We must focus our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq on reconstruction. 
   That means redeploying our troops out of Iraq on a firm timetable, and then working with regional and international partners to rebuild that devastated land. Electricity and water must be restored to every home. Jobs must be created. The shattered educational and health care systems must be rebuilt. The Iraqi Government must stop dragging its feet and spend the money it has budgeted for essential services. 
   And this House ought to take every chance to promote reconciliation in Iraq. Representative Shays and I have introduced legislation, H.R. 5925, to support the United States Institute for Peace, which has been carrying out important reconciliation projects in Iraq since 2004. The institute has worked to prevent violence and promote the rule of law, and it deserves our help. 
   Mr. Speaker, the current administration has only 4 months to go. I hope that the next administration will learn from this administration's mistakes. Starting next January 20, America must begin to export compassion and hope instead of war and occupation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the sound of gunshots could be heard throughout Iraq last week. Unlike most days, however, it was not the sound of civil war. Instead, it was the sounds of celebration as Iraq won a pivotal soccer match over their Saudi rivals. The return to violence that is the new Iraqi way of life did not take long, however. 
   Most Iraqi families are living in unimaginable circumstances. Nearly one-third of the children are malnourished, and some 15 percent of Iraqis regularly cannot afford to eat. That's according to a recent Oxfam report. 
   The high for Baghdad today was forecast at 121 degrees. Electricity is available for about 2 hours a day. Children are out of school, and regular employment is becoming harder and harder to come by. In these conditions, it is hard to sustain hope. For a country so rich in resources, it is disturbing to hear the stories of families trapped in slums begging for clean drinking water. Mothers scourge to find books and paper for school lessons. It is no wonder. Over 4 million Iraqis have been displaced from their homes and have sought refuge in neighboring provinces or nations. 
   The United Nations estimates that 50,000 Iraqis leave their homes and become refugees every single month. That is the equivalent of one Biloxi or one Idaho Falls every month. It hits home even more when we think of a population the size of San Rafael or Petaluma, both in my congressional district. This is each month, Mr. Speaker; and the situation isn't getting any better. 
   We have spent half a trillion dollars on this occupation. Where has it gotten us? If only a fraction of the money we were spending on tanks and bombs was redirected to reconstruction and reconciliation, what a different country Iraq could be. 
   In my district in Marin and Sonoma counties alone, the taxpayers have shelled out $1.5 billion for this Iraqi occupation. If we really wanted to make America safer, this same amount, just the money from my district alone, could have paid for nearly 29,000 public safety officers or 20,000 port container inspectors. That's the real way to defend our homeland. 
   We don't need to wait until September to see if the administration's efforts in Iraq are working. They haven't worked from the beginning. We were not met as liberators. We are not making America safer. Our continuing  presence only serves as a recruiting tool for new terrorists. How can anyone think to put our troops in harm's way merely to serve a political legacy? 
   Both the American and Iraqi people have consistently sent the clear message: Bring the troops home. Not in 2009 or whenever a new President comes along. The time is now, and we must not delay. 
   This will require bold actions, but our troops deserve nothing less than to be brought safely home to their families.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the defense spending in this budget is much, much, much higher than I would like. But I rise today in support of this conference report and the very good work of Chairman Spratt, of his committee, and his staff.     
   Thanks go to Chairman Spratt and the conferees for including my language in this bill to steer more defense dollars to military personnel for their health care, including Walter Reed and TRICARE, and away from outdated, misguided, and unneeded weapons systems that are still being built to fight the threat of the Soviet Union, to protect against the Cold War. 
   This budget also takes on waste at the Pentagon, insisting that DOD presses ahead in implementing over 1,300 unaddressed suggestions from the GAO to reduce waste, fraud and abuse. 
   Mr. Speaker, whenever any Member of this Congress has to stand on the floor and defend what they did in years past, you know it's pretty sure that they made some big mistakes.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (A BREAK IN THE PURSUIT OF PEACE -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, today the Associated Press reported that in the middle of the Iraq civil war, their parliament will be taking a 2-month break starting in July. While our troops are dying, while they are being wounded, while they are trying to provide security to the Iraqi people, the Iraqi leadership is planning to take 2 months off. 
   I hope that this does not mean that the Iraqis are giving up on providing a peaceful resolution to this conflict. If anything, the parliament should be rededicating themselves to providing security and hope to the Iraqi people, not taking a break, not letting any hope for a peaceful resolution slip through their fingers. 
   Our best hope for peace in the region, actually, will have to come through hard work, through negotiations, through constant attention. Every day we turn a blind eye to the real situation on the ground in Iraq, more people die, more American troops, more Iraqi civilians die. I don't know about anyone else, but this is simply unacceptable to me. 
   The American people have said again, and they have said again, that they want our troops out of Iraq. This administration must demand that the Iraqi leaders stay in town, stay at the table, and not go on vacation. 
   After all, how can we stand down if the Iraqis aren't there to stand up? 
   This is a very serious problem, Mr. Speaker. How can we have a partnership with the Iraqi people, as our administration has promised, a partnership that they say is working to bring peace in Iraq, if half of that partnership goes on vacation? 
   My position has remained the same from the very beginning: We need to fully fund the withdrawal from Iraq. We need to bring our troops and military contractors home. We need to provide real and reliable health care to our returning troops. We need to work with the international community to provide for a dependable and safe future for the Iraqi people. 
   The way to bring peace to Iraq is not through building walls around neighborhoods, creating walled-in villages, breaking up lives and breaking up families. The way to bring peace to Iraq is to give sovereignty to the Iraqi people and to have a surge of peaceful negotiations. The only way to bring about peace is to bring our troops home, to empower the Iraqi people to build a future based on hope and equality. 
   And I ask you, Mr. Speaker, if not now, when?

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 259, authored by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo). H. Res. 259 honors  and recognizes the work of the Meals on Wheels Association of America and their annual March For Meals campaigns. 
   The Meals on Wheels Association of America is the oldest and largest organization that provides meals to people in need. Through their many programs, Meals on Wheels strives to support the social, physical, nutritional, and economic needs of vulnerable individuals. Meals on Wheels offers tools and information to programs across the Nation and supports these organizations in making a difference in the lives of those at risk. They do this through professional training, creative leadership, and cash grants. Meals on Wheels helps local senior meal programs provide food and other nutrition services nationwide. 
   Hunger continues to be a profound problem in our country, Mr. Speaker. Nationwide nearly 38 million people live in households suffering from hunger, up from 33 million in the year 2000. Meals on Wheels is at the forefront of combating hunger by providing nutritious meals to people across the country, those who are elderly, those who are homebound, disabled, or at risk and who are at the greatest risk of going hungry. Even with these impressive efforts, a great need still exists. At this moment 40 percent of Meals on Wheels programs across the country report that there are waiting lists for their nutrition services. 
   Furthermore, the needs for Meals on Wheels will continue to grow. The elderly population in the United States has grown exponentially over the last few decades and will continue to increase well into the mid 21st century. The demographics that will experience the most growth is that of adults age 85 and older. At the same time, the economic insecurity of this elderly population will continue to rise, creating a dire need for services such as those provided by Meals on Wheels. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the conclusion of the annual March For Meals campaign, I want to join my colleagues in recognizing the important role that Meals on Wheels programs play all year long all over the country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, a child's safety should never be put in jeopardy. That's why I rise in support of H. Res. 1097, authored by Congressman Courtney from Connecticut. 
   H. Res. 1097 is a bill to designate this month as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. We need to shine a light on the tragic circumstances, Mr. Speaker, that face some of our Nation's children on a daily basis. As people across the country recognize this month as National Child Abuse Prevention Month and promote awareness activities in order to reduce the cases of child maltreatment, this resolution moves us one step closer to securing the safety and well-being of all children. 
   The latest data shows us that in the year 2006, approximately 1,530 children died, died in the United States of America, due to maltreatment, and an additional 905,000 children were victims of abuse and neglect. Even more disturbing, Mr. Speaker, is that our most vulnerable children are at greatest risk. Approximately 90,000 victims of child abuse and neglect in the year 2000 were less than 1 year old. More than 84 percent of those child abuse victims were less than 1 month old. 
   These facts are appalling. We must work together to bring attention to this important issue and begin to  strengthen our families and our communities and to keep our children safe. We need to emphasize the need for more prevention programs because prevention works by reducing risk factors, by promoting protective factors and by fostering a commitment for social change. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Courtney for introducing this important bill. It is my hope and it is my goal that all of my colleagues will join me in supporting H. Res. 1097 so that together we can reduce child abuse and neglect by increasing public awareness. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, as we enter the sixth year of the seemingly endless occupation of Iraq, the International Committee of the Red Cross published a worrying report about the State of the humanitarian crisis in Iraq. 
   In its entitled ``Iraq: No Let-Up in the Humanitarian Crisis,'' the publication shows just how far we need to go to meet the most basic needs of the Iraqi people. Despite the rosy picture being painted by some in the administration, too many Iraqis are still without health care, clean water, and/or education. 
   And many families have been torn apart by the civil war wracking the country. Family members have gone missing or have been killed. Some have been shipped off to detention centers. 
   Estimates range on how many people, mostly men, have been locked up. According to the Red Cross, ``Tens of thousands of Iraqis, almost all of them men, are currently in detention often far from their homes.'' 
   One camp is situated in the southern part of the country near Basra and is managed by the United States-led multinational forces in Iraq. At the same time, this is the largest detention facility in the country. And there are more than 20,000 inmates in that detention camp. 
   The situation means that many families have lost their breadwinner. The new heads of household, many women and many children, have to cope in a world that seems to be without home or promise for the future. And their day-to-day life is just as bleak. 
   Instead of improving, the supply of electricity has become even more unreliable. Because of this, water sanitation plants are breaking down and hospitals find they cannot provide adequate care, even if they had the medical supplies to meet the demand, which they very seldom do. 
   Parents the world over, Madam Speaker, American, Iraqi, or anywhere else, only want the best for their children. They want their kids to be happy. They want them to be healthy. They want their kids to go to school, to grow up and to have a chance to achieve their dreams. That is why ongoing occupation is about more than statistics or numbers. 
   The Red Cross reports helps to put a human face on the administration's so-called foreign policy. One such story actually highlights the struggle faced by too many. Here is Ruba's story. She says, ``My children and I left my home in Anbar province almost 2 years ago. My husband had been killed right in front of us.'' She continues, ``I had to protect my children, so we fled the same night with nothing but some money. For me, today, there is no past, there is no future, only a horrible present. I only wish I had some photos of my husband, photos of my family. I can see it all in my mind, but I don't know for how long I will remember. There was a time when we always sat down together for lunch and laughed. Today, we are living with my cousin's family.'' 
   She goes on to say, ``There are 12 of us in one room. I don't want my old life again, because I know it is impossible without my husband. All I want is for my children to go to school and lead a normal life.'' 
   The story of this mother, Madam Speaker, a woman just 38 years old, is heartbreaking. We have a solemn obligation to help the Iraqi people achieve a future that is both secure and stable. 
   In the 5 minutes we stand here to deliver our special order speeches, the administration spends over $1 million to prolong the endless occupation. I think the people of America could find a better way to show our commitment to the Iraqi people. 
   The American people's generosity and commitment to humanitarian assistance is boundless. But our patience with this administration's foreign policy follies is actually not boundless. This Congress must stand up to the administration. We must say ``no'' to a blank check. Let us redirect our resources to where they are really needed, towards aid, not ammunition.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, today marks the 79th anniversary of the birth of history's greatest champion of peace, Dr. King, who became the youngest person ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize when he received that great honor at age 35. 
   At the King Center in Atlanta, visitors are asked to take a pledge that includes the words: ``I pledge to do everything I can to make America and the world a place where equality and justice, freedom and peace will grow and flourish.'' 
   Today, Madam Speaker, America needs to hear Dr. King's message of peace more than ever before, because our Nation's leaders continue to take reckless actions to put the world on the road to ever-widening conflicts. We have seen many new examples of warmongering in just the past few days and weeks. Twelve days ago, a leading Republican candidate for President said it would be fine for him if the American occupation of Iraq continued for another 100 years. Think about that. He would ask babies born 80 years from now to go to Baghdad for a commitment that the American people want to end right now. 
   Now, President Bush continues his saber-rattling over Iran. Days ago, he warned that the world must take action against that country before it is too late. Isn't this a clear signal that the administration is still considering an attack against Iran, even though we know that it is not developing nuclear weapons that can threaten the United States? 
   Therefore, as a lesson to be learned, we don't know all the facts about the  incident with the Iranian boats yet; but until we know the whole story, I would advise my colleagues to be wary of coming to any conclusions too soon. 
   And as if that weren't enough, the administration told us again that the occupation of Iraq will continue indefinitely, right into the next Presidency. But this morning we learned that it could last through several more Presidencies. The Iraqi defense minister was quoted in the press as saying that Iraq will not be able to take full responsibility for its internal security until the year 2012, nor responsibility for defending its borders until at least 2018. Yet, it has been over 2 1/2 years since this administration announced that its strategy in Iraq is: as the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down. And it has been over a year since the President's famous surge speech where he said: ``I have made it clear that America's commitment is not open-ended.'' But, Madam Speaker, it is. 
   Madam Speaker, America loses its moral authority every day that our occupation of Iraq continues. According to a study conducted by the Iraqi Government and the World Health Organization that was published last week, 151,000 Iraqis died of violence in the first 3 years of our occupation. The study also found that there was a 60 percent increase in nonviolent deaths in Iraq, including deaths from childhood infections. 
   Martin Luther King understood that, if America is to lead the world, we must be more than a powerhouse; we must be a moral powerhouse. 
   I ask my colleagues to devote this session of the 110th Congress to the responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq and the creation of a new foreign policy committed to the values that Dr. King espoused: equality and justice, freedom and peace.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, we must ensure that no matter where a child comes from or what his or her background is, that child has an equal opportunity to succeed in school and in life. That begins with quality early childhood education, and that is why we need to and must reauthorize Head Start. 
   This bill will allow 10,000 more children to benefit from the Head Start program. But many, many more children are eligible for Head Start, and those children will continue to be left behind. A real investment in our children would ensure that every single child who is eligible has access to this very successful program. Without full funding, some children continue to start elementary school far behind their peers. 
   Some Members, as my friend on the other side of the aisle talked about, would like to allow Head Start programs to discriminate by using taxpayer dollars to hire staff based upon their religion, which is against everything I believe that the Head Start program stands for. When we already have a shortage of qualified Head Start teachers, we must not allow qualified teachers to be turned away simply because of their religion. 
   Mr. Chairman, children are 25 percent of our population. They are 100 percent of our future. We must support and expand Head Start for the best possible beginning of their lives.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, we must ensure that every child who could benefit from Head Start is able to enroll in a Head Start center. One way to do that is to provide full funding; another is to provide that we have the facilities we need; and, one of the most important ways is to ensure that we have qualified teachers. 
   The base bill increases the requests and requirements for teacher qualification, and it supports higher salaries and requires more college degrees. Therefore, including this amendment in the Head Start bill is absolutely appropriate, because this amendment helps Head Start teachers get the degrees that we are demanding that they have. And we do this by offering loan forgiveness to those teachers, teachers who teach in the Head Start programs. Loan forgiveness will help balance out low salaries, and it will assist with teacher retention. 
   Head Start is about the best thing we can do for our children, because this successful program gives children from all backgrounds a level playing field when they enter elementary school.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me this opportunity to talk about the importance of research into the environmental, cultural and health impacts of introducing new genetically modified plants and animals into our agriculture, horticulture and aquaculture systems. 
   The National Science Foundation, which supports a broad range of basic research in the biological sciences, is well equipped to perform this basic research that will help us develop more sustainable approaches to pest management, understand and manage unique environmental and health risks, and even discover ways in which modified plants could provide environmental benefits. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is critical research that the National Academy of Sciences has called for in a recent report. While I am not offering an amendment to this bill before us today, I do ask for your help in raising the profile of this very important issue as you proceed with the bill.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of our dear friend, Congresswoman STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES. Since her arrival here nearly 10 years ago as the first African-American woman elected to Congress by Ohio, she was a tireless advocate for the poor and our Nation's working families. Despite the tremendous personal losses she suffered, including the tragic loss of her sister, her parents, and her husband Mervyn of 26 years, she never wavered in her commitment to the people of Ohio.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IT IS TIME TO END THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the American people are opposed to the occupation of Iraq. And when I say ``the American people,'' I am not referring to members of one party or one political persuasion. I am referring to members of both parties who live in every part of our country, in cities and towns big and small. 
   According to the organization Cities For Progress, approximately 300 States, cities and towns have passed resolutions or referenda opposing the occupation of Iraq. They include places like Kalamazoo, Michigan; Carrboro, North Carolina; Ladysmith, Wisconsin; Butte, Montana; Chicago, Illinois; Guilford, Vermont; Cincinnati and Cleveland, Ohio; South Charleston, West Virginia; and Sacramento, California. 
   They also include 17 States that have either passed a State House or State Senate resolution opposing the occupation or sent letters to Congress signed by large numbers of the State legislature's members. These include the red States of Colorado, North Dakota, and Arizona and the blue States of Minnesota, New Jersey, and Oregon. 
   In addition, the United States Conference of Mayors has passed a Bring Home the Troops resolution. In their resolutions the cities and towns decry the terrible loss of life in Iraq. And they describe how the soaring costs of the occupation consume resources that would be much better spent on the needs of local communities. 
   I want to read portions of a few of these resolutions so that Members of the House can get a sense of the anguish that's out there in the heartland. 
   The resolution passed by South Charleston, West Virginia, declares that the conflict has ``mired American Armed Forces in an internecine, centuries-old conflict of ethnic, cultural, and religious rivalries.'' The resolution of the U.S. Conference of Mayors declared that ``the continued U.S. military presence in Iraq is reducing Federal funds available for needed domestic investments in education, health care, public safety, homeland security, and more.'' The Cincinnati city council echoed that sentiment and said that spending on the occupation ``severely lessens the ability of the city of Cincinnati to rebuild its urban core, promote homeownership opportunities in Cincinnati, and provide critical housing services for the poor.'' The Chicago city council warned that the occupation has ``inflamed anti-American passions in the Muslim world and increased the terrorist threat to United States citizens.'' The resolution of Cambridge, Massachusetts, laments the ``grievous impact of the loss of lives in the Iraq war on families and communities on both sides of the conflict and the destructive social and economic effects of the war.'' 
   The city of Bellingham, Washington, said that ``the killing of civilians is an unspeakable crime against humanity.'' The Cleveland city council declared that ``the costs to the States of the call-up of National Guard members for deployment in Iraq have been significant, as reckoned in lost lives, combat injuries and physical trauma, disruption of family life and damage to the fabric of civic life in our communities.'' 
   The New Hampshire House of Representatives urged ``the President to commence talks with the neighbors in the Middle East and begin the orderly withdrawal of American military forces from Iraq.'' 
   And the Vermont Senate declared that the escalation of the conflict ``is exactly the wrong foreign policy direction and the presence of American troops in Iraq has not and will not contribute to the stability of that nation, the region, or the security of Americans.'' 
   More information about these resolutions, Mr. Speaker, can be found on the Web site of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I urge my colleagues to read these resolutions in their entirety. They represent the true voice of America, the America that has compassion for the people of the world, believes in international cooperation, and knows that restoring our moral leadership is the best way to guarantee our own security and freedom. 
   Mr. Speaker, the people have spoken. It is time to end the occupation of Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Chairman, American contractors in Iraq have lived by their own rules for far too long. While American taxpayers fund the equipping and training of these private military contractors, companies like Blackwater continue to escape accountability to international, Iraqi or even American laws. 
   Today, the Democratic Congress will put an end to the question of whether we are training mercenaries and murderers in place of our Nation's warriors. By passing H.R. 2740, we can ensure that contractors in Iraq are held accountable under American criminal law. There is no excuse to allow private contractors and subcontractors to exist without legal accountability. 
   Madam Chairman, we must never forget that the way to end the abuses by contractors in Iraq is to bring our troops and our military contractors, 180,000 of them, home from Iraq as soon as practicable.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, over the past 5 years, the Bush administration has repeatedly asked the American people to put their faith and their judgment in the judgment of the White House, especially as it pertains to our position in Iraq. 
   But as we have seen, and we have seen it time and time again, that judgment is based on ignoring voices of dissent and the reality on the ground in favor of a stay-the-course mentality. 
   When General Petraeus presents his report on Iraq next week, we cannot allow the voice of the American people to be ignored. We watched this administration relaunch its public relations campaign to sell ``the escalation'' to the American people, and now they insist that the escalation is working. All this in spite of the Iraqi Government's failure to achieve most of its key benchmarks for military and political progress and the dramatic increase in American and Iraqi casualties since the escalation began. 
   The administration continues, Mr. Speaker, to resist all attempts supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans to bring our troops home. In essence, we are in the middle of another PR campaign, this one to stifle the will and undermine the judgment of the American people again. 
   Today Congress is again faced with the choice of trusting its own judgment or the claims of the Bush administration. Unfortunately, the past miscalculation and failed predictions of the administration have resulted in tragic consequences. 
   In 2003, the administration insisted that an invasion force of 130,000 troops would be enough to secure Iraq and restore peace after the invasion. They claimed Saddam Hussein was amassing weapons of mass destruction to use against our country. They promised that we would be greeted as liberators, and in May 2005 we were told that the insurgency in Iraq was in its last throes. Time after time, they have been wrong, wrong, wrong. 
   Earlier this year when Congress passed the emergency spending bill for Iraq, the Bush administration argued that benchmarks are the only way to measure progress in Iraq. As a result, the Government Accountability Office  released a report this week showing that Iraq has failed 11 out of 18 benchmarks. And those seven that did not fail were barely, barely worked upon at all. In response, the administration now claims that these benchmarks should no longer be used to measure progress. It is clear that the administration will never accept the reality about Iraq. The only way to end the violence is to fully fund a safe and orderly redeployment from Iraq. 
   The shallow fortune-telling of the Bush administration cannot replace what every American knows: The only right course in Iraq is to bring our troops home by fully funding a safe redeployment of our troops and military contractors. The American people want bold leadership, and they have called on the Congress to take action, action now. The occupation has been a total failure and the American people will not accept taking a wait-and-see attitude. They know that the only sensible moral and responsible course is to fully fund the redeployment of our American troops and military contractors. And they want us to get started on it now.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 121, and I thank my colleague, Mike Honda, for his leadership on this issue. 
   I particularly thank Representative Lane Evans, who was with us up until this year, and I hope he is watching today, because he was right when he first introduced this legislation, and his reasons and his legislation remains correct and right today. 
   Many may claim that the exploitation of the comfort women should be left in the past. That could not be further from the truth. Anyone who has met these brave women knows that they live with the haunting memories in the present every single day. The sexual exploitation, some would say enslavement, must be marked, and it must be remembered. The acts of violence the comfort women faced were inhuman, and it cannot be erased. 
   This should not be a day of sadness. Today is about accountability and hope for the future. We will remember that those who did not live to see this day and, yet, are still celebrated for their courage. In their honor, we will speak for all of the world here: Never again. 
   The lesson will be learned. Women are not prizes of war. This has been a long time coming, but there is no statute of limitations on courage and on dignity, and that is what we honor today. We honor the perseverance of comfort women. We call on governments worldwide to accept responsibility for past deeds and work towards a just future.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007. Congresswoman Lee and Congressman Payne are to be commended for their continued dedication to the people of Africa--and to the people of Darfur in particular. 
   It was September 2004--almost three years ago--when then Secretary of State Colin Powell declared that the situation in Darfur could be described in no other way than ``genocide.'' 
   And yet today, millions of people have been run off of their homeland. Children who should be in school, learning, are forced into armies. Women are raped and brutalized daily. Refugee camps are overrun. For many, the situation seems hopeless. 
   World leaders take the stage day after day talking--calling for an end to violence. Enough talking. It is clear the government of Sudan will not listen. Maybe the only way they will listen is to hit them in their pocket book--and that is exactly what we will do today. 
   This bill will identify which companies are conducting business in Sudan--some would say at the expense of the Darfur people. Once these companies are identified, the U.S. Government will be prohibited from doing business with them. If the Sudanese Government won't listen to reason, maybe they will listen to the sound of quiet cash registers. 
   We send a clear message that we will not forget the people of Darfur. 
   From small groups like ``Dear Sudan, Love Petaluma'' in my hometown to larger relief organizations like UNICEF, we are committed to peace and to a future of hope.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, this legislation overturns the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision, which offered a very restricted and decidedly unrealistic reading of just when a discriminatory action regarding compensation actually occurs. In doing so, this legislation restores the common and long-standing understanding of employees, employers and the circuit courts alike, that when it comes to discriminatory pay, the protection of title VII extends not only to pay decisions and practices, but to each and every paycheck as well. 
   Let me say a word about the plaintiff in this case, Lilly Ledbetter. Lilly will not reap the benefits of our legislation, and, as a result, will continue to feel the effect of the court's discriminatory decision to pay her less than her male colleagues for the rest of her life. 
   Lilly Ledbetter went to work at Goodyear Tires every day for 19 years. She was one of the few female supervisors at the plant. That was quite an accomplishment in and of itself. But what she didn't realize was that for all those years, she was paid less than her male colleagues, 20 percent less by the time she retired, because of discrimination based on her gender. 
   A jury found that she was discriminated against. They gave her over $3.8 million in back pay and damages. But the Supreme Court said to her, Ms. Ledbetter, you didn't file your claim within 180 days of the decision to discriminate, and, even though each and every one of your paychecks reflects the discriminatory decision, and you didn't have proof of the discrimination until long after the decision was made, you are out of luck. Lilly Ledbetter, we don't care that your monthly pension and your Social Security benefits also reflect that discrimination. 
   Now, the President says that he is planning to veto this legislation, and we shouldn't be surprised. But as a tribute to Lilly Ledbetter and other women who work hard to support their families, to get ahead, who face discrimination every day of their lives, vote for H.R. 2831.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, we have been waiting for this day for over a decade. Finally we are here, and we are about to pass H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act that we called GINA which was first introduced by Representative Slaughter in 1995 and which was approved by the Senate last week. 
   It has been a long road, but the main sponsors of the legislation, Representative Slaughter and Representative Biggert have persevered, and I congratulate them both. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of GINA which will prohibit employers from using genetic information to discriminate against workers, and will also prohibit health insurers from using such information to raise premiums or to deny coverage. 
   We know that many States, including my home State of California, prohibits employers and health insurers from discriminating on the basis of genetic information, and that is good, but these laws vary widely. 
   So it is important for the Federal Government, as it has with title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, to step forward to establish a national policy, making it clear that discriminating against workers and others based on genetic information is unacceptable. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill also contains the provisions of H.R. 2637, the Child Labor Protection Act of 2007. It was a bill I introduced last year that passed the House in June of 2007. 
   The provisions in H.R. 2637 will increase civil penalties from $11,000 to $50,000 for violations that cause the death or serious injury of a child worker, as if there is any penalty high enough to make up for a child. 
   The legislation, though, provides that a penalty can be doubled when the violation causing death or injury is repeated or willful. The child labor bill was a narrowly drafted bipartisan effort. It is a good foundation for future action on child labor laws. 
   So I am delighted that part of GINA includes my legislation, legislation that can be used to offset the costs of GINA. 
   We are living, Madam Speaker, in an exciting age. We have just begun to tap the potential of genetic testing. This bill adds the protection that is needed so this research can go forward and be used wisely.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (TRAGIC ANNIVERSARY OF ``MISSION ACCOMPLISHED'' -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, today marks a tragic anniversary. Five years ago President Bush delivered his infamous ``Mission Accomplished'' speech aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln. 
   Across this country, Americans are holding rallies and vigils to mark this occasion. And members of the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Unions are giving up a day's pay and they are marching in the streets to show their opposition to the failed policies of the Bush administration and of the cost of those policies. 
   We all remember that the President put on a green flight suit and white helmet and arrived in the copilot seat of a Navy Viking jet. Then he stood at a podium beneath a big ``Mission Accomplished'' banner and he spoke. 
   He said the search for weapons of mass destruction had already begun, and he declared that ``major combat operations in Iraq have ended.'' 
   Obviously, the American people didn't get the real facts that day, Mr. Speaker. So here's what should have been said. He should have said: ``My fellow Americans, our soldiers have performed with great skill and courage. But, frankly, the administration doesn't have a clue what to do next.'' 
   It didn't have a plan for the occupation. It didn't have an exit strategy. And the people who actually understand the history and culture of Iraq were warning us that there were going to be insurgencies and civil war. He should have said: ``Major combat operations have not ended--they have just begun.'' 
   Today I joined with my Out-of-Iraq Caucus colleagues, MAXINE WATERS and BARBARA LEE, to send a Dear Colleague Letter that describes the terrible human cost of the bungling in Iraq. It shows that over 96 percent of all American deaths in Iraq and over 98 percent of all casualties have taken place since the ``Mission Accomplished'' speech. 
   But you don't have to look, Mr. Speaker, at the cumulative devastation of the past 5 years to know that the occupation is a disaster. Just look at what happened in April, April of 2008, last month: Fifty American soldiers died, the highest number in 7 months. Thousands of innocent civilians were killed or injured in the bloody battle at Sadr City which continues to rage. The Pentagon was forced to extend the ``stop-loss'' policy because our military is stretched to its limits. 
   And as the administration acknowledged that al Qaeda is growing stronger in its safe havens in Pakistan, the drumbeat for war against Iran grew louder. 
   Here at home, the occupation continues to be a factor in driving gas prices higher. The Iraq recession continues in full swing. And every week, billions of dollars continue to be spent on military operations in Iraq that are desperately needed for domestic programs right here. 
   Sheer incompetence has surely been one reason for this. But the most important reason for our failure in Iraq is the fatally flawed national security policy. It has been a policy marked by arrogance, by the belief that America can go it alone and has the right to strike anywhere and anytime it pleases. And by the idea that military power alone can assure our security. 
   I hope we will use this ``Mission Accomplished'' anniversary date in a positive way so we can learn the lessons of the past 5 years and dedicate ourselves to a new foreign policy that will serve us much better. This new policy must be based on diplomacy; international cooperation; the rule of law; rejection of the doctrine of preemption and the use of torture; and, a commitment to helping other nations of the world to build a better life for their citizens. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, on this ``Mission Accomplished'' day, we must ask ourselves: What is America's mission? The American people believe that our mission is to stand up for the values of democracy, for human rights, and for peace. Those are the values that the dock workers are standing up for today. Those are the values that have been ignored and predictably resulted in disastrous results.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE SO-CALLED SURGE HAS FAILED -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I was pleased to participate in a joint hearing that took testimony from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. It was supposed to be a turning point in the occupation of Iraq. The purpose of this hearing was to get a report from our military and diplomatic leaders about the record of the so-called surge or escalation in Iraq. 
   Let's first look at what the main purpose of the escalation really was. According to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Michael Mullen, the surge was to give space for political reconciliation. I quote him here: ``Security is critical to providing the Government of Iraq the breathing space it needs to work toward political national reconciliation and economic growth. Barring that, no amount of troops in no amount of time will make much of a difference.'' 
   The President celebrates that there has been a short-term downward trend in violence. Of course that would happen. When we put our fighting men and women, the best in the world, on the ground in greater and greater numbers, of course they will bring some form of order. But let's be realistic. This is not sustainable. We cannot keep the same number of troops for very much longer. We simply do not have the resources to do so, and our troops should not have such a task. 
   So, yes, they are temporarily keeping a lid on the uprising and attacks. In fact, they've reached back to 2006 numbers, which at that time appalled us, and it should not be something we celebrate today. We are missing our ultimate goal. Like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs said, the purpose of the surge was political reconciliation. If the White House put even half of the resources, political and fiscal, behind political reconciliation, we would be in a much different place right now. We would have a stable and inclusive Iraqi national government, not one propped up by the United States. It would have the support of the Iraqi people, and it would be providing strength and dependable security. That, Mr. Speaker, is not what we have. In fact, just last month, a new deal called the Declaration of Principles was inked between President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki. It's basically a blueprint to keep our troops in Iraq indefinitely, and it allows permanent bases. 
   It may even provide for arming insurgent security forces, which actually looks like arming a militia. The last time we got into the business of arming folks, we ended up with the Taliban. Are we ever going to learn the lesson not to repeat the mistakes of the past? It will be interesting to see how the two leaders will try to jam this latest agreement down the throats of the Iraqi Parliament because the Iraqi Parliament has clearly stated that they are not pleased with the agreement, to say the very least. Let's take a good look at what's going on: The surge has failed. The new White House agreement would keep our troops in Iraq indefinitely. This is not the road to success. This will not make America safer. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's time for bold action. Our friends in the other Chamber and the resident down the road on Pennsylvania Avenue need to face up  to reality. Let's act boldly and fulfill our mandate. It's time to end this misguided occupation. It's time to bring our troops home.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer today simply says that the organizations receiving grant money from the trust fund may give consideration to first responders, public safety officers, teachers, other public employees whose incomes have kept them from living in the communities that they serve. 
   Mr. Chairman, I represent a district where the median income is higher than some others and so is the price of housing. Sometimes public service employees actually require that workers live within a certain distance from their job, and it's simply unfair that when home prices put affordable housing out of reach for these workers, then they cannot participate in that career. 
   The amendment would not only affect high-cost areas but would benefit every single county or city in our country where public service employees have trouble finding housing. 
   If these employees meet the income requirements of the bill, grantees would be able to give consideration to them and to their contributions to our communities. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is time we stand up for these employees. It is time we let them know that we welcome them in our communities.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, today marks a sad and tragic day in American history. Today is the fifth anniversary of the House joint resolution which authorized the use of American Armed Forces against Iraq. 
   I was among the 133 Members of the House who voted ``no'' on that resolution. But our voices could not be heard over the deafening spin machine of fear and misinformation that came from the administration. 
   We were told about mushroom clouds, yellow cake, and weapons of mass destruction. They all turned out to be fairytales. But they became the rationale of something America should never, never do: wage a war of choice. 
   But now the American people know that our involvement in Iraq is folly, and in 2006 they sent us to Congress to end the occupation. 
   Iraq is not the American people's war; it is the administration's war. And it goes on because the administration has turned a deaf ear to the will of the people. The administration looks to our involvement in South Korea as the model for Iraq. That means a permanent occupation that may last half a century or more. 
   Who wants this? The American people don't want it. The Iraqi people don't want it. The people of the Middle East don't want it. Our allies don't want it. The world does not want it. 
   Iraq is the symptom of a foreign policy that is fatally flawed. We have turned our backs on the structure of international cooperation and agreement that is the best way to stop terrorism, ensure our national security, and keep the peace. 
   Our leaders have told us to wait for history to judge the wisdom of our involvement in Iraq, but we don't have to wait; 5 years is long enough to judge. And we already know what the occupation has done; it has shattered the lives of millions through death, injury, and displacement. It has wrecked our moral leadership, it has wrecked our standing in the world. It has distracted us from fighting the poverty and hopelessness that give rise to terrorism, and from working with other nations to dismantle terrorist networks. It has made us foreign occupiers in the eyes of the people of the Middle East, making it virtually impossible for us to be partners for peace in that very volatile region. 
   The occupation broke faith with our brave troops. We told them they were going to fight America's enemies, and then we left them to police a civil war that has nothing to do with America. The occupation has undermined our commitment to civil liberties and human rights. America should be known as the great champion of democracy; instead, we are known for Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, illegal wiretapping, and the PATRIOT Act. 
   The occupation has squandered nearly half a trillion dollars from our Treasury, robbing money from domestic needs. And the occupation has not made our Nation safer. Our intelligence community has warned us that al Qaeda is using the occupation to recruit operatives for attacks on the United States. 
   So how should we mark this fifth anniversary day? Let us use October 10, 2007 to correct the mistake this House made on October 10, 2002. Let us use this day to commit ourselves to a bold new course of action. Congress must rescind the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. Congress must use its power of the purse to defund the occupation and, instead, fully fund the safe, orderly, and responsible redeployment of our troops and withdrawal of all military contractors now. And Congress must resist the new drumbeat of war, this time against Iran. 
   The occupation of Iraq represents a failure of national policy. America's true strengths lie in our commitment to moral action, lies in our compassion for the people of the world, and a government based on the rule of law. Let us use this day to return to those values and ensure the safety of our country and our people. And let us be committed to bring our troops home from Iraq.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (BRING OUR TROOPS AND MILITARY CONTRACTORS HOME -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, this week, we heard reports that private military contractor Blackwater has been ordered out of Iraq and had its license revoked after a shootout that took the lives of at least eight Iraqi civilians. This didn't happen in the ``wild west'' of Iraq, not even in the so-called ``triangle of death.'' Mr. Speaker, it happened within the U.S.-protected Green Zone in Baghdad. That's the area where the so-called surge was supposed to bring peace and stability. 
   One account of the scene goes like this: a witness, Muhammad Hussein, saw his brother killed in the gunfight. Muhammad said, I was driving behind my brother's car and suddenly there was an explosion and firing. I tried to figure out what was happening when I saw a black convoy ahead of us, he told an international news agency, and went on to say, Soon after, I saw my brother slumped in the car. I dragged him out of the car and tried to hide to avoid the firing, but realized that he had been shot in the chest and he was already dead. That's what he said. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, one week after General Petraeus came up to the Hill to brief Members of Congress, we are seeing private military contractors killing civil civilians in the streets of Baghdad. Is this the measure of success of the escalation? I should hope not. I should think not. To this date, the administration has either been unwilling or unable to account for all the private military contractors in Iraq. 
   Contractors have their own rules. No one knows to whom they are accountable. Reports of these contractors, however, have been anything but promising. The Center for American Progress estimates the total number of private contractors in Iraq to be 126,000 to 180,000; 20,000 to 50,000 of those are private security guards. They zip through Iraq, through Iraqi towns and neighborhoods in their convoys of armored SUVs. Are they accountable to an international law of war? Are they accountable to U.S. law? Can the Iraqis hold them accountable for acts of violence within Iraq? Nobody knows. Are these contractors receiving any mental health assistance? Are we ensuring that no one being paid by the United States is hitting the streets of Baghdad with PTSD? What is the screening process? We have no idea who's out there in the name of the United States of America. 
   Every single day we open the paper to find report after report that the occupation of Iraq is a failure. Despite all of the heroic acts of our men and women in uniform, we cannot bring peace and stability to a nation at the point of a gun. We cannot win an occupation. 
   This administration needs to get real about the situation on the ground. It is time, it is past time to fully fund a safe and orderly redeployment of our troops and of our military contractors from Iraq. That is all the Congress can accept. 
   We support our troops. We support Iraqi sovereignty. We support a surge in diplomatic efforts. What we cannot, what we will not accept is another year, another decade or another flag-draped coffin. 
   Let's bring our troops home. Let's bring our contractors home. And let's allow the people of Iraq to reclaim their country.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased to have had an opportunity in this bill to honor my friend and mentor, the late Congresswoman Patsy Mink, who was a leader on guaranteeing equality for all by creating Patsy T. Mink Fellowships. 
   While we have made great strides in providing educational opportunities for women and minorities, far too few are becoming college professors. The Mink Fellowships will be used to encourage women and minorities to become professors in fields where they are under-represented. 
   In addition to providing more diversity and opportunity in graduate programs, we recognize the need for more opportunities to attain certificates and degrees in high-wage, high-skilled jobs. This bill helps colleges partner with local businesses to create ``for-credit'' classes focused on the skills and certificates needed for high-wage jobs in the local community. 
   Also, many of our Nation's students enter college needing remedial education classes. Far too many get stuck taking those classes, never graduates. This bill fixes that. Let's pass it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. As some of you may know, at one time I was a single mother raising three small children. I was working full time, but I still wasn't able to put food on the table, pay for doctors' visits, and care for the other needs of my children all on my own because my paycheck was for a 40-hour week but it did not cover our necessities. To make ends meet, I was forced to turn to public assistance. 
   That was more than 35 years ago, but today there are still millions of single mothers in our country who are struggling to provide for their families, many while balancing full-time jobs. In fact, single mothers are twice as likely as fathers to raise their children in poverty. 
   Unfortunately, so long as women continue to receive pennies on the dollar compared to their male counterparts, this statistic is unlikely to change any time soon. 
   I want to thank my friend, Congresswoman DeLauro, for her work on this issue, and I would like to remind all of you that the Paycheck Fairness Act is about a lot more than fixing a couple of loopholes. It's about strengthening families, combating poverty, and finally recognizing that equal work deserves equal pay. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which will provide the additional tools that we need to stamp out gender-based wage discrimination once and for all.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, while I cannot support H.R. 1585, this legislation does contain the provisions of H.R. 3481, the ``Support for Injured Servicemembers Act,'' a bill that I introduced in the House and which amends the Family and Medical Leave Act to provide 6 months of leave for spouses, children, parents and other ``next of kin'' to care for injured service members. H.R. 3481 implements one of the recommendations of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors, chaired by Secretary Shalala and Senator DOLE. 
   The Family and Medical Leave Act is intended to help individuals balance their family and work obligations. Ninety million working people are now eligible for unpaid job protected leave for up to 12 weeks a year. When the Act was passed in 1993, it was a giant step and is of great importance to working families. 
   Since a majority of military spouses work, they too must balance work and family. They work to put food on the table and support their families, just like the rest of us. But they face additional challenges because their lives are disrupted by multiple deployments, involving not only active service members but those in the National Guard and reserves as well. 
   The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in over 30,000 casualties with many servicemembers being seriously wounded. These injured warriors need substantial support and care from their families, often for long periods of time, and some permanently. 
   The Workforce Protections Subcommittee, which I chair, held a hearing in September on H.R. 3481. We heard from several witnesses about the need for extended family and medical leave in these instances. 
   Unfortunately, this Administration has let down our returning service members and their families. Therefore, I introduced H.R. 3481, so no matter where we come down on the merits of these conflicts, we can help families who support loved ones who put their lives on the line in Iraq and Afghanistan. The provisions of H.R. 3481 will certainly help.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IRS EQUALS IRAQ REVENUE SUPPLIERS -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, today is April 15, Tax Day. Right now, millions of Americans are hurrying to report their incomes to the IRS. Usually, ``IRS'' stands for ``Internal Revenue Service,'' but today, it might as well stand for ``Iraq revenue suppliers'' because so much of our tax revenue is paying for the occupation of Iraq. 
   Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winning economist, has calculated the occupation will cost at least $3 trillion. That means that the occupation will cost each of our 300 million citizens $10,000, or an incredible $40,000 for a family of four. 
   America's hardworking families are struggling to keep their heads above water as we sink into a deep, what I  call, Iraq recession. Yet, they're being asked to hand over $40,000, most of which goes to the foreign nations that are lending us the money to keep the occupation going. And that $40,000, Madam Speaker, will get much bigger if the occupation goes on for another few years, for 100 years as some cheerleaders for the occupation are discussing. 
   What have we gotten for our occupation money? General Petraeus told us last week that the security situation in Iraq has gotten much better. But 19 of our incredibly brave soldiers died last week. And our top military leaders continue to warn us that our obsession with Iraq is breaking our military and that we may wake up one day to find that we can't meet a real threat to our national security. 
   Next month, the IRS will mail out economic stimulus checks. I'm glad that that relief is on the way. But the best economic stimulus plan would be to end the occupation of Iraq. The American people agree. A recent New York Times/CBS poll found that 89 percent of the American people believe that the cost of the occupation has contributed to our economic problems. 
   Last month, the Progressive Caucus put forth an alternative budget that showed that we can actually achieve an end to the occupation in Iraq and re-order our spending priorities. The budget is truly remarkable. We were able to fully fund the education that our children deserved and that our Nation must have to remain competitive in the global economy. 
   We were able to invest in green jobs that could employ millions of our citizens and put our Nation on the path to the energy independence we must have to fuel our economy and ensure our national security. And we were able to provide health care coverage to every American who lacks it, not only fulfilling our promise to care for each other, but making our country stronger and more competitive in the process. 
   But instead of revving up these engines of economic growth and social justice, the administration will soon send to Congress yet another request for emergency Iraq funding. This time around, the request will be for $108 billion. 
   Madam Speaker, I agree that we must spend money on Iraq but not the way the administration wants to spend it. It wants an open-ended occupation. Instead, we must fully fund the safe, responsible redeployment of our troops and military contractors out of Iraq. 
   And we must help, not do it all, but we must help to reconstruct Iraq. We've all heard of the so-called Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you own it. We need to expand that saying: If you break it, you have a moral obligation to help rebuild it. 
   It's time for the madness to end, Madam Speaker. It's time to bring our troops home, get our fiscal house in order, give the Iraqi people back their sovereignty and help them rebuild their country and their lives.

   This bill reaffirms our commitment, the United States commitment, to victims of torture. It will provide for essential services for these victims such as treatment of the physical and psychological effects of torture. It will provide for social and legal services. It will provide for research and training of health care providers to deal with the trauma of these victims. 
   Madam Speaker, in a world that sometimes seems to be overrun with violence, a world that sees so much brutality, this bill actually provides hope for a group of people, those who have so little and need so much. 
   I thank the authors of this bill for bringing it forward, and I certainly hope that every single Member of this body will vote in favor of it.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is our job in Congress to make tough decisions. So given the quagmire in Iraq which is costing $273 million every day, and our troops still don't have the training and equipment they need, and given we have critical needs at home that aren't being fully funded, needs like children's health care, rebuilding the gulf coast, keeping our promise to veterans, repairing tornado-ravaged towns and collapsed bridges, and I could go on and on, and you know it. 
   Sadly, we are still spending at least $60 billion every year to build and  maintain weapons that were specifically designed to fight the Soviet Union. It is not exactly the threat we need to worry about in the year 2007. That's why I am offering this amendment to H.R. 1585, an amendment that would require the DOD to identify all weapon systems that are currently being produced that were designed to fight the Cold War, identify their usefulness, and evaluate the cost of savings for eliminating these programs. 
   My amendment wouldn't eliminate a single program. Rather, it is simply asking the Department of Defense to take an inventory of what they are building that was designed to fight the Cold War and report back to Congress. 
   This December will mark the 18th anniversary of a meeting in Malta where the first President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev declared an end to the Cold War. From there, it was another couple of years before the Soviet Union was disbanded, the Berlin Wall came down, and the Iron Curtain collapsed. The Cold War is over. It is time that the Department of Defense realized this and made the proper adjustments in their procurement programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. First I want to thank Congressman Davis and Congresswoman Maloney for this excellent, excellent bill. Thank you, and I know that it has been 10 years in the working, and I also know it is time that it passed. 
   Mr. Speaker, investing in our working families is the very best way we can strengthen our workforce, our economy, and our country. I am the chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, and, as the leader of that committee, and with the hearings we have held, we have learned that the most generous leave policies don't help families who cannot afford to take leave without pay. It's as simple as that. 
   As a Nation, we must support working families, and we can do that by providing them with the help they need to balance their work and their family. No parent should ever be forced to choose between the needs of their family and the needs of their job or the possible loss of that job. 
   I look forward to the day that my own legislation, the Balancing Act, will be passed. The Balancing Act provides working families the help they need to balance work and family, paid leave, increased child care, voluntary universal preschool, school breakfast, afterschool programs, and incentives for flexible work schedules. 
   If children are lucky enough to have two parents, both parents are probably in the workforce. They are working long hours, they are commuting long distances, and these very same parents are working to put food on the table. 
   They put food on the table, but they are quite often not able to be there to eat that food with their families. H.R. 5781 is a perfect example of what we must do as a Nation. It is a step in the right direction. It will prove how important it is to provide leave with pay.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (NO MILITARY SOLUTION TO IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, one of the truest statements about the occupation of Iraq was uttered by one of our own generals. 
   The commander of U.S. troops in Iraq, General David Petraeus, said that there is no military solution in Iraq. In his own words, and I quote him, ``There is no military solution to a problem like that in Iraq, to the insurgency of Iraq.'' 
   I ask all of us, Is this another case of the President not listening to his top brass? When is he going to learn that, despite the brave and courageous efforts of our men and women in uniform, we cannot bomb, we cannot shoot our way to peace in Iraq? 
   General Petraeus even said that we should be refocusing our diplomatic efforts in and around Iraq, saying that talks should include, and I quote him again, ``some of those who have felt the new Iraq did not have a place for them.'' 
   I applaud him for his candor. He sees what is going on on the ground. He knows that the current approach is just not working. 
   The men and women under his command have given so much for this misguided occupation. They went in without armor they needed for their Humvees and even for their own bodily protection. They went in looking for weapons of mass destruction that did not work out too well. They went in to accomplish a mission that was not clearly defined, and there was no exit plan. How can we ask our troops to continue down this road? 
   The Bush administration, as we have seen in the reports about Walter Reed, has even failed our troops when they come home. Shame on the President. Shame on Veterans Affairs Secretary Nicholson. This is not the way to care for those who have given so very much. 
   The American people know what to do, even if lawmakers are slow to act. Overwhelming numbers in poll after poll say that we need to bring our troops home and end this disastrous foray into foreign policy. And we just don't need the polls to tell us that. Look at the calls, look at the letters, look at the e-mails that come into our offices. People are demanding that the White House wake up to reality and put an end to this mission, a mission that was not accomplished. 
   The best way to honor the legacy of those who have given their lives in this occupation is to bring our troops home and work with the international community to strengthen and promote security in Iraq. It is the mandate from the American people, and it is the Congress's moral obligation.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (HOLDING THE ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBLE FOR THE U.S. LEGACY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, it is past time to hold this administration accountable for its actions in Iraq and for its actions throughout the region. 
   Our standing in the world and throughout the Middle East is at an all-time low. And our standing in popularity has just about disappeared. The administration's policies have only brought instability and conflict. The strategy of preemptive war has, and we have seen it, been met with disbelief. It has been met with criticism from all corners of the world. 
   The administration keeps beating the drum of war with Iran, and its inaction in northern Iraq may lead to armed conflict with Turkey. A real leader, an effective Commander in Chief, knows that the use of force should be the very last possible option, not the first. The blame for this sits squarely in the Oval Office. 
   And what about the people the administration was supposed to be liberating? Many live now without the basic services they had for generations: electricity, clean water, basic health care, education. And at least 4 million Iraqis have fled their homes. Many are displaced within their own country, and millions more have escaped to neighboring Iran and Syria. Despite what the administration has claimed, the fault does not lie on the Iraqi people or the international community. Once again the blame belongs one place and one place only: that's with our administration. 
   Let's look at our international human rights record, Mr. Speaker. From Guantanamo to Abu Ghraib, a scandal, to the mercenary Blackwater security forces, the face of American policy emerges as goons, thugs, and cowboys. 
   Or what about torture? The administration says it doesn't promote torture. Yet day in and day out we read news media reports of an administration promoting rendition and ``enhanced interrogation methods.'' These methods allow for everything short of death. The responsibility lies at the feet of one man. Not a general. Not the Justice Department. Not the men and women of the intelligence community. And certainly not the brave men and women who are serving us in Iraq. One man. 
   And it does not get much better here, right here at home, where the administration is pushing for more ways to spy on American citizens. They are attacking their political adversaries by questioning their patriotism. They even outed a covert CIA operative. The President at that time said that anyone caught for such an action would be removed from his staff. Now it turns out that Karl Rove, Richard Armitage, Scooter Libby, and Ari Fleischer didn't count and the administration chose to put them above the law. 
   Once again, Mr. Speaker, we have to ask ourselves who's really to blame. I can only think of one person. 
   And, finally, most shameful of all, the legacy of this occupation of Iraq has left a generation of men and women with physical and mental wounds that may never heal. And how did the administration thank them for their bravery on behalf of our Nation? Walter Reed. Long waits for necessary medical treatment at local VA hospitals. And in some cases, extended deployments. What kind of Commander in Chief would do that? 
   Remember the good old days when past Presidents said, and meant it, that ``the buck stops here,'' the buck stops with them? This administration seems to think the buck stops everywhere but 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for the President to take the responsibility for his actions and turn the tide around, and he can do that by providing our men and women in uniform the equipment they need to come home safely; by funding the safe, responsible, and timely withdrawal of our troops; and by regaining, in turn, our place as a world leader promoting peace and stability. 
   Mr. Speaker, hold this administration accountable. Bring our troops home. End this senseless occupation.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (U.S. TROOP DEPLOYMENT -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, just 10 days ago we celebrated the 4th of July because on that day in 1776, we first declared our Nation's independence and sovereignty. 
   The American people have cherished and fought for that sovereignty for 232 years, so it is only right that we respect the sovereignty of other nations. 
   Last week, Iraq's Prime Minister al-Maliki said that the withdrawal of American troops out of Iraq or a timetable for withdrawal should be part of the current status-of-forces negotiations between his government and the United States. He insisted that the basis for any agreement will be respect for the full sovereignty of Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, this House should affirm Iraq's right to full sovereignty. In fact, my colleague, Representative Lee of California, and I have sent a letter to every Member of the House inviting all Members to cosign a letter to Prime Minister al-Maliki supporting his government's sovereign rights. The letter reads in part as follows: ``We, the undersigned, Members of the United States House of Representatives, write to acknowledge and support the sovereign right of the government of Iraq to insist that any security agreement between the United States and Iraq include a timetable for the complete redeployment of U.S. Armed Forces and military contractors out of Iraq. 
   The letter goes on to say, Mr. Speaker, ``As elected members of the legislative branch of the world's longest continuing democracy, we recognize that it is the national legislature that is responsible for expressing and exercising the sovereign rights and powers that the people have entrusted in their government. 
   ``It is for the free people of Iraq, acting through their elected representatives in the Iraq parliament, to decide for themselves the terms and conditions under which they will agree to the continuing presence of the U.S. Armed Forces and military contractors in their country. And it is for the Congress of the United States to approve the terms and conditions of any security agreement that commits the United States to the defense of Iraq.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Prime Minister al-Maliki's statement for support for withdrawal timetable could very well be the light at the end of the tunnel that the American people have long been waiting for. Ending the occupation of Iraq, which was never an imminent security threat to the United States in the first place, would allow us to refocus on Afghanistan where the real threat lies. It would end the U.S. military occupation in the Middle East that has done so much to strengthen Iran's hand in the region. And it would allow us to redirect tens of billions of dollars back home for desperately needed investments in our economy, our health care, energy independence, education, child care and so much more. 
   The President has often said that as Iraqis stand up, we will stand down. Prime Minister al-Maliki's statement shows that the Iraqis believe they are ready to stand up. Now the ball is in our court. It is time for the President  to prove he meant what he said because if the administration doesn't work with the prime minister in a serious way to withdrawal our troops and military contractors, it will prove what so many of us have feared all along, that the administration has no intention of leaving Iraq ever. 
   Representative Lee and I urge all Members of the House to sign this important letter to Prime Minister al-Maliki. This is a critical moment and a crucial opportunity to end the long, bloody, disastrous occupation of Iraq. We must seize it.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ AND THE ATTACK ON CIVIL LIBERTIES -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, when the President invaded Iraq in 2003, the American people were warned that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction posed a great threat to peace. We were told that launching a preemptive war would not make life harder for the Iraqi people nor compromise the security of the international community. And we were promised that the quick war to liberate Iraq would come at no cost to America's prestige abroad. 
   Five years later, it is painfully clear how very wrong the administration was and how dearly we are still paying for its mistakes. The administration launched a war of choice based on half truths, broken promises, and delusions of a swift and easy victory, but the most shameful of the administration's claims was that we were fighting abroad to protect our freedoms at home. 
   The President argued that sending our Nation's brave servicemen and -women into an unwinnable occupation was the only way we would safeguard our civil liberties. Since then, by repeatedly invoking the possibility of threats to our national security right here at home and abroad, the administration has justified its unprecedented attack on our constitutionally protected freedoms. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can no longer allow these attacks to go unchallenged. After authorizing the National Security Agency to openly violate Federal laws by eavesdropping on Americans, the administration successfully worked to legalize warrantless spying on innocent Americans. After consistently disregarding laws designed to promote public access to information, the administration expanded laws that authorized the government to withhold information from Congress and the American people. 
   After championing the virtues of democratic rule of law, the President has openly condoned torture, denied habeas corpus to prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, and fought every single attempt to hold members and friends of his administration accountable for their actions. 
   This abuse of power at the expense of the rights and freedoms of the American people, often in the name of protecting these very same rights and freedoms, is a shocking betrayal of the will of the American people. 
   Last month, after the House passed legislation ensuring that every contractor in Iraq would be accountable under American criminal law, the administration granted immunity to Blackwater Security employees who were involved in a Baghdad shooting that left 17 civilians dead. 
   This administration will never take responsibility for their actions. It will never end the occupation of Iraq. Instead, the attack on our civil liberties will be the only mission they will have accomplished. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is Congress' responsibility to stand up to this President. We must end the administration's war of choice. We must restore the checks and balances that have been eroded under this President. We must fight for peace and the protection of civil liberties. We must fully fund the safe and orderly withdrawal of all American troops and contractors. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must give Iraq back to the Iraqi people and America back its integrity.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, most of our Nation's students are on summer vacation right now. They are enjoying camp, swimming, playing, or just hanging out and relaxing. Some are even earning a few dollars at a summer job. 
   For their counterparts in Iraq, the school break is just now beginning. Iraqi students have just wrapped up their final exams. This year we learned was very different from last year's exam period. According to reports from relief organizations and a recent article in the Christian Science Monitor, last year's tests were marred by unprecedented incidents of mass cheating, bribe-taking, and sheer lawlessness. In many places, Mr. Speaker, last year we heard that militiamen and insurgents strolled casually into exam centers and forced officials, often at gun point, to allow cheating. 
   Parents feared sending their children to exams. The challenges of just getting to school, making it past militia roadblocks and suicide attackers was one thing; making it through a day full of cheating, intimidation and violence was quite another. One test proctor overseeing a geography high school exam at Baghdad University told the Christian Science Monitor, ``Last year the outlaws took advantage of the brittle security situation and caused unprecedented chaos during the final exams. It was truly a mark of utter shame on our education system as a whole.'' 
   Another Iraqi reported that militiamen stormed into an exam hall to force proctors to let students cheat. When one headmaster objected, he was briefly kidnapped and threatened by the militiamen until he relented. 
   Students were woefully underprepared for their exams, Mr. Speaker. One observer told the media that anguished-looking girls came out of the exam room complaining not only about how difficult the questions were, but also about their preparation. They said it is not fair, we didn't even have a chemistry teacher all year, and we are being tested on chemistry. 
   This year, thankfully, it appears that the neighborhoods are much more secure. An overwhelming presence of military and law enforcement appears to have kept interfering forces at bay during the testing. The situation is still not ideal, however, because many students have to travel great distances daily. But generally, the situation is somewhat, if not a great deal, better. 
   Iraq has a rich educational history, Mr. Speaker. Until the years of the first Gulf War, Iraq led the region in academics and produced internationally recognized leaders in the fields of law, medicine and theology. But the challenges are still great. 
   The Ministry of Human Rights reported at the end of June that 340 academics were killed in and around Iraq from 2005 to 2007. And according to the Ministry of Education, 28 percent of Iraq's 17 year olds in the center and southern part of the country took their final exams in the year 2007, but only 40 percent passed. That was a decrease from 2006 when the figure was 60 percent passing. 
   We already know that this administration gets a failing grade on its Iraq policy. However, we don't need to condemn a generation of Iraq's future leaders. We should be investing in schools, not in tanks and guns. We must redeploy our troops and military contractors from Iraq, and we must work peacefully to help with their reconciliation. Mr. Speaker, let's send the children to school, not to war.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (HONORING NELSON MANDELA ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1090 honoring Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela as he celebrates 90 years of life. 
   Mr. Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in Transkei, South Africa, where he was given the name Rolihlahla, meaning ``troublemaker,'' which would later seem so fitting. Throughout his early adulthood, he developed his own ideas about the oppression he had experienced which led him to join the African National Congress. His work with the ANC led him to be tried for treason. He was acquitted of the charges, but his strong opposition to South African apartheid continued. 
   His fight against racial segregation came to sudden halt when he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly plotting to overthrow the South African government. 
   However, 27 years in prison could not diminish the spirit of a great leader. Once released from prison, Mr. Mandela wasted no time in becoming involved with the ANC once again. It was no surprise that this revolutionary man would become the next President of the ANC in 1990, continuing to devote himself to a multi-racial democracy for his country. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Mandela embodies the dignity, strength, and leadership that all of us should strive for. Our country was founded on the values of freedom and liberty for all, personified undoubtedly by Mr. Mandela. He grasped these ideals and fought to make them a reality for South Africa through commitment unsurpassed by others. The dedication Mr. Mandela displayed, despite the many challenges he encountered, is deserving of our highest respect. 
   Mr. Mandela has undisputedly contributed to tremendous change with his efforts to peacefully resolve conflicts throughout the world. It is with great pleasure that I commend Mr. Mandela for his lifetime commitment to promoting the vision of freedom and equality for the people of South Africa.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ: THE VOICES OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, like all of my colleagues, I have received thousands of e-mails, letters, faxes and  phone calls about the ongoing occupation of Iraq. So many of them are touching, and they are impassioned. They urge me, they call on me, and they even beg me to get the administration to bring our troops home, and to allow the Iraqis to restore the security of their Nation. 
   Last week I received a set of letters that stood out among all of them, from Ms. Rene King's students at Sheppard School in Santa Rosa, California. Most of the children are 9 through 13 years old, yet their thoughts are mature and beyond their age. In fact, their words speak so much truth, a truth which we can absolutely not ignore. 
   From Marcos, 10 years old, ``Can you please stop the war in Iraq? Because the people in Iraq aren't safe. Their villages and houses are destroyed. I do not like fighting.'' 
   From Arturo, 11 years old. ``Can you please stop the war in Iraq? There is a lot of killing, a lot of people have died. People want to get out of fighting. I feel sad when people die.'' 
   From Freddy, 11 years old. ``Can you please stop the war in Iraq? I do not like fighting and killing people. Some people are dead. Don't send my people, please. We don't like to fight all the people. The people are sad. We need to save money for poor people here in America. Ms. King (my teacher) is sad. Stop sending people into the war.'' 
   From Tony, 11 years old. ``Can you please stop the war in Iraq? There are a lot of sad and crying families. I feel sad in our country. I don't like when people are mad at our country. I do not feel safe and other people do not feel safe.'' 
   From Genaro, age 13, ``Can you please stop the war in Iraq? There is a lot of killing. More than 3,000 Americans have died. Stop sending people to the war. We need to save the money for poor people here in America.'' 
   From Yovany, age 12, ``Can you please stop the war in Iraq? There is a lot of killing. We need to save money for the poor people. More than 600,000 Iraqis have died. Please stop sending people to the war.'' 
   From Jose, 10 years old. ``Can you please stop the war in Iraq? The people of Iraq aren't safe in their villages, and houses are destroyed. More than 3,000 Americans have died. Please stop sending people to war.'' 
   From Tomas, age 9, ``Can you please stop the war in Iraq? There is a lot of killing. A lot of people have died. More than 3,000 Americans have died. Families are being broken apart.'' 
   From Steven, age 12. ``Can you stop the war, please? A lot of people have died. Please, I don't like wars. No one feels safe. If you keep sending soldiers, more people will be sad.'' 
   One student, Angelina, wrote directly to the President, and here is what she wrote. ``I think you are making a big mistake. I like you, but your choices make me mad. You need to ask your people about war. I know these people said they will serve the Army. They never said they wanted to die there. If you were ever able to run again, Mr. President, I would not vote for you. I wish I could say you are helping, but you are not. There is another way to handle things other than guns and bombs. I think you should be more like Martin Luther King, Jr., Mr. President. He thought there was another way to handle things than war. I think the United States needs a different President.'' 
   These words are honest, these words are true. If only more people listen to the children, the future of this Nation may be different. What a better world we could be living in.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (10,000 TEACHERS, 10 MILLION MINDS SCIENCE AND MATH SCHOLARSHIP ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, innovation in math, science, and technology is the way America will stay strong and competitive in this century. Unfortunately, we are seeing our children's test scores slip behind the rest of the industrialized world. In a recent exam to test the real-world application ability of mathematical concepts, U.S. high-school students ranked 24th out of 40 countries that were tested. 
   As a mother and grandmother, I want all of our Nation's children to have the best possible education to empower them to be whatever they choose to be when they grow up. I can't help but be concerned with the idea that the America they will inherit will not be able to compete on the highest levels of the global marketplace. We must stem the tide of dropping test scores and fewer and fewer qualified teachers of science and math. 
   That's why I rise in support of H.R. 362, the 10,000 minds, 10 million Science and Math Scholarship Act. It's not enough that we have the scientists to drive the innovation to keep us competitive. We also need to be producing the educators to mentor and impart wisdom to our youth so that they can expand their fields of knowledge, innovate new technologies, discover new medicines, and answer questions we once thought unanswerable. 
   In a global economy, competition is going to keep increasing, and unless we take definitive action to increase our science and math capabilities, we are going to be left behind. H.R. 362, under the leadership of Chairman GORDON, is part of the definitive action we must take to get more qualified teachers in place to ensure that our kids have the knowledge and skills at hand to continue to lead the world.  
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 362 and to help put America on track to remain strong, competitive, and well-educated in math and science.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (LET'S LEAVE NO VETERAN BEHIND -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, the civil war in Iraq has devastated the colleges and the universities in that country. It is estimated that thousands of students and professors have been forced to flee the violence, cutting short their studies and their academic careers. 
   A humanitarian organization called the Iraqi Student Project is trying to help. It's working with 15 American universities to identify quality Iraqi students and provide them with a tuition-free education here in the United States. The project, which was created by two Americans based in the Middle East, is modeled on the Bosnian Student Project of the 1990s, a project that brought approximately 150 Bosnian students to American colleges. 
   This Friday, Madam Speaker, I will have the honor of delivering the commencement address at the graduation ceremonies for Dominican University's graduate students. I'm proud to say that Dominican University in my district is one of the institutions working with the Iraqi Student Project. Dominican anticipates admitting two Iraqi students in September and waiving their tuition. Upon graduation, it is hoped that the students will return to Iraq to help that devastated country rebuild. 
   In the coming days, this House will have the chance to show that we, too, have the right priorities. We will be considering the 21st Century GI Bill. This is a bipartisan proposal that would provide a college education to our brave troops when they return from the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   After World War II, Madam Speaker, the GI Bill sent millions of veterans to college. Everyone agrees it was one of the best investments our country has ever made. It fueled the post-war economic boom, vastly expanded our country's middle class, and made good of our Nation's solemn promise to care for our veterans. 
   But today, the GI Bill covers just half of the average cost of a college education. The proposed legislation would provide coverage for the full costs of going to a public university, and it would help with the cost of attending private university. 
   The need for this bill is great. It will help make the transition back to civilian life easier for our veterans and for their families. Many of those who have already returned home are unemployed or underemployed. They need a college education to help them succeed in the workplace, and our Nation, we need them to succeed to keep our economy strong. 
   But surprise, surprise. The administration doesn't share this view. Secretary of Defense Gates has expressed opposition to expanding education benefits. He has said that it would cause retention problems in the military because it would encourage troops to leave the service. I believe, Madam Speaker, that our troops have already done quite enough to help the military achieve its retention goals. Many of our troops have served two, three, and four tours of duty, and the number of troops who have been forced to stay in the service involuntarily through the Pentagon's Stop-Loss policies is actually rising in spite of the Army's promise to cut the number. 
   Our troops have done all that we have asked of them. They've done it again and again and again. It is true that the occupation of Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point, but the solution to the problem is to end the occupation, not to ask our brave troops to give up their futures and not to ask them to give up a chance to get a college education. 
   The 21st Century GI Bill is the right thing to do for our veterans and the smart thing to do for our country. It's a win-win, and it has strong bipartisan support, and it will leave no veteran behind.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (BRING OUR TROOPS HOME -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow this House will begin a debate on Iraq. This is the first of a series of debates that we must have on the House floor. It is a resolution. It reflects President Bush's plan to escalate the occupation of Iraq, and it will be a clean up or down vote. 
   I commend the Democratic leadership for providing a time for every single Member of this body to come to the floor and have their say. If you support escalation, you vote ``yes.'' If not, you vote ``no.'' I will support the legislation as a very important first step in this debate. 
   But after that, Congress must go on record in opposition of the war in general. First we have to go on record in opposition of escalation, and then we must change our course and lay out a plan to bring our troops home. There have been many, many ideas, both inside and outside of Congress, to plan for an end to this occupation of Iraq. 
   Few are as comprehensive as H.R. 508, the Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Act. I introduced this bill last month and have 34, 35 cosponsors today, with more interest expressed every single day. 
   H.R. 508 will end the occupation of Iraq within 6 months of passage. It will accelerate the training and equipping of Iraqi military and security forces while preparing to bring our troops and contractors out of Iraq safely. 
   It will commit to working with the international community to assist the Iraqis in rebuilding and in reconciliation if they agree and want us to be there. H.R. 508 will fully fund the health care commitment to our returning veterans. Additionally, the bill revokes the President's Iraq war powers, prevents the establishment of permanent bases in Iraq, and returns the oil rights to the Iraqi people. 
   We owe it to our brave men and brave women in uniform and to the Iraqi people to bring our troops home now. Let us be honest, the Iraqis don't want us there. They view us as an occupying force. They want to be strengthening their security forces, and they want to establish a reliable and dependable infrastructure and provide for their most basic needs like sanitation, health care, and education. 
   We can assist them; but in the end, Iraq must belong to the Iraqi people. Having learned from our past, we will never turn our backs on the returning troops, those who have been put in an unimaginable position. They have seen death; they have seen destruction up close, in a way many of us will never understand. They are returning with scars, both visible and invisible. The least we can do is fulfill our commitment to them by fully funding the medical services they have been promised. This is not a gift we are giving them. This is a right, this is an entitlement. 
   So I rise tonight, and I will rise again during the three days of debate to signal my support for the upcoming resolution as a very important first step: my support for the troops and their promised benefits, my support for the American people, who want our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (A MANDATE FOR CHANGE -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, November 7, the American public sent a powerful, unmistakable message to their elected leaders in Washington. 
   They want change. They are fed up with the corruption and sick of the infighting. But most importantly, voters, with a strong and decisive voice, demanded a change in our government's Iraq policy. 
   Last Wednesday, when the President addressed the Nation, and again last night when he came to this Chamber and called for an increase in troops, without mentioning an exit plan or a plan to care for our returning veterans, he proved yet again that he isn't going to listen to the voters. He doesn't care about what the polls say about the ordinary person and not liking what he is doing in Iraq. He won't listen to his commanders. And, in fact, those who disagree with him are either fired or transferred. And his own Republican Party that is coming out against this occupation in Iraq are being ignored. 
   In giving Democrats a majority, Mr. Speaker, Americans did not give my party a mandate simply to work with the President, or to wait for cues from any blue ribbon committee. No, the people told us to correct the President, challenge the President, and to confront the President on the moral challenge of our times. 
   The message is clear. The American public has directed the Congress to be  bold, to change course in Iraq and having our main goal be that of bringing our troops home. 
   Yet there remains a debate within this Congress on what it means to oppose the war. There are some who claim to oppose it, even while arguing that we cannot bring our troops home right away, that to do so would be catastrophic. But how could it get more catastrophic than fueling a devastating, homegrown insurgency in Iraq? The catastrophe is continuing to foment a civil war, a war that is tearing a proud nation apart at the seams. 
   This current policy is the catastrophe. Staying the course at this point will only plunge Iraq further into the abyss, costing thousands more American and Iraqi lives. 
   There are others who claim that while they oppose the war, they support the troops, and, they say, supporting a withdrawal would dishonor them. But is it honoring these brave men and women, some of the best America has to offer, to leave them in a dangerous, unwinnable situation? No. Honoring them means bringing them home to their families and strengthening a Veterans Administration health care system that has been all but laid to waste by the Bush administration in recent years. 
   Every day that we remain in Iraq is a day that we shortchange our priorities right here at home. This occupation has already cost over $300 billion, approximately $11 million every hour of every day, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. The total cost is now projected to surpass the cost of the entire Vietnam war. 
   This is an astronomical, irresponsible sum, a sum that would be better used here at home to improve our schools, provide quality health care, put Americans back to work and help Iraq rebuild its economy and its infrastructure. 
   In January of 2005, I came down here to the floor of the United States House of Representatives and, as the first Member of Congress, demanded that the President put together a plan to bring our troops home. Since then I have followed up with public forums, resolutions, forced votes and these nightly speeches, which tonight makes 181, all designed to build support for a movement to end the occupation. 
   Many times along the way, and going as far back as 2002, when we first debated the Iraq invasion, the right wing and their media mouthpieces greeted me and other antiwar leaders with the usual smears and jeers. But who will history judge as calling this one correctly? 
   Everyone but the blindest Bush-Cheney loyalist recognizes that Iraq has been an unmitigated disaster, a strategic blunder and moral failing of historic proportions.  
   Today, because of the pressure applied by the anti-war camp, I stand with the majority of the American public and with a growing number of elected leaders from both parties in opposing this occupation. 
   We were right in 2002, and we are still right--withdrawing our troops is the only humane, sensible option we have left. 
   Congress has the power to end this occupation. We must stand up to our responsibility and bring every pressure to bear on this administration. We must use every lever and pursue any avenue to hold them accountable for their immeasurable failures in Iraq. 
   This is not just another priority for the new Congress. According to the voters who have elected us, this is the 110th Congress' most solemn duty. 
   That is why last week, along with 25 of my colleagues, I introduced the ``Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act.'' This is the only comprehensive bill that will provide for a safe return of our troops, strengthen Iraqi institutions and provide for our veterans. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 508 today and to send a clear message to our President that--in absence of a real plan from him--Congress is ready to bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, China is facing growing criticism for its record on human rights. It has been condemned for its recent crackdown on Tibet, its oppression of dissidents at home, and its support for the regime in Sudan that is responsible for the genocide in Darfur. 
   Russia is another country that has received justifiable criticism for cracking down on freedom. President Putin has rolled back many of the democratic gains Russia made after the Cold War. And the recent elections in Russia were a sham, clearly rigged to favor Putin's candidate. 
   Because of all of this, you would think that the people of the world would have a much higher opinion of the United States, the world's greatest democracy, than they would have of anti-democratic China and Russia. But that just isn't the case. Incredibly, according to the most recent annual survey of international attitudes, America is viewed more negatively around the world than China and Russia. 
   The Study of World Opinion was conducted by the BBC World Survey. According to the BBC, America's image abroad plummeted after our invasion of Iraq in the year 2003, and continued to decline in the following years. 
   The latest survey, which was released on April 1, however, has shown some good news. America's image is a little better than it was last year. But it is not because the world has suddenly changed its opinion about the Bush administration and its policies in Iraq. 
   The director of the survey was quoted as saying, ``It may be that, as  the U.S. approaches a new presidential election, views of the U.S. are being mitigated by hope that a new administration will move away from foreign policies that have been so unpopular in the world.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, what the world thinks of America matters. And it is not just because we want to win popularity contests. It is far more serious than that. Our ability to lead the world is badly damaged when our reputation is in tatters. We cannot lead the world in the fight against terrorism when so many people in the world, even our best friends, believe that we are a threat to peace ourselves. We cannot lead the world in the fight against the many other global problems, including poverty, disease, climate change, and the lack of educational opportunity when we have lost our moral authority and credibility. 
   When you go to war under false pretenses, devastate a nation that never attacked you, and condone torture, you don't make America stronger, you make America weaker, because you undermine values that are the real source of our strength. America's great values are democracy, the rule of law, peace, and compassion for the people of the world. Our occupation of Iraq has trampled on all of these values. The veto of Congress' effort to outlaw waterboarding is just the latest example of what I am talking about. 
   And what was gained by trashing our values? Nothing. A report written by the National Defense University, the Pentagon's premier military educational institute, called our occupation of Iraq a major debacle. 
   Mr. Speaker, 92 Members of the House have written to the President to tell him that we will fully fund the responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq, but we will not approve another penny to support the disastrous policy of open-ended occupation. 
   After more than 5 years of occupation, it is time for us to redeem America's reputation, restore our values, rebuild Iraq, and lead the world in the fight for peace once again.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IRAQ AND THE PROPOSED BUSH ESCALATION -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, first of all, congratulations for being up in that chair. 
   I rise today to unwaveringly support the Speaker of the House, who has said that she opposes any escalation of the occupation of Iraq, that she opposes sending more combat troops into a situation in Iraq that is so, so messy. 
   The Speaker represents an overwhelming majority viewpoint among the American people. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, she is Speaker today because the American people overwhelmingly rejected the Bush occupation policy, a policy that has already claimed over 3,000 American lives, cost us hundreds of billions of dollars, ignited a bloody civil war, and diminished our national security. 
   But President Bush is stubbornly and desperately clinging onto an ideological vision that has been completely discredited. He is not listening to the new Congress. He is not listening to the American people. He is not listening to the Iraq Study Group. He is not even listening to his military commanders, who have advised against an escalation. 
   Even the most hawkish observer imaginable, Oliver North, has come out against an escalation in a recent column entitled: ``More Troops Equals More Targets.'' 
   This occupation takes a more disastrous turn with each passing week, but the Bush administration not only is sticking to its failed policy; it is investing even more in that policy. 
   Our military presence, from the very beginning, hasn't brought peace and freedom to Iraq. It has been a catalyst for greater violence and disorder. It hasn't defeated the insurgency. It has been what has motivated the insurgency. It hasn't solved problems in Iraq. It has exacerbated them. 
   So what is the White House's solution? Send more troops and put more Americans in harm's way, even though the American presence destabilized Iraq in the first place. Escalation defies common sense, Mr. Speaker. It is  completely incomprehensible. The President of the United States has a unique take on an old proverb. He believes that if you find yourself in a hole, the solution is to keep on digging. 
   Here in Congress, however, we want to stop digging. On Friday, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Out of Iraq Caucus will co-host a forum featuring former Senator George McGovern and Mideast expert Dr. William Polk. They will be discussing their plan for ending the occupation, as outlined in their recent book, ``Out of Iraq: A Practical Plan For Withdrawal Now.'' 
   We will also be joined by leaders from the military, and from diplomatic and intelligence communities, who will offer their expertise and input in a dialogue with Senator McGovern and Dr. Polk. 
   It is time for a 180-degree turn in the U.S. policy toward Iraq. It is time for the Congress to act out the mandate it received from the American people in November. It is time to get down to business and figure out how to extricate ourselves from Iraq, end the occupation and bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT: END THE OCCUPATION -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, last week British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that more than 1,600 British soldiers would be sent home from Iraq. By recalling troops from Iraq, the British government has sent a very clear message that increasing the number of troops is not the right strategy. In fact, the British government has come to the same conclusion that many Americans have reached almost 4 years ago. We should be ending the military occupation of Iraq, not expanding it. We should be supporting the men and women who have served bravely in Iraq by sending them home, not sending them back for their fourth or their fifth tour of duty after only a very few months of spending time with their families. 
   The British government's decision to scale back its military commitment in Iraq should have been another important wake up call to President Bush. However, the President has continued his course to go it alone, regardless of the staggering costs to our Nation. 
   President Bush has drained America's reservoir of goodwill by ignoring the facts on the ground, the advice of his generals, and the will of the American public. By stubbornly pursuing the same misguided policies over and over again, he has left it to Congress to stop him. 
   Two weeks ago, the House took an important first step by overwhelmingly passing a bipartisan resolution condemning the President's decision to send more than 20,000 additional American soldiers to the front lines. I commend the Democratic leadership, and I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for having the courage to stand up to the President and to oppose his escalation. This vote, however, is only the first step. 
   Now that the House has stood up to disagree with the President, we must use this consensus to take on the urgent job of bringing our troops safely home. 
   As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a co founder of the Out of Iraq Caucus, I have introduced a comprehensive and detailed plan to end the occupation while ensuring that we achieve security and stability in Iraq. My bill, H.R. 508, the Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act, now has 47 cosponsors. 
   H.R. 508 will provide for a fully funded withdrawal of U.S. troops and contractors from Iraq within a 6-month period. During the time of that 6-month passage, our troops will return home to receive the full health care benefits they deserve because we owe them, we owe them no less for their sacrifices. And while they are coming home, we will be putting those laws into place, ensuring they get their benefits. 
   Also during that 6-month withdrawal period, our government will accelerate the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces, and if requested by the Iraqi government, we will work with the international community to provide a stabilization force to enhance Iraq's security. 
   Additionally, my bill would prohibit the establishment of permanent U.S. bases in Iraq, and we would return control of Iraq's oil resources to the Iraqi people. The only way to restore stability to Iraq is to return the country to the Iraqis, and we must work with our allies to achieve this. But when the Bush administration, in spite of all the advice to the contrary, decides to escalate the occupation, and the British government takes the sensible path of withdrawal, they both can't be right. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to wait for the President to realize his mistake. Too many brave men and brave women have died and suffered to continue this occupation. We must stand up, we must demand, we must bring our troops home. That is how we can protect our troops.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, the patent reform bill before us today is a necessary step to modernize and streamline our patent process to ensure American innovation will keep our country competitive. It's been over 50 years since we have updated our patent process. That's before the Internet, before personal computers, and before digital music. Actually, it's 5 years before they launched Sputnik. So, there can be no doubt that reforming the system to accommodate a new era of innovation is needed. 
   Although this bill isn't perfect, I think that it does move the ball forward in terms of reforming the system. Clearly, additional patent reform is needed in the pharmaceutical and biomedical industry as there are many issues left unresolved by H.R. 1908. Hopefully these issues can be addressed in conference with the Senate. 
   Mr. Chairman, I commend my colleagues on the Judiciary committee for all of their hard work on this bill, it's been fifty-five years in the making, and it's time for an update.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I support S. 2499, the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007. It's important that Congress pass this legislation today to ensure that our Nation's poorest children retain their health insurance and doctors who take care of our seniors on Medicare do not receive a 10 percent cut in reimbursements. 
   It's deeply disappointing that this bill doesn't address the issue of the Medicare physician geographic payment discrepancy that is faced by many areas in California and across the country. One of these areas is Sonoma County, in my District. This inconsistency has led to doctor's reimbursements being based upon their geographic location and not the true cost of providing services. Because of this discrepancy, doctors in Sonoma County receive a lower payment for the same services than doctors in next door Marin County and this discrepancy is causing doctors to leave Sonoma County. Congress needs to act to fix this discrepancy and ensure that physicians with Medicare patients can continue to afford to see their patients regardless of where their practice is located. 
   Because of the Republican led efforts, the bill only delays a real solution to the Medicare physician payment cuts that all doctors are facing. We can and must do better for our seniors. When the Medicare extension expires in June, we owe it to our seniors and physicians to replace it with a permanent fix to the physician payment cuts and payment discrepancies. 
   With this bill, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) will be extended and states will receive enough funding to keep all the children currently enrolled on SCHIP from being removed from the program. But, this bill doesn't help the millions more children whose families cannot afford health insurance and who should be covered under SCHIP. Earlier this year, Congress passed an SCHIP bill that would have given 4 million more children healthcare, for a total of 10 million children receiving healthcare on SCHIP. However, the Administration showed that its priorities are completely out of line with the rest of this country when it vetoed that legislation. We need to do better for our nation's children and provide all of them with the healthy start and security that SCHIP can provide. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and look forward to working with them to provide a permanent solution to the Medicare physician payment issues and in ensuring that every child in America is insured.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (A CRISIS FOR IRAQ'S CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, every parent, every parent, whether living in the United States or in Iraq, wants only the best for their children. They want their kids to feel safe and to have the very best of everything. And every parent wants their child to get a quality education. 
   Worldwide over 100 million children do not attend school. Unfortunately, the trends of school attendance in Iraq are very discouraging. According to recent UNICEF reports, high levels of street violence and lawlessness are keeping school attendance levels, particularly of girls, to low levels. 
   Often because families can no longer afford to keep their children in school, girls are pulled out to assist their families with household work and to look after younger siblings while their brothers finish school. 
   The large refugee crisis is another impediment to education. UNHCR estimates that 500,000 school-age Iraqi children now live in neighboring countries. This could put a severe strain on neighboring countries' schools and their school systems, that is, if children are even allowed to attend school while living as a refugee. Additionally, refugee families often do not have money for tuition, and refugee children may not speak the local language. 
   This summer, the United Nations launched a global appeal for $129 million to get more Iraqi refugee children into schools. This is just a Band-Aid, Mr. Speaker, on the situation. 
   Until Iraq is stabilized and families can return to their homes, we're going to have a generation of children who have lived their lives on the run, without feeling safe and without an education. 
   In a nation with a rich legacy of education, a nation that has produced some of the world's leading doctors, architects and artists, parents are watching their children denied an education? This is not the future we want for American children, and it is not the future we want for Iraqi children. 
   Iraqis of all ages deserve a safe and secure future and one that is enriched by education. 
   We know how to provide that future, and it's by ending the occupation and returning sovereignty to Iraq. If this administration would only listen to the Congress, or even to the Iraqi people themselves, they would see that there is overwhelming support to bring our troops home. 
   This does not mean that we would end our commitment to the Iraqi people. In fact, the American people have a long history of generosity and great humanitarian works. Our dedication to the children of Iraq would not end with our military presence. Iraq is only made less stable with an endless American occupation, and our very presence appears to be inspiring even more insurgents. 
   Let's do what is in the best interests of the United States and of Iraq. Let's renew our humanitarian commitment to the Iraqi people. Let's end this misguided occupation. Let's bring our troops and military contractors home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IRAQ HAS BECOME THE ``FORGOTTEN WAR'' -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, after more than 5 years of occupation, America continues to have over 140,000 troops in Iraq. We continue to employ tens of thousands of military contractors. Over 1,200 Iraqi civilians died in the violence this summer alone, and there are still over 4 million refugees. Yet, Iraq is becoming the ``Forgotten War.'' We barely hear about it anymore. I have not forgotten Iraq. I will not forget it. 
   I rise today to remind the House of two things: First, America continues to occupy a country that never attacked the United States and was never a security threat to us; and second, we continue to spend over $10 billion a month in Iraq, at a time when the American people are losing their homes, their health care, and their jobs. 
   Everyone who is forgetting Iraq should read the recent report of the Government Accountability Office. GAO offers a harsh assessment of the administration's handling of the occupation, and warns that the security environment in Iraq remains volatile and dangerous. 
   The GAO report describes many problems. Only 24 percent of the Iraqi funds budgeted for reconstruction have been spent. Essential services to the Iraqi people continue to lag. The daily supply of electricity meets only half the need. The Iraqi ministries responsible for essential services spent only 11 percent of their capital investment budgets in 2007. Many of the benchmarks for progress have just not been met. 
   Perhaps worst of all, the administration has failed to develop a plan for improving the delivery of government services in Iraq. And to make matters worse, the GAO has urged the Defense Department and the State Department to work together to come up with such a plan, but both departments have refused to do so. 
   Many of the points made by the GAO were also made by former Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi when he testified before Chairman Delahunt and the Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight just last month. Prime Minister Allawi said, ``Progress continues to be very slow, if not stagnant, for public services and the economy, which includes the provision of electricity, water supply, health services and creating job opportunities.'' 
   Iraq continues to be a humanitarian disaster area, Mr. Speaker. A recent story in the press reported that Iraq needs 100,000 doctors, but has only 15,500. Many doctors fled after our invasion in 2003. A country that has seen over 5 years of bloodshed, obviously needs a good health care system. Iraq's health care system is in chaos. 
   Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing that the Iraq occupation is making things better when, in reality, it's making things worse because it delays the day that Iraq can really get back on its feet. 
   Ending the occupation would allow us to focus more resources on reconstruction and humanitarian efforts. It would allow regional and international partners to come into Iraq to help with reconstruction and reconciliation, because those countries simply won't get involved until we redeploy. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's time to end the occupation once and for all. It's time to shake off our amnesia and remember the forgotten war.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (RETURN SOVEREIGNTY TO IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I have believed for a long time now that the best way to bring peace to Iraq is to launch a diplomatic surge to encourage regional and international partners to get involved in addressing Iraq's problems. 
   The first step in this process would be to withdraw all of our troops and military contracts, which would create a positive climate, a climate that would allow diplomatic efforts to actually begin. But today, the administration is taking our country in quite the opposite direction. It is negotiating long-term security arrangements with the Iraqi Government, arrangements that could actually keep us bogged down in Iraq for decades and destroy Iraq's sovereignty.  
   It is hard to know exactly what the administration is demanding in the negotiations because it has refused to share the information with Congress. Reports, however, and whatever we can find out, indicates that the administration is asking for unilateral authority over all U.S. military operations in Iraq, the right to arrest and detain Iraqi citizens, legal immunity for American military contractors, control over Iraqi borders and air space, and perhaps permanent bases, making Iraq a virtual American colony. 
   All this has brought a wave of protest from Iraqis of all political and religious stripes. It seems that we have finally succeeded in uniting the Iraqis against us. An Iraqi Government spokesman actually has said, ``The Iraqi Government's vision differs from that of the Americans, who think the agreements will give them almost totally a free hand in Iraq, and that, as a military force, they must have absolute powers.'' 
   In addition, members of the Iraqi Parliament representing the majority of parties in that body wrote a letter to the Congress which was released just last week by my colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, Representative Delahunt, the chairman on the Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight. This letter includes a demand for the withdrawal of American troops. It said, in part, that ``the majority of Iraqi representatives strongly reject any military security, economic, commercial, agricultural investment or political agreement with the United States that is not linked to clear mechanisms that obligate the occupying American military forces to fully withdraw from Iraq in accordance with the declared timetable, and without leaving any military bases, soldiers, or hired fighters.'' 
   Madam Speaker, by moving for a permanent military presence in Iraq, the administration is sending the wrong message to the Iraqi people. The American people are also getting that message, along with the rest of the world. It says to the Iraqi people that they will continue to live under foreign military occupation with no end in sight. It tells the American people that the occupation will continue to drain our resources at a time when our citizens are facing dire economic problems at home. And it proves to the world that the administration is determined to tie the next President to the failed policies of the past. 
   The best course for America is to begin the immediate, responsible redeployment of our troops and military contractors out of Iraq, as this House has mandated. But since the administration is clearly unwilling to do that, the next best thing is for Congress to demand full knowledge of the negotiations, with the right to approve any agreements. 
   Madam Speaker, the United States must give full national sovereignty back to Iraq, and we must stop acting like an arrogant occupying power. After more than 5 years of bloody occupation, this is no time to talk about staying in Iraq forever. Instead, it is time to give the Iraq people back their independence. And it is time to bring our brave troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Congresswoman Watson. And I want to thank Chairman Conyers for organizing this special order and for his leadership on universal health care. 
   I am glad to join with my colleague, DIANE WATSON, and JAN SCHAKOWSKY is here, and we just heard from SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, to highlight the need for health care for not just some Americans but all Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, more than 47 million Americans are uninsured, an increase of 6 million since this administration took office. Nearly 10 million of those uninsured are children, children under the age of 18. It is unforgivable that a country as wealthy as the United States of America cannot find a way to provide health insurance to its entire population. 
   Actually, when there is a will, there is said to be a way. So the United States must not have the will to provide health coverage to every single American. 
   Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, are important safety nets for children whose families cannot afford to purchase health insurance. However, even with these programs, 10 million children still lack health insurance. Currently, Healthy Families, which is what CHIP is called in the State of California, Healthy Families serves 1.2 million children, more than 10,000 children in my district. And last year we, the Congress, had the opportunity to expand CHIP to provide services to nearly 4 million more children. This legislation would have provided health care to an additional 607,000 children in California, and would have provided CHIP coverage to many of the 5,000 children without health insurance in my district. 
   Unfortunately, however, the administration recklessly vetoed this expansion. Imagine when the United States is spending over $338 million a day in Iraq, we can't find $35 million over 5 years. So divide that, 5 into 35 is 7, so that would be $7 million a year to provide an additional 4 million children with health insurance. 
   What are these priorities? 
   No child should be denied quality care because his or her parent cannot afford to purchase health insurance. No parent should have to choose between medicine for his or her child and food on the table. 
   Mr. Speaker, even if we are able to insure every child, that still leaves nearly 40 million Americans without health insurance. We hear stories every day about people who lack medical care and whose only option is to go to our already overcrowded emergency rooms to seek care. Our Nation's health centers, hospitals and emergency rooms are doing everything they can to provide medical care to the uninsured and underinsured, but they cannot fill the need. 
   Actually, when an emergency room is the care center, the underinsured and uninsured do not get access to important preventive care and they do not get access to screenings to prevent disease or catch and treat them early. The shame is that we can detect and treat diseases when caught and treated early. So many uninsured, for example, who are surviving cancer and other serious diseases could have been treated with access to screenings and treatment. 
   No one should have to put off important medical screenings like a mammogram because she cannot afford the cost and doesn't have the time for a wait list for free screenings. If a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, she should not have to choose between food on the table or rent. What an awful choice to be asked to make, particularly if you have a family to support. No one should be denied necessary medical care because they cannot afford it. We must refocus our priorities. We must use the money that we are spending on Iraq to invest in our Nation's health care system. The 47 million Americans without health insurance deserve no less. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to find the best possible solution to address this crisis, and I thank you again, Congresswoman Watson, for holding this special order.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (NORMALCY IS NOT RETURNING TO IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the American people have begun to receive their recovery rebate checks. Families will use this assistance to deal with the rising cost of food, of gas, and for just hard times in general. So Congress did the right thing when we wrote those checks. But if we want to give our economy another boost, there is one check that we should not write, and that's the check we will soon be asked to write for the continued occupation of Iraq. 
   This occupation has already cost taxpayers over $1 trillion in direct and indirect costs. And Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, has calculated that the cost could soar, could, probably will soar to $3 trillion or more. Think what that money could do for our economy if we invested it wisely in job training, education, health care, child care, green technology, and so many other critically important domestic needs. 
   Some believe that the occupation of Iraq is more important than all of these other needs combined. They believe that the billions of dollars we're spending in Iraq are making things better. The President actually told us recently that normalcy is returning back to Iraq. But Iraq cannot be returning to normalcy when the fighting and dying continues without any letup. 
   Over 3,000 Iraqi civilians and 170 of our brave troops have been killed so far this year: 3,000; 170. Over 1,100 of our troops have been wounded. Mr. Speaker, does that sound like normalcy to anyone? It doesn't to me. I can't say it, actually. 
   Iraq cannot be returning to normalcy when over 5 million of its citizens remain refugees. That number equals more than 20 percent of the entire Iraqi population at the beginning of our invasion in the year 2003. 
   Iraq cannot be returning to normalcy when tens of thousands of armed military contractors roam its streets terrifying the people and accountable to no one. 
   Iraq can't be returning to normalcy when we're planning for a 50-year foreign occupation, and some voices, in fact, are even calling for a 100-year occupation. 
   And Iraq cannot be returning to normalcy when fear and destruction continue to grip its people. The International Herald Tribune described the Iraqi people's nightmare in an article published on April 23. It said, ``A simple decision to run an errand or choose an alternate route to work takes on life-altering consequences as the car bombs, stray bullets, rockets, and mortars claim those who merely happen by.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, as the war carries into its 6th year, nearly every family is touched by the death of a member of a close friend. 
   Iraq can only become normal again when it gets its sovereignty back. It can only become normal when it has the chance to rebuild and heal in peace, and that can only happen when we responsibly redeploy our troops and then lead a regional and international effort to bring social, economic, and political reconciliation to that devastated country. 
   So when we review supplemental funding like we will tomorrow, let's insist on a bill that fully funds the safe withdrawal of our troops but does not include one more cent for an occupation that isn't making us or the Iraqi people any safer. 
   Mr. Speaker, recovery rebate checks are great, but blank checks for the occupation of Iraq must stop.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (GULF OF THE FARALLONES AND CORDELL BANK NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES BOUNDARY MODIFICATION AND PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member. 
   I would like to respond quickly to the ``no public review.'' This bill has been subject to over 3 years of public review. It first faced public scrutiny at a public hearing that I hosted in August of 2004, in Sonoma County, was attended by the Director of the Marine Sanctuary Program, marine scientists, fishermen, and a standing room-only crowd of public who were interested. 
   It has been reviewed and endorsed by both the Sanctuary Advisory Committees, the bodies who initiate sanctuary regulations; the California Coastal Commission, the State Lands Commission, and the Supervisors of Marin, Sonoma, San Francisco, and Mendocino Counties, and many, many of our City Councils. All of these meetings were noticed, all of them were open to public comment. 
   The bill also received a hearing before the Oceans Subcommittee, and has gone through committee and subcommittee markup. So thank you for bringing that up so I could clarify that, Mr. Ranking Member. 
   Madam Speaker, my district, just across the Golden Gate Bridge, north of San Francisco, includes all of Marin and most of Sonoma Counties, where we are blessed with many environmental treasures. In fact, it is one of the most beautiful places on earth. I don't say that just because I am the Congresswoman from that area. It is beautiful. 
   One of the reasons for this source of beauty and our great pride is our pristine coastline and the Pacific Ocean that lies beyond it. An area this unique must be protected by the full power of our conservation laws.     
   That is why I am pleased that H.R. 1187, the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries Boundary Modification and Protection Act, is here before us today. 
   H.R. 1187 will expand the boundaries of two existing marine sanctuaries in order to more fully protect a unique upwelling system, which is one of only four in the world. This system provides a nutrient rich environment for fish and all other types of marine life. 
   Upwelling is a process where deep, cold, nutrient-rich waters rise into warmer waters, bringing with it an abundance of food to support a variety of marine life. Actually this area is so special and it is so productive that it  comprises only 1 percent of the ocean, but produces 20 percent of the world's fish. This in turn supports 36 species of marine mammals, including whales, elephant seals, sea lions and other seals. 
   But it is not only marine mammals who feast on the abundance of fish. The waters off the Sonoma and Mendocino County coasts support fleets of fishermen. That is why I worked so closely with the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishing Associations, the PCFFA, in carefully crafting this bill. 
   Fishermen have had a good relationship with the Gulf of the Farallones and the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary for over 20 years because they respect that good stewardship of our oceans produces better catches. H.R. 1187 will serve to strengthen this partnership for years and years to come. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1187 is a well thought out, carefully crafted bill that brings together diverse stakeholders, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, the fishing industry, State and local governments, conservation groups and marine scientists, all who agree that these proposed sanctuary areas are national treasures that absolutely deserve protection. 
   As a mother and a grandmother, I want to see these treasures protected for years to come so that my kids, so that my grandkids, and so that their children and your children and your grandchildren will be able to enjoy the same unspoiled coasts and clean waters that we enjoy today. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Rahall, Ranking Member Young and Chairwoman Bordallo for bringing my bill to the floor today. I would like to thank Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Bishop, all who have been part of reviewing and bringing H.R. 1187 to the floor. I thank you all, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE BIGGEST BURDEN OF THE IRAQ CONFLICT -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I'm really glad to be back in the House. I've been away for over 6 weeks because of back surgery. I've been patched up, and I'm going to be just fine. I'm not worried about myself. But I'm worried, and I hope every Member of the House is worried about the hundreds of thousands of American soldiers and civilians who have been injured in the conflict in Iraq. 
   Nearly 30,000, probably many, many more of our brave troops have been wounded. 
   Many have injuries that will rack their bodies and their minds for the rest of their lives. 
   Yet Vice President Cheney said last week that President Bush carries the biggest burden of this conflict. Tell that to the widows and widowers, Mr. Vice President. Tell that to the families who have been devastated by the injuries to their loved ones. Tell that to the children who see their mother or father in a hospital bed without a limb or with a terrible head wound. Tell that to the veterans who have not gotten the care they need and the care they deserve, the care we promised them. 
   One of our soldiers in Iraq, Lieutenant Sean Walsh, wrote a piece for Time magazine recently about the human costs of the occupation. He wrote that his fellow soldiers have become his family and that three of them have died. And he asked the question, ``What is worth the lives of three of your loved ones?'' It is a good question. 
   And so I would like to ask every Member of this House who supports the occupation the very same question: Is our occupation of Iraq worth the lives of three of your loved ones? 
   We must also remember the Iraq civilians who have been injured. We seem to forget them, and that is truly a disgrace. According to the best estimates, anywhere from 80,000 to 150,000 civilians have been injured. And the real number, the real number is certainly much, much higher. 
   What kind of health care are they, the Iraqi civilians, getting? The International Committee of the Red Cross reported last month that public hospitals in Iraq now provide 30,000 beds. Mr. Speaker, that is less than half of the 80,000 that are needed. 
   In addition, 2,200 doctors and nurses have been killed since the year 2003, and another 250 have been kidnapped. And the current conflict has worsened the impact of the previous war and the years of international sanctions. Of the 34,000 doctors registered in Iraq in 1990, 20,000 have fled the country, some by choice and others by force. What about their burden, Mr. Vice President? 
   Meanwhile, the administration continues to play its cynical game with troop levels. It is clear that the administration intends to keep 140,000 troops in Iraq until it leaves office in order to put an artificial lid on this violence. That way, the outgoing administration can say that it improved the security situation and that we are on the road to victory in Iraq. 
   But the truth is, all that has been achieved is a temporary military and  political stalemate, new explosions of violence coming as I stand here speaking on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   And while we continue to be bogged down in a civil war in Iraq, a conflict that began centuries before 9/11, the real enemy, al Qaeda, grows stronger in its cozy, safe haven in Pakistan. 
   The administration is often criticized for not having an exit strategy in Iraq. But in my view, the reason the President never had an exit strategy is because he never intended to exit Iraq. Permanent occupation has always been his game plan. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it's up to the Congress to implement the will of the American people and end the occupation with a responsible redeployment of our troops. The best way to honor those who have died or have been injured in this occupation is to ensure that more won't die and more won't be injured. 
   That is why I will continue to speak up for our brave troops and for the innocent Iraqis who are, despite what the Vice President may think, the ones who are carrying the biggest burden.

   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2634 and am proud to recognize Chairman Frank, his Ranking Member Bachus, Congresswoman Waters, Representative Lee and Representative Payne because they are leaders in this very, very necessary important issue of debt relief. And I want to tell you I admire their absolute stick-to-itiveness on this important issue, because 7 years ago, grass-roots groups asked Congress and the administration to release heavily indebted poor countries from their overwhelming debt. In many cases, the debt was acquired under dictatorships and despotic regimes. These emerging developing nations could not move forward while buried under seemingly crushing debt. 
   With bipartisan support, and this is bipartisan in the way it has come to the floor, it passed the first time. Now it is improved upon and going forward again. It is stronger than it was before. In so doing, we forgave debt owed by poor countries, countries that were spending vast sums on debt servicing while forgoing investment into education or health care, infrastructure and other social services so desperately needed in their small countries. 
   With this bill, we are putting a downpayment on the future of the developing world. We are getting more kids into classrooms. We are providing life-saving health care. We are building the pathways for entrepreneurship. 
   And I thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership, and I honor one more time, as we all have, Congresswoman Waters for her stick-to-itiveness in making these wonderful, important issues come forward and pass positively.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (ENDING THE MADNESS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, there will be a great debate in Congress in the coming days about the administration's escalation strategy in Iraq. The administration has been trying during this time to influence that debate by launching a saturation public relations campaign designed to convince us that the escalation is working. Before the debate in Congress begins, however, it is really important for every Member of this House to know the facts; and the truth is the escalation is not working. It is failing. Here are the facts: 
   First, this summer has been the bloodiest summer of the occupation for American troops since the occupation began. Between June and August, 261 of our brave troops died. Over the same three months last year, 169 died. That is too many, absolutely; but it is a 54 percent increase this year over last year. 
   Second, the escalation has been deadly for U.S. troops ever since it began: 654 U.S. troops were killed between February, when the escalation began,  and this August. That is 63 percent more than over the same period last year. 
   Third, the escalation has been a disaster for the Iraqi people. Over 5,000 more Iraqi civilians were killed between the start of the escalation in February and this August than died over the same period last year; and according to news reports, the number of internally displaced Iraqis has more than doubled since the escalation began, from 500,000 to 1.1 million refugees. 
   Next, despite the administration's claims of progress on security, the Government Accountability Office has reported that average daily attacks against civilians have remained unchanged, unchanged, since the escalation began and that the Iraqi Government has failed to meet most of its key benchmarks for military and political progress. A National Intelligence Estimate describes the Iraqi leaders as unable to govern effectively and that the Iraqi Government's ability to bring about political reconciliation is likely to become even more precarious. 
   Fifth, and finally, the statement on Monday that the administration might, might, might, that ``might'' is the operative word, might consider bringing a few troops home, I believe that was a brazen political maneuver designed to give Members of Congress who are needing a reason to stay the course a way out. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is outrageous that the administration is playing politics with the lives of our troops and with the emotions of their families. But their real goal couldn't be clearer: General Petraeus told a congressional delegation that went to Iraq in August that American troops will have to be in Iraq for 9 or 10 more years. I doubt that even the White House's most ardent supporters want the occupation to continue for another 10 years. Yet, incredibly, that could be the plan. 
   We can only come to one conclusion, which is that under the administration's leadership, there is no light at the end of this tunnel. There will be more deaths, more wounded, more refugees and more destruction, with absolutely no end in sight. Meanwhile, our standing in the world will continue to deteriorate. The terrorists will continue to hatch their plots against us in their safe havens far from Iraq, and the occupation will continue to rob our Treasury of the resources we desperately need for healthcare, for education, for infrastructure, for energy independence, for the environment and real homeland security. 
   The administration will never end the madness in Iraq. The American people have called upon Congress to do it, and history will judge each of us by how we answer that call.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (IRAQ AND THE PRESIDENT'S FISCAL YEAR 2008 BUDGET REQUEST -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, the devastating blast in the Baghdad market over the weekend was the worst suicide bombing since the American occupation began nearly 4 years ago, 121 killed and 226 wounded. The Iraqi Interior Ministry says approximately 1,000 people have been killed over the last week alone. 
   This so-called ``surge'' that the President is force feeding us is getting off to quite a start, isn't it? Indeed, The New York Times reported on Sunday that Iraqis are saying that the security situation has gotten worse, not better, with the escalation of American troops. 
   The National Intelligence Estimate released last week offers little hope that sectarian violence will abate or that Iraq can repair its political rifts between Sunni and Shi'a. Under these circumstances, with American soldiers thrown into this unwinnable occupation with no hope of turning the situation around, there is only one solution, bring our troops home. 
   I have introduced a bill, H.R. 508, with Congresswoman Lee and Congresswoman Waters and 30 others, which will do just that. H.R. 508 will end the occupation within 6 months of enactment. H.R. 508 will prohibit the construction of permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq. It will restore the sovereignty of the Iraqi people, even as we continue to provide nonmilitary assistance and to support a short-term international stabilization force will be available, if requested by the Iraqi government. 
   What a difference from the White House approach. Staring at the colossal, tragic failure of his Iraq policy, what did the President do today? He submitted a budget that asked Congress to sign off on $145 billion to continue waging war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, he wants us to make his tax cuts permanent, and he says the budget will be balanced by 2012. So where is the money going to come from? Why, of course, it is going to come from the most vulnerable members of society, that is where. 
   Actually, over time, the very troops and their families, who are sacrificing life and limb in Iraq today, will be paying for this debt.     
   The President's budget seeks deep Medicare and Medicaid cuts at just the moment when we need to be expanding access to affordable health care. Actually, it is simple, Madam Speaker. The money is there for the folly of occupying Iraq. The money is there for wealthy people to get tax breaks; but when old and when poor people need nursing home care, or kids need immunizations, suddenly it is time to tighten the belt. 
   It is a disgrace, Madam Speaker, this ongoing occupation of Iraq. It is not only morally indefensible; it is fiscally irresponsible. So many of our own communities need investment. So many of our own poor and middle-class families are taking on more and more risk, struggling to get by, getting squeezed economically. But we are spending our grandchildren's money on a fantasy that is getting young soldiers killed, igniting a civil war, inciting jihadists, inspiring hatred of the United States around the world, harming national security and making Americans less safe. 
   There is a solution: One, end the occupation; two, return Iraq to the Iraqis; three, spend our foreign affairs budget on humanitarian endeavors, not on war and conquest. Spend it on economic development, on democracy promotion, on building schools and hospitals. 
   In addition, bring our troops home. Bring our soldiers home. Bring our tax dollars home where they can be put to work meeting the needs of Americans, strengthening American communities.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (AN INFORMED CITIZENRY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, an informed citizenry is one of the cornerstones of our American democracy. In order to make the right decisions about our country's policies, Americans must know the facts. That is why every member of the administration and every Member of Congress has the duty to be honest and open with all of us. This is especially true when it comes to decisions about war and about peace, because the lives of our soldiers are actually on the line. 
   But recent events have reminded us that when it comes to Iraq, we have not always had the information that we need. Earlier this month, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a bipartisan report on Iraq that actually proved this. It showed that before the invasion began, the American people were told that there was a strong connection between Iraq and terrorist groups like al Qaeda. But the committee found that there was no conclusive intelligence to support such a claim. 
   Also, the American people have recently had the chance to read the book by a former White House press secretary who acknowledges that propaganda was used to sell the American people on supporting the invasion of Iraq.     
   And this House, this House of Representatives, is pretty familiar with the Pentagon's spin operation to get retired military officers to give us a rose-colored view about the situation in Iraq. The House has voted to stop the Pentagon from continuing such a program, and the Pentagon is expected to respect that ban. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. They need to have a true and accurate picture about what is currently happening in Iraq. That's why every Member of this House should be demanding that the administration give Congress the facts about its current status-of-forces negotiations with the Iraqi Government. I have repeatedly demanded that the administration share this information with Congress, including the establishment of permanent bases, because there was an alarming report in the press that the United States may actually be planning nearly 60 permanent bases in Iraq, this happening after the House has voted multiple times to prohibit permanent bases in Iraq. 
   Over the weekend, senior Iraqi leaders called for a complete exit of all U.S. troops, and they called for this at the expiration of the current U.N. mandate which comes this fall. Imagine their opinion of the United States' permanent bases in their country. Sixty permanent bases are absolutely unacceptable. One permanent base is unacceptable. 
   This House has voted many times, as I said, against the establishment of permanent bases, and the administration should not try to get around that by making fine, legalistic points about what constitutes a ``permanent base.'' In fact, we must apply the duck test. If it looks like a permanent base, if it walks like a permanent base, it is a permanent base. 
   Because the economy has replaced Iraq as the top news story of the day, some may be lured into thinking that nothing very important is happening in Iraq these days. Well, one important statistic is, if it has not happened today, we are about to report 5,000 of our troops dead, but nothing could be further from the truth about not being important. 
   While we aren't paying attention, the administration is negotiating status-of-forces negotiations that could make our country a foreign occupying power in the Middle East for years or for even decades to come. What a grave mistake that would be keeping our troops in harm's way and continuing the best recruiting tool that the terrorists could ask for. 
   Instead of planning for a permanent occupation, the United States needs to follow a very different path. We should redeploy our troops and military contracts. We should give the Iraqi people back their sovereignty. We should help them rebuild their shattered country. We should work with the international community to bring peace and stability to the region. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress must demand to know what is being negotiated in the name of the American people. What deals are being cut? What is going on behind closed doors? What exactly is the administration demanding and why? It is time for the American people to have the facts, and it is time to safely and responsibly bring our troops and independent contractors home and to give Iraq back to the Iraqi people.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the Democrats owe our majority to the American public who voted us into power for one simple reason; they trusted us. They trusted us to act boldly to hold this administration accountable and to bring our troops home. So far, we're failing the very trust that they've placed in us. 
   But, more importantly, every day that we allow this occupation to continue, we are failing our brave young men and women, those who are serving honorably and professionally in Iraq, and we are failing their families here at home who are struggling to keep their lives and families together, who are forced to worry whether their loved ones will come home alive or actually in one piece. 
   Today is not an opportunity to claim victory or to give bellicose speeches for partisan debate. Today is an opportunity to grieve for the soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for this President who has failed Iraq in his policies. 
   Today is a day to stand by our Nation's sons and daughters who suffer through irreparable physical and mental wounds.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HOMEOWNERSHIP MONTH -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, the importance of homeownership can't be underestimated. That's why I support H. Res. 1271, a bill to recognize National Homeownership Month and the importance of homeownership in the United States. 
   For most Americans, homeownership represents security for themselves and their families. Unfortunately in recent months, homeownership (a cornerstone of the American Dream) has been tarnished by an unscrupulous mortgage industry that has trapped far too many families into paying for homes they can't afford. In my district, all over California, and across the country, we are seeing family after family fall into foreclosure, as their dreams turn to dust, and they hand over their prize possession to the bank. 
   So, as we consider this bill in support of homeownership, I think it's important that we also don't forget the homeowner ..... those past, present and future, who need the assistance of this Congress to ensure they get a fair deal. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's my hope that those who vote in favor of this bill, H. Res. 1271, will also join in passing real housing reform to bring about systemic changes to help more Americans be able to achieve the goal of owning their own home, on fair terms, at affordable prices.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE CONFLICT IN IRAQ IS STILL GOING ON -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to make an important and urgent announcement to the House: the conflict in Iraq is still going on, and we are still occupying that country. 
   I have to make this announcement because apparently some people have forgotten all about Iraq or don't think it's an important issue anymore. That's because it doesn't dominate the TV news like it used to. As an example of that, a recent story on CNN began with the words, ``Whatever Happened to the War?'' 
   Well, I hate to spoil everyone's day, but I have to report, with great regret, that the occupation is still going. As proof of that, nearly 300 American and Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi civilians have been killed or wounded so far this month alone. Yes, the bloodshed continues. 
   And after nearly 5 years of occupation, our leaders still have no exit strategy. They have even stopped pretending that they have one. Last year they told us we couldn't get out of Iraq because things on the ground were going badly. This year they're telling us we can't get out because things are going well; and if we get out, they'll go badly again. 
   So if you follow the administration's argument to its logical conclusion, this is what you get: we can't leave when things are good; we can't leave when things are bad. Which means we can never leave. The result is permanent occupation, which is precisely what the administration appears to want. 
   Forgetting about the bloodshed in Iraq is bad enough. But it's dangerous for many, many other reasons. It gives the administration a free hand to ratchet up the threats against Iran. It takes the pressure off the Iraqi Government to make progress toward national political reconciliation. It means our military will continue to be overstretched and less capable of meeting real challenges to our national security that may and will arise elsewhere. It continues to make America appear to be a lawless and arrogant Western occupier of the Middle East. And it allows our budget to be plundered at a time when our economy is more than shaky. People are in danger of losing their jobs here at home; but thanks to the administration's policies, the boys at Blackwater will always have their high-paying military contractor jobs in Iraq where they can continue to terrify the Iraqi people. 
   We are spending over $300 million every day in Iraq, Madam Speaker. We couldn't afford that when the economy was good, and we certainly can't afford it as the economy goes into recession. 
   But thankfully, thankfully, the American people are too smart to fall into the trap of believing that everything is just swell. According to a recent CBS News poll, nearly 60 percent of Americans continue to believe the occupation is going badly, and 58 percent believe the U.S. should never have gotten into Iraq in the first place. 
   Madam Speaker, we cannot stick our heads in the sand and pretend that Iraq isn't a problem anymore. The only way to change course is to hold the administration accountable, and the only way to do that is to keep the pressure on the administration every single day. That's why I'll continue to raise my voice against the madness of this occupation, and why I will continue to urge the House to use its power of the purse to end it. 
   Iraq is not a television show that got canceled because of the writers' strike. Iraq is a real place where real people continue to die. We must redeploy our troops. We must give the Iraqi people back their sovereignty, and we must give them their hope for a brighter future.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (A ``SMART'' NEW ERA IN AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, the members of the Out of Iraq Caucus, the Progressive Caucus, and many other Members of this body have demanded that the administration change course in Iraq for many years now. We have also urged the administration to build a new foreign policy based on peaceful engagement, not on war. 
   For years the administration ignored us. We were voices in the wilderness. But today our ideas are winning wide acceptance, and they now occupy the center of the political debate. 
   We called for a timetable for the responsible redeployment of our troops and military contractors out of Iraq. In recent days even the presumptive Republican nominee for President has embraced this idea. The White House has talked about a time horizon for withdrawal. The Iraqi leaders, who are eager to regain their national sovereignty, have called for a firm timetable. 
   Perhaps most surprising, there has been sudden movement on the diplomatic front. A high-ranking State Department official sat down with Iran's nuclear negotiator, which the administration had stubbornly refused to do for over 6 years, and Secretary of State Rice met with her North Korean counterpart to urge North Korea to verify the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program. 
   We can only wonder how much could have been achieved, and how many lives could have been saved, if the administration had emphasized diplomacy all along. 
   These turn of events, however, didn't happen by themselves. They happened because so many of us in Congress and the American people demanded them. 
   Now we must demand even more change. We must demand a whole new foreign policy. America must reject saber-rattling and wars of choice and instead use the far more effective tools of diplomacy and international cooperation to achieve our national security goals. I hope that our next President will turn the page on the failed policies of the past and choose a new course. 
   I have offered a blueprint for change that can help us chart this course. It's a plan called SMART, which stands for Sensible, Multilateral American Response to Terrorism. I offer it again today because I believe that the American people are ready to support its principles. 
   SMART was developed with the help of Physicians For Social Responsibility, the Friends Committee on National Legislation, and Women's Action For New Directions. 
   SMART would end our isolation in the world and build strong international coalitions to fight terrorism and solve common challenges such as trade, the environment, and global health. It would strengthen our intelligence capabilities aimed at tracking and stopping terrorism. It would focus on stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction with vigorous inspection regimes, regional security arrangements, and a renewed commitment to nonproliferation. It would renew our commitment to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, a program which has been successful in securing loose nuclear material. It would address the root causes of terrorism through an ambitious international development program, a program that includes initiatives for better education and health, initiatives which are the building blocks of stability and peace and the best way to deny new recruits to the terrorists. And it would reshuffle our budget to include a serious effort to develop alternative energy and end the addiction of foreign oil that threatens our security. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a time of profound change. The country is preparing for a new administration. Momentum is building for ending the occupation of Iraq sooner rather than later. We must begin now to answer the question, What happens after Iraq? 
   I hope that my colleagues will consider SMART a good way to start answering that question. It would send a clear signal that America is once again ready to respect the rule of law and human rights and work for peace in the world.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (OUR HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, last week this House voted to end the occupation of Iraq. Some of those who opposed that action argued that bringing our troops home out of Iraq will increase the violence there and perhaps even lead to a humanitarian catastrophe. But what they forget, or choose to ignore, is that a humanitarian catastrophe has already occurred in Iraq. It is getting worse every day. That catastrophe includes the refugee crisis in that devastated nation. 
   Last week the United States Committee for Refugees reported that the number of refugees in the world rose last year to its highest level since 2001. One of the main reasons was the great exodus from Iraq. All told, more than 2 million Iraqis have been forced to flee their country. Close to 2 million more have been displaced internally. That is a total, Mr. Speaker, of 4 million refugees, 50 percent of whom are children, and tens of thousands more are leaving every single month. 
   Many of the refugees are in dire straits. Recently United Nations inspectors visited one refugee camp and found more than 2,000 people living in tents. They had no clothes except for the clothes on their backs. They had no medical care. They had no drinkable water. They had no toilets. Many of the children had typhoid and other illnesses and were living among snakes and scorpions. 
   Sweden, to its great credit, is accepting more than 1,000 refugees every month. The population of Sweden is only 9 million people. The United States, with a population of 300 million, accepted only 202 last year. Not 202,000, but 202. We have accepted only somewhere around 700 since our occupation of Iraq began. 
   That is a disgraceful record. Every Member of this House should feel ashamed. That goes for all of us; those who support the war and those who oppose it. We may disagree about policy, but surely we can agree that we have a moral obligation to do more about a terrible refugee problem that our occupation has created. After all, many of the refugees have had to flee because they cooperated with our troops in the first place, or they cooperated with American contractors. We can't turn our backs on them now. 
   That is why I am urging all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2265, the Responsibility to Iraq Refugees Act of 2007, sponsored by Representative Blumenauer along with Representative Shays and Representative Schakowsky. 
   I especially challenge those Members who want our occupation of Iraq to continue to support this bill. Don't just warn us about a humanitarian crisis. Do something about the one that already exists. 
   The bill would provide special immigrant status to 15,000 Iraqis every year for 4 years. The bill would also provide a safe haven for at least 20,000 more Iraqis, including children, who have been left all alone in the world. Giving these young people a chance in life is not only honorable, it is smart because these impoverished children could become prime targets for recruitment by terrorists. 
   To me, this bill represents the true heart of America, the good and caring heart that has compassion for the people of the world. But our leaders do not seem to share this compassion. Recently, for example, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton denied that the United States has any responsibility  for the refugee crisis. He said, ``Our obligation was to give the Iraqis new institutions and provide security. We have fulfilled that obligation. I don't think we have an obligation to compensate for the hardships of war.'' 
   This is the kind of arrogance, Mr. Speaker, that has destroyed America's reputation and credibility around the world. We must reclaim our moral leadership. We can start by helping the Iraqi refugees. It's the right thing to do. It's the right thing to do as we bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (TORTURE UNDERMINES OUR VALUES AND MAKES US WEAKER -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, nothing has stained the honor of the United States in recent years like the use of torture against detainees, detainees in Iraq and detainees elsewhere. Torture goes against our Nation's most basic values, and it undermines the American people's reputation as a compassionate and committed people to human rights. 
   Torture is not only immoral; it has a practical damaging effect on our foreign policy. When America is involved in torture, we lose the moral authority that is our most powerful weapon in the fight against terrorism. How can we lead the world against terrorism when the world believes that we don't respect the rule of law ourselves? 
   That is why I want to call attention to a new report on torture that was issued last week by the group Physicians for Human Rights. This group assembled a team of doctors and psychologists to evaluate former detainees held in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. The team found that the detainees were tortured, even though no charges were ever brought against them or any explanation ever given for their imprisonment. 
   The torture consisted of beatings, electric shocks, involuntary medication, shackling, and sexual humiliation. Other techniques were used, but they are far too awful for me to mention here. One Iraqi detainee who was held for a time in the notorious Abu Ghraib prison said he was subjected to psychological abuse as well as physical torture. He said that his captors threatened to rape his mother and his sisters. 
   Former Major General Anthony Taguba, who conducted the Army's investigation of the Abu Ghraib scandal in 2004, wrote a preface to the report. He said, ``In order for these individuals to suffer the wanton cruelty to which they were subjected, a government policy was promulgated to the field whereby the Geneva Conventions and the Uniform Code of Military Justice were disregarded. The U.N. Convention Against Torture was indiscriminately ignored ..... '' 
   He continued: ``Through the experiences,'' he said, ``of these men ..... we can see the full scope of the damage this illegal and unsound policy has inflicted, both on American institutions and our founding values.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I am sure that there will be some people who will try to discredit this report by charging that it was prepared by a group determined to embarrass the administration. But if they don't believe this report, perhaps they will believe the reporting of the McClatchy newspapers, which conducted an 8-month investigation of the U.S. detention system created after 9/11. The McClatchy investigation found ``that the United States imprisoned innocent men, subjected them to abuse, stripped them of their legal rights, and allowed Islamic militants to turn the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay into a school for jihad.'' 
   This House did the honorable thing a few months ago when it voted to stop the use of waterboarding and other illegal interrogation techniques. Forty-three retired generals and admirals supported that bill. Eighteen national security experts, including former Secretaries of State and national security advisers, supported it as well. But the President vetoed this bill, sending the world a message that America condones torture. 
   Torture doesn't work. It doesn't produce good information. It exposes our own troops to torture if they are captured. It creates enemies. In short, torture doesn't make us stronger; it makes us weaker. 
   Congress must recognize these facts and move to restore our Nation's good name. The best way to begin to do that is by redeploying our troops out of Iraq and then help the Iraqi people to rebuild their lives and their country. I know that this won't happen soon given last week's vote on funding for the occupation of Iraq. But sooner or later, Congress must act. Redeploying out of Iraq will help to heal the wounds of torture and right the wrongs.  
   Mr. Speaker, it's time for America to be America again: peace loving, compassionate, and a true champion of human rights, and restore our dignity.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3887, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2007. This bill makes great strides in both the areas of prevention and in victim assistance and will strengthen our national commitment to ending this horrific practice. 
   Since its founding, our Nation has been committed to the promotion of human rights and personal dignity. Human trafficking contradicts every core principle upon which our Nation and our international partnerships are based. 
   In recent years, we have seen appalling examples of trafficking--from women sold into sexual slavery ..... to men being pressed into indentured servitude ..... to children forced to become soldiers. 
   Trafficking frequently is tied to other illicit crimes--prostitution, drug running, sweatshops, and armed rebellions. Sadly, the victims have few champions and even fewer resources. And, all too often, national leaders have turned a blind eye to this growing epidemic. 
   Today our strategy is twofold. First, we are extending care and assistance to the victims while protecting them from their traffickers. Second, we are bolstering our efforts to work with international and domestic law enforcement to prevent trafficking at the source. It is essential that we remain dedicated and committed to each track. 
   Additionally, while it is not included in this bill, it is my hope that the administrators of the programs will consider the special needs of the victims and will look into the ``reflection periods'' in place in several countries. This allows additional time for former victims to become comfortable in their new situations before taking further action against their traffickers. 
   As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am proud to support this legislation and to urge my colleagues to support its passage.

In fact, I have come to the floor over 200 times. And as the first Member of Congress to call on the  President to bring our troops home and the author of the first amendment on the floor requiring the President to bring a plan to the House on how he will end this debacle that he started, you can know that I am very pleased that this vote is before us today. Finally, after 4 years here we are.

These provisions will fully fund bringing the troops home, prohibit permanent bases, give the Iraqi people sovereignty and a sense of hope for their future. 
   My colleagues, I urge you to support H.R. 2237. The American people are asking that we stand up for our troops, and we do that by fully funding them to bring them home. Bring them home to their families. Bring them home so that we can end this misguided occupation. By passing H.R. 2237, we will bring our troops and our military contractors out of Iraq safely.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, my district, just across the Golden Gate Bridge north of San Francisco, includes 100 percent of Marin County and 80 percent of Sonoma County, where we are blessed with many environmental treasures. In fact, it is one of the most beautiful places on Earth, and it is just across the bridge from one of the largest cities in our country. 
   In this area we have a stand of old-growth redwoods known as Muir Woods, and we consider this our crown jewel. Muir Woods is nearly 300 acres of what I refer to as ``Heaven on Earth'' where its natural beauty has been preserved and protected for everyone to enjoy so that we can enjoy the trees, which are mostly redwoods that stand over 250 feet tall and are, as the chairman just told you, as old as 1,100 years. That is why I am so pleased that Congress is considering H. Res. 868 today, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of President Teddy Roosevelt's declaration of Muir Woods as a national monument. 
   It is fitting that we honor the centennial of Muir Woods on the floor of the House of Representatives, because it was the actions of Congressman William Kent who represented Marin County at that time who made the national monument possible. William Kent privately owned the land where Muir Woods now stands, and he and his family donated it to the Federal Government to ensure its protection. I am proud to say that 100 years later Congressman Kent's vision is still going strong. 
   The leadership in conservation that William Kent showed 100 years ago is a valuable lesson for us today. Imagine all the national wonder that could have been saved in the last 100 years, wonders like Muir Woods, that we could be enjoying today had more people been as selfless as he. We in Congress have the power to ensure that 100 years from now people can look back and applaud new conservation efforts. 
   Mr. Speaker, Muir Woods is a unique sanctuary for the protection of one of Earth's greatest wonders, the coastal redwoods; and its preservation is to be commended. I want to thank Chairman Rahall, Chairman Grijalva, Ranking Member Young, and Mr. Bishop for bringing my resolution here to the floor today, because working together, Mr. Speaker, working together today, we will ensure that 100 years from now our grandchildren, our great grandchildren and their children will enjoy the Muir Woods bicentennial.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I would consume. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Miller and the committee staff for helping move this bill so quickly and the gentleman from Tennessee for being here with me today. 
   We often recognize teachers for their hard work, for their dedication to our children. In fact, we need to do more of this. Teachers are very important to ensuring that our children are learning. 
   However, there has been far too little recognition for the school support personnel, those who help schools run smoothly, the classified school employees. Teachers can't teach without support of classified school employees. This includes instructional assistants, clerical staffs, school bus drivers, food services employees, maintenance, security and others who ensure a safe and healthy school day every day for our children. 
   Imagine a school day without this support: without bus drivers, how would our children get to school? Without janitors, who will ensure their classrooms, cafeteria and bathrooms are clean? Without food service personnel, who will serve their food, who will order their food? Without a school nurse, where will children go if they are not feeling well or they are needing medication? Without maintenance personnel, what would happen if something broke or if the school is too hot or too cold? Without office and clerical staff, who will ensure that the proper person picks up a child? And without security personnel, who will make sure our schools are safe? These responsibilities need to be met in order for our students to be able to do what they come to school to do: learn. 
   What do our teachers come to school for? To teach. These and many more tasks would not be possible without these important school employees.     
   That is why I introduced this resolution with Chairman Miller and Representative Hare, to recognize the many contributions classified school employees make to our children's school day. Without the work of these valuable employees, schools would be unable to function. 
   Today, we recognize the work of the classified school employee and thank them for their hard work in helping ensure that our schools run smoothly. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the efforts of our classified school employees and thanking them for all they do to make certain our children are able to learn and teachers are able to teach in a safe and healthy environment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, our schoolchildren couldn't attend school and teachers couldn't teach without the efforts of these valuable school personnel. 
   Personnel like Al Hart, District Information Services Coordinator for Reed School District in southern Marin County. Mr. Hart was recognized this year as the Marin County classified school employee of the year. His hard work and that of other school employees in the rest of the 6th district of California, and the rest of the country should be recognized. 
   Classified school employees work with teachers and administrators to ensure that our schools are safe and healthy places. Their contributions are invaluable and can be recognized today and every day. 
   That's why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 376 to thank classified school employees for their work and to recognize them for their efforts.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (A HEALTH CHECKUP FOR IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, a very disturbing report emerged from Iraq last week. According to press reports, medical students in Iraq will be denied diplomas even though they have completed all of the coursework and passed all of the required testing. This means that they would only be allowed to practice in Iraq, and no other country will accept their medical training or let them practice in the new country, even though they have met all of the requirements. 
   This harkens back to the Iraq we knew under Saddam Hussein's rule. Saddam refused to grant diplomas to medical students in order to keep them in the country. Who would have thought that the new Iraq government would resort to Saddam Hussein's old tricks? This is an alarming and troubling trend, and it should be reversed immediately. 
   While dozens of international medical relief organizations have been forced to leave Iraq because of serious security concerns, Iraqis have fewer and fewer medical professionals available to them. 
   A well-known organization, Doctors Without Borders, related the story of one doctor, Dr. Bassam. He is an Iraqi physician specializing in orthopedic surgery living with his family in Baghdad. 
   His story says: Now, security issues have top priority for the few existing financial resources, and medical needs are forced to take a back seat. This morning, dozens of people were killed in Fallujah. Yesterday, it was Baghdad. And that's not counting the wounded, who add to the long list of emergency cases packing the hospitals. Every day brings a new batch of dead and wounded. In this context, patients simply cannot receive proper treatment from an increasingly overwhelmed health care system. Some are forced to sell their car, or even their house, to get certain kinds of care in the few hospitals able to provide it. 
   That is the end of his story. 
   Mr. Speaker, instead of locking people in against their will, the Iraqi government ought to be working with the international community to make Iraq a safe and prosperous place where people want to raise their families, where they want to stay, where they want to put down roots and contribute to the local communities. 
   If this is going to happen, the United States must dedicate our energies to bringing our troops home and to working with the Iraqi people to stabilize their infrastructure and social programs, programs that will provide health care, education and jobs. These are the most important needs for the Iraqis. 
   It is time, Mr. Speaker, to bring our troops home. It is time to provide a future of hope for the Iraqi people.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (BRING OUR TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, we are back from our Fourth of July district work period, but our homecoming has not been a particularly happy one because we have received even more bad news from the occupation in Iraq. 
   Yesterday the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported that the cost of the occupation has soared to $10 billion a month, which will add up to half a trillion dollars, thanks to the administration's decision to send more troops and escalate the occupation. 
   Ten billion dollars a month. I pulled out my calculator. I did some division and found that $10 billion translates into $23 million per month per congressional district. Yes, the President is sending a bill to our constituents in every district every month that says you owe $24 million and you had better pay up because if you don't, I will borrow the money and stick your children and your grandchildren with the bill plus plenty of interest. And I am going to send you another bill just like this one every single month from here on. 
   Now, some people call the spending on the war the ``burn rate.'' But America doesn't have money to burn. Not when we have critically important investments to make in places that really make a difference for our country, like education; health care; the environment; energy independence; and homeland security, including better security at our ports, at our airports and giving first responders the tools they need to keep our communities safe. 
   And here is what disturbs me the very most about this burn rate: while the administration throws good money after bad in Iraq, it wants to roll back health coverage for kids right here in America. Those are the wrong priorities. They are the wrong values. 
   Let's ask ourselves what are we getting for our $10 billion a month. We are getting an Iraq Government that isn't meeting any of the benchmarks. We are contributing to a refugee crisis that has already forced at least 4 million Iraqis out of their homes with tens of thousands leaving every month. And we are stretching our military to the breaking point. 
   Today, the Army announced that in June it missed its recruitment goal for the second month in a row. It appears that parents, alarmed about the bloodshed and never-ending nature of this occupation, are discouraging their children from signing up. Isn't it ironic that our involvement in Iraq is turning  out to be a bad recruiting tool for the United States but a great recruiting tool for al Qaeda and other terrorist groups? 
   I am encouraged, however, that a growing number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are turning against the occupation. But at the same time, the President gave a speech today in Cleveland that showed he isn't budging an inch from his failed escalation strategy. He said that Congress ``should wait'' for General Petraeus's report on the surge in September before making any decision about Iraq, while admitting at the same time that September is a meaningless goal. That is outrageous. The American people didn't send us to Congress to sit around and wait to do nothing. They sent us here to end the occupation, and that is what we must do. 
   I have proposed a bill that would achieve that, H.R. 508. It would fully fund bringing our troops home safely and soon. It would accelerate international assistance for reconstruction and reconciliation in order to keep Iraq as peaceful as possible. And it would use diplomacy. It would use diplomacy, not war, to achieve political solutions to regional problems. 
   We will have a golden opportunity in the days and weeks ahead to chart a new course. I urge my colleagues to heed the call and listen to history and listen to the American people and to bring our troops home.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, it's clear that the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, needs to be fixed. Year after year, we play this game of ``chicken'' with the end of the year, leaving millions of hard working American families fearful that they will be captured in a tax that was never meant to touch them. The good news is that the difference between this year's AMT patch and the ones that we did under the previous majority is that this time we are actually going to pay for it. 
   In my district alone, H.R. 3996 will save over 59,000 taxpayers from being subject to the AMT and it's my hope that this will be a first step to a responsible solution to permanently fixing this tax policy. 
   Also included in this bill is an extension and expansion of the Child Tax Credit, CTC, refund-ability. With economic disparity at its highest level since the Great Depression, expansion of this tax credit will help low-income families raise their children and help them get ahead. Finally, we are addressing the growing problem of the increasing gap between the wealthiest and the rest of America through a more equitable tax code. Thank you to Chairman RANGEL and Chairman NEAL for all of their hard work on this bill, closing loopholes, extending essential tax credits, and balancing the tax code.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, throughout most of our history, the world has admired the United States for our dedication to freedom, international law, and human rights. But today America's prestige is in the pits because of the administration's reckless occupation of Iraq. 
   The resignation last week of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy at the State Department brought new attention to our low standing in the world. The Under Secretary was hired in 2005 to improve our image in the world with a public relations campaign. But the effort failed. It failed because no amount of spin could overcome the catastrophic consequences of our occupation of Iraq. 
   Today, according to the Pew Global Attitudes Project, our image in the world is actually worse than it was before the public relations campaign began. Pew surveyed 33 countries and found that the United States is viewed less favorably in 26 of those countries. To be fair to the Under Secretary, her bosses in the White House had done a good job of trashing America's image in the world long before she started her job. 
   At the beginning of this decade, Mr. Speaker, the United States was viewed very favorably in many countries. But not anymore. For example, 78 percent of the German people viewed the United States favorably in the year 2000. Now it's just 37 percent. In Spain we have gone from a favorability rating of 50 percent to 23 percent. In Great Britain we have gone from 83 percent to 56 percent. And in France we have gone from 62 to 39. 
   In the Muslim world, we have just about fallen off the charts. In Turkey, for example, we have gone from 52 percent to just 12 percent. 
   And, most tragically, our occupation of Iraq has undermined support for American leadership in the fight against terrorism. In fact, less than half the people in all the countries I just cited are now willing to follow our lead. 
   We shouldn't be surprised by this. It is much harder to convince others to get behind us in the fight against terrorism when they actually believe that we are the threat to peace ourselves. And it's much harder for us to fight many other world problems, including poverty, disease, lack of education, and global warming when our standing in the world has hit rock bottom. 
   This foreign policy disaster is the result of a White House that has run amok for nearly 7 years. When you tear up your treaties, walk away from your friends, condone torture, go to war under false pretenses, and carelessly throw around words like ``World War III,'' you don't make America stronger; you make America weaker by destroying our credibility and undermining our moral authority. 
   The American people understand this, and they are demanding a new course for our Nation. They know the administration will never give us that; so they are looking to Congress to do the job. So far we have failed, but we have the power to turn things around, the power of the purse. We must use it, and we must use it to insist that any further funding for Iraq be dedicated to bringing our troops home. We must fully fund the safe, orderly, and timely redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. And we must also force the withdrawal of all of our military contractors who are acting like thugs in our Nation. We have a chance. We have a chance right now. If we don't take advantage of it, we will have failed our children and we will have failed America.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (OBSESSION WITH IRAQ HURTS AMERICAN SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, for over 5 years, the administration has had a single-minded obsession with the occupation of Iraq. It has poured our troops and our treasure into a misguided foreign adventure, while ignoring our Nation's real security needs, both at home and abroad. 
   I want to mention just a few of the ways that Iraq tunnel vision has blinded us to what we really need to be focusing on. First, the occupation of Iraq has weakened our efforts in Afghanistan. Secretary of Defense Gates has acknowledged that many Europeans do not support the NATO mission in Afghanistan because they oppose the American occupation of Iraq. 
   He has said, and I quote ``Many (Europeans) have a problem with our involvement in Iraq and project that to Afghanistan.'' 
   Second, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves have said that the use of the Guard and Reserves in Iraq has seriously weakened their ability to protect us from threats to the homeland. These threats could include terrorist attacks using chemicals, biological and nuclear weapons. 
   Third, just as our Guard and Reserves have been stretched too thin, our entire military has been stretched to the breaking point. Many of our most senior military leaders have been warning us for quite some time now that the occupation of Iraq has compromised our ability to respond to genuine threats elsewhere in the world. 
   Fourth, our occupation of Iraq has strengthened the hand of the pro-nuclear regime in Iran. The occupation has destabilized the region, giving Iran the chance to gain influence among its neighbors. 
   We must stand with our international partners, and we must work with international organizations to put strong diplomatic pressures on Iran to behave responsibly. We must begin direct negotiations with Iran. We cannot allow the occupation of Iraq to spread to a war with Iran. That would be another catastrophic mistake. 
   Iran would retaliate against our troops in Iraq and against our allies and interests throughout the region. Oil would spike, further threatening our economy right here at home. 
   Fifth, the occupation of Iraq has seriously undermined America's standing in the world. My colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman Delahunt of the Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight, issued a report on this subject just last week, a report that I hope every Member of the House will read. 
   The report describes the alarming decline in how the people of the world view the United States. There has been a 45-percent drop in America's favorability rating in Indonesia, a 41 percent drop in Morocco and a 40 percent drop in Turkey. 
   The United States is now viewed unfavorably by 82 percent of the people in Arab countries, and there has been a 26-point increase in Europe for the view that U.S. leadership in world affairs is undesirable. The report finds that two of major causes for this unprecedented and widespread decline are the occupation of Iraq and the torture and abuse of prisoners. 
   In addition, the people of the world believe that America's decisions are made unilaterally without regard to international law or standards, making our rhetoric about democracy quite hypocritical. 
   The administration has told us that the occupation of Iraq is all about spreading democracy in the Middle East. Yet, here we have clear evidence that their policy is failing, because you cannot bomb and blast your way to democracy. 
   There can be no doubt that the occupation of Iraq has weakened America's  defenses in many, many ways. The only solution is to responsibly redeploy our troops and military contractors out of Iraq. That way we can get back to the business of conducting an effective foreign policy, safeguarding our Nation's security, and working with the international community to bring peace to the world.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, today the House began debate on the budget for the next year. This is the time when each party shows its true priorities. The Democrats have promised to ensure our homeland security while providing for the needs of America's working families: health care, education, safe communities. 
   This is another chance to tell the people to tell the administration that we are not going to fund this misguided occupation of Iraq. We are quickly approaching one-half trillion dollars for the occupation of Iraq, including billions that have been lost, misallocated, or squandered, while drastically cutting important domestic programs in the United States of America. 
   Let me say that one more time: one-half trillion dollars. What comes after a trillion? A zillion? This might not mean much to some of the folks in Washington, but to the people scraping to get by this means everything. 
   We are in the fifth year of this occupation, and if we follow the leadership of the administration we will be there for years to come. In fact, they even say that the exit strategy for Iraq will be decided by future presidents. Presidents. Not one, but many. This is really unacceptable. 
   The Progressive Caucus budget, the Peace and Security budget, takes a stand against the ridiculous budget request and puts the money where it will do the most good. By ending our military presence in Iraq, we can save at least $202 billion over the next 2 years. Doing that, we can focus on the real needs of Americans. 
   The Congressional Progressive Caucus budget will fully fund No Child Left Behind and IDEA and improve the Teacher Corps and job training. It will provide affordable, accessible, quality health care for Americans, starting with fully funding the SCHIP program to ensure that every American child is covered for basic health insurance. It will rebuild America's communities by increasing funding for Community Development Block Grants, Hurricane Katrina relief, and reconstruction and community policing. It also guarantees veterans health care and ensures that the Federal funding that is needed will be available to provide health care, including mental health care, for every single American veteran, including but not limited to veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. 
   This Peace and Security budget gives a fair shake for working families by increasing funding to protect fundamental worker rights, enforcing credit and lending practices, and promoting liveable wages and safe work places. It also will renew the social contract and 21st century safety net by substantially increasing funding for decent, affordable housing, for anti-hunger programs, and more quality child care for low-income and impoverished Americans, including Hurricane Katrina victims. 
   Does this mean that we will abandon our obligation throughout the world? Absolutely not. We will support the Smart Security Plan by increasing nonmilitary spending to enhance homeland security and to fight the root causes of terrorism, a real 21st century diplomacy plan that meets basic human needs such as fighting HIV and AIDS and providing for universal basic education. 
   If we had spent the last 4 years focusing on the real needs of America's working families and not fighting this endless, misguided occupation of Iraq, America would be safer, more prosperous and a leader in peace and security worldwide. 
   It is time to bring common sense and reason back to our foreign policy. I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting the Progressive Caucus budget, the Peace and Security budget, and to join me in the call to bring our troops home now.

   As a member of the subcommittee, I'm especially pleased that this bill supports maternal health, orphans, and vulnerable children. Today, in Africa and throughout the world, children are losing their parents to the AIDS epidemic. These same kids will grow up too soon. They will be forced to become caregivers to their own siblings, leaving school, joining the underage workforce, praying that they are not the next in line for the graveyard. 
   In a world as prosperous as our own, Madam Chairman, it is absolutely unacceptable that this could be happening anywhere. But this bill actually continues our promise to rid the planet of this plague. This bill offers real hope. We invest in treatment, but most importantly, it works towards prevention. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I'm disappointed that conservative forces pushed to reduce the Reproductive Health Initiative, but the overall result will actually be remarkable. And most importantly, it will be life saving.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, when the American death toll in Iraq hit 4,000 on March 23, there was a great deal of coverage about it in the media. But the media only seems to care about the death toll when it reaches a special milestone. But now that the number of dead has reached 4,012, they have packed up their cameras, they have gone back to ignoring Iraq. Once again, our brave soldiers are dying in virtual anonymity, surely paying the highest price. 
   Here at home, the administration's occupation policies are harming American people in other ways. I am talking about the millions of Americans who are suffering because we are spending our Nation's treasure in Iraq rather than on vitally-needed social and economic programs here at home. We're spending about $4,600 every second on the occupation, or about $12 billion a month. 
   Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winning economist, has calculated that the occupation will ultimately cost $3 trillion, and that, Mr. Speaker, is a conservative estimate. And it will certainly cost a whole lot more if the administration gets its way and we establish permanent bases in Iraq or the others get their way and we remain involved in Iraq for 50 to 100 years. 
   This enormous drain on our resources has buried us so deeply in debt that we cannot make investments in the programs that would really move our Nation forward. Just think of what we could do with all of those trillions of dollars. 
   We could invest in the education of the 48 million children in our public schools. We could prepare them to compete and win in the global economy. 
   We could invest in early childhood education and the childcare that millions of poor and middle-class families so desperately need. 
   We could invest in the medical research needed to cure disease and to save millions of Americans from needless suffering and from premature death. 
   We could invest in our infrastructure and new green technologies which could produce millions of jobs around our Nation. 
   We could produce an economic stimulus package to fulfill remaining unmet needs. 
   We could help States and cities to provide their first responders with the equipment they need to save lives in the event of terrorism or natural disasters. 
   We could build more affordable housing and assist those who have been caught up in the mortgage meltdown. 
   We could provide health care to our citizens, starting with SCHIP for our children. 
   We could move to ensure the solvency of Social Security. 
   We could invest in global health. As a member of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, I can tell you that every single dollar spent on global health is a dollar spent to make our world more peaceful and stable. 
   These are just a few examples, Mr. Speaker. We couldn't do them all, but if we did just a few, we would go much further toward safeguarding our national security than we are currently doing in Iraq. 
   I hope my colleagues will remember this when General Petraeus arrives next week with his bar charts and statistics. Let us remember that the turmoil in the Middle East is helping to spike gas prices at the pump. It is leading us deeper and deeper into the effects of the Iraq recession. 
   The responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq is the one policy that makes sense, and the one policy that the great majority of the American people support. It is high time for us to do what the American people expect us to do, and they expect us to end our occupation of Iraq.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, before the invasion of Iraq, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was interviewed on television by George Stephanopoulos. Mr. Stephanopoulos asked Secretary Rumsfeld what invading Iraq would cost. Rumsfeld answered, ``Under $50 billion.'' 
   Mr. Stephanopoulos then replied that outside estimates say it would be up to $300 billion, to which Rumsfeld replied, ``Baloney.'' 
   Well, it may have been baloney to Rumsfeld then, but he must eat his words now because the cost of the occupation has climbed to over $400 billion so far. And it's going to go up, up, and up because our leaders in the White House seem simply not to care how much this occupation costs. It's like that old joke: We could say they are spending like drunken sailors, but we wouldn't say that because that would be an insult to the sailors. 
   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated yesterday that the occupation of Iraq could cost the taxpayers $1.9 trillion by the year 2017. Of that amount with over $500 billion going to just pay off the interest on the debt we're piling up, it is going to cost $500 billion. That's $500 billion that would fly out of our treasury and land in Japan and in China and the other countries that are lending us the money for the occupation. That is far more than what the SCHIP bill would cost us. 
   It is incredible to me and to most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle that the administration would rather give our country's money to foreign governments and investors than invest it in the health care of America's poor children. And it is incredible to me that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who lecture us daily about fiscal constraints, did not make a peep about this fiscal catastrophe. 
   The next question is, what are we getting for this money? The answer is, we are getting a slap in the face from the Iraqi leadership. 
   Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist who has won three Pulitzer Prizes, reported yesterday that the Iraqi leaders who are supposed to be working on the political reconciliation needed to end the conflict have been more asleep at the switch than ever. Mr. Friedman writes: ``Study the travel itineraries of Iraq's principal factional leaders. Did they all rush to Baghdad to try to work out their differences'' after General Petraeus testified before the Congress? ``No. Many of them took off for abroad. As one U.S. official in Baghdad pointed out to me,'' and this is Mr. Friedman speaking, ``at no point since the testimony by General Petraeus ..... have you had the four key Iraqi leaders in the same country at the same time. They saw the hearings as buying them more time, and so they took it.'' 
   With American troops and innocent civilians continuing to die in Iraq, you would think our leaders in the White House would be on the phone ten times a day with the Iraqi leaders demanding that they get out of their La-Z-Boy recliners and get to work. But the White House shows no desire to knock heads together. What does the White House do instead? It sends us a request for another $46 billion for this occupation. 
   We must tell the White House, ``Sorry, we've run out of blank checks.'' Then we must use our power of the purse to defund the occupation. Instead, we must fully fund the safe, orderly, and responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq, and that includes the withdrawal of all military contractors, including those trigger-happy Blackwater boys who have given our country a black eye. 
   Mr. Speaker, from now on every time the administration tells us it needs more money for its senseless occupation of Iraq, we have the perfect one-word answer, and that word is ``baloney.''

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, ours is a very generous Nation. As we have seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the Southeast Asian tsunami, the depth and breadth of American giving is unsurpassed. Our dedication goes far beyond natural disasters, however. 
   In each of our communities we have seen families reaching out by sending care packages to our troops, or donating school supplies for Iraqi children, or giving to refugee relief organizations. With the support of the Congress, the U.S. government is beginning to follow the path of the American people. Instead of a foreign policy balanced on the tip of a gun, some U.S. programs are reaching out to the people on the ground.     
   These are the types of programs which should be receiving robust support, not a misguided military agenda without an end game. 
   The United States Agency for International Development, known as USAID, has several excellent projects that are getting relief into the hands of Iraqi families. We should be helping to rebuild communities because, as the old saying goes, ``You break it, you buy it.'' To be sure, our obligation goes well beyond military and security intervention. 
   One program deserving note is a USAID grant to get the Balad canning factory up and running again. The factory, one of Iraq's largest food processors, was built in 1974. It was built as  a government-owned tomato paste factory. After privatization, the factory was producing 10 more products and employing 1,000 people, including 200 women. 
   According to USAID, with the instability that was brought on by the invasion of Iraq and the ensuing civil war, the factory's potential for food processing was shattered. Farmers were unable to work the fields, and the factory no longer had access to the agricultural supply required to operate. Not only were factory workers suddenly unemployed, tens of thousands of farmers found themselves similarly destitute.

   Madam Chairman, I'm pleased to rise in support of H.R. 3021, the 21st Century High-Performing Public School Facilities Act. 
   No child should be expected to learn in a crumbling school building. And this bill will give our Nation's schools the funds needed to repair and renovate their school building. That's very important because our children deserve the best opportunities in life, and that starts with a quality education in a safe building where students can focus on learning and teachers can focus on teaching.  
   This bill also encourages schools to make environmentally--green repairs. Schools in my district are making their facilities more environmentally friendly lately, and it's encouraging other schools to follow their lead because as our States face budget shortfalls and school districts deal with budget cuts, savings on energy costs will make a huge difference. 
   And it's a win-win. As a school shifts towards greening their school, students will learn about the process and the importance of preserving our environment. If you value our children, if you value our students, if you value their education and their educators, then show them; ensure their schools are the very best possible.

   The Administration said it's too expensive. Yet the Administration has had no trouble spending half-a-trillion dollars on the occupation of Iraq. The Administration's priorities are clear: Unlimited money for occupation, no money for kids. Currently, we're spending about $14 million dollars per hour on the occupation. That means we could provide medical, dental, and mental health care to more than 10,000 low-income children for the cost of just one single hour in Iraq. 
   This bill was an opportunity for us to stand up and say that 10 million of our Nation's children deserve health coverage and access to dental and mental health services. In California, that would have provided 607,000 additional children with health insurance. By vetoing this bill, the Administration has turned its back on these children. 
   Additionally, the Administration has abandoned its promise to our Nation's military service members and their families. This legislation amends the Family and Medical Leave Act, the landmark workplace protection legislation passed 14 years ago, to provide the spouse, child, parent, and next of kin of an injured service member with six months of unpaid, job protected leave to care for their wounded loved one. This language is identical to the bipartisan bill, H.R. 3481, the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act, which Chairman GEORGE MILLER and I have championed in the House and Senators CHRISTOPHER DODD and HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON have fought for in the Senate. We have a moral obligation to honor our military families, who should never have to choose between keeping their jobs and support and meeting the needs of their loved ones. As the Chairwoman of the Workforce Protections Subcommittee, I believe we can no longer afford to deny these dedicated men and women the urgently needed protections included in this bill. 
   Children are 25 percent of our population but 100 percent of our future. I look forward to working with my fellow Members to continue to protect the health and well-being of our Nation's most valuable resource: its children.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (THE PRESIDENT'S PRIORITIES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, all too often we've seen this administration turn a blind eye toward the priorities of our very country. While the administration has consistently failed to demonstrate restraint when it comes to escalating the occupation of Iraq, it has cold-heartedly insisted on denying the children of struggling working families with health insurance in the name of fiscal discipline. Once again, the values of the administration are glaringly out of step with the values of the American people. 
   The administration will not stand for accountability, transparency, or dissent when it comes to ending the occupation of Iraq. They will, however, support another blank check, resulting in more lives lost and more of our priorities left unfunded. 
   Earlier today, the House voted on overriding the President's veto of the children's health insurance reauthorization, or SCHIP. When the President vetoed SCHIP, he argued that the appearance of fiscal responsibility was more important than the health of 10 million of our children in this Nation. But when we learned that insuring 10 million children in America for 1 year costs the same as 40 days in Iraq, it is clear that the administration does not have its priorities straight. 
   Mr. Speaker, supporting our service men and women is certainly our absolute responsibility. Our Nation has an obligation to those who sacrifice and defend us during times of war. However, our servicemembers in Iraq were sent into combat without adequate training, without state-of-the-art body armor and equipment, and without assurances that their tours of duty will not be overextended. The glaring failures in Iraq show that not only is the Bush administration defunding our Nation's priorities to continue the occupation, but that it is allowing much of that money to be wasted. 
   The Inspector General has reported that $8.8 billion appropriated for Iraq's reconstruction cannot be accounted for. Media sources have recently reported that the administration is constructing a $600 million American Embassy located in the Green Zone in Iraq. This embassy, which is the largest in the world, in fact, it is larger than the Vatican, this embassy will include grocery stores, a movie theater, tennis courts and a social club. 
   It will require $1 billion a year to keep it up and to be maintained. Instead of our children's health care, the priorities of the Bush administration seem to be waste, fraud and abuse. 
   Mr. Speaker, when the administration vetoes a bipartisan investment in health insurance for our Nation's children, it rejects the priorities of the American people. When the administration spends billions on constructing and maintaining an embassy in Iraq while Iraq's infrastructure collapses around them, it compromises the safety of our troops abroad. And when the administration refuses to end the occupation in Iraq, it assures that countless generations will suffer for their mistakes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the priorities of the American people are clear. They want to provide health care for children. They want to promote peace and protect our troops. They want us to fully fund the efforts to bring our troops home. They want us to do it now.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (WAITING FOR THE NEXT BIG EVENT -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, last month, despite my objections and many of my colleagues, Congress passed a bill to continue funding the occupation of Iraq. Now everyone is waiting for the next big event in the war, General Petraeus's report on whether the escalation, the surge, is succeeding. This report is due in September. 
   But with our brave American troops and innocent Iraqis continuing to die, we are remiss if we twiddle our thumbs and wait for September. We need to hold this administration accountable for its actions in Iraq, and we need to do it today, not 3 months from now. 
   So I want to go back to January 10 of this year, the night that the President announced his new surge policy in a speech to the Nation, to see if he is delivering on what he promised. On that night, he said, ``America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' 
   But here we are, Mr. Speaker, 6 months later, and the Iraqi government has made virtually no progress on any of it's benchmarks. Even Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, our new war czar, expressed frustration about this in his Senate confirmation hearing. General Lute said, ``My assessment would be that the Iraqis have shown very little progress.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, back on January 10, we were told that the surge would help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence. But the Pentagon's own report on the current situation, which was released last Wednesday, said that the violence continues to be driven by sectarianism. In other words, we've sent our troops to fight a civil war that has nothing to do with protecting America from terrorism. 
   Also, back on January 10, the escalation speech included these words: ``Our military forces in Anbar are killing and capturing al Qaeda leaders.'' 
   Yet, Mr. Speaker, in the Senate hearing I mentioned a moment ago, Senator EVAN BAYH quoted a top CIA expert in saying that the American presence in Iraq is creating more members of al Qaeda than we are killing. 
   The President claims that he has the power to grab people off the streets of America, declare them enemy combatants and order the military to hold them indefinitely. But last week, a Federal Appeals Court ruled that, ``to sanction such authority would have disastrous consequences for the Constitution and for the country.'' 
   The President says that he is a strict constructionist when it comes to the Constitution. But he has shown that he is not a strict constructionist, not a loose constructionist, but a non constructionist who simply ignores the Constitution. 
   It is time, Mr. Speaker, for a new policy in Iraq. We must fully fund the safe redeployment of our troops. We must guarantee the very best health care for our veterans. We must work with the Iraqi people and the international community to provide for the reconstruction of Iraq. We must look to diplomacy, not preemptive war, to help Iraq and its neighbors to achieve political solutions to the region's problems, and there must be no permanent American military bases in Iraq. 
   And America must rely, once again, on our most powerful weapons in the fight against terrorism, our Constitution and our democratic values. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, we must bring our troops home.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for putting forth a good and necessary bill to protect our college students from the loan industry practices that actually work against, not for, those students who need the help. Every student in America who wants to go to college deserves the opportunity to do so, and we need to make it easier for them to go to school, not harder. Our students deserve all the help we can give them to ensure that they not only get a good education, but that they also don't come out of college saddled with loans or interest rates that will haunt them for years and years to come. 
   This bill will ensure that the student loan companies and some financial aid officers can no longer benefit from directing students to any particular loan company. What a concept. Loans should be for our children and for our students, not for those who are involved in the industry. 
   The Student Loan Sunshine Act ensures that students get the best possible options when deciding on a loan. A vote for this bill is a vote for our college students and for giving every child the opportunity to succeed in life, and indeed it is a vote for the future of the United States of America, because these young people are our future.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I commend the committee. I commend this committee for the hard work in crafting bipartisan legislation because as we continue to face the challenge of identifying new threats and providing new strategies for securing our Nation, it is absolutely essential that the Homeland Security Department operate to its full potential. 
   The Homeland Security authorization will ensure that taxpayers' dollars are not wasted by mismanagement and will encourage the best and the brightest minds of our time to contribute to our national homeland security strategy. 
   Harnessing these resources is absolutely key to protecting our Nation's vital infrastructure, infrastructure like the Golden Gate Bridge in my district. And it is vital to quickly respond in providing aid and support in the event of a disaster, unlike the way in which the Department responded to Hurricane Katrina. These new authorizations will make a huge difference. These reforms must be made to keep the people safe. So by restoring accountability to the Department and strengthening the protections for its employees, we can and we will improve our ability to effectively safeguard our Nation. 
   I encourage all Members to vote for the Homeland Security authorization.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, one learns the useful lesson of ``strength in numbers'' from an early age, but it seems some of us could use a refresher. The more people you have on your side, the better the chances of success. 
   Well, there are approximately 43 million Medicare beneficiaries in this country--more than enough, I'm sure, to throw some considerable weight behind the drug price negotiations we're debating today. 
   Now let's make one thing clear. The only real beneficiaries of the Medicare modernization act were the insurance companies and the drug companies whose profits continue to soar. 
   Meanwhile, seniors who have worked a lifetime to earn the peace of mind our drug program should be have been sacrificed for handouts to these industries. Furthermore, they remain responsible for paying a majority of their often astronomical prescription drug costs. 
   Well today the tides are turning. I'm proud to join my colleagues in support of this long-awaited, urgently needed measure that will finally bring seniors savings on their prescription drugs. 
   On behalf of beneficiaries in Marin and Sonoma counties, I urge you to support the seniors in your districts, by voting for H.R. 4.

   Mr. Speaker, the American people have called for bold action to bring our troops home, and today we are debating a first step, setting a date certain to bring them home. 
   Over the next weeks, we will vote to prohibit permanent bases in Iraq. We will continue the drumbeat to fund the safe and complete withdrawal of our troops. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, despite calls--no, actually pleas--from the American people, some at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and many right here in the House are just fine with staying the course. In fact, they are once again changing the conversation. They are trying to focus on gut feelings about an upcoming terrorist attack. But the American people will not stand for changing the conversation, and they will not stand for staying the course, nor should we in this Congress. 
   The costs are just too high: $10 billion a month, and worst of all, the deadliest 3-month period since the escalation; 3,600 troops dead; at least 26,000 wounded; and tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees leaving Iraq every day. This is not only unacceptable; it is immoral. 
   Today, the Congress must take a bold step to bring our troops home. We must stand up today with the American people. We must say, enough is enough. End the occupation, bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (GENERAL PETRAEUS'S REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, many of my colleagues are eagerly waiting for General Petraeus's report on the situation in Iraq this September. But I don't know why we are waiting because we have already heard from General Petraeus in September; September of 2004, that is. 
   On September 26, 2004, General Petraeus wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post giving his assessment of the situation in Iraq at that time. I think it would be very constructive for us to review that article, and I would like to read pieces from it. 
   Near the beginning General Petraeus says: ``Eighteen months after entering Iraq, I see tangible progress. Iraqi security elements are being rebuilt from the ground up. The institutions that oversee them are being reestablished from the top down. And Iraqi leaders are stepping forward, leading their country and their security forces courageously ..... '' 
   He goes on to recognize that the Iraqis face a violent insurgency, but he says: ``Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism ..... Iraqi police and soldiers ..... are performing a wide variety of security missions. Equipment is being delivered. Training is on track and increasing in capacity. Infrastructure is being repaired. Command and control structures and institutions are being reestablished.'' 
   And after citing many other examples of progress, the general ended his piece this way: ``I meet with Iraqi security force leaders every day ..... I have seen their determination and their desire to assume the full burden of security tasks for Iraq. There will be more tough times ..... along the way. Iraq's security forces are, however, developing steadily and they are in the fight. Momentum has gathered in recent months. With strong Iraqi leaders  out front and continued coalition support, this trend will continue.'' 
   Obviously, the general could not have been more wrong. 
   Madam Speaker, we can only hope that when General Petraeus reports to us this September that he will take off his rose-colored glasses and see things more clearly. The American people deserve a full accounting of what is really going on. But it actually looks like we won't get it. Ambassador Crocker has said that the report will be just a ``snapshot.'' So it looks like the White House spin machine is already trying to lower expectations and do preemptive damage control again. 
   But the damage in Iraq has already been done, and the American people deserve more than spin. What we need is a national security plan that is based on what will actually make our Nation safe. Such a plan must include diplomacy, strong international alliances against terrorism, initiatives to address the root cause of terrorism, and a new approach to foreign policy, an approach that restores America's credibility and moral leadership in the world. 
   I have proposed such a national security plan. It is called SMART, which stands for Sensible, Multilateral American Response to Terrorism. I invite all my colleagues to learn about it and consider this plan. 
   In the meantime, the runup to General Petraeus's report continues. I hope that this September he will be more accurate than he was in September 2004. But I am not holding my breath. In fact, I will not breathe easily until all of our troops are home safely.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bipartisan Farm Bill, and, in particular, section 4302. This section includes language directing the Secretary of Agriculture to undertake training, guidance, and enforcement of current Buy American Statutory requirements. I applaud the Agriculture Committee for including this important provision in the Farm Bill. 
   Congress has time and time again expressed its desire that taxpayer dollars be used to purchase domestically produced goods. We have consistently stated, through public law and senses of the Congress, that American-made goods should be given top priority. 
   Despite the repeated efforts of Congress, however, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has chosen not to enforce the law. Schools, if they are even aware of the Buy American requirement, need training and assistance in how to incorporate the requirement into their bid solicitations. 
   Some companies blatantly disregard the requirement. A year ago, at a national school food conference, a food company marketed their peaches to school foodservice authorities. However, these peaches were clearly marked: ``peaches from China, packed in Thailand.'' If a school foodservice authority were to purchase this product for use in the national school lunch and breakfast programs, it would be an outright violation of Federal law. 
   After this was brought to the attention of USDA, a letter was issued to the conference host. No additional guidance, no additional training, no attempt to bring awareness to the issue. Obviously, the problem has not been adequately dealt with. A year later, at the same national school food conference, held just a week ago, the same product was exhibited: ``peaches from China, packed in Thailand.'' Evidently, nothing has changed. USDA needs to take responsibility to fulfill its duty to implement the law. 
   We produce, and should be promoting, plenty of high quality fresh, canned, and frozen product in the U.S. There is no reason to violate the law and purchase foreign goods. Now, more than ever, when our farmers need support, when we are facing food imports of questionable safety, it is vital that we ensure our school children are eating products produced by American Agriculture. 
   I applaud the Agriculture Committee for including this important language.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, this Thursday night, I will join many of my constituents at the 26th Annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Humanitarian Awards hosted by the Marin County Human Rights Commission in San Rafael, California. 
   Ten of my constituents, including four high school seniors, will receive awards for the many, many contributions they have made to our community, and I would like to name a few of them. Two doctors, Paul Cohen and Alicia Suski, will be honored for developing a partnership to provide medical and legal services to low-income residents. An educator, Whitney Hoyt, will be honored for protecting the rights of gay students. A high school senior, Joanna Sitzmann, will be recognized for her work with a therapeutic horseback riding program for people with disabilities. Another student, Morgan Green, will be cited for helping to raise money for the victims of the crisis in Darfur. And another high school senior, Allison Franklin, will be honored for working with disadvantaged youngsters, including those participating in the Marin Special Olympics. 
   I am really proud of these wonderful constituents, constituents who are serving others. I know there are millions of other Americans just like them, and they can be found in every single congressional district. They represent the true face of America, the America that has compassion for the people of the world, who want the world to be a better place for all of us. 
   But today, the world has a very different picture of America, Mr. Speaker. The people of the world see us through the lens of the occupation of Iraq, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo. They hear about torture, waterboarding, and the reckless activities of the Blackwater military contracts. 
   In addition to the very real human rights issues that these problems raise, they have made it much harder for us to win the public relations battle against the terrorists. And in the long run, that public relations battle, along with other elements of so-called ``soft power,'' are just as important, if not more important, than any military battle that we will fight in Iraq. 
   Even Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has recognized this. In a speech he gave 2 months ago, Secretary Gates said, and I quote, ``One of the more important lessons of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win. Economic development, institution building, and rule of law, promoting internal reconciliation, good governance, providing basic services to the people, and strategic communications are essential ingredients for long-term success.'' He also called for an increase in spending on the soft power components of national security. These include diplomacy, foreign assistance, and economic reconstruction and development. 
   I agree with Secretary Gates about all of this, but this appears to be one more example of our leaders not backing up their words with actions. This administration has relied solely upon military power to achieve its objectives. It hasn't believed in diplomacy in the first place, or of the other elements of soft power. 
   Our leaders think they can bomb and shoot their way to a more democratic and peaceful world, and they've been proven wrong over and over again. In their latest testimony before the House, our generals have told us that our occupation of Iraq may last until the year 2020. And even Secretary Gates has undermined his own lofty rhetoric about diplomacy by saying that a 50-year occupation would be just fine with him. 
   The only way to restore our moral leadership and our ability to influence events is to responsibly redeploy our troops out of Iraq. That would allow the regional and international diplomacy needed to end the conflict to begin. It is up to Congress to use its power of the purse to make this happen. The administration will never do it. Our leaders offer us high-minded speeches about the rule of law and diplomacy, but all they give us are bloodshed and occupation. And Mr. Speaker, it must stop.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, for the past 5 years, the administration has underfunded the No Child Left Behind Act to the tune of more than $50 billion. This has robbed millions of children of the education they will need to succeed in the 21st century, and it is robbing America of the brain power we need to stay competitive in the global economy. 
   Those of us who believe it's a bad idea to shortchange our kids and our Nation begged the administration to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act, but our pleas were ignored. That is one of the reasons I was so outraged last week when the White House requested $46 billion in supplemental funding for its occupation of Iraq. That $46 billion, Madam Speaker, is almost identical to the amount that the administration has underfunded No Child Left Behind. In fact, the administration announced its request at a press conference. In that one short press conference, they asked for virtually the same amount for Iraq that it has been denying to our Nation's schools for nearly 6 years. 
   And while the administration has demanded that every school in America show adequate yearly progress on its learning benchmarks or they will be punished, punished financially for the most part, it has allowed the Iraqi Government to show virtually no progress at all when it comes to meeting its benchmarks for peace. 
   And education is not the only crying need that is being ignored. The opportunity costs of the occupation are actually incalculable. The occupation is soaking up dollars we need to meet so many of our domestic challenges. If we really want America to be secure, we must invest in child care, we must invest in health care, sustainable energy, the environment, law enforcement, community and economic development, medical research, real homeland security, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. 
   But the administration believes that policing a centuries-old civil war in  Iraq trumps all other needs. The American people do not agree with this administration's priorities. They want action, they want real solutions to our domestic problems, and they want to fight a real war on terrorism, not the phony war on terrorism the administration is fighting in Iraq. 
   When the President signed the No Child Left Behind Act, Madam Speaker, he said it was the most important piece of legislation most of us will ever work on. The education of our children is far more important to the future of our country than an endless and counterproductive occupation of another country. 
   That is why Congress must finally stand up to the administration and say no, no to supplemental funding that would bring our total spending in Iraq this fiscal year alone to $160 billion. Madam Speaker, that's over $13 billion a month, or nearly $450 million per day. 
   Almost exactly a year ago, the American people sent us to Congress to end the occupation of Iraq. It's time that we do it. We must use our power of the purse to fully fund the safe, orderly and responsible redeployment of all of our troops out of Iraq, and that includes the withdrawal of all of our military contractors as well. 
   As if one occupation army weren't enough, these independent contractors comprise a second occupation army that is angering the Iraqi people and actually making life much harder for our very own troops. 
   Madam Speaker, we can't afford to keep throwing money into the bottomless pit of Iraq. That appears to be what our leaders in the White House want us to do. But their policy is bankrupting all of us politically, economically, and morally. It is time that we come to our senses; it is time to end this madness.

<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, yesterday as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I participated in one of the Petraeus-Crocker hearings. Sadly, it was just more of the same. We heard doubletalk and nuanced excuse. 
   The American people and the Congress demand more. This is not the punchline on some late night comedy news show. This is the blood and treasure of our Nation. And now the Administration has its hand out for another blank check, over $1 billion rumor has it. This Congress should remain firm in its opposition to an open-ended occupation which is neither making America safer nor providing any real hope for the Iraqi people. 
   Just a few months ago, Madam Speaker, our esteemed Appropriations Chairman, Mr. Obey, introduced, and this House passed, a bill that clearly stated the position of a majority of Americans. 
   With bipartisan support, the bill stated, the primary purpose of funds made available by this Act should be to transition the mission of United States Armed Forces in Iraq and undertake their redeployment and not to extend or prolong the war. 
   A line has been drawn in the sand. The bar was raised, and we will not step back from this. 
   From so-called blue states to red states, from east coast to west, from the deep south to the midwest, on to the great plain states, people are fed up. They overwhelmingly, time after time, demand that we end our occupation of Iraq, bring our troops home and that we also bring military contractors home and reaffirm our support of the Iraqi people by funding reconstruction and reconciliation efforts. 
   Our assistance should come through diplomacy. Actually through a handshake, not at the point of a gun. What is the best way to help the Iraqi people? By occupying their land or by lending a hand? As I said many, many times, I represent the most beautiful and most progressive congressional district. Every day my constituents make me proud to represent such amazing people. My own community has collected supplies for the troops, has donated to aid agencies and has gone the extra distance by giving straight from the heart. 
   One such example is Dominican University in Marin County. They've offered free schooling to Iraqi refugees. As part of the Iraqi Student Project, they will receive tuition and fee waivers. It may not seem like much to some, but I can tell you, this generous gift will change lives. 
   Our communities can make these small but priceless gestures. But the real work lies here under the Dome. We have the support of the American people, the Iraqis, and the world community. We can't wait until next year. We can't wait until the next decade or the next century. 
   So as this spending bill comes together, Americans want to know that their voices are being heard and, most importantly, heeded. 
   We must stand strong. We must steel our spines. In November, the House of Representatives said that the primary purpose of all of those Federal dollars was a safe and orderly redeployment. The administration disagreed saying it won't back down. 
   We will consider spending over $1 billion on the Iraq occupation in the coming weeks, Madam Speaker. I, for one, welcome the debate.

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, last week, the President called for an enduring relationship with Iraq, a relationship that extends beyond his administration. He did not tell us exactly how long this would last, but we have to have a good idea, because the White House and the Secretary of Defense have said that our involvement on the Korean peninsula should be the model for Iraq. That would mean they are planning to occupy Iraq for 50 years or more. 
   Consider what this means: A lame duck administration is committing the United States to decades of occupation that will cost trillions of dollars and result in the deaths of countless American troops and Iraqi civilians. This is simply, simply, intolerable. 
   We were also told last week that the next Petraeus report will come in this coming March and we must wait for that report before we act. But we can't sit around and we can't wait. We can't wait for another Petraeus report; we can't sit around and wait for another Crocker report, because we are fiddling while Iraq burns. We have already had a 4 1/2 -year sugar-coated spin and TV show from the Oval Office. 
   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. The occupation is damaging America morally, politically and economically, and it must end. The Congress has the constitutional power and the Congress has the responsibility to end it. 
   It is time to take bold action. It is time to use our power, our power of the purse, to bring our brave troops home. We must pass a bill requiring that all war spending be used for one purpose and one purpose only, to fully fund the safe, orderly and responsible withdrawal of American troops and military contractors. Commanders on the ground would be given what they need to ensure the safe redeployment of all troops. The bill should also set firm and doable dates for the start and the end of the withdrawal. 
   We can then help the Iraqis by replacing military action that isn't working with the strong regional and international diplomatic efforts that can work, work to bring about reconciliation and reconstruction to Iraq. 
   By using our power of the purse, the Congress can set the political agenda. We can build political momentum for withdrawal by offering the American people a clear and easily understood plan for ending our involvement in Iraq. And we can change the terms of the debate from the narrow ``is the surge working'' to ``how soon can we get on with the job of bringing peace to Iraq and restoring America's moral leadership in the world.'' 
   If we use our constitutional power of the purse, the administration would surely attack us. They would say we are cutting off funding for the troops. But that would be false. The troops would get every single last dollar they need to come home to their families, come home safe and come home sound. 
   To those who might have objections to this plan, I would say, is there a better way to end the occupation once and for all? I think the answer is no, there is none. 
   I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me. Do what the American people sent us here to do: End the occupation of Iraq, and end it now

   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, maybe, just maybe, if a woman has access to contraceptives, abortion will be prevented. 
   What is wrong with you people? Where do you come from? 
   Oh, that's right, you come from the United States of America, where all women are allowed, rich or poor, to have access to and choices over family planning. Lucky us. 
   There are many choices for preventing unwanted pregnancies, and let us not forget prevention of HIV/AIDS. If you are against abortion, at least support prevention. If you are concerned about HIV/AIDS, support contraception. 
   Our Nation has a long history of generosity and caring. That should not end today. What are we doing? We are up here with the Lowey amendment ensuring that women in the poorest villages in the poorest countries have access to contraceptives. We are doing that by providing medically approved and necessary contraceptives to women who would otherwise have no other means to prevent unwanted pregnancies and/or to prevent HIV/AIDS. 
   Unintended pregnancies and illegal abortions have been on the rise in areas where access to family planning has been denied. Chairwoman Lowey's provision is just plain common sense. Let's put women's health above politics and vote ``no'' on the Smith-Stupak amendment.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (ESCALATION IN IRAQ WAR COSTS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to draw attention to the surge, or escalation, of the occupation of Iraq. This time it is not an escalation of troops; it is the escalation in spending to continue this senseless, apparently endless occupation. 
   Recent estimates put the cost of the military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan at $808 billion by the end of this year. That's just knocking on the door of $1 trillion, Mr. Speaker. Let me say that again: we are closing in on $1 trillion, and we haven't even begun to put together a plan to bring our troops home. 
   This administration has talked about a Korean- or Vietnam-like presence in Iraq. This could mean as much as 50 more years of U.S. boots on the ground. Conservative estimates put just one more decade of military spending at $1.5 trillion. Who knows what it will be after 20 or 30 or 50 years. 
   The United States has an obligation, both moral and political, to help the people of Iraq to rebuild their nation. Whether through reconciliation or reconstruction, our commitment must be ongoing. But we can't start either of these while we are funding this administration's occupation. 
   Despite the bravery of our men and women in uniform, we all know that we can't bring peace and stability to another country down the barrel of a gun. 
   A recent report by the Congressional Progressive Caucus found that this misdirection of funds may actually be endangering our own homeland. Each of my colleagues can go to my Web site, www.Woolsey.house.gov, and find out what it is costing their congressional district. 
   My district of Marin and Sonoma counties in California have already paid $1.3 billion for the occupation of Iraq. That could have paid for nearly 25,000 public safety officers or nearly 18,000 port container inspectors to provide real security for our homeland. 
   Instead of passing on a war deficit to our children and grandchildren, we could have been investing in their future and, Mr. Speaker, we must. So far in paying for the occupation, we could have paid for 20,000 more elementary school teachers, or we could have provided almost 500,000 more children with health care, or 200,000 college scholarships to worthy students. 
   America's working families have demanded, they went to the polls in November, they want us to end this occupation. They want real investment in their own communities. They want this Congress to stand up to the White House and demand that our troops and military contractors be brought home, not in 10 years, not in 50 years. They want our troops home in a safe and orderly responsible manner by the holidays. 
   Enough of the endless occupation. Enough of the misspent billions. Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. Let's bring the troops home. Let's provide for a secure future for American and Iraqi families.

<DOCNO>Ms. WOOLSEY. (CORPORAL CLOY RICHARDS--``WHY I FIGHT FOR PEACE'' -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, all too often the painful stories of those who have served in Iraq go unheard by Representatives in Washington; however, their experiences are a window into the truth about the real effect of this war on real people, both in service and after they come home from service. 
   One of these stories belongs to Corporal Cloy Richards, who bravely served with the United States Marine Corps for two tours in Iraq and may soon be called back again even though he has been diagnosed with PTS. 
   Cloy Richards has a poem; it is a courage poem. It is entitled: ``Why I Fight for Peace.'' This poem is exactly the message we need to hear.     
   The message that shows us in our continuing debate on funding the occupation of Iraq, just how this affects our servicemembers. 
   As I said, the poem is called, ``Why I Fight for Peace,'' by Corporal Cloy Richards, United States Marine Corps. And I am going to read it, Mr. Speaker. 
   ``Because I can't forget no matter how hard I try. They told us we are taking out advancing Iraqi forces, but when we went to check out the bodies, they were nothing but women and children desperately fleeing their homes because they wanted to get out of the city before we attacked in the morning. 
   ``Because my little brother, who is my job to protect, decided to join the California National Guard to get some money for college, and they promised he wouldn't go to Iraq. Instead, 3 months after enlisting, he was sent to Iraq for 1 year. 
   ``Since he has been home for the last 6 months, he refuses to talk to anyone; he lives by himself. The only person he associates with is a friend of his, the one other man out of his squad of 13 men who made it home alive. 
   ``He called me a few weeks ago for the first time, and he told me he's having nightmares. I asked what they were about, and he said, they're about picking up the pieces of his fellow soldiers after a car bomb hit them. 
   ``Because every single one of the Marines I served with, the really brave warriors, even when some friends and people they looked up to got killed and lost an arm or a leg, they wouldn't cry; they just kept fighting. They completed their mission. 
   ``Every one of them I have spoken to since we got home has broken down  crying in front of me, saying all they can do since they got back is bounce from job to job, drink and do drugs and contemplate suicide to end the pain. 
   ``Because I'm tired of drinking, bouncing from job to job and contemplating suicide to end the pain. 
   ``Because every time I see a child, I think of the thousands I have slaughtered. Because every time I see a young soldier, I think of the thousands Bush has slaughtered. Because every time I look in the mirror, I see a casualty of war. 
   ``Because I have a lot of lives I have to make up for, the lives I have taken. And because it's right. That's why I fight. Because of soldiers with wounds you can't see.'' 
   As I said, Cloy Richards served two tours in Iraq. He is currently in the IRR and facing a possible involuntary recall for a third tour. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, I urge the President to remember that our commitment to our soldiers does not stop on the battlefield. It must continue when our troops return home. 
   Corporal Richards deserves our full support. He has bravely fulfilled his duty to fight for our country. 
   Now it is time for the Congress to fulfill its duty, and we must do that by heeding his call for peace. This is a call we cannot afford to ignore.
