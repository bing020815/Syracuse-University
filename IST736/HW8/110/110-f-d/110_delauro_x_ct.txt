<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, from negative economic data on wages and consumer prices, to a falling stock market, there is almost no margin for error in today's tight economy. We face an urgency and a moral obligation to get it right and ensure no American is forced to live in those margins. 
   This legislation represents a strong bipartisan agreement on an economic stimulus package that will begin to provide financial relief and income security to middle-class Americans most at risk in a prospective recession. 
   Building on our work to extend the child tax credit, and my belief that all hardworking low- and middle-income families should receive at least a partial credit, this package will ensure that any family that pays taxes and earned at least $3,000 last year will get a $300 rebate per child. It is long past time that we finally recognize that the child tax credit should be available to all families, including those who serve in our military. 
   With the economy in so much difficulty, this is the right approach: immediate, focused on those who need resources, and who will spend it. Unlike previous efforts to stimulate the economy, this package is focused on the middle class, and provides real, not token, relief. That includes $28 billion in tax relief for 35 million families who work but make too little to pay income taxes, but they pay sales tax, FICA tax, property taxes, families who otherwise would not have been included in this recovery effort, more than 19 million of them with children. 
   To meet our obligation, boost our struggling economy, and provide real assistance for middle-class Americans, I urge a ``yes'' vote.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (NEW ENGLAND NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to rise in support of H.R. 1528, the New England Scenic Trail Designation Act, which would designate portions of the Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett, or the MMM Trail System, as a national scenic trail. 
   I commend Representative Olver for his leadership on this issue, and I thank him for bringing the entire region together to make this happen. 
   This is a simple commitment to act as responsible stewards of our natural resources. We have an obligation to our communities and to generations that follow to preserve our Nation's scenic beauty, wildlife, and outdoor recreation. 
   Now we have the opportunity to make good on that great promise, every step of the way along the 190-mile MMM trail system as it winds through 39 communities in central Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
   The trail route, which has been in existence for over half a century, hosts numerous scenic features and historic sites. But more than that, this unique trail passes through some of the most densely populated parts of the country, 2 million people live within 10 miles of the trail, and offers users exceptional recreational opportunity near urban areas. 
   That is why this legislation is so critical. By protecting against increasing pressures from residential subdivision growth, national scenic trail designation will provide an opportunity for long-term viability. 
   It will offer residents safe, healthy recreation options free of smog, congestion, and stress. In an age when we are constantly trying to combat sprawl in our communities, we need to recognize that these kinds of projects are a real investment in our communities and in community spirit alike. I urge a ``yes'' vote.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. I rise in support of this bill. It's an important first step to address the concerns of millions of Americans, families and farmers, who feel powerless at the gas station and in the grocery store, sensing that something more than supply and demand is going on, producing breathtakingly high prices. 
   It's a complex issue. Excessive speculation occurs when the market price for a given commodity no longer accurately reflects the forces of supply and demand. We can point to loopholes and exemptions today that have allowed interested parties and special interests access and information to improperly speculate on the price of energy without oversight. 
   This bill confronts that speculation. It says to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission this is new authority to gather the information from currently unregulated, over-the-counter energy transactions. If it's improper speculation which is driving up the prices, the agency has the authority to act to reduce that speculation. It's new, long overdue authority that will shed light on once hidden markets. 
   It makes sure we know who is participating in the markets, to what extent, by requiring detailed trading information from index traders and swap dealers. It works to make sure that only those who are legitimate hedgers can use them. 
   It brings relief and can bring relief to American families and says to the CFTC: Do your regulatory job.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Chairman, the National Labor Relations Board was created to ensure that workers enjoyed the same freedom of association in the workplace that they did in the political arena, to guarantee free and fair union elections. And today the democratic principles in the workplace that built our vibrant middle class are at risk. Instead of holding companies who violate labor law accountable for their actions, the board routinely rules on the side of employers. 
   In my community we have had several disputes in which a strong, just NLRB would make such a difference: employees at a hospital, a uniform company, graduate teaching assistants at a local university. 
   The time has come for Congress to reform the NLRB. That is why I support the Employee Free Choice Act. It simplifies the organizing process. It expands remedies for employer interference and intimidation. It commits labor and management to collective bargaining. 
   This legislation is about standing up for the efforts of working people to improve their lives, honoring their commitment and dedication that they bring to their jobs. It is our core responsibility as government to support the Employee Free Choice Act.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment. We have 28 million people living within 50 miles of the Long Island Sound. It contributes more than $5 billion to our economy annually. It provides environmental, recreational, and economic opportunity for our communities. 
   It is an estuary designated by Congress for its national significance. Our responsibility is to keep major and potentially dangerous industrial product out of our fragile sound. That includes the LNG Broadwater facility. This would install a floating vessel, roughly the size of Queen Mary 2, 10.2 miles off the Connecticut coast, 9 miles off the Long Island coast. 
   It calls for the installation of a 25-mile pipeline in the middle of prime territory for lobstering and fishing. It creates an exclusionary zone, prohibits any vessels from coming within a certain distance of the facility itself and delivery tankers. It would fall to the Coast Guard to maintain our security. 
   Their funds are stretched thin. Instead of being able to manage fisheries, conducting lifesaving operations, and dealing with port security, we will be diverting resources to these tankers. It would propose a new security risk. 
   I commend Mr. Bishop and my colleague, Mr. Courtney. This amendment gives DOE the time to address these concerns.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. 
   Connecticut has seen a 5.5 percent increase in commuter rail usage over the first quarter of 2008 alone. As gas prices continue to skyrocket, more Americans than ever are looking for new ways to get where they are going without filling their gas tank. 
   While thousands of Connecticut residents who live in the southern portion of the State are well served by Metro North and the Shoreline East commuter rail, there remains hardly any commuter rail options in the central portion of our State through Hartford and up to Springfield, Massachusetts. Yet New England's traffic has increased 2 to 3 times faster than its population since 1990. When 80 percent of Connecticut commuters drive to work by themselves, we must provide a better alternative. 
   I want to commend Chairman Oberstar for his hard work on this bill. I congratulate my colleague, Mr. Murphy, whose amendment expresses support for current discussions between Amtrak and the Connecticut Department of Transportation to create a cooperative framework by which an Amtrak-owned New Haven-Springfield rail line could serve as the conduit for increased commuter rail run by Connecticut DOT. And his amendment also requires a report to Congress on uncompleted infrastructure maintenance. 
   Expanded commuter rail service on the New Haven-Springfield line will result in an estimated 630,000 more trips a year and over 2 million passenger miles annually. The demand is there. The benefits are clear. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank Chairman Oberstar, and I thank you graciously, Mr. Shuster, for allowing me to take the time.

   And after President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki signed a ``Declaration of Principles'' document outlining unprecedented security commitments and assurances to Iraq from the United States, I introduced the Iraq Strategic Agreement Review Act. 
   So today I want to voice my support for the provision that makes clear, as my bill does, that any security arrangement between the United States and Iraq will not be funded unless it comes in the form of a treaty or is specifically authorized by a law. 
   As we speak, the administration is negotiating a strategic framework agreement that goes well beyond a typical Status of Forces Agreement, essentially amounting to a treaty. It will need to be ratified by the Iraqi parliament, and it must be ratified by the United States Congress as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, this issue goes to the heart of our constitutional duties as a Congress and the power to declare war with which we have been entrusted as representatives. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this provision.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (RECOGNIZING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN SPIRITUAL AS A NATIONAL TREASURE -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation that would recognize the African American spiritual as a national treasure, and would like to say thank you to my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) with whom I introduced this legislation in the Congress, as well as my colleagues on the floor this morning, the gentlewoman from California and the gentleman from Michigan, and also the chairman, Mr. Miller, for bringing the bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, even though they sprang from one of the darkest periods of our Nation's history, a period of turmoil that Americans still live with to this day, as we all know, African American spirituals have inspired many of America's most remarkable and enduring musical accomplishments. Name the modern music form, and it owes a debt to the spiritual. Jazz, blues, rock and roll, gospel all trace their origins to this particular musical heritage. Today people around the world play, listen to, and find the deepest of inspiration in the music of Africans who lived their lives in slavery. 
   In so many ways this is a uniquely American music, one born of our uniquely American experience, reminding us who we are, where we come from, and all that we are capable of as a society and as a Nation. 
   The African American spiritual is as poignant and powerful a genre of music as any in history. And throughout history the African American spiritual has been kept alive through that oral tradition. For certain, this was so before the abolition of slavery in 1865 when these songs provided comfort and an outlet for spiritual yearning for so many, but also in the years immediately following abolition when few wished to sing African American spirituals, so acute was the pain and anguish they called to mind. 
   Thankfully there were some who recognized in the power of these songs the collective experiences from which they came and their intrinsic cultural and musical value. And by the late 19th and early 20th century, the spiritual was kept alive by churches and singing groups like the Fisk Jubilee Singers, who traveled and performed these remarkable pieces in the face of hostility and intolerance. Indeed, in 1872, the Jubilee Singers sang at the World Peace Festival in Boston and were invited to perform at the White House that year by no less than President Grant himself. 
   Today African American spirituals are not only performed in spirituals and concert halls across the world, they are also studied by sociologists and musicologists across the country. The University of Denver's Spirituals Project puts it aptly in its mission statement: ``Spirituals uplift in times of crisis, heal, comfort, inspire, and instill hopes and dreams, thereby transforming individuals, communities, and whole societies.'' 
   And in much the same spirit of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, I want to say thank you to a good friend, a musicologist himself, for bringing to my attention the need for the Congress to honor this vital piece of our national heritage, Calvin Earl. As the youngest of nine children in North Carolina, Calvin taught himself the guitar at age 7, forming his first rhythm and blues group while serving in the Army before spending several decades performing jazz and big band music. Since 1989, Calvin has dedicated himself to preserving and sharing spirituals with a new generation of Americans. Traveling the country, he builds on the traditional words and melodies to illuminate the history and complexity of this unique art form. 
   It was from Calvin that I learned about this remarkable tradition, how spirituals enabled slaves to teach their children, record their history, and surreptitiously communicate with one another. Indeed, songs such as ``Wade in the Water,'' ``The Gospel Train,'' and ``Swing Low, Sweet Chariot'' all reference the Underground Railroad. Another, ``Follow the Drinking Gourd,'' even contained a coded map to the Underground Railroad. As these songs were spontaneous, their authors are not known, though they were the inspiration for the writers of the first gospel songs, from Charles Albert Tindley to Harry Thackert Burleigh to John Rosamond Johnson. 
   Mr. Speaker, no less than Frederick Douglass remarked that such spirituals ``told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension. They were tones loud, long, and deep. They breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains.'' 
   Indeed, in so many ways the African American spiritual embodies who we are as Americans. The impact it has made on the cultural heritage of America, and indeed every American, is incalculable. I thank all who have allowed us to bring this resolution for consideration today. I urge my colleagues to support honoring this national treasure and this timeless reminder of the enduring human spirit.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of every working woman who faces pay discrimination in the workforce and call on the House to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to limit the ability of women and other employees to sue their employers for pay discrimination under title VII. The court decided that a victim of pay disparity should be able to document a discriminatory difference in pay within a mere 6 months, despite the typical office secrecy over income. 
   The Supreme Court is essentially rolling back efforts to ensure equal pay. When women still earn only 77 percent of what men earn, this ruling leaves these individuals with no recourse or remedy. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act will help women confront discrimination in the workplace and give teeth to the Equal Pay Act by prohibiting employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information with their co-workers; allowing women to sue for punitive damages and recovery of back pay; and create a new program to help strengthen the negotiation skills of girls and women. 
   Mr. Speaker, next Sunday, we commemorate 44 years since John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act and still equal pay is not a fact of life for American women. It is time to value the work that women do in our society. Let's pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bill and want to commend the chairman and the staff for an excellent bill which signals a new direction and reflects our priorities as a Nation. The goal of this bill has always been to make a strong investment in our future, to take seriously our responsibility to the American public. 
   I'm proud to see that this bill will provide $10 million to the Sexual Assault Service Program directly for rape crisis centers, State and territorial sexual assault coalitions and culturally specific programs and tribes. 
   This is the only Federal funding stream dedicated entirely to providing direct services for victims of sexual violence. That is vital because, without a consistent and a specialized funding stream for direct services, rape crisis centers are stretched to the limit trying to meet increased demand for services with reduced government funding. 
   We are finding other ways as well to strengthen services to victims of all domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, by significantly boosting funds for the Office of Violence Against Women, $430 million, or $60 million above the President's request. 
   We know these programs are both necessary and effective. Since the Violence Against Women Act was first passed in 1994, reports of domestic violence have decreased by half. But as long as domestic violence continues, we must continue fighting to ensure women have the tools to fight back. 
   The bill also works to strengthen local law enforcement $3.2 billion to protect our communities and our quality of life, including COPS grants to put 2,800 new police officers on the streets, drug courts, Byrne grants for local crime prevention programs, and a competitive youth mentoring grants program to prevent juvenile delinquency. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill reflects a commitment to our longstanding responsibilities and true fiscal responsibility. Together we can meet our obligations as a Congress and a Nation to the American people.

   With this legislation, we can recover $14 billion in unnecessary oil and gas subsidies and target that money toward where it should have been going all along, into renewable energy sources created right here at home, into alternative fuels grown on our farms and energy-efficiency technologies, creating jobs, protecting our consumers and our economy. 
   We could generate over 800,000 jobs by 2010, jobs from the Great Plains to the Northeast. In Bethlehem, Connecticut, we have the first biodiesel production plant in New England, in partnership with Maryland and Delaware soybean growers. 
   By supporting this legislation, we have an opportunity to begin bridging the cultural, economic and social divide growing between rural America and other parts of the country.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, our economy is struggling. We know the price at the gas pump is killing middle class families trying to make ends meet, farmers harvesting their crops, truckers traveling our highways. 
   I rise in support of this bill. It's an important first step to address the concerns of millions of Americans who fear something more than just supply and demand is at play and our energy markets are not operating as they should. 
   I want to commend Chairman Peterson for being so open and available as he worked with myself and my colleagues, Congressmen Stupak, Larson and Van Hollen throughout the summer to make this bill a priority and to bring transparency back to our futures market. 
   This is a complex issue. Our responsibility as a Congress and the Nation is serious, however. Excessive speculation occurs when the market price for a given commodity no longer accurately reflects the forces of supply and demand. Today we can point to loopholes and exemptions that have allowed interested parties with special access to information to improperly speculate on the price of energy without oversight. That excessive speculation has contributed to rising gas prices. 
   This bill begins to confront that speculation, providing the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission new authority to gather information from currently unregulated over-the-counter energy transactions. And if it finds improper speculation is driving up the prices, the agency has the authority then to act to reduce the speculation. This is new, it's long overdue authority that will shed light on once hidden markets. 
   The bill also makes sure we know who is participating in the market to what extent by requiring detailed trading information from index traders and swap dealers. It works to make sure hedge exemptions are not exploited, making clear only legitimate hedgers may use them. 
   This vote follows the report last week from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission which suggested the need for a legislative fix to restore balance to the energy marketplace, recommending a significant increase in the transparency of energy markets, more careful analysis of data, and even a reclassification of swap dealers. 
   A day earlier, hedge fund managers Michael Masters and Adam White released their own report pointing to institutional investors pouring money into energy futures and contributing to rising prices. Later, by pulling those funds out of the market, the rush for the exits helped bring the prices down. And this decline may continue, according to yesterday's Wall Street Journal which reported, and I quote, ``Evaporating access to credit, fears of an economic washout are taking a toll on oil prices, forcing speculators using borrowed money out of the market.'' 
   Whether prices are up or down, the bottom line that growing volatility, a growing disconnect between where the market is and where supply and demand would normally put it. 
   We have a responsibility to protect consumers from excessive speculation. We can no longer allow random speculators free rein to play these games while our entire economy hangs in the balance. It is time to empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to do its regulatory job and provide the kind of relief that we need to get Americans who are in great need in this faltering economy, we need to provide relief to middle class Americans and American taxpayers, and not provide relief or profit for those who are already taking the profits and making a fortune with them. 
   Let's pass this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, while today's Consolidated Appropriations bill falls far short, the Democratic Congress has made sure it is far better than the President's budget request for fiscal year 2008. We have made very real changes to the administration's original budget proposal, and made real responsible investment in new domestic priorities that are long overdue. 
   Despite absurd limitations imposed by the administration and from Republican obstructionists in Congress, we have fought to meet our obligations as a Nation and a congress. Getting our work done when we are supposed to, and getting the big things right. Yet, while we worked to find common ground, the administration played political games. 
   Still, as chair of the FDA Agriculture Subcommittee I am proud of the bill we put together under tremendous constraints: 
   Reinvesting in rural America--restoring $44 million for rural business enterprise and opportunity grants, $119 million over the President's request for critical water and waste programs to ensure rural areas have access to clean water, and $20.3 million for community facility grants to help rural areas build day care centers and police and fire stations. 
   Protecting public health, increasing FDA funding by $145 million over 2007; $56 million for FDA food safety activities, with $28 million withheld until July 1 pending the submission of a comprehensive food safety plan by the FDA. A $21 million increase for drug safety and $6 million more for the FDA's Office of Generic Drugs. 
   It has $633 million above the President's request for the WIC nutrition program; and $472 million above for bio-energy and renewable energy R&D, including loans and grants in rural areas.  
   Mr. Speaker, this is about meeting our commitment to the American people. And, although at a much lower level, this bill finally funds our domestic priorities: from rural development to local law enforcement, Pell grants to No Child Left Behind. A new direction with new priorities for our Nation--the American people demand nothing less.

   What is it about? It's about stopping the excessive energy commodity speculation that has driven up the price of gasoline by as much as 30 percent, according to independent economists. 
   Last October, the Government Accountability Office issued a report indicating that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission did not have the resources and the authority that it needed to protect the American people. When the report was issued, a gallon of gas cost on average $2.90. Today in my State of Connecticut, gas costs $4.37 a gallon. Commodity prices have skyrocketed in the past 5 years, but those unprecedented price spikes cannot be explained entirely by increased demand from China and India or the dollar's valuation. 
   So what is the cause? Independent economists point to one significant culprit: unregulated speculation in our futures markets. A May 2008 International Monetary Fund report agrees. Professional investors have purchased contracts for more than a billion barrels of petroleum essentially adding eight times as much demand for oil as the U.S. has added to its Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the last 5 years. The CFTC should be the cop on the beat protecting American consumers by putting a halt to out-of-control speculation. Unfortunately, the CFTC may be partly to blame for allowing loopholes and opening up exemptions. 
   The resolution before us today is simple. It directs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to use its emergency powers granted by Congress under section 4a of the Commodity Exchange Act to investigate excessive speculation in any contract market within the CFTC's jurisdiction and take the necessary action to eliminate excessive speculation that is artificially inflating gas prices. 
   What the CFTC needs to do is to use its powers to close the Enron loophole, to end the London-Dubai foreign border trade loophole. I urge my colleagues to support this effort. What it essentially does is restore sanity to the markets, and it provides consumers with the relief that they need in order to be able to continue to lead their lives and not be forced to make choices of whether to not buy gasoline for their cars and put food on the table or other things to take care of their families.

   The Small Business Innovative Research program increases small businesses' participation in federally funded research and development. It is a proven program. It is an effective program. 
   Since 1983, more than 94,000 projects have received more than $20 billion in awards, keeping our Nation competitive in the global marketplace and helping our small businesses thrive. But in order for this program to have its full impact, there must be that level playing field, and those who try and cheat the system must not be allowed to reap the benefits. 
   This amendment simply says that to receive a Small Business Innovation Research award, a small business must be domiciled in the United States. You must play by the rules. Today, even contractors supporting our own military in Iraq continue to filter Federal dollars through offshore shell companies to avoid paying taxes here. Every year, offshore tax shelters cost taxpayers nearly $100 billion. No one, contractors, small businesses or otherwise, no one who looks for special privileges under our tax system should be able to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Federal Government.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of every working woman who faces pay discrimination in the workplace. Last year the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to drastically limit women's access to seek justice for pay discrimination based on gender, requiring workers to file a pay discriminate claim within a 6-month period only, regardless of how long the pay inequity goes on. 
   The House has passed legislation to right this wrong, and the other body will follow this week. While a weakening economy weighs heavily on women and families across America, and when women are still only earning 77 percent of what men earn, this is not the time to curtail women's access to fair pay. 
   That is why this Congress must pass into law the Paycheck Fairness Act. With the support of more than 227 cosponsors, my bill would help women confront discrimination in the workplace, give teeth to the Equal Pay Act by prohibiting employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information with their coworkers, allow women to sue for punitive damages and the recovery of back pay and create a new grant program to help strength the negotiation skills of girls and women.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FY08 Labor/HHS & Education Appropriations bill. I want to commend the Chairman and the staff for an excellent bill which signals a new direction and reflects our priorities as a Nation. 
   The goal of this bill has always been to make a strong investment in our future--to take seriously our responsibility to the American public, on the issues that affect people every day from our health to our children's education to the scientific research that will find the cures of tomorrow, from protecting workers to providing the training they need to make it in today's economy. I must say that this time around, our bill does not disappoint. 
   To help States serve 6.8 million unemployed and 13 million jobseekers, the bill provides a $227.4 million or 1.9 percent increase over fiscal year 2007 for employment, training, and worker protection programs. On worker protection, the bill provides a $45.5 million increase to key programs to improving safety and health for 113 million workers. 
   On education, the bill provides historic increases in No Child Left Behind, 8.4 percent above 2007, including $1.9 billion more for Title I grants to schools. For students with disabilities, the President's budget proposed to cut IDEA Part B grants by $291 million or 2.7 percent below the fiscal year 2007 level. In contrast, this bill provides a $299 million or a 2.8 percent increase over last year. More importantly, this bill reverses a 2-year decline in the federal contribution toward the rising costs of special education for 6.9 million children with disabilities. 
   It also makes real progress toward college affordability with a significant increase in Pell Grants, allowing us to raise the maximum Pell Grant by $390 to $4,700 and benefiting over 5.5 million students without reducing or eliminating other student financial assistance programs. 
   In the area of medical research, the bill provides continued investment at the NIH and CDC for innovative programs that save lives. With a $750 million increase over last year, NIH will be able to support another 545 new and competing research grants over last year's level and 1,262 over the President's request. 
   The bill also provides much-needed investments in programs that support low income people: An increase of $500.8 million or 23.2 percent above last year for LIHEAP to secure energy assistance for approximately 1 million more low-income seniors and families than last year. $660.4 million for the Community Services Block Grant allowing states to expand critical services, such as housing, home weatherization, parenting education, adult literacy classes, and emergency food assistance. And a down payment of $75 million or 3.6 percent in child care assistance, the first increase in discretionary spending for this program in more than five years. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill reflects a real commitment to our longstanding responsibilities and true fiscal responsibility. Each of us should support the FY08 Labor/HHS & Education bill--a bill each of us can take home and proudly share with our constituents. 
   We will accomplish a lot of good with this bill, but I especially want to highlight and commend Chairman OBEY, for the ``Reducing the Need for Abortion Initiative'' included in the bill, which parallels legislation spearheaded by Representative RYAN and myself. 
   With close to $650 million in increased funding over last year and approximately $1.4 billion for programs such as Title X, Healthy Start, teen pregnancy prevention, adoption awareness, after school programs, and child care programs for new parents attending college, just to name a few, we are promoting policies so critical to reducing the need for abortion in this country. 
   This bold initiative represents a considerable investment in preventing unintended pregnancies and supporting new parents. It is strong on prevention, strong on family income supports, and it makes clear that we are serious about addressing the issue of abortion head on. That, for all of us, it is a matter of conscience. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, I am proud to be a Member of this subcommittee, its Members, and the work we have done this year. With this bill, we make opportunity real for millions of Americans and we give people the tools they need to grow and thrive tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, we all know our economy is rapidly deteriorating and we have a responsibility to act. Today we passed an economic stabilization bill that we worked to benefit everyone, allowing individuals and businesses across the country critical access to the credit that they need. The package also included tax provisions to bring further relief to the middle class, protecting hardworking Americans from the encroaching alternative minimum tax, expand the child tax credit, and create jobs through renewable energy and research and development tax credits. Yet we must do more to help those in need. 
   So far this year, 760,000 jobs have disappeared. The Labor Department reported today that the economy shed 159,000 jobs in September, the ninth straight month of job losses and the most in more than 5 years. The unemployment rate is now at 6.1 percent, the highest level in 5 years. This August, Connecticut unemployment reached 6.5 percent, the highest since 1993, and wages remained stagnant. 
   The legislation we consider today will provide 7 additional weeks of extended benefits for workers in every State, extend eligibility to 20 weeks, and provides another 13 weeks for workers in States with the unemployment rate of 6 percent or higher. With 800,000 workers currently set to exhaust their extended benefits in October, this could not be more urgent. 
   In the long run, we need to provide real stimulus to help the middle class, create jobs by investing in infrastructure and renewable energy and provide the middle class with much-needed tax relief. Extending unemployment insurance is one of the best options to stimulate the economy. It is good economics, and it is basic human decency.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT THE AIR FORCE TANKER CONTRACT AWARD -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, this week the GAO will rule on the Boeing protest of the Air Force acquisition process for the $35 billion award to replace the KC-135 air refueling tankers that went to Northrop and a European consortium team in February. 
   The Department of Labor's employment report for May showed a loss of 49,000 jobs and an unemployment rate that increased to 5.5 percent--the biggest monthly rise since 1986. Yet this contract will not only continue but accelerate the erosion of our industrial base and skilled workforce. According to an Economic Policy Institute analysis released earlier this month, this decision will ground at least 14,000 U.S. jobs. Roughly half the parts and labor that go into making Airbus tankers will come from overseas. 
   Producing the Airbus KC-45 tanker would support about 14,350 U.S. jobs per year, while Boeing's proposed tanker would support at least twice as many jobs--including those for high-skilled workers manufacturing engines in Middletown, Connecticut. Our economy has lost nearly 325,000 jobs since the beginning of the year. We should not be sending more jobs overseas, outsourcing our technological base. We should be creating jobs at home, supporting local innovation, and investing in our economy.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. It really is disingenuous when I listen to my colleague from California talk about ammo, armor and equipment from the folks who brought our young men and women into a battle without appropriate ammo, without armor, and without the appropriate equipment that they needed to be able to fight this war from the outset. In fact, it has been the Democratic majority over and over and over again who have increased that funding for our troops in the field. 
   Let me also say to our distinguished minority leader, and you should not be fooled by the commentary, this issue is about the Labor, Health, Education and Human Services bill. And the folks who are playing games are the minority and the Republicans on that side of the aisle. 
   This is bill where we know that we will increase funding for veterans health care, offer pay raises for active duty soldiers, provide additional support for military families. Let me just tell you what this President wants to veto: the investment in lifesaving medical research, the investment in increased education funding, and he would like to veto our being able to strengthen job training in this Nation. 
   Two or three examples, my friends. The President's budget cuts funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health. He would cut that by $480 million. That is 800 fewer research grants than last year to study deadly diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, leukemia, Parkinson's, heart disease. We rejected that on our side of the aisle. We invest $1 billion above the President's request or roughly the cost of three days in Iraq. That's what the President wants to veto. 
   Let's take a look at the Centers for Disease Control. When the chairwoman testified before the committee, she said we face as a nation the issue of the daily health challenges: 4 million seniors living with Alzheimer's, 583 women diagnosed with breast cancer every single day, and 176,000 teens who will  struggle their entire lives with diabetes. And so if we fail to pass the Labor-HHS appropriation conference report, we cut that CDC budget by $475 million. The President wants to veto that $475 million for those efforts. 
   Let's take a look at what he said last month, that is the President: ``Don't go backwards when it comes to educational excellence. We have come too far to turn back.'' Yet he will recall millions in Perkins loans funds and cut the special education program by $291 million. Going backwards is exactly what he is proposing to do. 
   We invest $5.9 billion in education, the cost of just 18 days in Iraq. What will we do with it? We will benefit 8.5 million students to prepare our Nation for the 21st century economy. 
   Let's talk about the President last week. An additional $42 billion from Congress for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that will in the next decade cost $2.4 trillion, or $8,000 per man, woman and child. Let's fight for people, not dollars, and the people of this Nation understand that.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Our first goal as Members of Congress is to rescue the economy, get it moving again, and make sure the middle class and small businesses get on their feet. 
   I hate that near criminal mismanagement of our economy and near criminal contempt for our values has forced us to act today. Today's financial crisis could lead to an economic meltdown unseen since the Great Depression, and I have a responsibility to avert it in the interest of the country, though I know it will be unpopular. 
   For too long, the policies of this administration and the previous majority in Congress put middle class families at risk. I am under no illusions about how we got here. And I act today not to help the banks, but to help hardworking, struggling middle class Americans, small business people. 
   If we do not act, unemployment will rise, small businesses will not meet payroll, and a credit freeze closes the door on families who need loans to pay for schools, cars and housing. 
   The administration offered a plan; it was unacceptable. This legislation, while imperfect, offers a different approach. It should be coupled with investing in job-creating infrastructure, new green jobs, and measures that give consumers more income.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to present to the House for fiscal year 2008 the appropriations bill For Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies. I want to say ``thank you'' to Chairman David Obey for his dedication and leadership. It has been a very busy 7 months, and we have been fortunate to have Chairman Obey at the helm. A special ``thank you'' to my colleague, Congressman Kingston. It has been a pleasure to partner with him on this subcommittee, and I believe that we have accomplished a lot together. We are working to accomplish quite a lot today, with quite a wide-ranging portfolio. 
   This appropriation covers many subjects. Our top priority has always been to move with a clear purpose and direction towards several key goals: strengthening rural America, protecting public health, improving nutrition for more Americans, transforming our energy future, supporting conservation, investing in research, and, finally, enhancing oversight. 
   It begins with our fiscal year 2008 mark providing total discretionary resources of $18.8 billion, $1 billion, or 5.7 percent, above 2007, and $987.4 million, or 5.5 percent, above the budget request. A full 95 percent of the increase above the budget request, or $940 million, is used to restore funding that was either eliminated or cut in the President's budget. 
   Our first goal is strengthening rural America. Community development is a key link to rebuilding rural America, preserving infrastructure, building new opportunities, and confronting a tremendous gap when it comes to educational and medical resources. To help close that gap, the bill provides $52.8 million. That would double the broadband grant program which the President's budget request had eliminated. It provides $10 million more than the President requested for distance learning and telemedicine grants and includes $728.8 million to support community facilities, water and waste disposal systems, and business grants; $31.2 million for community facilities; $56.8 million for business and industry; and $70.3 million for waste and waste disposal programs. 
   Clean water. Rural communities face tens of billions of dollars in costs for safe drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. To begin addressing these needs, the bill provides $500 million for rural water and waste disposal grants and $1 billion for water and waste direct loans. 
   In housing, the community held a special hearing to discuss economic conditions in rural America with the USDA's Economic Research Service. A recent ERS report found that 302 of America's non-metro counties are ``housing stressed.'' That is why we are making significant investments in rural housing, including $212.2 million to fund $5.1 billion in affordable loans to providing housing to low-income and moderate-income families in rural areas, providing approximately 38,000 single family home ownership opportunities. 
   The President's budget eliminated direct loans and shifted funding to guaranteed loans with a 1 percent increase  in fees, making these loans more expensive and less accessible for low-income families. 
   Protecting public health was another of our priorities. The bill provides $1.7 billion for the Food and Drug Administration. That is $128.5 million over 2007 and $62 million over the budget request; in addition, $7 million in the manager's amendment in order for us to be able to inspect produce coming in from foreign countries. 
   This is what the committee hopes will be the first step in the fundamental transformation and the regulation of food safety at FDA.     
   The committee directs the FDA to submit a plan to begin changing its approach to food safety when it submits the fiscal year 2009 budget, giving the committee time to review the plan before the funds to implement it become available on July 1, 2008. 
   We can help with additional resources at FDA, but there also needs to be a corresponding commitment from management to perform its duties. 
   When our pets began to die from contaminated pet food that originated in China, the news forced us to take a hard look at entire food safety systems abroad. Our renewed attention revealed inadequate protection and an increasingly global food supply system. The budget includes an additional $7 million, as I said, for FDA inspection of FDA imports. In addition, we address vacancies in Federal meat inspector positions. The bill fully funds the requested amount for the food safety and inspection service at $930 million. 
   The bill also includes key language preventing the FDA from granting waivers of conflict of interest rules to voting members of the FDA advisory committee, and preventing USDA from establishing or implementing a rule allowing poultry products from China into the United States. The Chinese and others must be aware that trade cannot trump public health and that their regulations need to be strengthened to be considered an adequate trading partner. 
   Another of our top priorities is improving nutrition. For many long years we have failed to meet our obligations, failed to act, while too many Americans have gone without adequate healthy food. One in eight families with a toddler, an infant, in the United States is ``food insecure''; that means that they are hungry. One in eight families with an infant. 
   Forty percent of children in rural America are dependent upon food stamps. The progress we made on this issue with the farm bill last week represents real change, and this bill includes $39.8 billion for the Food Stamp program to meet increased participation and ensuring rising food prices do not diminish families' purchasing power. 
   The bill also provides record funding for two fundamental food security programs which serve our country's most vulnerable population, the supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants and Children, WIC, and the Commodities Supplemental Food Program, CSFP. These efforts go hand in hand with ongoing initiatives, including $957.7 million for nutrition programs to confront our Nation's obesity crisis, instilling better eating habits in our children, giving them the tools and the choices to avoid diabetes and other dangerous health conditions. That includes $68.5 million for the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program, $26 million to expand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable and Simplified Summer Food Programs to all States, and $10 million for specialty crops. What are specialty crops? They are related to healthy diets in this Nation; fruits and vegetables that are farmed in my part of the country, in the mid-Atlantic States, in California, crops that are so crucial nationwide from New England to the west coast. 
   Our work continues with other chief goals. Energy independence. This bill makes investments across the spectrum to grow our economy, create new jobs, lower energy prices and address global warming. It promotes renewable energy and moves us down the path to energy independence, strengthening bioenergy and renewable energy research funded at $1.2 billion, including loans and grants in rural areas. The conservation and stewardship of our lands will affect our children for years to come. 
   This bill restores many of the programs slated for elimination in the President's request, including the Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative, the Wildlife Habitat Program, and watershed rehabilitation, and provides $979.4 million to continue assistance to landowners for conservation efforts on private lands. 
   We also have an obligation to maintain agriculture's critical place at the forefront of groundbreaking research, maintaining our edge in crop development, competitiveness, trade, nutrition, food safety and even homeland security. 
   The bill increases funds for research and education through USDA's Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service and the Agricultural Research Service. 
   Finally, enhanced oversight. The committee is concerned about waste, fraud and abuse in key programs and has included language requested by the administration to allow the Risk Management Agency to use up $11.2 million in mandatory crop insurance funds to strengthen its ability to oversee the program by maintaining and upgrading IT systems and other methods of detecting dubious claims. 
   In closing, I think we should be excited about this bill, the goals that we set out to accomplish: strengthening rural America, protecting our public health, improving nutrition for more Americans, transforming our energy future, supporting conservation, investing in research, and finally, enhancing oversight. 
   Most importantly, I believe it brings us back to our Nation's most fundamental principles; the strength of our communities. We have an obligation to get these things right. Let us assume that responsibility today, Mr. Chairman, and I'm pleased to submit this bill and I urge favorable consideration. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I also want to say thank you to the many staffers who have worked hour after hour on this bill to make today possible. As a former staff member, I know that these efforts don't come together by some alchemy, but it is because of the incredible hard work that people put into it over many, many hours.

   Ms. DeLAURO. I think my colleague from Georgia maybe doesn't understand what bill is on the floor today. This is the Agriculture appropriations bill. There will be an opportunity to discuss SCHIP, and you can continue to do that, but let me just comment about your Agriculture appropriations amendment. 
   The House bill includes funding for central administration offices to fund current staff. The only increase is for pay costs. And I might just tell you that for all of the staff offices in central administration, that the work that was done by the committee literally cut these offices by about 16 percent. So it was just pay and benefits. 
   However, you should know I feel the obligation to mention these things to you, that any cuts in these offices will result in the reduction of headquarters staff, not the field staff, because that's the personnel that deals directly on a one-to-one basis with our farmers and with our ranchers so that they can access the system and be able to do what they need to do. 
   Now, I'm going to give the gentleman an opportunity to withdraw his amendment, because I am prepared to accept your amendment, and I'm happy to accept your amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his concern and his compassion and his indefatigable work on the issue of making sure that those in our Nation who are hungry are able to get the food that they need in order to be able to sustain themselves. 
   I also want to say a thank-you to my colleague from California for his kind words and working with him on the farm bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I look forward to debating this bill and discussing our priorities. We are going to cover a lot of ground today with a wide ranging portfolio to accomplish quite a lot. 
   This appropriation covers many subjects. But what runs through every element of this bill is the common thread of our Nation assuming responsibility again for the things we are supposed to get right: keeping our country safe and healthy, preserving and strengthening our rural traditional communities, and thinking about problems that we have on the horizon, like energy, and not just thinking about today's problems. 
   I want to say thank you to Chairman Obey for his leadership and to our ranking member, Congressman Kingston, a partner in this effort. I believe together we have crafted a strong and bipartisan, responsible bill. 
   Our top priority has always been to move with a clear purpose in a direction towards several key goals: strengthening rural America; protecting public health; improving nutrition for more Americans; transforming our energy future; supporting conservation; investing in research; and finally, enhancing oversight. 
   Our bill provides total discretionary resources of $18.8 billion, $1 billion or 5.7 percent above 2007 and $987.4 million or 5.5 percent above the budget request. To be sure, a full 95 percent of the increase above the budget request, or $940 million, is used to restore funding that was either eliminated or cut in the President's budget, to acknowledge and to meet our obligation to hundreds of communities and millions of Americans. 
   When it comes to strengthening rural America, our first goal, our efforts have been critical to try to facilitate growth and to soften the impact of population loss in rural America. This bill provides $23.1 million in grants to rural areas for critical community facilities such as health care, education, public safety, day-care facilities. It also provides increases in the community facility loan programs. It provides $10 million more than the President requested for distance learning telemedicine grants, and it includes $728.8 million to support community facilities, water and waste disposal systems, and business grants. 
   We also make significant investments in rural housing: $212.2 million to fund $5.1 billion in affordable loans to provide housing to low-income and moderate-income families in rural areas, providing approximately 38,000 single-family homeownership opportunities. 
   On our second priority, protecting public health, the subcommittee stepped up from spinach and seafood to peanut butter and pet food. This has shown that our food safety system is dangerously inadequate and that we must transform the way we meet our obligation to protect the public health. So the bill provides $1.7 billion for the Food and Drug Administration, $128.5 million over 2007, $62 million over the budget request, and the first step in a fundamental transformation in the regulation of food safety at the FDA.     
   The bill directs the FDA to submit a plan to begin changing its approach to food safety when it submits the fiscal year 2009 budget, giving the committee time to review the plan before the funds to implement it become available on July 1, 2008. 
   We can help with additional resources, but there's also a need to have a corresponding commitment from management to perform its duties. 
   Funds are provided specifically to begin a critical transformation in food safety regulation, enhanced drug safety functions, review direct-to-consumer ads and review generic drugs. 
   Our next goal was improving nutrition, and I am proud of the progress we made on this issue. With the farm bill last week, this bill includes $39.8 billion for the Food Stamp program to meet increased participation and ensure rising food prices do not diminish families' purchasing power. 
   The bill also provides record funding for two fundamental food security programs which our country's most vulnerable population: the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, the WIC program, and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. These efforts go hand-in-hand with ongoing initiatives. 
   $957.7 million for nutrition programs to confront our Nation's obesity, instilling better eating habits in our children, giving them the tools and choices to avoid diabetes and other dangerous health conditions. 
   It includes record funding of $68.5 million for the expanded Food and Nutrition Education program; $26 million to expand the fresh fruit and vegetables and the Simplified Summer Food Program to all States; and $10 million for specialty crops, yes, for fruits and vegetables. 
   And when it comes to other key objectives, transforming our energy future, supporting conservation and investing in research, we step up with this bill. This legislation strengthens bioenergy and renewable energy research $1.2 billion, including loans and grants in rural areas. It restores many of the conservation programs slated for elimination in the President's request, including grazing lands, conservation initiatives, the Wildlife Habitat Program, watershed rehabilitation; and provides $979.4 million to continue assistance to landowners for conservation efforts on private land. 
   And yes, with regard to research, $178 million for cooperative State research education and extension service, and $108.9 million of that is for research and education. Overall, we have increased research. 
   Finally, the bill is dedicated to enhanced oversight. We share the concern about fraud, waste and abuse, and we have key language in here which would allow the risk management agencies to use up to $11.2 million in mandatory crop insurance funds to strengthen its ability to oversee the program by  maintaining and upgrading IT systems and other methods of detecting dubious claims. 
   I'm proud of the bill, its priorities and the goals that we set out to accomplish. I will continue to discuss some of the obligations of this bill later today, and the Congress has chosen to highlight and return to after many long years of inaction and silence. I'll continue to discuss and recognize the values and the priorities that my colleagues and I have sought to uphold, to strengthen and to honor with this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule.

   Ms. DeLAURO. I just want to let the gentleman from Kansas understand about feeding programs in the United States, and I will get a copy for you, send it over to you, something called the Carsey report that just came about a week, a week and a half ago, which talks about 40 percent, 40 percent of children in rural America are dependent on food stamps. 
   This bill has gone a great distance to address the issues of rural America, including the farm issues of trying to link what is produced on the land with those who are in need of food, trying to deal with an opportunity to create a more stable economy in rural America when the President's budget, in fact, has left rural America pretty much decimated; $940 million of this bill and this increase has been placed to restore the programs mainly in rural America that the administration had either cut back or eliminated.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. It illustrates our commitment to restoring middle class prosperity, a clear and practical approach to strengthen our economy, achieve energy independence and give families the opportunity to reach for the American dream. 
   By expanding the child tax credit, lowering its floor to $8,500, we can finally make a direct and a critical impact for all families with children: $3 billion benefiting 13 million children. That is 2.9 million children newly eligible and more than 10 million who would see their credit increased. 
   I believe with the child tax credit we make opportunity real for American families. Today, amidst our current financial crisis and an economy that continues to shed jobs and produces less income, these 13 million children come from families with parents who work hard every single day and struggle every day just to get by. 
   We have a responsibility to make our economy work, a responsibility to help ordinary Americans face today's economic challenges. Expanding the child tax credit is a great way to do it. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, as we try to prevent our financial markets from breaking down, we can never forget the middle class families across  this Nation who bear the brunt and continue struggling every day just to get by. 
   I believe our government has a responsibility to help get our economy back on track and make opportunity real in our communities and for our families. But with soaring energy prices, rising foreclosures and a Republican economy that continues to shed more jobs and produce less income, middle class families are at great risk. 
   There were more than 490,000 new filings for State jobless benefits last week, the highest number of weekly claims since shortly after 9/11. In Connecticut, unemployment climbed to 6.9 percent in August, topping the national average. That is why I support this economic recovery package, targeted investment to jump-start this economy and create quality jobs. 
   This bill makes a serious commitment to our national infrastructure. According to State transportation departments, there are $18 billion in ready-to-go infrastructure projects across the country. This bill provides $12.8 billion for those projects that can start right away, begin creating quality jobs and rebuild our Nation's aging highways, roads and bridges; $6.5 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and $1 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund to repair, rehabilitate and expand water systems, many of which are over 50 years old; $3 billion for the States to immediately fund much-needed school maintenance, and still more innovative green infrastructure, Amtrak maintenance and public housing construction projects. 
   This is about making a direct and an immediate impact, creating jobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced, spurring economic growth and putting our Nation on a better path, not just for today but for the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this economic recovery package.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it has been 10 years since this Congress last approved an increase in the minimum wage. In that time, increasing numbers of families have fallen out of the middle class, victims of economic pressures from rising health care and college tuition costs to gas prices, and an economic policy from an administration that has always seemed to push working families aside. 
   Raising the Federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour is so important so the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. But that barely masks the troubles that families face. Household incomes are down nearly $1,300 from 2000, employee compensation at its lowest level in 40 years. This economy is not producing rising living standards for most families. Today we can expect to have the first sustained period of economic growth since World War II that fails to offer a comparable increase in wages for workers. 
   Raising the minimum wage is not about handouts or making political statements but rather raising the earnings floor for workers in this country. Indeed, today a full-time minimum wage worker still earns only $10,700 a year. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we make almost $163,000 a year, and we are opposed to $2 in a raise for working families? My friends, walk in the shoes of people who work every single day for a living. This Congress in the last session barely worked 2 days a week here for $163,000 a year. Take heed. Raising the minimum wage has big consequences. 
   You know, 4 years after the last minimum wage increase, the American economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades. Between 1997 and 2003, small business employment grew in States that had a higher minimum wage than those with a Federal minimum wage. 
   Mr. Speaker, it comes down to priorities. It is long past time here that this Congress recognize that we have an obligation to work to raise the standard of living in America for every single family, not just for the few at the top of the heap. That is what this legislation is about, and I am proud to support it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, of all the barriers that families have faced these last several years, from the rising cost of health care and energy, to the outsourcing of good-paying American jobs, few have had as chilling an impact on opportunity as the skyrocketing cost of college tuition. The last 5 years, tuition at public universities shot up more than 40 percent. 
   These kinds of financial barriers prevent about 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year public college over the next decade, 2 million high school graduates finding themselves unable to attend any college at all. This, when the United States has talked about a proposed projected shortage of up to 12 million college-educated workers by 2020. 
   There are so many challenges before us, breathtaking challenges that impact every American. This Congress has to recognize how closely tied access to a quality education is to our economic prosperity, our national security, our civic health. Strengthening those bonds, reaffirming our commitment to our Nation's family, that is what this legislation is about. Cutting the interest rate for undergraduate students with a subsidized student loan in half over the next 5 years, we can help 5.5 million students fulfill their dream. 
   In Connecticut, more than 33,000 students currently take out 4-year loans. They have an average debt of $14,200. We are going to help these youngsters save more than $2,300 over the life of the loan. 
   I happen to represent an area with many first-rate universities. The time has come to make these universities and the lifetime of opportunity they unleash accessible to every American, to every parent who wants to send their child to college. 
   Lowering college costs is about expanding opportunity. It is what government should be all about. It is the reason why the people in our communities send us here, to try to help them have the opportunity to have an education for their children at a rate that they can afford, an interest rate that they can afford. 
   Let's help them with the college loans. This legislation deserves our support.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, Sergeant Jonathan Schulze was an Iraq war veteran who committed suicide after being denied care to address his PTSD symptoms. According to the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, today, among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the number of suicides may exceed the number who have been killed in combat. This is a broken promise, Mr. Chairman. After asking our soldiers to sacrifice so much, we must ensure they get the care they deserve. 
   I was proud to work with Chairman Skelton on the DeLauro-Courtney amendment to direct the Secretary of Defense to conduct a demonstration project to assess the feasibility and the efficacy of providing face-to-face postdeployment mental health screening between members of the Armed Forces and a mental health provider.     
   The 2-year project will include a combat stress evaluation conducted by a qualified mental health professional 120 to 180 days of the date the soldier returns. And a case manager will follow up by phone over the course of another 2 years. 
   We have no excuse for failing the soldiers who have given this Nation everything.

   Ms. DeLAURO. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise to support this amendment because no one should receive special privileges under our tax system. 
   I want to recognize Representative Ellsworth and Congressman Emanuel for the hard work on this important issue. 
   It is unacceptable for the Department of Defense to pay for this war by doing business with companies that siphon money from their own workers and from their own government. What does it say about our Nation and our priorities when American companies like Kellogg, Brown & Root, by far the largest contractor in Iraq, are allowed to take their Department of Defense dollars, filter them through an offshore shell company, all to avoid paying significant Social Security and Medicare taxes? 
   Madam Chairman, we are depleting the Social Security and Medicare trust funds by hundreds of millions of dollars, and this amendment says that must end--prohibiting Defense Department contractors from using foreign shell companies to employ American workers. When tax dodgers avoid their responsibilities, the American taxpayers suffers. We cannot afford this. Support this amendment.

   Ms. DeLAURO. This is domestic propaganda. It is a military-industrial-media complex in which military analysts, many who have ties with the contractors making money off of the war and parroting DOD talking points on the air to mislead the American public, and the TV networks did nothing to prevent it. 
   I will just tell my colleagues that if you voted for the DOD appropriations bill last year, if you did, you voted to prohibit this. You've done it since 2002. Donald Rumsfeld met with these guys 18 times, told them what to say, and then, my friends, DOD hired a company to track their remarks on the TV networks.  
   I am proud to offer this amendment with my colleagues. This has been a secret propaganda program within the Department of Defense to use military analysts to generate positive news coverage of the war in Iraq, conditions on Guantanamo, and other activities as part of the war on terror. 
   New York Times: 75 retired military analysts briefed often by high-level officials in a ``powerfully seductive environment'' only to be found later again parroting the administration's talking points on major television news programs, over the radio and through newspapers. 
   Also, the Times reported internal DOD documents described the analysts as ``message force multipliers'' who could be counted on to deliver the administration's themes and messages to millions of Americans in the form of their own opinions. 
   You know, when you put analysts on the air without fully disclosing their business interests or their relationship with high-level officials, you have betrayed the public trust. This should not have happened. Unfortunately, our leaders at the Department of Defense didn't understand it. Support this amendment.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, as we speak, the administration is negotiating a strategic framework agreement with Iraq that goes well beyond the typical Status of Forces Agreement. Contrary to what my colleague, Mr. Hunter says, from California, essentially it does amount to a treaty. Read the words of the Declaration of Principles. It will need to be ratified by the Iraqi Parliament and therefore it must be ratified by the United States Congress as well. This is the issue that goes to the heart of our constitutional duties as a Congress and the power to declare war, with which we have been entrusted as representatives. 
   After voting against this war, I have supported the goal of responsibly redeploying our troops for over 2 years, and after President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki signed the Declaration of Principles last year. It is a document that outlines unprecedented security commitments and assurances to Iraq from the United States. If in fact it is just a Status of Forces Agreement as usual, then the administration should repudiate this Declaration of Principles and start with a genuine Status of Forces Agreement. 
   I introduced the Iraq Strategic Agreement Act. I compliment my colleague, Ms. Lee, and support her amendment.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to change the mission of the United States Armed Forces in Iraq and undertake their redeployment. It is time to set a real plan to end this war, fought courageously by our troops on the ground, but recklessly mismanaged by our administration at home. 
   2007 has been the deadliest year for American troops since the start of the war in Iraq; 860 U.S. casualties since January. And almost 1 year after the President announced a so-called surge, the Iraqi Government has made no progress toward political reconciliation and is nowhere near taking responsibility for security in all of its provinces. 
   Without any progress or end in sight, the cost of the war continues to rise. The recent Joint Economic Committee report estimates the cost of the war at $1.3 trillion from 2002 to 2008; yet just this week the President vetoed critical funds for education, job training and health care, and, yes, he vetoed the children's health care bill. 
   With its latest $200 billion request for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration has asked for a total of $800 billion, all paid for with the government's credit card. 
   Mr. Speaker, with this bill we put forth a plan and a clear path toward change. We require the start of the redeployment of U.S. forces within 30 days of enactment, with a goal for completion of redeployment by December 15, 2008. 
   It prohibits the deployment of U.S. troops to Iraq who are not fully trained and fully equipped, and changes the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq to diplomatic and force protection, targeted counterterrorism operations, and limited support to Iraqi security forces. And notably, the bill prohibits torture once and for all. 
   We provide $50 billion to meet the immediate needs of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and defer consideration of the remainder of the President's request. 
   The President and his stubborn Republican allies in the Congress have acted recklessly in Iraq and with our Nation's standing in the world. And the American people pay the price. Our young men and women are paying the price. 
   The Bush administration rushed to war and never had an exit strategy. If we, in the Congress, do not provide one, who will?

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2693, POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule to allow the House to consider the Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Prevention Act. This is important legislation. It would require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue a standard to minimize worker exposure to diacetyl, which is an artificial butter flavoring chemical that has been linked to irreversible, deadly lung disease known as ``popcorn lung.'' By passing this rule and bill, we meet our obligation to protect thousands of American workers and ensure the public health. 
   More than 7 years ago, a physician contacted the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services to report eight cases of fixed obstructive lung diseases, bronchiolitis obliterans, also known as ``popcorn lung,'' in workers from a Missouri microwave popcorn plant. Follow-up investigations by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found diacetyl to  have caused the lung disease. Since that time, cases of popcorn lung have been identified in microwave popcorn workers in several States: Missouri, Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey, and Illinois. In all, NIOSH conducted six investigations at 10 microwave popcorn facilities, finding respiratory impairment among workers at a majority of the plants. 
   The science on this chemical's danger is clear. Beyond the NIOSH investigations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for health care providers to report additional suspected cases of respiratory disease in workers exposed to food-flavoring chemicals. 
   That was 5 years ago. This past April, the CDC again recommended that employers implement safety measures to minimize worker exposures to flavoring chemicals such as diacetyl. 
   When I asked Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao, during an appropriations budget hearing why OSHA was dragging its feet on issuing an ``emergency temporary standard,'' she responded, ``This is a difficult evaluation because of the relative lack of specific scientific information concerning the health effects of diacetyl and other butter flavoring chemicals.'' Indeed, we should not be too surprised by the fact that, even after all these years, OSHA has failed to issue a standard to protect workers from exposure to diacetyl, preferring to rely instead on voluntary efforts. 
   The science is there. Scientists have called diacetyl's effect on workers' lungs ``astonishingly grotesque.'' They likened it to ``inhaling acid.'' Workers who are exposed to diacetyl today cannot afford to wait. This legislation would require engineering controls, respiratory protection, exposure monitoring, medical surveillance, and worker training. It would also apply to popcorn manufacturing and packaging as well as to the food flavorings industry. 
   Let me just tell you what the industry has done. ConAgra Foods and Pop Weaver, two major producers of microwave popcorn, have already announced that they will no longer used diacetyl to flavor their microwave popcorn because they understand it. They see the science and know that we have to act.     
   We have a responsibility in this body to both consumers and to workers. Yesterday, however, Kraft Foods announced a new toasted butter flavor which contains diacetyl; in fact, Kraft Company flavorist, Susan Parker, told reporters, ``To some customers diacetyl is not an issue; to others, it is. We're moving forward to formulating solutions to meet customer need.'' But what Kraft fails to realize and fails to mention is that diacetyl is an issue for all workers. This much we know, and that is why we need this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule.

   Ms. DeLAURO. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. 
   After too many long years, this is a historic moment. After too many lost opportunities, this is our chance to make a difference and to take an important step toward meeting our commitment to the women of America. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Chairman Dingell, with whom I introduced the very first version of the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act over a decade ago. It is his partnership and that of our colleagues, Chairmen Pallone, Stark, Andrews, Miller, that helped to make this day and this vote possible. 
   I want to say thank you to the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Barton, for his support, and for the bipartisan support of this effort. 
   More than 12 years ago, I first met Dr. Kristen Zarfos. She walked into my office in Connecticut and told me that HMOs were forcing her to discharge her patients before they were ready, sometimes just hours after mastectomy surgery. Dr. Zarfos' experience inspired me to get involved. Her tireless work with patients in my State of Connecticut and with a network of doctors she knew around the country gathered support for this bill from the grass roots all the way to the Congress. 
   Today, a woman's chance of developing breast cancer in her lifetime is one in eight. Almost everyone knows someone who has suffered from this disease. If you have watched a loved one fighting for her life, you understand how important it is to have not only the loving support of family as I did during my fight against ovarian cancer, but also adequate recovery time in the hospital after surgery so you have the professional care to begin healing and to avoid infection. 
   A mastectomy is not an easy surgery; it is physically and emotionally traumatic. That is what the Breast Cancer Patient Protection bill is all about. It says that when it comes to mastectomies and lumpectomies, adequate recovery time in the hospital should not be negotiable. The last thing any woman should be doing at that time is fighting with her insurance company. 
   This bill does not mandate a 48-hour hospital stay if a patient chooses to go home sooner, nor does it set 48 hours as a maximum amount of time a woman can stay in the hospital. It simply ensures that any decision in favor of a shorter or longer hospital stay will be made by the patient and her doctor, and not an insurance company. It would also ensure women have access to second opinions and adequate hospital stays after having a lumpectomy. 
   Some may argue that the time for a bill like this has already passed, that States are beginning to address the issue, but the truth is that drive-through mastectomies continue to today. 
   At the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing this spring--and I thank, again, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone)--breast cancer patient Alva Williams testified that she had a mastectomy on March 6, 2006 and was sent home several hours after surgery. Her insurance company would not cover an overnight stay. Ms. Williams had family to take care of her at home, but they had no medical training. She developed an infection in her incisions. Recovering from the infection caused Ms. Williams' chemotherapy treatments to be delayed by 6 weeks. 
   All across the Nation women continue to suffer the same way that Alva Williams suffered, physically and emotionally, and yet without the care they should rightfully be getting for the insurance premiums that they have paid. And all across this Nation people everywhere are saying, ``No more.'' 
   Twenty-three million Americans have signed Lifetime Television's petition calling for the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act's passage. Now with 222 cosponsors in the House and Senators Snowe and Landrieu leading 19 cosponsors in the Senate, strong bipartisan support exists for these most basic patient protections. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act. Make this day a powerful turning point. We have a tremendous opportunity today to make it clear to women, to cancer patients, and to their families that we value your health. 
   I again thank my colleagues, and urge the support of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, this week Congress takes up its obligation to finally change course in Iraq. This week as we enter the fifth year of the Iraq war, more than 3,200 American lives have been lost, tens of thousands more are wounded, and sectarian violence threatens to spill over into the entire Middle East with no prospect for a stable, constitutional democracy in Iraq in sight. We must judge this war not for what we wish it were, but for what it has so clearly and tragically become, a mistake of historic proportions. 
   I believe America should be sending a clear signal by beginning to reduce our troop levels now so the Iraqi Government takes responsibility and diplomacy can begin for real. I support phased redeployment over the next year and will seek every opportunity to mandate such change in law. Let us serve our men and women fighting overseas and recognize their sacrifices by charting a new course in Iraq. 
   By voting for this supplemental appropriations bill, we vote for accountability in Iraq. We vote to force a change in policy and in law, requiring a phased, responsible redeployment of our troops over 12 to 18 months. There are too many lives at stake here, and, personally, I have crossed the Rubicon on this war. 
   Regardless of whether this bill is blocked by a filibuster from Senate Republicans or a threatened veto from President Bush, we must support this bill today. Passing this bill in the House will be the first formal act, the first step toward requiring a new course in Iraq. We all know our troops will do anything their country asks. But let us make sure their courage and their sacrifices advance a mission that enhances our security and our interests. 
   We need to begin reducing our troops and pursuing a new strategy in order to achieve a stable Iraq, a peaceful Middle East, and a more secure America. 
   That is our obligation. Let us honor it by voting in favor of this supplemental bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this budget, which represents a down payment on our commitment to restore middle class prosperity. It offers a clear and practical approach to strengthen our economy in a way that helps our workforce thrive. It allows families to reach for that American Dream. 
   Today, the Bush economy continues to weigh heavily on America's families and businesses. Our Republican colleagues call for fiscal responsibility. That call is a sham. George Bush has added more to the Federal debt than every single President from George Washington to Ronald Reagan. And at the same time, median household income has dropped $1,000. In the Clinton years, median income rose to $6,100. Poor economic growth has left nearly 1.6 million more workers unemployed, and long-term unemployment is up by 62 percent. There are over 3.3 million fewer manufacturing jobs today than at the start of this administration. Incomes are flat while everything else goes up, gas prices, food prices, the cost of health care and education. 
   This is a budget that is strong. It gets us back to basics. It maintains fiscal discipline while making strong economic growth possible, benefiting all American families. It means crucial funding for the Democratic Innovation Agenda and reforms for our tax policy to reduce burdens on middle class families. It means rejecting the President's cuts to critical unemployment programs. Now is not the time to undermine already vulnerable communities. We can act to rebuild crumbling bridges, fix our roads, reduce congestion and make a serious investment in our infrastructure, paving the way for new growth and opportunity. 
   This budget makes real investments to help workers and create jobs in a fiscally responsible way. It is a budget that reaches balance in 2012. It reflects our priorities as a Nation and our belief that government has a commitment to its citizens to make critical investments in efficient and renewable energy sources, education, job training and health care, the foundation of a strong economy and future growth. It is about making our workforce more productive and making opportunity real. It is about staying competitive. And we share a mutual obligation to get it right.

The real progress that we can make in this budget does require the critical long-term investments in our local communities in energy and in infrastructure, in which the gentleman has been a leader, and that is all contained in this budget proposed by Chairman JOHN SPRATT. I thank the gentleman, and I urge my colleagues to vote for the Spratt budget.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, we know what is possible for our Nation, if we choose to move seriously and quickly down the path to energy independence. We know what this choice means. 
   Energy independence means demanding more efficiency and smarter technology for our cars, homes, businesses, and industry. Energy independence means investing in our communities and plugging their resources and workforce into vibrant, expanding markets. 
   It means developing new technologies that create new jobs through America's economic backbone: our innovation industries. If we want to make opportunity real for more Americans--if we want to keep our nation strong even as our new economy continues to change--there is no better way to do it, than by investing in a new energy future. 
   This bill--The New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act--makes investments across the spectrum, to promote renewable energy, grow our economy, create new jobs, lower energy prices, and begin to address global warming. It is time to reduce our reliance on foreign oil--an addiction that threatens our environment, our economy, and our national security. 
   It is an ambitious initiative, to be sure, but nothing less will secure our nation's energy future. It is time to stop talking about energy independence, and start moving toward it. 
   We can do that today with this legislation, by providing a historic investment in homegrown biofuels and giving incentives for plug-in hybrid vehicles rather than Hummers. We can promote and improve the use of truly efficient products from mass transit and fleets of cars to lighting and buildings, and we are finally doing our part, to make the federal government a leader in reducing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. 
   But this is not just about specific provisions from today's important legislation. It is also a recognition that by embracing tomorrow's great challenges we create great opportunity. That when it comes to addressing those energy challenges--from the soaring price of gas to rising temperatures around the world to the dangerous actions of hostile regimes abroad--we need the right leadership with clear direction and bold vision. That there is nothing America cannot achieve if we put our minds to it, harnessing our future to our own spirit of ingenuity and innovation.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this motion for several reasons, not the least of which is that it derails the bill. There is one word in this motion, ``promptly,'' which, as my colleagues know, takes the bill from the floor without reaching the question of passage. 
   Let me also add a critical point and be very clear: There are no funds in this bill which would authorize any actions for illegal aliens; not for rural housing, not for employment, not for any of the activities funded under this bill. 
   The President today accused the Congress of stalling on appropriations bills, yet that is exactly what you are doing with this motion. You are adding to the delay with a motion that means nothing. 
   As I have said earlier today during debate, this bill is the product of good, bipartisan cooperation and the result of many, many months of hard work; from hearings, to the subcommittee mark and up through the full committee. This bill strengthens rural America, it protects our public health, it improves nutrition in this Nation, it transforms our energy future, it supports conservation, it invests in research and it enhances all of society. We have every reason to move forward on this bill tonight. 
   Let me take the time to say thank you to the chair of the committee, Mr. Obey; yes, to the ranking member, Mr. Lewis; to the subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Kingston; to the staff, Martha Foley, Leslie Barrack, Diem-Linh Jones, Adrienne Simonson, Kelly Wade, Brian Ronholm, Ashley Turton, Leticia Mederos; on the Republican side, Martin Delgado, David Gibbons, Jamie Swafford, Merritt Myers, Meg Gilley; and on our side again, Rob Nabors, John Daniel, David Reich, Lesley Turner. They did incredible work to make sure that this bill got passed.     
   Let me just say to you now that I have had a lot of Members who have come up to tell me that they will vote for whichever side stops talking first. So with that, I end my remarks. Defeat this motion to recommit and pass this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I just want to say I think we need to be very excited about this bill. We set out to accomplish several goals, including strengthening rural America, having the opportunity to protect our public health, improving nutrition for more Americans, and we tried to be concerned particularly about rural areas. But we're looking at 40 percent of the children in rural areas who are dependent on food stamps. We look to transforming our energy future to $1.2 billion in loans and grants, particularly in rural areas, supporting conservation, investing in research, which keeps our agriculture on the cutting edge and, finally, enhancing oversight. 
   Most importantly, what I believe about this bill is it brings our Nation back to its most fundamental principles and that is the strength of our communities. We have an obligation to keep these things and to get them right, and I'm assuming we will take that responsibility today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. I rise in opposition to the Sessions amendment, and I am astounded that the gentleman is taking the time of the House with this amendment. 
   The only requirement in the language that the amendment seeks to strike is for the USDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide a report on contracting out policies and expenditures, to the appropriations and the Oversight and Government Reform committees. 
   This is a bipartisan provision, included when the gentleman's party was in the majority and a long-standing provision that was first part of the Agriculture bill for fiscal year 2004. 
   If the gentleman's aim is to allow USDA to continue contracting out, this amendment is not the way to accomplish that. The language that we have included in the bill does not prevent USDA from carrying out the outsourcing of Federal work. What it simply aims to do is to establish a much-needed oversight on the related costs to contracting out. 
   Regardless of how one feels about the role of the Federal workforce and the outsourcing of Federal jobs to private contractors, why would we object to transparency in this area? We are talking about a report. 
   Now, after the comment about the report being burdensome, this is the report, it is hardly burdensome, four paragraphs and a chart. It really defies the imagination. 
   The fact is that we need to exercise our responsibility. We need to increase oversight in this area. We all know that the administration's guidelines for public-private competitions, OMB circular 876, has long favored contractors and stacked the deck against Federal employees. 
   The Bush White House has pushed privatization so much that the Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month that there are more private contractors in Iraq than U.S. troops. More than 180,000 civilians, including Americans, foreigners and Iraqis, are working in Iraq under U.S. contracts, according to State and Defense Department figures obtained by the newspaper. 
   I believe we should know the costs associated with contracting-out policies. That is all, again, that is all the language in the report is about, and I cannot understand why the gentleman objects to a report. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, again, let me just notify the gentleman who just spoke, there is truly nothing in our bill that deals with the issue of privatization or with States and privatization. I think the gentleman is confused with the Agriculture appropriations bill and with the farm bill which occurred a week ago. That was addressed in the farm bill. There is nothing in our bill that deals with the issue of privatization. 
   I think it's again worth noting that all we are speaking about here is a report. What I can't understand is why we would not want to know about the cost of contracting out and what is happening. That is what our responsibility is, to ask questions. We have oversight responsibility of these Federal agencies. 
   As I pointed out before, you have 21,000 Americans, 43,000 foreign contractors, 118,000 Iraqis all employed in Iraq by U.S. tax dollars, according to the most recent government data. You have got the massive privatization of military jobs which have been taken up with construction, security, weapons systems, maintenance, and, in fact, we can't even keep track of that effort. We have a responsibility, whether it is Department of Agriculture, whether it is Department of Defense, whatever Department it is. 
   If we want to hold the jobs that we have, we ought to be asking questions about how taxpayers' dollars are being spent by these agencies. And it's fiscally responsible, and it is what we are charged with doing. You may choose not to know what they are doing because you concur that that's the thing to do, to replace Federal employees and their jobs. You can hold that view, but let's get the information. Let's get a mere report to do it. 
   I ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment.

   Ms. DeLAURO. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I rise in strong opposition to this amendment from the gentleman from Texas to cut the Community Facility grant program. 
   These are grants, please understand, that assist in the development of central community facilities in rural areas and towns of up to 20,000 in population. These are small communities, low populations, low income, and they receive a higher percentage of the grants. 
   What are they used for? To construct, enlarge, improve community facilities. What are those community facilities? It is about health care, public safety, community, public services. When you have seen what has happened to rural America with the loss of jobs, globalization, you have families and livelihoods which have become marginal, you also see the fabric of the community and those institutions cannot be sustained, and these things go away. And so that the local community has an opportunity to create some of these services that are necessary, it is vital to small communities, to impoverished communities. And they build fire stations, hospitals. They purchase ambulances and other critical facilities. 
   And if you don't deal with the health care where they have limited availability and accessibility, we are going to continually have a shortage of health care providers in rural America, and that is a disaster. 
   Major investments in transportation, telecommunications, and other critical services are necessary in many rural areas, and local tax bases are unable to support necessary investments and improvements. And we know what the topography is in rural areas with the remoteness from metropolitan areas adds only to their difficulties. 
   This is essential, this program, to really help communities get a critical infrastructure. This is building infrastructure in rural America, which every report, every study says we need to do in order to reenergize and revitalize rural America. I urge you not to vote for this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, let me close by saying that, again, this is about building infrastructure in rural America. 
   The facts are that the demographics are changing in rural America. We are looking at communities that have lost jobs, that have lost because they can't sustain them, community institutions. These community facility grants allow for these communities to access resources in order to create the kinds of services that they and their families need in order to be able to survive. 
   The demographics are going in one direction, and the administration will take away all of the opportunities, as with the gentleman from Texas, for these communities to be able to thrive. It is wrong, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise again in strong opposition to this amendment from the gentleman from Texas. This would cut in half the Broadband Community Connect program. 
   This funding level will help. First, let me quote to you from something called the Carsey Institute Report, Rural America and the Twenty-First Century Prospectus from the Field. And this is the quote. This is June, 2007: ``Expanded broadband telecommunication is essential, is essential, if rural areas are to be competitive in a global economy.'' 
   I can't believe the gentleman would want to move us backward and not forward in terms of allowing our communities to move into the 21st century and to be able to compete globally. This funding level helps more families in rural communities get the access that they need to technology. This helps to increase business, employment opportunities, greater access to educational and lifesaving medical services. 
   This is not a partisan issue. We all support providing increased broadband  services to rural America. Communities that are selected to receive grant funds do not currently have access to broadband connectivity for central services of police, fire protection, hospitals, local governments, libraries, schools. In return, what the communities do, because it is a partnership, they provide a community center where you have at least 10 computers to be available to the public with hours set for instruction and on the use of the Internet. 
   This is about economic opportunity and revitalization and the potential for improving the quality of life for residents in these areas that need to have this infrastructure. The technology is going to be the key to the ability of rural businesses and rural economies.

   Ms. DeLAURO. The President's proposal was to zero out the broadband program, telemedicine, which is really quite extraordinary in an age of technology, an age of trying to bring our communities together and particularly rural America. One of the things that we do in this bill is we're examining why we have so many underserved areas in terms of rural America. And we're going to request that the Inspector General do a study of why money isn't going into the underserved areas. 
   I don't think that there's an individual in this House, on either side of the aisle, that doesn't believe that that is the key to the future; the Internet, broadband, telecommunications. It's for urban areas. It is particularly for the rural areas which are underserved. Again, these are communities population under 20,000. Libraries, educational centers.

It has been done for decades. Reimportation needs to stay on the table. It needs to stay in this bill.

   Ms. DeLAURO. I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment, which would cut all of the agencies and programs in the bill by 5.5 percent to stay at the 2007 level. 
   This would represent a cut of more than $1 billion from the bill. Now is exactly the wrong time to cut funding for the critical programs under this bill. It is not the way to restore fiscal discipline and balance the budget. 
   Rather than using targeted precision cuts, as we have done with the bill, an across-the-board cut hurts core programs, increases the investment deficits our communities across the country have had to overcome in the past years, regardless of the value of the program. We face investment deficits in fundamental programs, rural and economic development, nutrition, international food assistance, agriculture exports, conservation, food and drug safety. 
   I mentioned in my opening remarks that the fiscal year 2008 mark provides total discretionary resources of $18.8 billion, $1 billion above 2007, $982 million above the budget request. These are modest increases, but critical to provide basic services to rural communities to feed those in need and support conservation efforts. And 95 percent of the increase in this bill is used precisely to restore these programs. 
   If we cut $1 billion from the bill, as the gentleman is proposing, this is what would happen: we would not be able to fund these efforts in rural development. Direct loans for the section 515 Rural Multi-Family Rental Housing Program; section 502 directs single family housing programs; broadband grants, the Community Connect Broadband Program; Empowerment Zone; Enterprise Community Program; Community Facility Grant Program; Rural Business Enterprise and Opportunity Grants Program. We would have to significantly cut funding for water and waste grants, mutual self-help housing grant programs, farm labor housing loans and grants. In conservation, we will eliminate funding for the Watershed Flood Prevention Operation. 
   Watershed surveys and planning. Cut funding for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program, Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative, and the Resources Conservation and Development Program. 
   Nutrition. Without $1 billion, we may not be able to restore funding for the Commodities Supplemental Food Program. We may have to cut WIC administrative grants to States. 
   The increases needed and provided in this bill are not based on the belief that we should just throw money at the challenges that we face. The modest increases are about meeting the Federal Government's obligation. 
   I oppose the gentleman's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. DeLAURO. I would just concur that I think what we need to do is to look at core programs. Whether it is at the USDA or at the FDA, the gentleman's amendment would force all of these agencies that cover rural development, and I laid out the programs. Again, if you take a look at the demographics of rural America and their needs, which have to do with water and conservation and transportation and broadband and housing, by the very nature of your amendment, we've cut $1 billion from all those very, very critically important programs that are meeting the needs today of rural America in an effort that they may be able to re-energize and revitalize their communities, put together the kinds of community institutions that will help people in rural America to be able to thrive. They have taken a terrible blow in wages and in globalization. And what you would do with your amendment is just snatch that money from these kinds of efforts. 
   And I will just say this to you: quite honestly, what we've tried to do is, because the administration, and I'm presuming that this is something that you support along with the administration, is to say to rural America, You're on your own. If you don't have it, forget about it, we're not going to be there to help you. Government has a responsibility, a moral responsibility, to engage when people are facing challenges in their lives. 
   I believe everyone in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle would concur on what we are seeing happening in rural America and what is happening to the economic stability of this area and of these communities and of these individuals. It's not statistics; it's people. It's people's lives; it's people's abilities to have health care, to take their kids to school, to be able to afford education and transportation costs. Why would you want to take that away? 
   Why would you want to decimate nutrition programs when 40 percent of children in rural America are dependent upon food stamps? Why would you want to say no to nutrition when one out of eight families with an infant in this Nation is food insecure? 
   Let me tell you what food insecure means. It means they're hungry. They're hungry in the richest country  in the world; and that is wrong, which is why your amendment really should be defeated, and it makes no sense.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, every year, the administration has castigated the Congress for funding these items. In fiscal year 2007, in the continuing resolution, we left the decision up to the administration. In order to decide what to do, the administration conducted an extensive review of all of the ``earmarks'' in the Agriculture Research Service account. Do you know what? They decided that the vast, overwhelming proportion of the earmarks were worth funding. This one on catfish genomics was approved by the administration. It may have a funny name, but it makes a good sound bite. 
   I am sure that the members of each party that requested this funding can tell the House a lot about the importance of the catfish industry to their State and the economic losses from the disease in a very serious way. 
   We also have recently witnessed what is happening with imported product in terms of catfish from China and, in fact, what that has done to that market in these communities.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I might just add to the count of amendments, lest it be forgotten on Tuesday night, that I accepted both the Gingrey and the McHenry amendments.     
   So that is 14 Republican amendments that have been allowed for debate and discussion. 
   I'm saddened by the path that we've taken to find our way here today, but I must also say that, yes, I'm glad. I'm glad that we've arrived here today because this Agriculture appropriations bill is a good bill, it's a fair bill, and it has the potential to do so much for people and for our communities who are in such need. And, yes, in fact, over the last several months it has been a product of hard work, of honest partnership, of an ongoing collaboration over a number of weeks from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
   I'm sorry that I don't see the ranking member of this subcommittee, Mr. Kingston, on the floor. Mr. Kingston can attest to the kind of work we have done together to produce and to craft a very solid piece of legislation that, in fact, will make a difference in people's lives. 
   And we should not forget how much that we have put into this bill and why. At the subcommittee level, the full committee level, even, as I said, this past Tuesday, this bill has been a bipartisan process, giving every single member of the subcommittee and of the full committee the opportunity to engage, to propose amendments, to ask for a vote if they wanted to. It has been a totally open process. 
   As a matter of fact, in the full committee there was not even one vote called because there was such a sense of agreement on every single amendment and the process that we went through in that committee. For that, I stand here very proud as the Chair of this subcommittee, and the first time that I have served as the Chair of this committee, we produced a bill that has such support. I defy any of the other 11 subcommittees to have that same kind of bipartisanship that we had. 
   This bill is too important. There's critical responsibilities. And maybe people don't view this bill as that important, but speak to rural America, speak to people who care about what's happening in nutrition, speak to people who care about conservation in this country. That is what is in this bill, renewable sources of energy. To let it be filibustered, to play political games, to let that take precedent over this bill is what's happened. 
   The minority shut down this process. The minority's tactics, 4 hours, 4 hours, and I appreciate the minority leader's disappointment with SCHIP, but on Tuesday night SCHIP was not the legislation that we were discussing. Four hours. Those tactics, tied to other legislation, have stood in the way of this process, even as the American people, in fact, do insist that we get to work fulfilling our obligations to consumers who want safe drugs and food. 
   It's good to see the gentleman from Georgia on the floor because JACK KINGSTON and I have worked very well together, as I said, to produce a good bill, one of which I stand here proudly to support and to carry on with today. 
   Our priorities have been to have safe drugs and food, farmers who rely on fair and functioning markets, children who need healthy food to meet their potential, and rural communities who need opportunities to thrive. And our priority has been to move with swift purpose, clear direction on several key goals: strengthening rural America, protecting the public health, improving nutrition for more Americans, transforming our energy future, supporting conservation, investing in research and enhancing oversight. 
   The bill provides discretionary resources of $18.8 billion. It is $1 billion above 2007, $987.4 million above the budget request, and to be sure and to make it very clear, 95 percent of the increase over the budget request, $940 million, is used to restore funding that was eliminated or cut in the President's budget, to acknowledge that we have, in fact, the obligation to meet the needs of hundreds of our communities and millions of Americans. 
   It is about strengthening rural America. And what we do in terms of facilitating growth, softening the impact of population loss, this bill includes $728.8 million to support community facilities, water and waste disposal systems, and business grants to protect our public health. We provide $1.7 billion for the FDA, $62 million over the budget request, the first step in a fundamental food safety transformation at FDA. 
   We include $39.8 billion for food stamps, a program to meet increased participation and to ensure rising food prices. We fund the Women, Infants and Children program above the President's request. We step up to priorities like investing in research, which many of you have requested in earmarks in this bill, and conservation; and when it comes to transforming energy, this budget includes bioenergy, renewable energy research, $1.2 billion, including loans and grants in rural areas of this country. 
   I'm proud of the bill. I'm proud of its priorities and the goals that we set out to accomplish. We have obligations here, and that is to discuss and to recognize what our roles are and what we do here in order to meet the needs of the American public, not to interrupt for 4 hours for political gain or for whatever is annoying you that day, to disrupt the process, shut it down. And we're going to move forward, we're going to discuss this bill, we're going to pass the bill and achieve the goals. You choose delay. We choose to proceed to go forward in a responsible way. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, we all pay the price when 46 million Americans, 9 million of them children, have no health insurance. We all have a responsibility, a moral responsibility to make sure that our most vulnerable get the health care coverage they need. 
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program is perhaps the best social policy success story of the last decade. At a time when most Americans want to see this program reach more of the 6 million children who are eligible but still uninsured, the administration's proposal would result in hundreds of thousands of children losing their coverage. That is the wrong direction and the wrong choice for our country.  
   The Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act will take us in the right direction, reaching children most in need, while improving Medicare for 44 million seniors and people with disabilities. 
   This is about embracing our Nation's most serious challenge, a challenge the Federal government has the ability, the capacity, the resources and the moral obligation to help us meet. 
   We all have a stake in solving this crisis. No one, not even the President, should be able to undermine the great promise of a healthy future for our kids.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that we have come together and finally agree on a fiscally responsible budget. And I am proud of the work that we have done to address our most urgent priorities as a Congress and as a Nation. 
   Last year, the previous majority failed to pass a budget and in the process left us without the framework to pass critical appropriations bills. In 1998, 2002, 2004, we also went without a budget resolution. We have to do better, and that begins today. We have a responsibility in this Congress to do our jobs and to put our Nation back on track. 
   At last we are beginning to get our House in order with a real commitment to spend our tax dollars wisely and with fiscal responsibility, finally honoring our long-standing commitments and making a modest investment in our future. By balancing our budget and even providing for a slight $41 billion surplus by the year 2012 without raising taxes, this plan reflects our priorities and takes our Nation in a new direction. 
   Today we have a budget that makes an investment in children and families for the first time in 6 years. We have a budget that expands SCHIP, the hugely successful children's health insurance program to give kids without coverage the attention and care that they need. 
   We have a budget that ensures new resources for No Child Left Behind to make student achievement a reality, and a new commitment for Pell Grants to make college education more affordable. 
   We have a budget that honors our veterans with the resources our VA facilities need to handle increased patient load, and provide the care our servicemembers deserve. 
   We face great challenges, challenges that the Federal Government has the ability, the capacity, the resources and the moral obligation to help us meet. Let us embrace that obligation, create real opportunity today, and give people the tools they need to grow and to thrive tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, our community recently lost a treasure, a man whose reach extended to communities across the world for the last three decades. Father Phillip Cascia made an indelible mark on the lives of thousands, thousands of people at his parishes, like St. Anthony's Church in Prospect, CT, and indeed across the globe. His commitment to children and families was as strong as his reach was long.  
   Father Cascia will long be remembered for many things. For starting the St. Vincent dePaul Society Shelter and Soup Kitchen in Waterbury, CT, not only the largest soup kitchen in Connecticut but also its largest homeless shelter, a thrift store, a mental health center; for when the United States State Department called upon him to help youth in St. Petersburg, Russia, paving the way for his work opening an orphanage for victims of earthquakes there; and for his work founding Intersport USA and other remarkable international exchange programs he started in Sao Paulo, Brazil, China and Vietnam, work that led this Congress, this body to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize. 
   Most of all, he will be remembered for being a builder of bridges. Mr. Speaker, Father Philip Cascia was never content to live his faith confined within the walls of his church. He reached out. Whether you knew him for a moment, a few months or a few decades, as I did, you were touched by his values and moved by his compassion. Few lived their faith with greater commitment, dignity and hope. Father Cascia will be missed, but he will always be remembered.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Lilly Ledbetter was shortchanged; shortchanged by her employer, by consistent pay discrimination lasting years; shortchanged again by the Supreme Court with its decision limiting a woman's ability to sue their employers for pay discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 
   As Justice Ginsburg suggested in her dissent, Congress now has an obligation to correct the Court's decision. That's why we are here, to make it clear the title VII statute of limitations runs from the date a discriminatory wage is actually paid, not simply some earliest possible date which has come and gone long ago. 
   I commend Congressman Miller for acting with urgency to correct the injustice. It is time to value the work that women do in our society, respecting the work that women do, and to value it.     
   ``The plant manager at Goodyear said, The plant did not need women, women did not help it, and women caused problems.'' 
   The President's threat to veto this legislation suggests he is happy to limit women's access to equal pay. Let's turn this around, fix the decision and make sure that women who face discrimination, like Lilly Ledbetter faced, have a right to fight against it.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1338, PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule. I commend Speaker Pelosi, the majority leader, Chairman Miller, and as well Chairman Slaughter and the entire Rules Committee, for bringing this important legislation to the floor. 
   With this resolution, we take up an effort that began more than 150 years ago when visionary women came together to stand up for women's rights, to better the status of women in our society. In this tradition, more than 11 years ago I first introduced the legislation that we consider this morning, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and I cannot help but think of all the Aprils we have commemorated Equal Pay Day without legislative movement. But, today, the legislative inertia we have experienced for years comes to an end. I could not be more proud. 
   We have made some important strides during the last quarter century. Women now make up a majority of the workforce, own 6 million small businesses and are more likely to hold an advanced degree than men. But for all of our successes, women continue to be stymied when it comes to equal pay. 
   The wage gap is real. Over the course of her lifetime, a female high school graduate will make $700,000 less than the young man she graduates with. Compared to a man, a female college graduate stands to lose up to $2 million in the course of her career. This is true across the board. As the National Committee on Pay Equity tells us, the wage gap today finds that women earn about 77 cents for every dollar men earn. 
   By now, we are all familiar with the case of Lilly Ledbetter, the woman whose pay discrimination case against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company went all the way to the Supreme Court. In her testimony before the Education and Labor Committee, she said, ``Goodyear acknowledged that it was paying me a lot less than the men doing the same work, so I was actually earning 20 percent less than the lowest paid male supervisor in the same position. What happened to me is not only an insult to my dignity, but it had real consequences for my ability to care for my family. Every paycheck I received, I got less than what I was entitled under the law.'' 
   Clearly, the marketplace alone and even our court system will not correct this injustice. We need a legislative solution. The Paycheck Fairness Act would make modest, commonsense reforms to the Equal Pay Act by closing numerous loopholes in the 45-year-old law that has enabled some employers to evade liability. 
   It would clarify the ``any factor other than sex'' defense so that an employer trying to justify paying a man more than a woman for the same job must show that the disparity is not sex-based; that it is job related and necessary for the businesses. It would prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who discuss or disclose salary information with their coworkers.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Of course, employees such as human resources personnel who have access to payroll information would not be protected if they disclosed workers' salaries of other workers. And it would strengthen the remedies available to include punitive and compensatory damages. 
   Pay equity is not just another benefit to be bargained for or bargained away. It is part of something bigger, part of a promise in which we all have a role, giving women the power to gain economic security for themselves and for their families. I urge a yes vote on this resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I want to thank Chairman George Miller for his dedication to this cause. We never could have come this far without his tenacious leadership. 
   We are grateful, Chairman Miller. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Paycheck Fairness Act is about valuing the work that women do in our society. One of our Nation's most enduring principles, one of our greatest aspirations, has been ensuring equality of opportunity for all. There is no more important American promise that allows us to be a country of dreams and of success, and today we can take another important step toward finally honoring that promise. 
   I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, whose leadership today continues to build on the legacy of those who preceded us, those pioneers at Seneca Falls as well as the women who blazed a path in the House of Representatives, Jeanette Rankin, Mary Norton. Even President Kennedy's Equal Pay Act grew out of the Commission on the Status of Women led by Eleanor Roosevelt. Forty-five years later our Speaker has celebrated that history by making this movement an absolute priority. Her message has been clear: It is time to stand up for working women and their families. 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, we can do that today by supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act, reasserting the principle that women and men should be paid the same when doing the same work and making it real by allowing female employees to sue for compensatory and punitive damages. It does so without imposing the arbitrary caps women face under title VII. It protects employees from retaliation for sharing information with their coworkers about their salary, with some exceptions. And it establishes a grant initiative to provide negotiation skills training programs for girls and women. 
   Some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth, that we already have laws in place to make discrimination on the basis of gender illegal. But just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen. According to the Department of Labor, women still earn only 77 percent of what men earn. 
   Opponents insist that this figure does not take into account education and experience. But the truth is the gap barely closes among women with college degrees. Recent research by the American Association of University Women found that just one year after college graduation, women earn only 80 percent of what their male counterparts earn. Ten years after college graduation, women fall further behind, earning only 69 percent of what men earn. So what is the message? No matter how advanced their degree or how hard they work, women will not be compensated fairly. 
   The marketplace alone will not correct this injustice. We need a solution in law, just as our country has done in the past to bring down discriminatory barriers. Others will insist that we cannot open the door for increased litigation, but in the light of day, it is clear that the current system is rife with loopholes that have allowed employers to avoid responsibility for discriminatory pay scales. 
   We all know Lilly Ledbetter's story. For so many years she was shortchanged by her employer. And years later she was shortchanged again by the Supreme Court ruling of 5-4 against her discrimination claim, drastically limiting women's access to seek justice for pay discrimination based on gender. 
   We have an obligation to ensure that this does not go on any longer, and we must begin today by toughening remedies in the Equal Pay Act to give America's working women the opportunity to fight against wage discrimination and receive the paycheck they have earned. No one should be forced to consider a trade-off between a full wage, a family life, and a good job.  
   My colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we are so fortunate to come to work every day in this extraordinary institution. We are blessed. Different regions of the country we come from, different backgrounds, and different experiences. We are men and we are women and we are paid equally. Every woman in this country deserves the same. Every family deserves to know that this institution will act today to make it real. 
   It is about ensuring that women who work hard and productively and carry a full range of family responsibilities are paid at a rate they are entitled. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Paycheck Fairness Act. We should not underestimate the power of a big idea whose time has come. 
   So many employers and companies do the right thing as a matter of course, but passing this bill today says that this is now a matter of right and wrong, that discrimination is unacceptable anywhere, and we are all diminished when we fall short. But today we have a chance to make all men and women whole and contribute to the richness of America. 
   In 1963 President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, saying that it would ``add to our laws another structure basic to democracy'' and ``affirm our determination that when women enter the labor force, they will find equality in their pay envelope.'' 
   Today we have another opportunity to make good on that promise. Those days come only few times in our tenure in the United States Congress. 
   I have always been proud to serve in this institution, and I revere those lawmakers before us who on previous days took a stand for health care for the elderly or the Civil Rights Act or Family and Medical Leave and made such an impact on people's lives. They changed people's lives. That is the whole reason why we serve in this institution. 
   It is my hope today that the House of Representatives passes this law and makes history for our country.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule we are considering and the bill, the AMT relief bill. 
   Last month, this Congress stepped up. We passed responsible legislation providing millions of hardworking middle-class families with the tax cuts they need and they deserve. And we're back today, working once again to protect over 23 million middle-class families from the encroaching alternative minimum tax. 
   In my home State, Connecticut, failing to act on the AMT would mean new taxes on 358,842 households, including almost 67,000 in my district. This is must-pass legislation for our families and for our changing economy. 
   I commend Chairman Rangel for leading the way for providing relief in a way that allows us to get our fiscal house in order by sticking to the PAYGO rules that this Congress adopted.     
   This legislation also includes a long overdue expansion of the child tax credit. Last year, because of the way the laws were written, 7 million children, most of them infants and toddlers, in working families across the country remained ineligible for even a partial credit. 
   This year we do better. We return to the original intent of the child tax credit. By lowering the earnings threshold to $8,500, we will capture additional millions of children who will be eligible for the tax credit, and the families of 10 million others will receive larger refunds. 
   With this bill, we have an opportunity to help these kids. I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule and to pass this legislation.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this budget. It represents a downpayment on our commitment to restoring middle class prosperity, a clear, practical approach to strengthen our economy, help our workforce thrive, and allow families to reach for the American Dream. 
   Today the Bush economy continues to weigh heavily on America's families and businesses. Incomes are down; everything else is up. Gas prices, food prices, the cost of health care and higher education. 
   This back-to-basics budget maintains fiscal discipline, reaching balance in 2012, remains in balance in 2013. If we pass this budget, it will mark the first time since 2000 that the Congress has been able to agree on a budget blueprint in an election year. 
   What does the budget mean? Middle class tax relief, including an extension to the refundable child tax credit and the Senate reserve fund to lower the income threshold and extend the benefit to more families. Last month we recognized the importance of expanding the child tax credit, lowering the income eligibility threshold to $8,500, providing relief to more than 12 million children. 
   It means crucial support for energy initiatives. It means enhancing our competitive edge, increasing funding for math and science education and research. And at the same time, we reject the administration's cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, first responder grants, emergency home heating assistance, and Community Development Block Grants. We bolster our economy's long-term health and help workers by making an investment in our national infrastructure and creating quality jobs, rebuilding crumbling bridges, fixing our roads, and reducing congestion, paving the way for new growth and new opportunity. 
   I urge my colleagues to stand behind this responsible budget. It is the foundation of a safe country, a strong economy, and future growth.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the rule and the underlying legislation. The Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act is an important step toward a more straightforward, just tax system. I commend Chairman Rangel for his tireless leadership. 
   Among other things, this bill will allow IRS employees to refer taxpayers needing assistance to qualified low-income taxpayer clinics, boost outreach, supporting the earned income tax credit. For so many families facing such great income insecurity during these difficult times, the EITC is a powerful initiative whose benefits reach our entire economy. 
   In particular, I want to recognize Representative Ellsworth and highlight this bill's Fair Tax Provision, rooted in our belief that no one, no one, should receive special privileges under our tax system. After all, what does it say about our Nation and our priorities when American companies like Kellog, Brown & Root, by far the largest contractor in Iraq, are allowed to take their Department of Defense dollars and filter them through offshore shell companies in order to avoid paying significant Social Security and Medicare taxes? It is my understanding that there are no other contractors in Iraq who are doing this. 
   KBR, which received a no-bid contract to rebuild Iraq's oil infrastructure and provides logistical support to the military, employs roughly 14,000 Americans in Iraq, and nearly all of them, approximately 10,500, are listed as employees of two Cayman Islands' shell companies, contracted by KBR solely to avoid paying payroll taxes for those workers. 
   And that means big cost savings passed on to a Defense Department that is contracted to reimburse KBR for all its labor costs while guaranteeing a profit, a Defense Department that is more than ready to look the other way as long as the bottom line works out in its favor. Indeed, the department knew KBR was shirking its responsibilities since 2004; yet they took no action. This kind of setup may mean a smaller price tag on any particular contract, but the long-term costs to the government and the taxpayer are far greater, $846 million over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. And the only one who really wins in the end is the company who gets the contract thanks to its unfair competitive advantage. 
   Mr. Speaker, these practices must end. This bill amends current law to treat foreign subsidies of U.S. companies under contract with the U.S. Government as American employers. And it changes the degree of common ownership to 50 percent, ensuring that more companies owing taxes are subject to the new law and greater transparency.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is unacceptable for the Department of Defense to pay for this war by doing business with a company that siphons money from its own workers and its own government, undermining the Social Security and the Medicare trust funds in the process. When tax dodgers try to avoid their responsibility, the American taxpayer suffers. This company should not be allowed to shirk their responsibilities and then be able to reap the rewards of very large Federal contracts. It is wrong. It should end. And we can no longer afford to look the other way.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program and its reauthorization. I commend the congresswomen who have spoken tonight, Mrs. Myrick and Ms. Baldwin, for their dedication to this important program and for their work to ensure its continued success. 
   Cancer is a disease that affects almost all Americans in one way or another. It is as indiscriminate a disease as you can find. It does not care about your age, your family, your sex, your race, your religion. 
   It reminds us that we are human and we are vulnerable. But as every survivor knows, it brings out our resilience, our strength, and it makes us value and really savor every moment of our lives afterward, and I can say that as a survivor of ovarian cancer. 
   It has also taught us just how critical early detection can be; and when detected at its earliest stages, the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is nearly 98 percent. When detected at its earliest stages, the 5-year survival rate for cervical cancer is more than 92 percent. However, many women have limited access to life-saving early cancer detection. 
   So in 1990, Congress created a National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, and I was  proud to be part of that effort. It provides access to critical breast and cervical cancer screening services for underserved women in the United States, especially those at high risk for breast cancer, including minority women and women with a family history of breast cancer. 
   Since its launch, the program has served more than 2.9 million women, and it has provided more than 6.9 million screening examinations and diagnosed more than 29,000 breast cancers; 94,000 precursor cervical lesions; and 1,800 cervical cancers. Any way you look at it, these numbers represent incredible success, and they translate into lives saved. 
   We have made tremendous progress in the fight against cancer, but there is no doubt we have a long way still to go. Today, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program reaches only 20 percent of eligible women. We need to work together to make sure that all women can take advantage of the medical advances we have seen, so that everyone has a fighting chance of beating this disease. 
   That is why this legislation is so important. It provides this critical and proven program with the resources for 147,000 more screenings per year. Through a five-State demonstration project it extends assistance to rural communities and special populations, providing an emphasis on education and on outreach, while ensuring that women continue to have access to life-saving screening services. 
   Reauthorization is critical. We know that more challenges lie ahead, and so we must keep up the drumbeat. Outreach, education, screenings: these make early detection possible. They make beating cancer possible. They are powerful tools that give us real hope. 
   We do a lot of things in this institution. We deal with roads, bridges, any number of parks. This is life and death.

   From Hamden, Connecticut: ``I pray that the hearts and minds of those making decisions concerning the war in Iraq be opened to finding viable, peaceful alternatives to continuing the war. I pray that the withdrawal of troops commence immediately, and continue steadily over the shortest period possible, to bring them all home. I pray that the light of God will fall upon the country and Iraq and bring about peace in that place.''

   Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, when the toys our children play with are no longer safe, government must respond. Today's bill represents a first step forward, an active response to an agency which has failed to take its regulatory responsibilities seriously for far too long, an agency that does not understand its regulatory function. We are addressing the Consumer Product Safety Commission's mandate, and trying to reform it in a meaningful way. 
   I have been proud to work with my colleague, Congresswoman DeGette, and other colleagues from the Energy and Commerce Committee to hone, to strengthen this bill. We all recognize that the American people must be able to depend on the system responsible for protecting them. 
   I especially want to thank Congresswoman Anna Eshoo who fought to strengthen the mandatory recall provision governing products that pose an imminent hazard. This new authority will allow the CPSC to provide notice and halt distribution without protracted legal proceedings. 
   I am pleased that I could partner with my colleagues to strengthen this bill in other ways as well, requiring tracking labels and product registration cards for durable and nursery products, providing the additional resources the CPSC needs to get its act together, instituting a ban on industry-sponsored travel, and providing for protections for children under the age of 12. 
   I do not believe that we have gone far enough and that we must go further. I look forward to making this bill stronger still, working through the conference to address its shortcomings. 
   Under this bill, we must make it clear that States will not be preempted. Attorneys General should not be limited when pursuing remedies or penalties. At a time when the number of dangerous products entering our markets are skyrocketing, this is a problem we need to fix now. We should be bringing more allies to our fight, not fewer. 
   Also, we are still not tough enough on third-party testing. There are still loopholes that leave manufacturers to conduct their own tests. The days of industry self-policing must come to an end. And I believe the current provision banning lead, although long overdue, has problematic exemptions. Health advocacy experts have testified to the need to place its threshold at 40 parts per million and urge more timely implementation. With our children's health at stake, we should listen to the experts. 
   Government has an obligation to its citizens; it's that simple. This bill represents a first step forward in meeting that obligation, striving to make sure dangerous toys and products do not slip through the cracks and into our children's hands. 
   During this holiday season, we cannot afford to wait any longer. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation.

   Ms. DeLAURO. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and I thank him for his perseverance in this effort as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the rule and the underlying bill, historic change that will meet the nutritional needs of all Americans.  
   I want to thank the Speaker for her vision and clear priorities on this bill and Chairman Peterson for his tireless leadership and perseverance. Thank you for welcoming my input on something so critical as the nutrition title. 
   Today, as the country faces rising food costs, food banks cannot handle the demand, and families struggle just to keep up. Today 35.5 million Americans live in households where not everyone has had enough food in the United States of America. 
   With this bill we are finally taking the right steps to provide people with a fighting chance, ending the erosion in food stamps by increasing the standard deduction and the minimum benefit, which has been frozen at $10 for the past 30 years, then indexing them to inflation. Commitments to help almost 11 million people, families with children, seniors, and people with disabilities. 
   Yet the current administration is looking for ways to undermine the legislation. The administration has argued against expanding eligibility by excluding retirement, education savings, and combat pay when determining that eligibility.     
   What does it say when our soldiers who fight so bravely for our Nation abroad are forced to scrape and scrounge for food upon their return? 
   And this bill does more. It increases funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program, including an immediate infusion of $50 million to address supply shortages as more families than ever are relying on food banks, soup kitchens and food pantries for help. There is also a dramatic increase in funding for the fruits and vegetables snack program for our schools giving more children greater access to healthy fresh fruits and vegetables at school. And we are providing $84 million in funding for the McGovern-Dole program which helps reduce child hunger, promotes education and represents a powerful opportunity for our Nation to export goodwill around the world. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. For too long we have failed to meet our obligations as a Congress and as a Nation, failed to act while too many Americans have gone without adequate food, healthy food, and are facing hunger in our Nation today. Today, we can begin to do something about it.

   Ms. DeLAURO. I rise to strongly oppose the Flake amendment. 
   This year, the Congress has worked diligently to reform the earmark process and significantly increase transparency. We targeted a decade of abuse, while still protecting Members' ability to direct critical funds to important projects and to ensure they remain in the public interest. This earmark meets that obligation. 
   The East Coast Shellfish Research Institute is a nonprofit entity. It distributes funds to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Fisheries Lab in Milford, Connecticut, to conduct vital research about the shellfish industry. 
   I understand that the gentleman from Arizona is from a State that is landlocked. For those of us who are in Connecticut, Louisiana, South Carolina, Texas and other areas that this lab meets the needs for, we rely on a healthy shellfish industry. This is a small investment. It goes a long way and pays big dividends for this entire country. We keep the industry competitive, spurring significant sustainable growth, and strengthening communities around the country. 
   The Milford Lab and others performing similar research, such as Stony Brook University and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, are national assets. They provide shellfish hatcheries with pioneering research and the tools to fight predators and disease, keep business profitable to  promote efficient, environmentally sound farming techniques. 
   The shellfish aquaculture industry is an economic powerhouse and a potential source of tremendous growth. The east coast, which relies on this industry, is home to more than 13,000 small shellfish farmers. Yes, the annual harvests are valued at nearly $80 million. The per-acre yields from shellfish aquaculture are among the highest of any form of agriculture. And I might add, this is agriculture; we just farm fish. And the industry provides thousands of jobs in rural areas. It supports related industries such as boat building, outboard repair, tourism and shellfish processing. 
   You know, today the U.S. now imports 80 percent of the seafood that we consume. Some of the worst food safety scares in recent weeks have come from seafood shipped from foreign shores. We should be building American businesses and providing an environment where more home-grown, safe seafood can reach the American public. These funds will turn research into results, making scientific information and innovation possible, benefiting shellfish producers nationwide, not only in Connecticut, but Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, Washington State and, yes, other northeastern States. 
   You know, if my colleagues truly believe in supporting families and farmers, harnessing innovation, strengthening our economy, this policy is common sense. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Flake amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, this year we fought to make sure Americans do not just get more of the same from this Congress for its agriculture policy and the farm bill. And we should be proud of the results: genuine reform-oriented legislation reflecting our new priorities. By closing a loophole that even this administration labeled tax abuse, we are stopping foreign-based tax dodgers and fulfilling some of this bill's most important obligations. 
   By sponsoring a marker farm bill for the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States, I sought to highlight our regions and, I believe, serve the entire country. We secured a major increase in conservation support for programs like EQIP and the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, and we made sure that there was a place in this bill for specialty crops. 
   What are specialty crops? Fruits and vegetables that are farmed in my part of the country, in Middle Atlantic States, in California. This is related to healthy diets in this Nation, crops that are so crucial nationwide, from New England to California. 
   And with an agreement on the implementation of mandatory country of origin labeling, this bill represents a victory for consumers and a positive first step toward improving food safety in the United States. 
   Most importantly, we are addressing a top priority: nutrition. The Food Stamp Program is one of the most effective programs to help low-income Americans secure an adequate diet, to help children and families to reach their full potential. This bill represents a real strategy to stop the erosion of the food stamp benefits and actually take us in the right direction, a long overdue improvement for our most vulnerable populations. 
   Today food stamps are feeding 40 percent of all rural children, yet the current benefit of approximately $1 per person per meal is appallingly inadequate. This bill increases the minimum standard deduction to $145 for 2008. It then indexes it to inflation. It increases the maximum benefit. And we are taking steps to improve benefits for working families with child care costs, indexing to inflation the asset limit, which has effectively barred many poor households with modest savings from receiving any benefits a all. 
   For many long years, we have failed to meet our obligations, failed to act while too many Americans have gone without adequate healthful food. Today in the Congress we should take pride in acting, finally, to improve domestic nutrition. 
   Let's pass a responsible farm bill. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Title X of the Public Health Services Act reaches our most vulnerable populations and is a primary source of reproductive health services for low-income women, lowering the rate of unintended pregnancies, reducing the need for abortion, and decreasing infant mortality and morbidity. It is good public policy. 
   For many women, Planned Parenthood is their only source of health care. In some States like Wisconsin, Utah, and my own Connecticut, Planned Parenthood is the only title X provider. It sees 65,000 patients a year in Connecticut and provides critical family-planning infrastructure in our State. 
   This amendment would be devastating, especially for the thousands of women whose sole source of medical care is these clinics. This amendment plainly discriminates against the uninsured, leaving the most vulnerable in our society in the most helpless situation. If we truly do value, if we value, as we say we do, women's health, we cannot sabotage title X, we cannot strip Planned Parenthood of funding, and we cannot pass this amendment.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the Prescription Drug User Fee  Act, better known as PDUFA, and to express my concern about the path this Congress took to reauthorize it for the next 5 years. 
   As we all know, this is an important law affecting millions of Americans and their health every day. We have an obligation to examine it closely and debate it in great depth. Yet, by considering the bill under suspension, this Congress has neither explored nor understood its full ramifications. 
   As we move ahead with PDUFA, this reauthorization clearly offers powerful reforms and poses still greater challenges. There is a lot to be proud of in the bill, adding new transparency, providing new resources to ensure the safety of the drugs and devices that we count on every day to fight disease and to stay healthy. 
   To be sure, it is certainly stronger than the bill that passed on the Senate side, and that is a good thing. This bill expands the FDA's ability to monitor the safety of drugs and medical devices after they have been approved and marketed, and increasing by $225 million over 5 years the user fees the agency can use for post-market safety monitoring. The FDA would be required to revisit the drug several years later for further analysis. And for riskier drugs, there would be regulation limiting prescribing authority to trained physicians. 
   In addition, by providing funds for the active analysis of large medical databases, this bill will also help us quickly detect drugs with major short and long-term safety problems. However, there are significant improvements we could have made to the bill if it were taken up under regular order and amendments were debated. 
   This bill, for example, does not provide any mandatory recall authority for the FDA to immediately pull products off the shelves after they have been found to be dangerous. I do not need to remind my colleagues that many of the high-profile drugs recently taken off the market had to be removed voluntarily, and that was only after significant damage had already been done. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to look at this bill a little closer. You will get an idea of just how much influence the drug industry has on this Congress. 
   Indeed, there were a number of very strong provisions in the original subcommittee draft bill that were unjustifiably weakened during the markup process. For instance, this bill creates a new risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for new drugs that would create specific requirements and criteria for each drug. Under the original draft, drug or device companies would have been subjected to a $20 million maximum fine for a single violation, and a $100 million maximum fine for several violations. These figures were reduced, however, to $250,000 and $1 million as the bill moved forward. As you know, this is mere pocket change for drug companies, and provides virtually no deterrent to companies that choose to ignore the new process. 
   In addition, the original draft would have granted the FDA discretion to ban direct consumer advertising for a new drug for up to 3 years, yet this provision was weakened as well, making it completely voluntary, while giving the FDA zero authority to require changes. 
   Worse still, if a drug company chooses to volunteer for the review system and pays a fee, it can run its advertisements regardless, rendering the system utterly useless. 
   And finally, when it comes to addressing significant conflicts of interest at the FDA, the language here is actually weaker than what the FDA itself proposed earlier this year. The agency, in fact, would have prevented any Members with conflicts of interest from voting on an advisory panel, and would have prevented any Member with more than $5,000 worth of investments from even serving on the panel. 
   This bill, however, allows the FDA to grant waivers overriding its already lenient current conflict-of-interest rules. 
   Today the pharmaceutical industry argues that interaction between drug companies and doctors who serve on these advisory committees are beneficial. Well, we know it is beneficial to the drug companies. It is time to end the influence drug companies have in our doctors' offices and at the FDA. 
   By providing additional resources and boosting the FDA's post-market surveillance activity, this bill takes us in the right direction. But we got here the wrong way, under suspension of the rules. As a result, with no debate and no amendments, the final legislation serves the American people poorly. 
   It is no surprise that drug companies are always working to improve their bottom line. They are big businesses with stockholders to please. But we have an even bigger responsibility to meet. We have a tremendous obligation to protect the public health and to ensure a safe America for everyone.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE AND WESTERN STATES EMERGENCY UNFINISHED BUSINESS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, with this supplemental appropriations bill, we continue to confront urgent business which the 109th Congress left unfinished last year and which the President continues to want to leave unfinished. Today, that includes an important relief package for agricultural disasters which occurred in 2005, 2006 and 2007. 
   I do not have to remind my colleagues about so many instances of devastation that have struck every corner of our Nation. And the President's response to these disasters is, ``You are on your own.'' With severe drought in the Midwest, wildfire in the Southwest and floods in the Upper Plains, the United States Department of Agriculture designated nearly three-quarters of all U.S. counties as primary or contiguous disaster areas over the past 2 years. Hardworking farmers struggling just to get by, struggling to deal with each disaster's painful consequences, struggling to understand their deeply felt impact on our businesses, our communities, on our everyday lives. What is the President's response? ``You are on your own.'' 
   These events are described by many as ``slow-motion disasters,'' but they are disasters nonetheless. And we cannot turn our backs on those who are hit hardest. Indeed, we have a responsibility to look honestly at all of the hard choices which have been put off far too long by this Congress and our President. 
   Outside the gulf region, there has been no disaster assistance in the past 2 years, even though natural disasters hit our farmers hard. In 2000 and 2001, we had disaster assistance bills that cost over $11 billion in one year and $14 billion in the other. Our proposal is a fraction of those. 
   While some time has passed since these natural disasters occurred, it does not mean that they have ceased to be emergencies, and it does not mean that we no longer have an obligation to help those in need. 
   What the Democrats tonight are telling those who are struggling in the face of these disasters is that you are not alone. We are on your side. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Temporary Tax Relief Act. 
   This is sound legislation. It will provide millions of hardworking middle-class families with the tax cuts that they need. We all know this bill will protect over 23 million middle-class families from the encroaching alternative minimum tax. In my home State of Connecticut, failing to act on the AMT would mean new taxes on almost 400,000 households including 67,000 in my district. 
   Along with addressing the AMT, I want to commend Chairman Rangel for including in the bill a long overdue expansion of the child tax credit. Last year minimum-wage families working full-time were not eligible for the tax credit, excluding almost 7 million children, most of them infants and toddlers.     
   Military families, fighting and dying for the United States, were not eligible. 
   With this bill, we get back to the intent of the child tax credit, providing relief to the working-class families that need it most; 2.9 million additional children will be eligible for the tax credit, and the families of 10 million others will receive larger refunds. We have an opportunity today to provide tax relief to 23 million middle-class families. Let us not fail them today, and let us not fail our children. 
   This bill represents the values of this Nation and its priorities. I urge my colleagues to vote for the rule and pass this legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 99, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Let's be clear. The 2008 budget resolution, the Democratic proposal leaves the tax cuts in place, it plans for their extension, and it extends the child tax credit and will do that. If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle cared a whit about the child tax credit, they would entertain lowering the eligibility threshold so that families who make less than $10,500 a year in this Nation could be eligible for the child tax credit. They refuse to do that. So take their words with a grain of salt today, my friends. 
   As a nation, we face great challenges, challenges in education and in health care, challenges that the Federal Government has the ability, the capacity, the resources and the moral obligation to help us meet.     
   Our job is to help create real opportunity, to give people the tools that they need to succeed. The budget that we consider today reflects our Nation's values and puts us on the right path to meet our obligations. 
   I am proud of the work that we have done with this budget because I believe it addresses our most urgent priorities, and for the first time in 6 years we have a budget that makes an investment in children and in families. It puts children first by addressing their health care needs. It rejects the inadequate funding level proposed by the President for the SCHIP, the children's health care program. Our Nation's health care problems have become increasingly desperate. SCHIP is virtually the only success story that we have, covering nearly 1 million more children and working families today than even President Clinton anticipated when he created it. 
   And Republicans agree. Recently, I received a letter from my Republican Governor from the State of Connecticut saying as much. 
   This expands coverage to the estimated 6 million children eligible but not currently enrolled in SCHIP. 
   This budget focuses on education. A quality education is more closely tied to our economic prosperity than ever. It is critical to staying competitive in today's global economy. The President's budget reduces our commitment to education investment for a third year in a row. As we face record school enrollments, the academic requirements under No Child Left Behind and rising college costs, to say nothing of increased competition from China and India, the President's budget takes us in the wrong direction for this country. 
   Now is the time to invest more in education and not less. The funding allows for an infusion of new resources for No Child Left Behind and IDEA, where the Federal Government has a promise to keep, and it works to make higher education more affordable through a commitment to the Pell Grants. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this rule. I support this budget. It represents a commitment to fiscal responsibility and a greater investment in our future.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Every family in America, every business struggles in some way with the rising cost of health care. The key to driving those health care costs down is getting control of skyrocketing prescription drug prices. It starts with negotiating better prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, something the previous majority expressly and senselessly prohibited when the Medicare prescription drug law was passed in 2003. 
   Now, this legislation is not about establishing formularies, setting price controls, or picking and choosing on behalf of seniors. It is about empowering the government to act on behalf of consumers and seniors. And, yes, that is a proper role for government, particularly when we have drug companies reporting double-digit profit increases while raising prices on top-selling medicines. 
   We can get our health care crisis under control. Allow government to negotiate drug prices as private insurance plans do for their customers and the VA does so successfully for our Nation's veterans. 
   Support this bill. Let us for a change do something for the public interest rather than continually doing something for the special interests.

   This is about only having Cuba to pay cash in advance, cash in advance for any products that are shipped. It also says that the U.S. Government has created unreasonable obstacles to American businesspeople in their trade with Cuba, which can average $2 billion in agricultural products. 
   Let me give you an example. Today Cuba has increased its purchases of rice from Vietnam because of the payment restrictions imposed by the United States. That is $200 million that could be directed towards our farmers and not to Vietnam. Talk to the folks from Arkansas. Talk to the folks from Louisiana. Wouldn't it be better if our rice farmers, in fact, could be the beneficiaries of that market? 
   Let us end this foolishness of making a restriction on our farmers to sell their agricultural products to Cuba. Cuba is the only country in the world on which we put these kinds of restrictions.

<DOCNO>Ms. DeLAURO. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, this week the Congress finally takes up its obligation to change course in Iraq. We have arrived at a new moment. Few responsibilities are more solemn for a Member of this body than one in which he or she is obligated to register a vote of no confidence in their President in a time of war. 
   Under different circumstances, I think most Americans would want to give their President the benefit of the doubt on matters of war, that they would want to trust the President's judgment to do what is right for our country, for our national security interests, and for our troops and their families who never leave our prayers. 
   It is a measure of how desperate matters have become in Iraq that the Congress considers this resolution of disapproval. Today, we find ourselves embroiled in a war that is not winnable, a religious war that is inconsistent with our original mission there, a war the American people no longer support. 
   And with 3,100 American lives lost, sectarian violence threatening to spill over into the entire Middle East, and no prospect for a stable, constitutional democracy in Iraq in sight, today we consider this war for not what we wish it were but for what it has so clearly and tragically become, a mistake of historic proportions. 
   As such, I will support this resolution opposing the escalation of this conflict. And with this debate, the Congress takes up its constitutional responsibilities with a sense of urgency and accountability that the public so desperately seeks from us. For too long the Congress has asked too few questions and been all too willing to put politics and ideology before our Nation's security. 
   To be sure, matters of war are the most serious that I will deliberate over in the United States Congress. Indeed, such a vote was my first in the Congress in 1991. But with this moment, Congress now has the opportunity to take the country into a new phase of this war. To me, nothing matters more than getting this right. 
   Four years ago, I voted against authorizing the President to go to war because, as I said on this House floor, I believed taking unilateral action against Iraq would ``weaken our moral authority, our military effectiveness and our ability to keep events under control afterwards.'' 
   Today, 1 month into the new Congress, and for the first time since the previous majority rushed to authorize this war in October of 2002, every Member of this institution, Democrat or Republican, will face a different choice. With the situation so clearly out of control, Members can trust President Bush one more time as he escalates the conflict in Iraq, or they can support a change in direction that begins to redeploy our troops out of Iraq, that uses our military in the right way, to make our country safer and raise America's standing so that we have both allies and moral authority to address our threats. 
   To be sure, of all the concerns we take to the floor with, it is the deteriorating welfare of our troops that is most alarming. Of course, every American takes comfort in the heroism and the determination that our soldiers have shown. They have performed magnificently, but they have been charged with an impossible mission that undermines their incalculable sacrifice and has strained our military in countless ways, from manpower to morale. 
   As the father of one marine whose son has been deployed for the second time to Iraq wrote to me, ``You forget what it is like to actually sleep through the night without waking up to the horrible thought that you might not ever see your son again.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know our troops will do anything their country asks of them, but let us not ask them to escalate an unwinnable war. 
   Today, virtually everyone agrees we need a new strategy, everyone, that is, except for the President who continues to pursue an objective the consensus judgment of our Nation's intelligence agencies says has no chance of success. Indeed, in proposing an escalation of the current strategy, the President rejects conclusions drawn by the National Intelligence Estimate, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, his own generals and, perhaps most importantly, the American people. In so doing, he sends what could be as many as 170,000 troops into a civil war that is being waged along sectarian fault lines that have existed for more than 1,300 years. 
   Such a policy will not only make matters worse, in my view and that of the Iraq Study Group. It will also postpone Iraqis taking responsibility and postpone diplomatic efforts that we so urgently need to reach a political settlement in Iraq and avoid an all-out civil war that spills into the entire Middle East. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not willing to stand here in the well of the House of Representatives and not move to change our policy in Iraq. There are too many lives at stake, our security at stake. I support the conclusions and recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, but I have crossed the Rubicon on this war. I support phased redeployment over the next year and will seek every opportunity to mandate such a change in law. But that begins with stopping this escalation  
   Mr. Speaker, I harbor no illusions about the President's willingness to hear this message from the Congress. Before long, it may be necessary to mandate reductions in troop levels. But the President must understand that the public and the Congress do not support his policies in Iraq--that if we can even hope to achieve a stable Iraq, a peaceful Middle East and a more secure America, our strategy must change. That is what this vote of no confidence is about. That is our obligation--let us honor it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee, and I rise in support of House Resolution 726, calling on the President of the United States and the international community to take immediate steps to respond to and to prevent acts of rape and sexual violence against women and girls in Darfur, Sudan, eastern Chad, and the Central African Republic. 
   I was proud to introduce this resolution, and I have been proud to work with my colleague Chairman Lantos, whose attention to the crisis in Darfur has been unrelenting. His dedication made it possible to move this important legislation through the committee and onto the floor of the House so quickly. 
   My friend Congressman BRAD MILLER also took a lead on this resolution, and following his trip to Darfur this summer, he has shared his unique insight about the region and our responsibility. 
   And today it is also important to note that we have reached this point together with my colleagues from across the aisle. Congresswoman ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN led our bipartisan collaboration, and we now have the support of more than 100 cosponsors from both parties. That broad support from Members at every point along the political spectrum makes sense because this is not a political issue; it is a moral issue. And it is urgent. We have an obligation to act and to act now. 
   As Members of the United States Congress, we believe we must do everything in our power to protect the basic human rights of individuals around the world, and there may be no greater violation of a woman's or a girl's basic human rights than when she is a victim of rape or sexual violence. 
   All too often during war, rape and sexual violence are used systematically as a weapon of intimidation, humiliation, terror, and ethnic cleansing. There is no other way to put it. These crimes are crimes against humanity and war crimes. And we cannot ignore them. 
   The use of rape as a weapon of war is as prevalent today as ever. An average of 40 women are raped every day in the ongoing armed conflict in the Congo. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s. And it is estimated that between 250,000 and 500,000 women were raped during the genocide in Rwanda. 
   Now, as these atrocities occur in the Darfur conflict region, we must ask ourselves, again, when will we learn from history? The answer, it seems, is not soon enough for the untold number of Darfuri women and girls beaten, kidnapped, and raped, often multiple times by multiple attackers, and held as sex slaves by the Sudanese armed forces, the janjaweed, and other armed combatants. Since the current conflict began over 4 years ago, instances of rape and sexual violence have all been documented by NGOs like Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders. And the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported on widespread and systematic mass rape occurring in the region as well as grave health risks, psychological trauma, and resulting pregnancies. 
   In July, the United Nations Security Council adopted its most recent Security Council resolution relating to Darfur in which it expressed strong concern about the ``continued and widespread sexual violence'' while ``emphasizing the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes.'' 
   But we cannot simply talk about the downward spiral in Darfur or the conditions that have only worsened since the so-called Darfur Peace Agreement was signed in May 2006. As we saw just this weekend, peace talks in Libya appear to be breaking down because key rebel groups refuse to participate, demonstrating that we are a long way from peace and security in Darfur. 
   We cannot sit idly by as women and children are targeted. The resolution before us today calls for action. It calls on the President and it calls on the international community to do the following: 
   One, develop within the State Department and USAID a Women and Girls of Darfur Initiative to, among other things, provide victims and potential victims of rape in Darfur, eastern Chad, and the Central African Republic with all essential and quality medical supplies and health care services, psychological counseling, and legal advice; 
   Two, to ensure that a hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force is deployed that can properly protect women and girls from and respond to acts of rape and sexual violence; 
   And, three, through the U.N. Security Council, find Sudan in noncompliance with its obligations to protect women and girls and call on Khartoum to bring perpetrators of rape and sexual violence to justice. 
   Our State Department and USAID must make this a top priority. As the rape and murder in Darfur goes on, the perpetrators of these atrocities go unpunished. And while the rhetoric of the administration and the international community have hit the mark, their action has fallen far short. Too much is at stake to allow these atrocities to continue. We have the power, the will, and the moral obligation to stop sexual violence and rape in the Darfur conflict region. There is no reason that we stand by when we should be acting. 
   I plead with my colleagues to understand what women and girls are undergoing in Darfur and to please pass this resolution. Let's act together in the best interests of women and girls around the world.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Chairwoman Lowey has made it perfectly clear her intent to allow only for the provision of donated contraceptives. Some of our colleagues have expressed concerns that the language, as currently written, could be interpreted more broadly than intended. Therefore, Chairwoman Lowey is offering this amendment to clarify this provision. 
   This amendment is crystal clear, my friends. It would only allow nongovernmental organizations to receive U.S. donated contraceptives, not funds, for distribution to millions of men and women in desperate need of these products. 
   Mr. Chairman, we cannot reduce abortions without contraception. That is a fact. Contraception is about prevention. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to talk about prevention, that is the focus of this amendment. 
   And let me just say this to all of my colleagues; for those in this body who proclaim to want to protect lives and to save lives and that is your mission, you have but one choice in this debate, and that is to support the Lowey amendment.

   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment and I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for offering it. 
   By prohibiting any funding in this bill from being used for the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, formerly the infamous U.S. Army School of the Americas located at Fort Benning, Georgia, we can stand up for human rights, we can honor our principles and send a strong message to the world. 
   The School of the Americas has been associated with human rights abuses, with many of its students linked to Latin American coups and vicious death squads. In 1989, graduates from the school killed six Jesuit priests, a housekeeper and her daughter in El Salvador. And today they have a new name, but they have not changed the school's old patterns of abuse and conflict. The institute continues admitting and graduating known human rights abusers. Yes, Colonel Francisco del Cid Diaz, for example, who commanded a unit responsible for a notorious massacre of indigenous people in El Salvador in 1983, then attended the institute on our own soil as recently as 2003. And there are others just like him. It is clear that the institute continually fails not only to fully investigate the prior history of its students but also to track their activity after graduation. That is why nations like Costa Rica, Argentina and Uruguay have terminated their relationship with the institute. It is clear neither those nations nor this one have anything to gain by supporting an institution with such a marred, violent history. 
   One hundred sixty-seven U.S. Catholic bishops agree. They have written Congress in support of this amendment and called for the institute's closure, recognizing that many of its graduates have consistently targeted Catholic clergy and lay workers across Latin America. As a Congresswoman, a Catholic and an American, I believe every action that we take sends the whole world a clear message about our priorities and values as a Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the McGovern amendment, make it clear we are serious about human rights and that the United States of America does not train murderers or killers and that we take the loss of human life seriously.
