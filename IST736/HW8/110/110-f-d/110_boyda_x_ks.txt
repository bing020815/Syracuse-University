<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Kansas, Ranking Member Tiahrt, and Chairman Dicks. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to light an issue of great importance to southeast Kansas, and I think we have a visual down here that we can point to in a minute. 
   Treece, Kansas, is a small town of about 150 people. It is part of the Tri-State mining district of southwest Missouri, southeast Kansas and northwest Oklahoma, producing lead, zinc and coal. Much of the lead and zinc that was used in ammunition and equipment to win World War II came from this area. However, this mining has led to incredible environmental problems, to include significant subsidence and health problems from chat piles, otherwise known as mining waste. The photograph that we have here on the easel, those are the chat piles we are talking about. 
   This problem has been under study for years. In 2004, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma arranged for the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a subsidence risk study for northern Oklahoma towns similar to Treece. The results of this study lead to a voluntary buyout program allowing Picher, Oklahoma, residents to move. 
   The Kansas Geological Survey did a stability study and hazard evaluation of southeast Kansas mining areas in 1983. The report indicated that Treece is ``located within the Picher field and is surrounded on all sides by abandoned mine workings and is extensively undermined.'' 
   In a letter to me dated March 30 of this year from the EPA in D.C., they note that, ``The Treece sub-site is part of the former Picher mining field centered near the town of Picher, Oklahoma.'' In fact, Treece was originally platted as part of Picher, Oklahoma. It sits right on the Kansas-Oklahoma border and is separated from the town of Picher only by a political boundary. Treece receives its electricity and emergency services from Picher, Oklahoma. 
   The geology of Treece and mining techniques that were used are the same as in Picher. In fact, and this is the point I would like to make, Treece, Kansas, and Picher, Oklahoma, are in fact the same minefield. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two points: First, if we must, we will ask the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study similar to the one done in Picher. But we should not have to. The Treece community should be treated the same as Picher. 
   Second, while Treece is designated as part of the EPA Superfund site, EPA has yet to approve a request for funding that would remove the chat from Treece and other sites along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. This requested funding would allow removal of this dangerous material over a 10-year period. 
   Addressing both of these issues for the good people of Treece, Kansas, is long overdue, and we certainly appreciate this committee's attention.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support House Concurrent Resolution 261, commemorating the centennial anniversary of the sailing of the Navy's Great White Fleet launched by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 16, 1907 from Hampton Roads, Virginia, and returning there on February 22, 1909. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from Virginia, Mrs. THELMA DRAKE, my friend and colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, for bringing this measure before the House. It was the Atlantic Fleet, later to be known as the Great White Fleet for its pristine decor that launched the United States into the realm of the maritime overnight. Over 14,000 sailors made an extraordinary voyage around the world, from Virginia in the Atlantic Ocean, around South America's Cape Horn to San Francisco. From there, the crews sailed the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, through the Mediterranean Sea, and back to the United States, stopping in such great nations as Australia and Italy to forge and secure the diplomatic friendships that continue to this day. 
   In 14 months, the Great White Fleet demonstrated to the entire world that the United States is committed to both military maritime presence as well as international humanitarian aid. This coming Sunday, December 16, marks the 100th year since the beginning of that voyage. In the past 100 years, we have maintained these commitments and continued deployments of the naval ships, including the hospital ships Mercy and Comfort, to provide aid and assistance to those in time of need. This centennial is an appropriate time to celebrate and renew our continued commitment to responsible international stewardship. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 261. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 42, which honors the heroic service of glider pilots of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. I would like to commend the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy) for bringing this measure forward. 
   The resolution recognizes the more than 20,000 individuals who volunteered and were trained to serve as glider pilots during World War II. These brave men served alongside airborne forces and participated in many of the major invasions: Sicily, Burma, the Battle of Normandy, France, Holland, Germany, the Philippines, and the Battle of the Bulge. These unarmed gliders landed behind enemy lines transporting vital troops and equipment to support the Allied Forces. 
   Major General Henry ``Hap'' Arnold, commanding general of the Army Air Corps, directed the development of a transport glider program, and the United States military glider program officially began on February 25, 1941. These gliders provided the Army Air Corps with a unique ability to transport soldiers and equipment that could not be reached by conventional ground units. 
   By the end of 1942, the Army Air Force had graduated a total of 9,802 glider pilots. Within just 3 years, the United States had 21,240 military glider pilots available, according to the Army Air Forces Statistical Digest of World War II. Less than 3 years after the first graduating class of glider pilots had finished their training, these fearless pilots flew numerous combat teams into France on D-Day. Gliders transported 12 to 15 fully equipped soldiers and four portable machine guns with 500 rounds of ammunition for each gun. 
   Unfortunately, the American military glider pilots are a vanishing breed. The Department of Defense ended the military glider program in 1952. Today, we are here to honor these daring and fearless World War II glider pilots for their services and sacrifices and to urge all Americans to remember the significant contribution that they made on behalf of our Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Speaker, my father, again, and it's so good to hear us talk about the generation that has come before us, my father was actually in a submarine in the South Pacific during World War II. Like many of our fathers, mine only recently has begun to really tell us what went on and those experiences as he was fighting for our country back during World War II. 
   I am so appreciative of my colleague and friend, Mrs. McCarthy, for bringing this to our attention. I hope that at some point we can take the same opportunity to honor those who have served in those submarines, not only during World War II, but today. It is a dangerous service and clearly these men love their country and are willing to do what it takes to defend the rights and to keep our country free. 
   Again, I appreciate the gentlewoman from New York in bringing this bill forward and any support that we can bring to it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Speaker, thanks to the long contributions of our soldiers and our veterans, America has amassed the most powerful military in the history of mankind. It is so powerful that we almost cannot imagine, we can almost imagine its resources are infinite, but they are not. 
   They are limited, and due to the ever-expanding, ever-deteriorating war in Iraq, they are stretched dangerously thin. Our soldiers and our families, they will never complain, and that is why we must speak for them. We must ask, no, we must demand, that they have the equipment, the training and the support that they need to succeed, and today they do not. 
   Since the Iraq war began in 2003, the Army has lost nearly 2,000 wheeled vehicles and more than 100 armored vehicles. Almost half of the U.S. Army's  entire supply of ground equipment is now deployed in the Middle East. The constant demands of combat and the treacherous terrain are wearing out equipment at up to nine times the usual rate. 
   America's military is overburdened, and now our Nation must seriously discuss how to best deploy our depleted forces against the dangers of our day.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I, too, am in strong, strong support of this. The House has overwhelmingly voted 411-3 to pass this amendment. To be honest, I think it is just an egregious grab of power by the administration to take the will of the American people and the will of this Congress and completely disregard it. 
   There are not systems or laboratories in place to test for drugs. There isn't documentation in order to make sure that we have inspected our trucks, that we have the training, and that there is drug testing. It is just a complete farce to be told that these safety requirements are going to be met. 
   Mr. Chairman, I know that I, as well as the people of the Second District of Kansas, are strongly urging the President to stop this. I certainly support this bill, which will stop the funding and stop this pilot program.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman. 
   Well, we are here. We are back again. It was about 6 weeks ago that this body passed the very bill that we are talking about today, with the looming shortfall in the highway trust fund. With no Senate action until yesterday, the shortfall is now here and now, and we have to deal with it. 
   Just last week, our Department of Transportation Secretary, Deb Miller, in Kansas, announced that KDOT would have to cut funds, cut programs and projects while the delay of the payment of funds was slated from the highway trust fund took shape. 
   Madam Speaker, we can no longer wait to act. The American people are so frustrated right now with Congress, and this is just one more of those things. It is about as crazy as I thought it would be getting here in Congress and watching what Congress can't do, with the opportunity today to do a two-for: We can fix this fund. We can fix this shortfall in the highway trust fund, and we can show the American people that in fact we can come together; in a bipartisan manner, we can work together. With that, I strongly support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to share a couple of freshman stories here. I am one of the new kids. And when I campaigned, I actually campaigned for 3 years. And you can image what I heard about veterans issues. It was about access mainly. 
   Our veterans hospitals in Kansas are good, but they only had a certain amount of money, and getting access, waiting times, waiting lines was just a tremendous problem. 
   So when I got here, I went to Chairman Filner's office with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder, and I said, listen, I need to know what we're going to do for veterans, what's going to happen. And listen, I want to know the truth. Don't tell me something. Don't let me go home to Kansas and then come back and not be truthful. 
   He said, Mrs. Boyda, we are going to take care of our veterans. 
   And then when we did our first continuing resolution and put $3.5 billion immediately into that pipeline, I heard something that I just absolutely couldn't believe, and that was someone who said, that's just a down payment. So I actually began to have faith that people in Congress do what they promise to do. 
   Let me tell you another quick story, too, and that was when I spoke with Chairman Edwards and he was telling me about what was going on, because I have been a tireless advocate for this. He said, Nancy, we're going to get this done, and we are going to do an historic funding for this, and we're going to get that done by June. 
   And then the next thing we're going to do is spend the next 6 months on oversight because we have to make sure that those funds are used in a way that makes a difference to our veterans, and we have to make sure that every cent of that that we have appropriated we can do the best we can to make sure that those funds are used appropriately. 
   So I am thrilled to be here with the new Democratic majority that is keeping its word to veterans, and saying that we're not only funding, but I believe that we will go and do the oversight that's needed to make sure those funds are used for the best benefit of our veterans. 
   Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today dismayed by the Department of Transportation's decision to rush dangerous Mexican trucks onto American roads. 
   In the last month, this House voted twice to impose severe restraints on any cross-border trucking program. Three weeks ago, we passed my Safe American Roads Act by an overwhelming, bipartisan 411-3 margin. The supplemental appropriations bill included similar language. It passed both Houses, and it was signed into law by the President of the United States. 
   But although we have twice loudly and unambiguously rebuked the Department of Transportation, they are simply ignoring the American people. On Friday, they announced plans to launch a cross-border pilot program anyway, in clear violation of both Houses and the will of the American people. 
   Their actions are deceptive, and they are intolerable. The people's House cannot be sidestepped through bureaucratic trickery. I urge the DOT to put the brakes on this profoundly undemocratic course of action. The safety of our highways is at stake.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Thank you, Chairman DeFazio. I certainly appreciate your support. 
   This is a tremendously huge issue in my district. People want to know that Congress is out there making our roads safe. I have two children and went back and forth on I-70 between Kansas City and St. Louis for years with two little kids. The truck traffic is amazingly dense. We spent years encouraging truck safety and spending billions of  dollars on safety and environmental standards, and it just does not make any sense to now watch that be reversed. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Transportation has unveiled a pilot program that will permit poorly regulated Mexican traffic onto American highways. In its present form, the DOT proposal exhibits reckless disregard for America's road safety, not to mention our border security and our economic interests. 
   Under current law, trucks registered in Mexico can drive only within a narrow border zone in the United States before cargos are transferred to an American vehicle. This system not only protects U.S. highways from unsafe Mexican traffic, but it prevents drug smuggling and illegal immigration, and it safeguards American transportation jobs. 
   But the DOT intends to halt this very sensible system. Under their pilot program, Mexican-domiciled trucks could penetrate far into the American heartland. The traditional safety standards required for vehicles on American roads, such as frequent safety inspections, limits on the number of hours driven in a day, drug testing and criminal background checks for drivers hauling hazardous materials, either would not be applied or would be weakly enforced. 
   Mexico certainly does not have a system right now for keeping these kinds of records in place. It's ridiculous for us to consider that they will be able to enforce these regulations in any way that comes up to our standards. 
   Again, let me say that our trucking industry has spent so much money getting our trucks, making them safer and so much to bring them up to environmental standards, it's just crazy to now say that we are going to bring in trucks that do not have to meet those same standards. 
   If the DOT pilot program proceeds as planned, drivers in Kansas and all across America will soon share their roads with unsafe Mexican trucks. The flood of foreign traffic will inevitably rise, result in collisions, injuries and even fatalities. 
   I introduced the bill now under consideration, the Safe American Roads Act of 2007, to rein in the Department of Transportation. The bill requires the cross-border pilot program to comply with 22 specific strict safety criteria. It creates an independent review panel to monitor and evaluate the pilot program after it launches, and it provides that the program can be terminated at any point if the Secretary of Transportation does not comply with all of these provisions. 
   By decisively approving the Safe American Roads Act, Congress can protect the millions of American families who drive our highways every day. I'd also like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairman DeFazio for their assistance and support, and I certainly urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Small Business Lending Improvements Act of 2007, passed yesterday by this House by an overwhelming margin. 
   Small businesses are critical to the Kansas and American economies. They create jobs, they keep wealth in our local communities, and they spur innovation. But in order to succeed, small businesses need ready access to startup capital and financial services. 
   The Small Business Association's 7(a) loans have helped tremendously. Last year alone, 757 Kansas businesses received $104 million through the 7(a) program.  
   The Small Business Lending Improvements Act will increase the accessibility of small business loans, helping to drive the Kansas economy forward. I especially support its provisions benefiting the rural lenders that serve so many entrepreneurs in my district. 
   I was pleased to vote for this important and innovative bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of accountability in Congress. This year, taxpayers will pay the retirement benefits for Dan Rostenkowski, Duke Cunningham and Bob Ney. What do these men have in common? All are retired Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. All are convicted criminals. Each abused his office by committing fraud, bribery or conspiracy, and each was found guilty in Federal court. 
   Despite their convictions, these three representatives and over a dozen other former lawmakers remain eligible to draw taxpayer-funded pensions for their service. The exact amount of the payments vary, of course, but the average is about $47,000 per year. That's more than the average American makes. Let me tell you, it's certainly more than the average Kansan makes. Certainly a lot more than the average person in the Second District of Kansas makes. 
   Mr. Speaker, when the new majority was sworn into the House of Representatives, we had a clear mandate from Americans--End the scandals. Clean up Congress. We've already taken meaningful first steps toward reform. In our first days, we passed an ethics package that banned Members from accepting gifts from lobbyists. We blocked representatives from flying on corporate jets. And we prevented Congressmen from pressuring businesspeople to fire or hire for political reasons. 
   That last one to me is especially important. Before this Congress, our Congressmen were out there actually influencing people and saying, if you don't agree with my politics, we're asking you to hire or fire businesspeople. It was so wrong. 
   But our work is not done and it never will be done as long as convicted criminals can draw a congressional pension. Congress can and should revoke the pensions of convicted lawmakers. But for decades now, even as payments have totaled millions of dollars, this body has quietly ignored the problem. But no longer. Today, the bill we will consider this afternoon incorporates legislation that I authored to strip the pensions of these crooked lawmakers. The final bill also sets limits on the so-called revolving door of lawmakers who are turning into lobbyists, and it imposes financial disclosure requirements on the lobbying industry. Sunlight is the best disinfectant and we need a whole lot more transparency still. 
   Taken together, these changes represent the most significant ethics overhaul to pass the Congress in decades. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. By enacting these sweeping reforms, Congress can begin to recover from the long years of scandal and corruption. Congress can begin to earn back Americans' trust.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Spreaker, the Department of Justice estimates that, in the last year, one in five children between the ages of 10 and 17 received a sexual solicitation or approach while they were using the Internet, With so many threats out there, Congress must provide a unified message that we, as a society, will not stand for anything less than a safe Internet. We will do that today when we pass five good pieces of legislation that will help keep our children safe. I am proud that my legislation, H.R. 4120, Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act will be a part of that message. 
   A man from Kansas, William Schaefer, was found guilty of both ``knowingly receiving'' and ``knowingly possessing'' child pornography that had been ``transported in interstate commerce, by any means including by computer.'' 
   Sadly, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision and the offender was not prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The Court ruled that just because images are obtained on the Internet, does not mean they were transmitted across state lines and issued the following statements:  
   We decline to assume that Internet use automatically equates with a movement across state lines. 
   Congress' use of the ``in commerce'' language, as opposed to phrasing such as ``affecting commerce'' or ``facility of interstate commerce,'' signals its decision to limit federal jurisdiction and require actual movement between states to satisfy interstate nexus.  
   The Court essentially asked Congress to clarify its intent that the Internet is in fact Interstate Commerce and we did that with passage of the Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act of 2007. This legislation closes the jurisdictional loophole that allowed a guilty man to escape punishment. 
   As concerned citizens, parents, and Members of Congress, we must do all we can to keep our children safe. That means we must make a commitment to being tough on crime--to make sure that those who violate the law are fully prosecuted--to ensure that the law is so clear that it deters such heinous crimes from happening.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. First of all, Mr. Flake, I would certainly like to just say thank you so much for this opportunity. I've had a lot of people on both sides of the aisle say that this whole thing is a complete waste of time. And I personally just want to thank you for the opportunity to stand up and talk about Leavenworth County, Kansas. We don't get that opportunity enough.     
   Actually we have many prisons. We probably have more prisons in Leavenworth County, Kansas, than any other county in the United States. Let me tell you about three of them. Lansing, which is in Leavenworth County, hosts and houses the Kansas State correctional facility for the entire State. Then, of course, we have the United States penitentiary. It is an historic penitentiary, has got some names of people who have been housed there: George ``Machine Gun'' Kelly; the NFL running back Bam Morris; Leonard Peltier; Fritz Duquesne, a Nazi spy; and Robert Stroud, who later became the Birdman of Alcatraz. So it has a huge history there. But it currently still houses close to 2,000 prisoners for the United States Government, Mr. Flake. 
   Then let me tell you about the detention barracks, which is part of Fort Leavenworth. Actually, for the first time in, say, 50 years, a unit from Fort Leavenworth was actually sent to Iraq because they were so expert in detentions and in handling these kinds of extremely difficult and sensitive issues that they went to Iraq to try to clean up some of the mess that was made by some of the detention problems. 
   So, Mr. Flake, I would just say to you that I don't think this is a joking manner in any way, shape, or form. It is very easy for you to go tell the people of Arizona that you are tough on crime. But let me say that it is a very difficult thing to do, and we take a great deal of pride about it in Kansas. It does take a lot more than talk to say that you are tough on crime. 
   The local residents are proud of their heritage and rightly so, and they see it as part of their responsibility to preserve this history. Let me talk about what they are doing. They are raising $2 million of private funds for this. 
   So I am proud. And, again, I just thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about this. We are asking for $100,000 to add to this museum. But let me talk about one other thing. Mr. Flake, I don't know if you understand this.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Chairman, real life corrections work is sometimes dangerous, and it involves loss of life and injury. This memorial, this museum, will actually be a memorial to those fallen who have, again, at the U.S. penitentiary as well as our State, as well as our fort, and the detention barracks that are there, this memorial will offer an appropriate tribute to the sacrifices that these people have made. 
   So, again, it is very, very easy to say that we are tough on crime. The men and women who do the corrections work in Leavenworth County, Kansas, understand that it takes a heck of a lot more than talk to get behind this and be tough on crime to be able to do what we know needs to be done in this country. 
   Again, I am glad to have the opportunity to stand up here. Leavenworth County has a rich tradition. We were part of the border wars when it came to the settling of one of the biggest issues in this country about slavery. We have the United States penitentiary, which is just so intense in its history. We have the Leavenworth, which has played a huge role in keeping our country safe. 
   So I appreciate this. We would like as many people to come. This is going to be a tourist attraction, and we are inviting as many people as we can to Leavenworth County, Kansas, while we are building this museum and certainly as well as after it is built. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (COMMENDING THE KANSAS JAYHAWKS FOR WINNING THE 2008 NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise again with my colleague Mr. Moran to salute the 2008 national champion Kansas Jayhawks. 
   Rock Chalk Jayhawk. Rock Chalk Jayhawk. 
   My district includes some of the most loyal college basketball fans in the Nation. Every week they get up, go  out in the dark in the middle of the Kansas prairie winter, and they journey out into the cold and dark to sit on wooden benches in an old field house, and they cheer on our local team, the Kansas Jayhawks, just like their parents and grandparents did. They are also some of the luckiest college basketball fans in the Nation. Our field house is the legendary Allen Field House, and our local team is the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most dominant college basketball teams in this Nation. This year the Kansas Jayhawks made their 13th, their 13th, Final Four and they won their fifth national championship. 
   Eat your heart out, MU. 
   In 109 years of basketball, the Jayhawks have had only eight head coaches. The position was first held by James Naismith, the very founder of this legendary game, but there have been none better than our current head coach, Bill Self. Self came to Kansas 5 years ago, and since then he's led the Kansas Jayhawks to four consecutive Big 12 Conference regular season championships and through three consecutive Big 12 tournament championships. And, Mr. Speaker, this is a tough, tough conference where even the lowly Missouri Tigers were able to hold Kansas close until the final minutes. 
   The Kansas Jayhawks won the first Final Four where all four number one seeds participated. This year all four of the number one seeds were in the last Final Four. And our Kansas Jayhawks won in dramatic fashion. Those of us who are from Kansas were hoping that the last three points that Mario Chalmers sunk into that basket might replace some of those annoying comments about Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz and then they're going to say, ``You're from Kansas. Aren't they the great basketball team that won in such a wonderful fashion?'' And I'm going to say yes, Mr. Speaker, they are. Our Kansas Jayhawks have made us all proud. And I congratulate them; I congratulate our chancellor, Bob Hemenway; and the entire KU and Bill Self for their wonderful victory and for making Kansans so proud.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (AMERICANS ARE PRAYING FOR RAIN -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, tonight Americans across the Southeast are praying for rain. As drought conditions have stretched from weeks into months, residents face a stark reminder of how one of our most precious resources, water, can also be one of our most unpredictable. 
   The lessons of natural disaster all too familiar to the good folks back home in Kansas. In the past year, nearly every county in Kansas has suffered from disastrous conditions. 
   The weather has been hard on many of us, but especially on our farmers and ranchers, who depend on nature to earn their living. It's hard to find words to express their concern, their worry. Many have worked the same acreage for decades, and they've always trusted that if they treat their land right, if they plow its soil and they plant it carefully and tend it for many months, it will reward them with a crop that will earn their living. 
   But in so many counties, disaster conditions have slashed crop yields. Ranchers face their own problems as animal feed prices soar. 
   Kansas farmers and ranchers are good hardworking people, but lately they've found that the land and the weather are betraying them. That's why it's so important that earlier this year Congress passed a critical agricultural disaster relief package. These funds helped Kansans continue to farm and ranch in spite of the ever-present threats of drought, fire and other catastrophes. 
   Today I urge America to come together once again to show the same compassion to our brothers and sisters in the Southeast. Farmers are finding that no matter how much they care and the effort that they devote to their land, their crops simply won't grow. These hardworking families can't make ends meet and they need a helping hand from Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to remember the struggles of farmers and ranchers in the Southeast, in Kansas and across America who continue to confront the challenge of this difficult weather. 
   And again, we're praying tonight for the rain for the Southeast, and it looks like we might get some rain, and we are just blessed.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It has been a pleasure to work with you on behalf of our active duty military and the two VA hospitals that we have in the Second District of Kansas. It's such an important issue for so many people in my district, and they want to know that somebody is fighting for them. 
   I would just say that it's almost laughable if it weren't so sad to hear the gentleman from Wisconsin talk about this debt as if for the last 7 years we haven't seen a tremendous increase in our national debt. 
   I, too, am absolutely worried sick about the fact that my children are going to have to pay the $4 trillion of debt that we've incurred since they've been in the majority, or actually, in the last 7 years. But Mr. Chairman, let me just say that what makes me feel so good about this new majority and this budget that we've brought forward, in those years since we've seen that increase in debt that's going to be so devastating to us, what have we gotten for it? In 12 years, we've seen the debt double, and yet we only saw $16 billion go into veterans benefits at a time when they needed them so badly. In the last year, with our fiscally responsible budget, we will have added in the last 2 years $17 billion. It's just a matter of priorities. 
   We all are very concerned about the budget deficit that the Republicans have just escalated beyond control. You and I are working together to make sure that we have priorities that reflect the priorities of the American people. Since 2003, the backlog has increased by 50 percent. We have cut so much funding out. And so, thank God that we have put some of this money back in. 
   And I know the people of Kansas want to make sure that the money they are sending to Washington, D.C. is used well and is used for the veterans that have gone out and fought so bravely for our country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am so pleased to be a strong supporter of this budget and a strong supporter of the veterans. It's easy, very easy to put a yellow ribbon on your car. And I agree with the gentleman from Pennsylvania who just spoke, we need to have action, not just words.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Speaker, unless we act now, over 150,000 of our American troops and their families will pay sharply higher taxes. Unless Congress extends the military eligibility for the earned income tax credit, we will, through inaction, slash the EITC for hundreds of thousands of troops. It would be a tax borne solely by our soldiers and our military families. We call it a soldier tax. 
   Our military continues to serve our country with honor and distinction. The last thing we need is for our soldiers and their families to have to worry about paying higher taxes next year. That is why I authored the Tax Relief for Armed Combat Families Act for 2007. It will permanently end the soldier tax. Our military families should not have to worry from year to year what funds are going to be available to take care of their families. 
   I thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Neal for working my language into today's legislation, and I call on my colleagues to pass this important legislation. Let's permanently end the soldier tax.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Speaker, veterans are a number one issue in the State of Kansas. We found it just appalling how shameful the lack of funding for our veterans had become. 
   When I came to this Congress, I can't tell you how pleased I was that we put $5.2 billion of emergency spending into our veterans funding, and a lot of that came right into the good hospitals of Kansas. That $5.2 billion of emergency funding was also called ``pork.'' How somebody could call funding our veterans ``pork'' was just beyond me. 
   Today, we are making a historic investment in our veteran care. I am hoping that we can come together across the aisle in a bipartisan manner and stand up for our veterans and insist that our President sign this bill and start to take care of our veterans as they should have been.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (DIRECTING THE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS OF OFFICIAL CONDUCT TO RESPOND TO THE INDICTMENT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, last November, voters charged a new congressional majority with a clear mandate: End the scandals and clean up Congress. At first, we embraced the voters' charge. The Democratic majority passed an ethics reform package that banned Members from accepting gifts from lobbyists, we blocked Representatives from flying on corporate jets, and we prevented Congressmen from pressuring private businesses to hire or fire for political reasons. 
   Now the time has come for another step, and our actions in the next days will determine the strength of our resolve. Did we mean it last November when we said we would change Congress, or were our words just mere election-year slogans? 
   If we meant what we said, then it is clear what must happen next. First, the House Ethics Committee must launch investigations into public reports of congressional corruption, including accusations that Mr. William Jefferson committed crimes such as racketeering, soliciting bribes and money laundering. This committee must investigate. No excuses and no delays. And if the Ethics Committee proves unable to complete this, its most basic responsibility, then Congress must create a more independent Ethics Committee, capable of the initiative and oversight that the American people deserve. 
   But that isn't enough. Although Mr. Jefferson should and must enjoy the presumption of innocence granted to all American defendants, as a Member of Congress he has a special pact with the American people. If Mr. Jefferson left Congress today, if he were to resign today, as I know many of us wish that he would, then tomorrow he will begin drawing a Federal pension for his service in Congress. According to the National Taxpayers Union, that pension will exceed $40,000 a year. 
   This, and I mean this word literally, is an outrage. Taxpayers should not fund the pensions of Members of Congress who had to resign or have resigned in disgrace, and Congress has the responsibility to end this state of affairs.  
   We must strip the pensions of any Member of Congress who commits a major Federal crime while in office. I offered a bill, the Pensions Forfeiture Act, to do precisely that, and it passed the House of Representatives earlier this year. A similar bill has passed the Senate, and now it must be sent to the floor as a reconciled bill that we can finally send to the President. 
   Let's not permit committee delays or needless procedure to interfere one more day with real, meaningful ethics reform. Let's pass the Pensions Forfeiture Act into law, and, what's more, let's end the revolving door. Let's establish an independent ethics commission, and let's begin to rebuild the trust of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I just had to come down to the floor and speak on this. No one, there isn't anybody who disagrees that we ought to be wiretapping the terrorists. No one disagrees with that. Democrats, Republicans, everyone wants to keep this country safe.     
   Let's make something real clear about what's at stake here. What's at stake is whether we wiretap Americans. That's what we're talking about. 
   The bill that we proposed that we have here, it can be summarized in one thing: wiretap first, get permission later. Go out and be aggressive. As a matter of fact, you can spy on Americans. You can do anything. You can spy, you can go out there and keep our country safe. 
   But when it comes to spying on Americans, that's the difference here. We believe that you need a warrant to do that, even after the fact of 6 or 7 days later to go back and tell the court what you've done. 
   I, for one, do not, and am not able to stand here and say, as the other side says, that the terrorists have already won; we need to give up our basic constitutional right. I don't believe that the terrorists have won, and I find it extremely discouraging. 
   What I find so troubling is the same, same rhetoric that we heard for this march to Iraq and, quite honestly, lately this march to Iran. Its the same rhetoric that we're hearing now. It's ``trust me.'' 
   Well, I'll tell you what. I didn't get sent to Washington, DC not to speak up. A lot of people are worried sick that a 30-second ad is going to kick them out of office. And I'll tell you what, I will not put my own re-election ahead of the absolute determination that I have to make sure, first and foremost, that my family and your family are safe, but that we do not shred that Constitution to do it. This is not an either/or, and we need to find a balance. I do not believe the terrorists have won.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, last month my congressional office was flooded with letters asking me to cosponsor the National Eosinophil Awareness Week Resolution. All of these heartfelt notes, as it turned out, were authored by the family and friends of an 11-year-old girl who lives in my district, Jessica Seidel. Jessica and her mother are here with us today. 
   Jessica suffers from a rare eosinophil disorder that causes her body to mistake common proteins as foreign bodies. The disorder makes Jessica's life very hard. Only last week, she had to move out of her house because her basement flooded, rendering the house unliveable for her. 
   Despite these challenges, Jessica remains a remarkable girl. She is visiting me here in Washington today, and I am impressed by her poise and her courage. I am very pleased that on Monday, the House unanimously approved the Eosinophil Awareness Week Resolution. Our vote was meaningful and it was important, not only to Jessica and her family and friends, but to every sufferer of an eosinophilic disorder across the United States.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (EFFECTIVE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY PROSECUTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Justice estimates last year that one in five children between the ages of 10 and 17 had received a sexual solicitation or approach while they were using the Internet. With so many threats out there, Congress must provide a unified message that we, as a society, together, will stand strong for Internet safety. 
   What we will do today is good; it's very good. We will pass five pieces of legislation that will help keep our children safe. And I'm so proud that my legislation, H.R. 4120, the Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act of 2007, is going to be part of that message.     
   In September of this year, a man that I am sorry to say was from Kansas, William Schaefer, was found guilty of both ``knowingly receiving'' and ``knowingly possessing'' child pornography that had ``been transported in interstate commerce, by any means including by computer.'' Sadly, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision and that offender was acquitted. The Court ruled that just because images are obtained on the Internet doesn't mean that they were necessarily transmitted across State lines. The Court essentially then asked Congress to clarify its intent that the Internet is, in fact, interstate commerce, and we will do that with the passage of the Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act of 2007. This legislation closes the judicial loophole that allowed a guilty man who hurt our children and was allowed to go free. 
   As concerned citizens, as parents, and as Members of Congress, Mr. Speaker, we must do all that we can to keep our children safe. That means we must make a commitment to being tough on crime, and to make sure those who violate the law are fully prosecuted, to ensure that the law is so clear that it deters such heinous crimes from ever happening again.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Thank you very much to my good friend from Texas, Mr. Chet Edwards, for yielding. We have worked quite diligently on many of the issues going on right in Kansas at the military bases, Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley, that I have the honor to represent. 
   I would just like to say that as a new Member of Congress, when I came, I had heard many, many promises made to veterans, and I had to wonder if they were going to be met. Many people said, Yes. Trust us. They will be met. And you can imagine as a new Member of Congress, and as a freshman, to have those promises to our veterans actually met meant so much to me, for  somebody who came to Washington to try to make a difference and, in fact, for the second year in a row we are really righting some of the real problems that we have seen with our Veterans Administration and we are proposing record funding for the second year in a row, and I am deeply proud and honored to be part of this Congress. 
   I understand that this is a bipartisan bill, and for that I am very grateful. We have plenty of floods in Kansas as well. There's a right time and a wrong time to bring that up. I believe that the Members on this side of the aisle have been very, very diligent to make sure that that is taken care of. I would like to see this committee particularly keep that same bipartisan air that has served this country so well. 
   Some of the things that are highlighting that are so important to the good people of Kansas and our veterans across the United States, an initial $4 billion for mental health, for TBI, for PTSD, for the drug abuse that we see way too often, for the suicides that are hitting our soldiers. That $4 billion of extra funding will make a huge difference in these soldiers' lives. 
   Mileage reimbursement. I come from the State of Kansas. It's a huge issue. The 41.5 cents a mile is a significant increase. I still would love to see it come up to be the full standard, but this is a significant increase that will mean a great deal to veterans from Kansas who have to travel a great deal. 
   Thank you, and congratulations on this wonderful and bipartisan bill.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, on the sixth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, I am honored and humbled to support a resolution to honor the victims of that terrible day. I ask that this House also pause to honor America's troops, who even now risk their lives to prevent the horror of September 11th from ever striking again, and our first responders, who willingly face danger to protect our safety. 
   On September 11th, our Nation experienced a grief broader than any we'd known before, one that reached beyond individuals and families, beyond even cities and states. For a few weeks in 2001, our country was united in mourning. We grieved for 3,000 souls abruptly taken, for a Nation forever changed, for an innocence forever lost. 
   Tragedy has a way of bringing people together. It doesn't minimize our differences; it magnifies what we have in common. It reminds us that, above all else, we are all Americans. As the days since September 11th continue to tick by, I hope we remember not only the grief of that day but also that extraordinary sense of community. Even 6 years later, we still grieve together for our fallen. We still pray together for our soldiers. We are--and will remain--one Nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all. 
   I support the resolution that so eloquently states the House of Representatives gratitude for those that protect us and remind us never to forget that terrible day. 
   May God continue to bless the United States of America.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Thank you very much, Mr. Inslee. I appreciate being able to join this group. 
   And it is a good day. I think it's a very good day for America. I know that it was a good day for Kansans when we got the news that the GAO report upheld the protest. There were certainly sighs of relief. 
   Let me make it clear what we're relieved about. First and foremost, we're relieved about our own national security, and that's what everybody has ultimately been most concerned about. Outsourcing our national security, outsourcing our technology, we all know that it's very hard to keep secrets, to make sure that that intelligence stays in our own hands. 
   So number one, the people of Kansas were very, very happy that our national security today would be stronger tomorrow because we did not outsource this important contract. It's a huge, huge contract and obviously the implications for our country are tremendous. 
   When we look right now at the industrial base and we wonder sometimes why we're not getting enough equipment and why it has taken us so long to get equipment to Iraq and Afghanistan, our own industrial base is right here in America, and we need to keep it strong.     
   So, again, there was rejoicing in the streets of Kansas. 
   Let me make it clear, the first reason was for our national security, and keeping that technology here with that intelligence right here at home.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. I think what the American people are learning is that Boeing has been in the tanker business for decades. You know, 50, 60 years, they have been the supplier of these tankers, and can you imagine what these tankers do. These tankers are refueling aircraft that are speeding across our skies. They're refueling them in midair. This technology is something that clearly has taken years to develop. It's been done extremely well and extremely safely right in Kansas in our Forbes Field in Topeka, Kansas, where we have the KC-135E model. 
   We just retired the oldest KC-135E tanker in the country. It was 51 years old, and quite honestly, with maintenance, it could have been maintained. It was time to put it to rest, to take it down to the bone yard. It had done its duty and it served its country very well. But that Boeing tanker has been out there making sure that our country is safe for the last 51 years, and that's what they brought to this. 
   The fact that it has the safety and the survivability should not be any real shock to anyone. They have perfected this technology. They have embraced this technology, and they've provided this technology to our Air Force and to our entire military for the last 50, 60 years. And clearly, they had a lot to offer, just the fact they've had this much experience. 
   So the survivability, you know, it's nice to see that there's data and the analysis shows that, but they've been doing this for decades. It's no big shock that the product that they were going to deliver was something that the United States can be more assured that it will be done on time and with the quality that's suitable for our military that are putting their lives on the line when they're up in the sky, doing this incredibly dangerous midair refueling. 
   I also say, too, I have the honor of representing two Army bases: Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley. I represent the headquarters of the National Guard there in Topeka, Kansas, which is where Forbes Field is. We have an Army and Air Force unit that are there, and then we have McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita. 
   But what I hear from a lot of our military is just the statement that when you're behind something, when you're out there, whether you're in the Army, whether you're in the Air Force, whatever branch, that when you're picking up something, whether it's munition, whatever you're in, the fact that that's made in America means something to them. They want to know that what they're using to defend the country and to keep themselves safe, it means something. And I've heard from people that it's very unsettling to pick up something and to think that our military equipment or military goods are not made here in the United States. 
   Clearly, if our Air Force had chosen Airbus, they would have gone out and done whatever it took to keep our country safe, but I've heard over and over again they'd like to be out there using American-made equipment, and it doesn't seem like too much to ask.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. I was just thinking, I think the American people are beginning to understand by now that specifications for this tanker, this refueling aircraft that is so important to us, there were some specifications that were given, this is what we want. And all of a sudden, here they come with this great big airplane, and now they want to be congratulated for not coloring in the lines, for not doing what they were asked to do. It kind of reminds you of a teacher that says you can write a paper, but it can only be 10 pages, and somebody wants extra credit for writing 13. Well, it was a 10-page paper assignment not a 13-page paper assignment. 
   So it's interesting that it has taken this long for the Air Force to understand that it was going to take this much more money to take this big tanker--it wasn't what the Air Force had asked for. The Air Force had asked for a tanker of the proportions and the specifications, and that's what Boeing did. They said, this is what you want. By the way, we've done this for the last 50 years, so we understand why you're asking for this. And they went about putting together a tanker that was the best deal with the very best equipment for the American people and for our military. And they did what they were asked to do. And all of a sudden, then all of this kind of bizarre math, this fuzzy math starts to come out, and some way or another it's going to be cheaper. It just never made any sense. 
   And let me finish by saying, I really applaud the GAO. I think many of us thought, well, it's going to be difficult for them to overturn that. But they sharpened up their pencils and they said, well, no, this doesn't make any sense. And so we've got to applaud the GAO for standing up and saying this is the right thing to do.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. And as I understood it, too, one of the GAO findings was that the Airbus tanker wouldn't refuel all types of aircraft, too. So you had something that certainly was bigger. But what was found out was that bigger wasn't better in this particular instance; you needed longer runways to be able to land them. And so that limited the number of places. 
   But this Airbus tanker also wasn't even able to refuel as many different kinds of aircraft as the Boeing aircraft. And I will go right back on message of saying, I wonder why. Well, Boeing has been doing this for 50, 60 years, and they knew what they were doing. And so they understand the intricacies of what needs to be done and why you need to be flexible, and that flexible is finding that optimum way to do this. And the KC135Es were replaced by the Rs. They've been doing this and making these tankers and optimizing the whole process of making these tankers for decades.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. I would just say when it comes to the issues, and clearly it just was nonsensical. Again I really appreciate the fact that before we're talking about these kinds of issues, we're talking about the plane on the merits. Because I think that's the main thing that the American people, they want a plane that works. So I think we have established that that was the better choice. But what just absolutely cooks people back in Kansas is the concept that we have agreements, and there is no real enforcement of them. It's just like they're not even worth the paper that they're on. And to just blow it off and to say that, yes, we're in the middle of a disagreement, we're in the middle of a trade violation with the same company, just as you were saying, I agree with you in what you have said. I would just add the one thing that in Kansas, people do not understand why we put together policies, why we pass laws right here and then we fail to follow through on implementing them or enforcing them, whether it's issues of trade. Certainly that is just a very, very raw one in my district, whether it's issues of just, I won't go in any myriad of issues that we probably ought not to start down that path tonight. But that is just what really chaps people. 
   We have these agreements. Why do we even bother to do them if we're not going to implement them? Not only within the letter of the law, but the spirit of the law. 
   And so certainly we have an enormous aircraft industry in the State of Kansas. And again I would as much as it's a huge economic impact for us, first and foremost, we have so much military in Kansas, and I would again come back and say that this was ultimately about making sure that we have what we need to keep our country safe and to keep the men and women who are serving in our military safe. That was first and foremost.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. I would like to add just one other aspect, too, that we haven't really touched on too much. I serve on the House Armed Services Committee. And earlier this year, we had a hearing with the National Industrial Security Program we started back in 1993 to take the intelligence, again, and the intellectual property and to make sure that we were keeping classified information classified when it to came to the purchase and interaction with foreign companies. 
   And I asked the question, did they participate, what was their participation in this whole tanker contracting process, to make sure that this classified information about these tankers was being secured. And they really weren't very involved. I said, ``Well who is going to maintain the security? Who is going to see that there are trade secrets, there are national security aspects that are being, that should be maintained?'' And during the course, they didn't say this about the Boeing contracts specifically, but their own, the assessment was that the NISP had been so underfunded and so dismantled over the last several years that they said that their services overseeing foreign military contracts, they described it as Swiss cheese. So we have to look at the big picture here tonight and just throw that in as one additional thing. 
   There was not any real oversight for what we're going to do to maintain that intellectual property and to maintain that security, that classified and secure information I didn't see. And I was allowed to ask in a few instances, but there was no, I didn't at least find out what we were doing in order to keep or maintain that classified information. And the people that certainly seemed to be the ones that should be doing it said, no, they really weren't up to it or they weren't doing it. So another reason on top of everything else. I certainly appreciate the gentleman from Washington including me in this discussion tonight.

And it's at times like this that I really am glad to be part of this freshman class and add our voices together. We've worked on so many things, whether it's trade, so many issues that our districts have a lot in common. And so it's actually a pleasure to stand up and work with the good people here tonight. And I really appreciate both of you and our friend from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). So thank you again to you both.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to speak on behalf of so many in the 2nd District of Kansas who are as concerned as I am about what's happening with the trucks coming in from Mexico. 
   I have stood strong and said from the beginning what on Earth are we doing here. We have a rule of law in this country, and some way or another it is once again being completely disregarded, the will of the American people, the rule of law, and I stand before you here tonight to say the people of the 2nd District want me to say something, and that is, enough is enough. 
   My Safe American Roads Act basically said this pilot program is not going to keep our families safe. It, in fact, will make our highways more dangerous, and asks the President, please, Mr. President, stop this program now. 
   We had a bill that was voted on this very floor right here, 411-3, virtually unanimously, and yet on Labor Day weekend, just a stunning, a stunning reversal of what the American people had asked our President, on Labor Day weekend it was announced that these trucks coming up from Mexico would be allowed that weekend, and in fact, the first trucks started to roll. 
   Tonight we want to talk about what's going on and why we are so concerned, and I'm joined here with my friend and colleague Mr. Ryan from Ohio, and I will just turn it over to you for a few minutes.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. I know a lot of good people are concerned about their jobs. 
   Our trucking industry, while I'm sure you've heard the same thing as well, as of January I had to put on some pretty strict environmental controls, and they did it. They went out and spent the money. They maintain their trucks. They keep them up to standard, so that when you and I are out there with our families, we don't have to breathe as much smog and we know that trucks that are out there are, in fact, safe. 
   Those men and women who have purchased those trucks at great expense are now going, What did I do that for? Why is it that I'm required to meet a standard and yet our companions to the south are not, in fact, required to do that? Something is just definitely awry here, and the American people have stood up and said enough is enough. 
   Let me make this real clear. This is not a partisan issue, Mr. Speaker. We both happen to represent the heartland, but this is an issue that speaks across not only party lines but across our geographic districts and speaks to people up and down the United States. 
   What the Safe American Roads Act basically did was say NAFTA provided for a pilot program, but it said there had to be some standards, let's have some standards here, and there had to be a public comment period. Well, we have a grade card here, and I'd like to pull that up for a minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, here is that grade card. First of all, it said that we had to have a public comment period. Now, traditionally, the minimum comment period is 30 days. Did this get 30 days? No. On June 8, after the Safe American Roads Act was passed, on June 8 there was an announcement that, by the way, all the safety standards had now been met. A simple statement, by the way, they've been met. I compare that to, you know, giving a third-grader 5 hours of homework and 5 minutes later they're running out the door saying, I got it done.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. I would absolutely agree with that. 
   So on June 8, the statement was made, yeah, good job, all the safety standards have been met, and the public comment period is starting. That was June 8. It was over on June 28, 20 calendar days, 10 short of what's considered to be the very minimum. You know, it was just a slap in the face of the American people. 
   Basically, it said that you had to comply with the rules that are already out there. We have section 350 of the FMCA, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; you can't bring this new pilot program in until you at least meet those requirements. Well, the fact is that they have not met those requirements either. That has to do with bus inspections. This makes a difference. These aren't just petty little infringements. This is real big business here. Bus inspection facilities still have not been met. Hazardous materials transportation, still we have an F here. 
   How about keeping the promise of inspecting every truck every time? Well, I think as we noted tomorrow, the Secretary of Transportation is having a press conference with the Secretary of Transportation from Mexico. They're going to be having a press event. Oh, did I say ``press event''? I meant they're going to be doing inspections, I'm sorry. They're going to be doing inspections. They're going to inspect one truck from Mexico and one truck from the United States. 
   Now, I don't know how you feel about that, but I am not convinced that we take a look at one truck and then deem the whole program safe, and I am deeply concerned again that we are heading in a direction that it's going to be harder and harder and harder to pull back on this thing. 
   We all know once it's out of the door, once the horse is out of the barn, it's harder and harder to pull this back, and they're just going off in a direction, again that's clearly, clearly opposite the will of the American people.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. So when you first started learning about this, I'm sure you thought the same that I did. Certainly, maybe we're just overreacting, maybe there are standards there, and those standards are being met and we shouldn't worry. Then you come to find out that they don't even have drug testing facilities. They don't even have drug testing facilities in which to perform these. The whole recordkeeping, the hours of service is just extremely worrisome. There's no way to even begin to verify that when someone comes across the border, we don't know how many hours of service that they've had already. 
   So this is not even an attempt to meaningfully enforce these laws, and they will tell you that, in fact, these systems are not put in place, the same standards that we have, we've come to expect in this country, training, recordkeeping, sleep, drug testing. 
   And certainly if we're going to talk about drugs, I don't know about in your area, but in mine, we are finally getting the meth labs in the rural parts of my district, we're getting those under control, only to have huge meth shipments coming in from where? From Mexico. And this, again, will just exacerbate that situation and make it harder and harder and harder to control the influx of drugs into this country. 
   This is not a partisan issue. This is not anything that is being done politically.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. You just have to wonder who said no, and then it went to the Senate, and the Senate basically said we'll take something and  we'll put it into the supplemental bill. And it also, of course, then passed as well. 
   And again, we now have a law that's, in fact, in force today as we speak, and it's very difficult in my district to ask people to believe that there's any real meaning when it comes to enforcement of these laws. 
   And it's one of the real outrages in my district is with immigration, and that's why it all comes together in saying this is yet another law that they're not even trying to enforce it.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Another Special Order on food safety and different standards of food. We have standards for food in this country.     
   But we bring in food that doesn't even meet our own standards. Now, tell me if that makes any sense. Is it safer to eat something that comes in from someplace else? It is just that the hypocrisy here is becoming, I think, very, very clear to the American people, Mr. Speaker. They have had enough. They are speaking up and telling us they want change. 
   One thing that concerns me, too, and especially with what is going on tomorrow. There is going to be one truck from America and one truck from Mexico that is going to be inspected. Now, my background is in the pharmaceutical industry. I was in the research and development side. When we did studies, you can believe how much time went into that protocol to say is this going to be safe and effective. Those same kinds of standards apply to this very project right here. So if we are going to do this pilot program, certainly there must have been some kind of a protocol put together that says, here is how we are going to study this, and at the end here is how we are going to know if in fact we have the data, we have collected the data to tell us if we are now safe. There hasn't been anything that has been done in that regard, that hasn't been looked at as is this a statistically significant sample? Are we testing it? Is it rigorous? 
   When we are done with this, really there is one of two things that can happen a year from now when this pilot program is finished. We will have had 500 trucks on the road for a year. And if there is no incident, will we know at that time do we just open up the borders? Now, let me tell you that I would rather that there is not an incident with those 500 trucks, but the fact of looking at 500 trucks, you could keep an eye on each one of those individually for one year, this isn't difficult. At the end of the year, are they going to tell us, if there isn't any problem that it is now safe and we have demonstrated that this has been a pilot program? That is kind of like saying we are going to give a drug to 500 people, and if nobody dies on it, let's put it out to the American people and market it. Now, that is not the way I did business and certainly not the way the pharmaceutical industry would even want to do business, but legally would not be allowed to, but they wouldn't want to do it that way. 
   Why is it that we are taking a small sample that we know probably is going to be handpicked and watched closely for a year, and then use that to determine what goes on?

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. It seems like it should make sense. In the State of Kansas, I don't know in Ohio but in the State of Kansas we do triples. Do you do triples, triple trailers? We do triple trailers across Kansas. One truck pulls three trailers. And I don't mind saying, as a mom, when you have got kids in the back seat, it is unnerving. Now, I have come to understand that triple trailers in fact are safe and there is data out there to prove that in fact they are safe, but I don't mind saying it is unnerving. 
   The concept that we would be doing triple trailers, I would assume that if triple trailers are allowed, then Mexican triple trailers are going to be allowed across Kansas. I am telling you, I don't think many people in Kansas are going to sit still very long. So are we saying that our own truckers then should start to dummy down their standards, that they shouldn't be able to do things because these other trucks are coming in and they might not be as safe? 
   Actually, when my kids were small and they were in that back seat and we were traveling across I-70, we went from Kansas across to St. Louis, Missouri, across I-70, I am sure fathers as well as mothers just have that sense of dread when you are so close to those big trucks. And, unfortunately, there are accidents. I can't imagine driving my grandkids now across I-70, wondering if these trucks are going to be safe. 
   We had a news conference, Mr. Speaker, about a month, maybe 3 weeks, ago and this woman I thought was incredibly brave. She told the story that was an absolute, it was literally tear jerking. She had just gotten married on her parents' 45th wedding anniversary. They were so very close. And to make a long story short, not long after she was married, her parents were in their car going down the highway in California with her nephew when the drive train fell out of the car. Needless to say, what happened after that was just, you couldn't even describe. And she was so brave. And this truck was from Mexico; and she said not only had they lived through this terrible, and of course wondering what her parents' last moments were like and the terror that resulted from it, but then the legal nightmare.  
   Mr. Speaker, trying to find the driver and trying to find the company, trying to find anybody who could give them information about, first of all, what had happened, who owned this truck, who was this person. And obviously the truck driver lived; her mom and dad of course did not. Getting any kind of compensation has been a nightmare. 
   Now, again, we are taking a fairly small, limited sample. And I am sure that we both agree that within this first year we both want this first year to be completely accident free. We should all want that. But what is it going to tell us if it is accident free? What knowledge are we going to have gained 12 months from now if it has been accident free? 
   This is what concerns me, that they take the entire program, put a great big Good Housekeeping stamp of approval on it and call it good and open it up. And then we are going to see what really happens.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Absolutely. I think that really speaks for it. In July, what, 114 Members in the House also signed an urgent, urgent letter to the President, Mr. Speaker, just calling on him to stop this pilot program until these safety concerns were met. 
   Is this about jobs? Sure. Is it about safety? Absolutely. And ultimately that is why I had to stand up and say something. This is about safety, and 114 Members of this House right here, absolutely bipartisan, wrote a letter to the President imploring that he stop this program before it gets started. 
   And so in the House we have passed the Safe American Roads Act; we have signed on to some statements in the supplemental asking for the President, telling the President and/or law to stop this. We have written a letter. I am hoping that our colleagues in the Senate, certainly I am calling on my colleagues from Kansas, to stand up and to really get behind this issue very clearly, very forcefully, and impress in whatever way we can to influence the President of the United States, and to see that we bring this extremely ill conceived project to a halt. The horse has not left the barn, but it is getting ready to. Now, that is what we say in Kansas.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. We have lots of horses in Kansas. The horse has left the barn. It has not left the barn; it is getting ready to. And then we are going to hear that it is going to be impossible to pull back. And this is what we have to do, and it just cannot be allowed to go further. 
   Some of the independent truckers in my district were so concerned because they knew that this pilot program was being discussed; and yet time after time they were told, no, don't worry about it, this is not going to happen. 
   And I agree with you, Mr. Ryan, that just the issue of trust has so much to do with this right now. And I think the American people are just deeply offended that the President has said ``trust me'' one more time, and they are just not able to. 
   This is not about race, it is not about Mexico, it is not about anything other than keeping our families safe when we get out on the road that we could be assured that every safety precaution, every reasonable safety precaution has been met, and that the force of law is behind it and the American people, their tax dollars are going to make sure that this is being enforced, and they can get out on the roads, take the kids to wherever they are going, over the river and through the woods, and know that they are going to be safe.

   The GI Bill educated my dad after he came home from World War II. And today is his 86th birthday; so happy birthday, Dad. 
   The GI Bill paid for his tuition, his room, his books, some living expenses. It paid for his college degree. It helped him lift our family from the Depression into the middle class, and it offered my two brothers and me a brighter future. 
   Millions of Americans have stories that are just like mine. In all of the many ways that America shows gratitude to our veterans, the GI Bill has to be one of the greatest. 
   I was honored last week to vote to extend and to renew the GI Bill to the new generation of veterans that are coming home. The GI Bill was always meant to be a permanent promise, a contract with our soldiers, a bill of rights for our veterans. And I certainly urge the Senate and the President to pass this bill into law as soon as possible. 
   Happy birthday, Dad.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, this past fall, this House passed H.R. 3997, which included a provision to permanently extend the military eligibility for the earned income tax credit (EITC). However, we are back here again while our men and women in uniform still wait for a permanent solution. We provided a 1-year extension, but our military deserve a permanent fix. 
   Without action today, hundreds of thousands of troops could find their EITC eligibility slashed. It would be a tax borne solely by our soldiers and our military families. We call it a soldier tax. 
   Our military continues to serve our country with honor and distinction. The last thing we need is for our soldiers and their families to have to worry about paying higher taxes next year. That is why I authored the Tax Relief for Armed Combat Families Act for 2007. It will permanently end the soldier tax. Our military families should not have to worry from year to year what funds are going to be available to take care of their families. 
   I thank Chairman RANGEL for working my language into today's legislation, and I call on my colleagues to pass this important legislation. Let's permanently end the soldier tax.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Speaker, in the late 1980s, a Topeka couple, Clifford and Phyllis Oshel, welcomed a foster child into their homes and into their hearts. For 2 years, they provided shelter, food, and, more importantly, caring. Through their patient guidance, they led that child from a time of crisis to what he now calls ``the best years of my life.'' 
   That child's name was Kevin Surbagh. Ever since he left the Oshels' house, he has worked to repay his debt of gratitude. For 17 years, he has fought tirelessly for a national day of recognition for foster parents, one day of the year, just one day, to honor their contributions, and to respect their sacrifices. 
   Soon after I was sworn into Congress, Kevin approached my office and told me about his mission. At Kevin's urging, I now submit for your consideration the National Foster Parents Day resolution. I ask you to join me in saying thank you, not only to Clifford and Phyllis Oshel, but to the hundreds of thousands of foster parents across our great Nation. 
   When I think back to the support I received from my mom and dad, I recognize the crucial role of our parents. My mom set me on the path that has led me to Congress today. She taught me my faith. She taught me to do unto others as I would have them do unto me. She taught me to speak to everyone in a room no matter what their role or position. She also taught me never to wear white shoes after Labor Day. All of her words of wisdom led me to where I am today. 
   In a perfect world, every child's biological parents would play the role that my parents played for me. But sometimes a family can't provide a safe, supportive, sufficient home. When tragedy strikes or turmoil rips a family apart, children are left dislocated and need a new place to call home, at least for a while. 
   Because many of these kids grew up in unstable households, some suffer emotional disturbances. Some are grieving the loss of their parents. All have endured more than any child should and all deserve a caring and supportive family. Today, over 500,000 American children still need a temporary home, a foster home. Today, 380,000 have found one, thanks to foster parents. 
   To the foster parents in Kansas and throughout America, today's vote in Congress is our way of honoring your efforts. You are deeply appreciated, and your contribution doesn't go unnoticed. 
   I hope that our vote is more than symbolic, that it encourages more families to open their homes to foster children. Caring for a foster child is one of the greatest challenges that you'll ever face, but the reward is immense. You'll help a little girl piece her life back together. You'll help a little boy feel safe and loved. You'll earn the respect of your community, your country, and of this Congress.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I rise today because earlier this week the House passed H.R. 948 to recognize the University of Kansas football team on their astonishing accomplishments of the last season and their victory at the Orange Bowl. 
   I also rise this morning with great sadness because just this Monday KU lost one of its great all-time athletes. Otto Schnellbacher was an all-American who, in 1948, led KU to its very first Orange Bowl appearance. He was a wide receiver whose career 58 catches was a record for almost three decades. As a professional athlete, he played in both the NFL and the NBA. 
   This man was an American and an astonishing athlete. Otto was a giant of Kansas athletics. He was a very good friend. He leaves behind many admirers and a legacy that will last forever. 
   To the University of Kansas, congratulations again on a historic season. To Otto Schnellbacher, we will miss you. To his widow, Jane, God be with you.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. I thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I really appreciate all the work that we have been doing on this bill. 
   How many times have we done this now? We have been here time and time and time again, trying to say that this program of bringing trucks in from Mexico into the United States, when, as you so well pointed out, all the provisions that the American people expect with regard to drugs, with regard to training and maintenance, all of the things that the American people have come to expect out of our American trucking interests are now being put on the line. 
   And so what is this, the third time that we have tried to put this, bring this program, this crazy program that, in fact, is making just almost a mockery of this Congress, trying to bring this to its final conclusion. 
   It was a year ago, after we had made, we passed H.R. 1773 by 411-3, after the Senate had passed their bill as well, that we thought maybe at that time that this program was going to come to an end. And yet, on Labor Day, this time a year ago, on Labor Day the President said, no, we're going to go through with this bill, even though it is clearly against the will of the American people. 
   Now, Labor Day. Let's think about what happens on Labor Day. First of all, how many families do we have crossing on our highways trying to take families from one event to the next, out there? It's an issue of safety to keep our families safe on our highways. It was an absolute slap in the face of the American people, and it was also a slap in the face of our American trucking industry, who has worked hard to live up to the standards that we have in this Congress imposed on them with safety, training, maintenance and all the environmental controls that they have struggled to get, to be in compliance with. 
   And so a year ago, the President absolutely refuted the will of the American people and said, we're going to go ahead and do this anyway.

   Now, let me just say that I spent many, many years working in the pharmaceutical industry. And my concern with this is there have been 500 trucks on our highways over the year. And, by the grace of God, we don't know of any fatal or serious accidents that have taken place. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I think you will agree with me that the last thing we want to do is approve a drug that hasn't killed 500 people in a year, and certainly we don't want to take this and say that this program is now ready to be opened up into the broader sector. 
   We need to stop this now. The American people have spoken. It is about our jobs, it is about safety, it is just flat out about common sense. And I hope finally, Mr. Speaker, that after  all of our work on this that we are finally bringing this crazy chapter of having trucks from Mexico be on our highways with our families and our American trucks. I hope we are finally bringing this to a close.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Last weekend, I spoke on a panel about civics and civility at Kansas State University. And during the question-and-answer time, a teacher stood up and asked me a question. She said, Do you know of any books that might be like a checklist that I could share, be a checklist on teaching my kids civics and civility? I thought for a minute, and I said, As a matter of fact, I do. 
   I am holding it right here in my hand, Mr. Speaker. It is the Bible. This particular copy was my mother's Bible. And it is the one that I was sworn in last January. So it has a great deal of meaning to me. The lessons in the Bible are truly a checklist for decent living. In Matthew 22, when the disciples asked what is the greatest commandment, it is to love our God with all of our heart and soul and mind, and the second is likened to it, to love thy neighbor as thyself. And then He says, on these hang all the laws and the prophets. Love thy neighbor as thyself. Very clear. Judge not lest you be judged. 
   The Bible has all the wisdom that we need to bring our country together. And that's why I'm glad the House is pausing tonight to recognize the start of National Bible Week. Faith has an important role to play in the lives of all Americans. It is a role that may be more important today in these dangerous and complicated times than ever before. And it is a role that we, yes, we as public servants have to defend. 
   Just last month, the Architect of the Capitol refused to fulfill a citizen's request for a flag certificate that referred to devotion to God. Just last week, the National Cemetery Administration banned a flag folding ceremony used at veterans' funerals because of references to God. Let's be clear: neither mentioning God in a flag certificate nor speaking of God in a funeral ceremony poses any threat to the separation of church and State. Not only is speaking about religion permitted by the Constitution; it is a right that is protected by the first amendment. 
   Thankfully, both of these bans have been reversed, and not a moment too soon. As we begin National Bible Week, I hope that all of my colleagues and citizens across America will pause to recognize the role that faith plays in all of our lives to reflect on the lessons of the Bible. It is our guidebook. It is our guidebook to civics and civility, as well. It is our how-to guide for public service. Everything we need is right here, folks. It is right here between these two covers.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, when most of us think about law enforcement, we imagine police patrolling the streets, or we think of lawyers and judges in a courtroom. But there's another chapter to the law enforcement story. Once a criminal has been caught, tried, and convicted in federal court, the U.S. prison system is charged with detaining him--sometimes for the rest of his life. 
   Just as Congress talks about supporting police and protecting judges, we need to talk about supporting our prisons. In recent years we have seen the Federal inmate population grow without a corresponding increase in the number of corrections officers. This is a dangerous situation that we cannot allow to continue. 
   Since 1980, the population of inmates in Federal prisons has increased from 24,000 to almost 200,000--an 830 percent increase. Unfortunately, funding hasn't increased nearly that fast, and too many facilities are facing staffing shortages. Right now, Federal prisons are overcrowded by about 37 percent. 
   Frankly, that isn't right. We can't claim to be tough on crime and neglect our prisons. Congress has to provide enough funding to the Bureau of Prisoners to ensure the safety of our guards and the quality of our prisons. 
   As a member of the House Corrections Caucus, last month I authored a letter to the House Appropriations Committee requesting increased funding for the Bureau of Prisons. Together, we requested $427 million over 2007 for the Bureau of Prison's ``salaries and expenses'' account and $210 million for the ``buildings and facilities'' account. Unfortunately, resources are stretched thin and that amount could not be met. 
   In order to continue managing the increasing prison population and providing a safe work environment for our correctional officers we need to provide the BOP with the necessary funding. We must ensure that the BOP receives the funds it needs to conduct maintenance on current facilities and build the new facilities necessary to deal with overcrowding. 
   Congress can never remove all of the risk from the job of guarding a prison. Risk accompanies any law enforcement job. But we can provide the resources to help our guards do their jobs as safely as possible and demonstrate that we are tough on crime.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. I thank the chairman for all the hard work that has gone into this bill. 
   I rise in opposition to the Kind amendment. I believe, actually, that they are doing it with the best of intentions, but what will happen to independent and small farmers in Kansas is not a good thing, and I will not be able to support it. 
   But, Madam Chairman, I would also like to talk today about something that I have been speaking about in Kansas for now 4 years, and that is closing the loopholes on these corporations that move offshore just to avoid taxes. The people in Kansas certainly are not happy that this has been allowed to go on for year after year. And I am proud to work on the farm bill, what I thought was a very bipartisan group, and I get to kill two birds with one stone, hopefully, and that is to bring home a farm policy that is going to be a very good thing for our country and for Kansas farmers, and we get to  finally close a loophole that should have been closed years and years ago. 
   The bottom line is we can't borrow and spend. We have to pay for the things that we want. It is a bipartisan bill, it is not a tax increase, and I ask my colleagues to support our farm bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Thank you so much, Mr. Davis. 
   Mr. Speaker, it shouldn't be difficult for Americans to interact with their government. But most citizen interaction with their government is through filling out forms, both paper and online, that are required to be filled out in order to receive grants, tax refunds, passports, and so many other things. 
   With so many forms, questions about what information is actually needed are bound to arise, but finding the right office to call is difficult. And to get the answers that people need in an orderly manner is, quite frankly, very, very difficult, and it shouldn't be that way. That's why I've introduced bill. And it's very simple. Any form that the government uses to collect information from Americans also has to include contact information--a phone number or a Web site--in which a person can obtain specific information on who to talk to about that form. Hopefully, when they call, a real live person will be at the other end of that line. 
   This bill also requires the Office of Management and Budget to report to Congress on implementation and a description of how the agencies are responding to complaints about it. 
   This bill is especially important to small businesses and owners, and the National Federation of Independent Businesses is a strong supporter of my bill. In fact, the idea for this bill came from some of the small businesses right there in Kansas, the good constituents that I get to represent. They were responding to a survey that was distributed to NFIB members in which they overwhelmingly supported legislation to help them get answers to questions about all the government paperwork that they have to fill out. And yes, getting that government paperwork reduced is certainly our first priority, but in the meantime, let's just get an access number so people can call and find out how to fill these forms out efficiently. 
   I've said time and time again that democracy is a team sport, and this is a perfect example of everyone working together to make our government more responsive. I would like to thank Mr. Towns and Ms. Watson for their assistance in getting this important legislation to the floor. And I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this very, very commonsense bill.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Thank you again, Mr. Davis. 
   When I went home to Kansas this weekend, I went to a couple of county fairs. And everybody was in a very, very festive mood, it's county fair  time. Clearly, there are many things that are challenging the American people and the Kansas people right now, but we have to rejoice that finally we started to see the price of this oil come down. And I think oil has come down by $25 now. Hopefully, today it's continuing to fall more. 
   I personally believe that that's for a couple of reasons: One, the Agriculture Committee last week--and I serve with Representative Foxx on that committee--we passed through the committee and will bring to the floor legislation that's going to really bring the light down on this speculation and manipulation. And I think we've basically called the bluff of the speculators and the people who are manipulating here, and that's having a real impact for which I'm very, very grateful. 
   But secondly, I think the thing that's having an impact--and the people of Kansas are grateful to see it come down, and yes, it needs to come down much more--is, quite honestly, we've called the oil companies' bluff and we've said ``drill.'' You have millions and millions of acres to drill. And we're not only asking you to drill, we're going to tell you if you don't drill, we're going to tell you to give those leases up and to give them to companies who will go out there and do it. 
   Unfortunately, as Ms. Foxx and I heard about a month ago in the Agriculture Committee, the oil companies do not have the drilling equipment. And I'm sure she was as surprised as I was a month ago to hear the American Petroleum Institute say with a totally straight face that they don't have any more equipment to drill onshore or offshore. They can barely keep up with the leases that they have now. And we're not expected to have any more for at least one, and probably two more years. 
   So we have seen the price of oil come down. We have to increase the supply of energy in this country, and I think we all agree on that. And I would reach across the aisle to my good friend and colleague on the House Agriculture Committee and say, let's work together to bring this price down. And yes, drilling will absolutely be a part of that, I think the American people and the Democrats understand that. I look forward to working together with the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) on that as we've been working on the Agriculture Committee. And I think some of the things that we've been doing have really made a difference.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (TAUNTON RIVER WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 415, and I offer it to clear up any misconceptions there may be about the impact of this bill. 
   As the amendment states, ``nothing in this act shall impact the supply of domestically produced energy resources.'' Those on the other side of the aisle have held up designating the Taunton River as a national scenic and recreational river because of supposed energy concerns. 
   I support domestic drilling, and I believe domestic oil production is important to our energy supply. This amendment makes it clear that we are not going to stop energy development in this bill, and we're not going to impede exploration of domestic resources. We're simply taking steps to protect the Taunton River. 
   We must drop the rhetoric and have a national debate about our real energy priorities by finding real solutions for the rising price of oil and gas. From the cost of fuel to increased fertilizers that are killing our farmers back in Kansas, everyone is hurting. We all know that our country needs a comprehensive energy plan to address our future. 
   The plan that was developed by Big Oil in the White House 8 years ago has brought us nothing but higher fuel prices, and we've sent trillions of our dollars to unfriendly governments overseas. 
   If you have heard me talk about the energy policy, then you have heard me talk about the three-legged stool. First and foremost, it's conservation. It's the cheapest, most fastest, and easiest piece of this puzzle. Second is an absolute determination by this country to finally break our addiction to oil through new technologies like plug-in hybrid vehicles that rely on wind or solar or nuclear or alternative sources. 
   Energy prices are driven by supply and demand, and we have to increase the supply of not only oil, but certainly of alternative fuels. 
   Third, even with these alternatives and with conservation, we must continue to have oil and gas to play a significant role in our energy policy. But we can use the lands, and we must use the lands that are currently open to drilling, like the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, and we need to invest in technologies that make it easier and more environmentally friendly to access. 
   My home State of Kansas holds wind, solar, biofuels, and yes, even nuclear  potential. If we take the simple step of just making a plug-in hybrid vehicle common and affordable, we can turn off the oil spigot and turn on the energy grid that's powered by alternatives to oil. 
   Today I think we've said it over and over and over again, Mr. Chairman. There are 68 million acres that are currently leased and are not being drilled. Today the leases are in place, the environmental hurdles have been cleared, but there's not drilling going on. And the American people, certainly the people of Kansas, they want to know why and so do I. 
   So let's talk about Big Oil's dirty little secret. They don't have the equipment necessary to drill. Eighty percent of the oil that's available on the Outer Continental Shelf is already available for offshore leasing and for drilling. But here is their little secret. There won't be any new rigs available for 1 to 2 years. According to the American Petroleum Institute, the API, that in time of increasing demand when they should have been keeping up with supply, they've been making an enormously high profit. The oil companies haven't even been growing their own stock of drilling equipment even for the lands they currently hold leases on. Mr. Chairman, I find it, and I think the good people of Kansas, as well as America, finds it just simply unbelievable. 
   My mom always taught me to clean up my plate before I asked for more. But the oil companies aren't following my mom's advice. They've been collecting lease after lease after lease, but they're not drilling on these lands. And it's time they get started. 
   The high price of oil, it's very clear that it certainly helps the big oil industry. And I don't debate that it's a very good decision to them to limit supply. But it's killing American families. It is hurting our farmers, and it is hurting our businesses. 
   Congress can't force these oil companies to go out and drill, but we can pass legislation that stops the hoarding of these leases on Federal lands. And we voted to do that here just 3 weeks ago. But like other important energy bills, it's gone right down partisan lines, and it's been opposed by the President. 
   As important as it is that we get this right, Mr. Chairman, let me go back and say, again, the people of Kansas are too smart to buy all of this. They know that ultimately, though we need that oil to bridge to the new alternative future that we're talking about in energy, we cannot drill our way out of this mess. 
   America uses 24 percent of the world's oil, yet we only have 2 percent of the world's reserves.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (CONGRESSIONAL PENSION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help rebuild the American people's faith in our Congress. 
   Last year a Member of this House, Congressman Bob Ney, praised legislation that would have stripped the pensions of Members of Congress who are convicted of trading votes for bribes. Congressman Ney claimed that the bill would hold, and I quote, ``Members of Congress and those they work with to the highest standards in order to ensure that those who abuse the public trust will be dealt with accordingly.'' But that bill never passed, for which Congressman Ney is probably grateful. On Friday he was sentenced to serve 30 months in Federal prison. His crime: Accepting tens of thousands of dollars in luxury vacations, sporting tickets, and meals from Big Money lobbyist Jack Abramoff. 
   Despite his conviction, Congressman Ney remains eligible to draw a congressional pension. And he isn't alone. Over the last 25 years, as many as 20 politicians convicted of serious offenses have received their congressional pensions. The exact amount of their payments vary, but the typical payment is about $47,000 a year. That is greater than the average American's total household income, and four times the annual earnings of the minimum-wage worker. 
   Why should taxpayers fund a comfortable retirement for a crooked Congressman? The answer, of course, is that we shouldn't. Corrupt politicians deserve prison sentences, not taxpayer-funded pensions. 
   Mr. Speaker, this House has already taken an important first step toward ending congressional corruption. On our very first day of Congress in session, we passed an aggressive ethics package that banned Members from accepting meals and gifts from lobbyists, and we enacted real earmark reform. But our work isn't done. 
   During my campaign I promised my constituents that I would help end Big Money's control of Congress, and that promise won't be fulfilled until Members who accept Big Money bribes cannot still retire at taxpayer expense. 
   Today I am proud to introduce H.R. 476, the Pensions Forfeiture Act, which would strip the pensions of Members of Congress convicted of bribery, conspiracy, espionage, or perjury. I am honored that my three fellow Representatives from Kansas, Representative TODD TIAHRT, JERRY MORAN, and DENNIS MOORE, are cosponsoring this legislation with me. All of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, are answering Kansas's demands to sever the link between money and politicians. 
   My father told me when I told him about this legislation, he said, ``Sweetheart, it's about time. Let's get on with it.'' 
   Unfortunately, we cannot now revoke Congressman Ney's pension. Believe me, I wish we could, but the Constitution prohibits us from passing such laws after the fact. But we can and we must prevent this from happening again. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Pensions Forfeiture Act. I hope that this bill will further deter corruption. Perhaps when Congressmen know that their retirement benefits are on the line, they will think long and hard before committing a Federal crime. But if some future Representative does follow in the footsteps of Congressman Ney, at least  Kansas taxpayers and the rest of American taxpayers won't have to foot the bill for his retirement home.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, yesterday I was thrilled to join four distinguished members of the House Armed Services Committee--Ms. DAVIS, Mr. GINGREY, Mr. CONAWAY, and our esteemed chairman, Mr. SKELTON--on a tour of Fort Riley. 
   I am proud to represent Fort Riley in Congress, and my pride only grew as I saw the professionalism and patriotism of Fort Riley's troops. Fort Riley is charged with training Military Training Teams--small groups of American soldiers who recruit, organize, and train Iraqi forces to take charge of their nation's security. 
   Fort Riley goes to tremendous lengths to prepare soldiers for their tours in Iraq. The fort runs complex simulations of battle conditions--they engage actors to portray Arab citizens; they encourage soldiers to behave throughout their training as though they are already in Iraq. 
   For transition teams at Fort Riley, the war begins months before they leave American soil. Their war will continue through twelve months of hazardous, exhausting deployment in Iraq. And even when they return home, their war will continue still. Many will bear the scars of the Iraq war--both physical and mental--for a lifetime. 
   Just as Fort Riley has recognized that we cannot drop soldiers into a war zone without adequate preparation, this Congress must realize that we cannot abandon soldiers upon their return to America. We owe veterans nothing less than a lifetime of support. Abraham Lincoln understood this concept when he charged America ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.'' It is time that this Congress meet our obligation. 
   I was proud in January to support a continuing resolution that increased VA funding by $3.4 billion. Last week this House passed a supplemental bill that provided a further $1.7 billion. These increases were meaningful and long-overdue--but our support must not waver now. 
   The Budget Committee has provided superb leadership toward that end. The Committee proposed a fiscally responsible, comprehensive 2008 budget that includes a $6.6 billion increase for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Their approach has earned praise from AMVETS, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the American Legion. 
   I urge my colleagues to follow the Budget Committee's lead. 
   No one can doubt that every Member of this esteemed body supports America's veterans. The only question is whether we will demonstrate our support using the most powerful tool at our disposal: the federal budget.  
   I urge you to turn words of support for veterans into action, to transform sentiment into financing. Please vote for full funding of the VA.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Madam Chairman, I rise today to ask my esteemed colleagues for their enthusiastic support for an amendment that Representative Chet Edwards and I are offering. 
   Quite simply, this amendment makes certain that children and dependents of active service duty members can afford higher education. It guarantees in-State tuition for the dependents of military family members, and it ensures that these students may maintain their in-State rates even if a parent or guardian is reassigned out of State. 
   In Kansas, we have always believed that everyone who works hard should have the chance to succeed. Kansans believe that education should open doors, not close them. Education should create opportunities. Requiring military dependents to pay out-of-State tuition leaves military students, the children of our Nation's heroes, sometimes with debt as far as the eye can see. 
   I am proud that my State of Kansas, like many others, extends both benefits to military dependents. But now Congress must act to support servicemembers in all 50 States. All but five States in America offer in-State tuition to military dependents, and all but 17 preserve those in-State rates even if a loved one is reassigned. 
   Military parents, like all parents, want a high-quality and affordable education for their children. Due to the nature of their jobs, which often requires frequent moves, military families are too often faced with the extra challenge of making sure their children receive an affordable education without endlessly transferring schools. 
   Our country's servicemembers are making the ultimate sacrifice for us. It is our duty to do everything within our power to help them take care of their loved ones. We must help them serve with a clear mind, unworried about the financial security and educational futures of their children. The very last thing a soldier needs to worry about while navigating the streets of Baghdad is whether his or her child can pay for college. 
   I rise today to ask my esteemed colleagues for their enthusiastic support for the children of these heroes of our Nation's military.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the most critical issue this Congress, indeed our Nation, is facing. The U.S. military is the best fighting force in the world, and it is vitally important that we keep it that way. I am concerned that the President's planned escalation is too little, too late, and it will further deplete our military's readiness. 
   My life changed in the late spring of 2002 when my husband Steve casually said he thought we would be at war with Iraq by Christmas. And I said certainly that wouldn't be the case; the terrorists were from Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. Certainly we will continue to hunt down Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice. We wouldn't take resources away from fighting the terrorists in Afghanistan. But that isn't what happened. 
   That fall, every time I heard that we were going to be greeted as liberators in Iraq, I cringed. We were going into the most unstable part of the world, a region that has been at war for centuries, and we were going in with dangerously naive plans. We were going after a hornet's nest with a baseball bat. 
   As the mother of two and stepmother of five, I felt my family's very safety was being threatened by this diversion of resources. Like a mother bear who senses, no, who knows that her cubs are being threatened, I could not remain silent. 
   Diverting resources from Afghanistan and invading Iraq may be one of the most dangerous decisions this country has ever made. Our Nation's civilian leadership took their eye off the ball. Instead of securing more resources to hunt down Osama bin Laden, instead of engaging in diplomacy, they put resources into what has become a civil war and have depleted our Nation's strategic readiness. 
   Please, please understand me. Our military has not failed. What has failed is our civilian leadership. Our military and their families have repeatedly stepped up and done what our Nation has asked of them. And now, Mr. Speaker, President Bush proposes to send more than 20,000 more troops to this civil war. He asks us to trust him with our soldiers' lives, even after trust has been broken time and time again. 
   Not only is the goal of this escalation unclear, but its effect would be to redirect precious military resources instead of preparing for potential future conflicts. In a recent hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, I asked General Peter Pace whether he was satisfied with the readiness levels of our troops. His response? ``No, ma'am, I'm not.'' General Peter Schoomaker and General Steven Blum have echoed his concerns. 
   America lives in an unstable world; we face threats from a nuclear-armed North Korea, from a belligerent Iran, and from the al Qaeda terrorists who considered September 11 as only the first act in their sinister play. In these dangerous times we are not safer if we devote so many of our resources to a civil war in Iraq. And I as a mother, I cannot support this escalation. It is withdrawing precious resources from a fighting force that is already stretched too thin. 
   America's strategic readiness is not a political question; it is a question of national security, and it is a critical question about the safety of all our families.

<DOCNO>Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. (AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 TO RESTORE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people are so frustrated right now with Congress. And this is one of the things. People ask me does anything surprise me. And I say no, it's about as crazy as I thought it would be on a given day. But a couple of weeks ago, I have to tell you that I was just shocked. This very bill that we're talking about today was brought in the FAA bill. The Parliamentarian said, it's germane. And we said we have a shortfall between now and 2009. Sure we have long-term problems, but we have this shortfall right now that has to be addressed. We got left with this train wreck, and we're trying to clean it up. 
   And when the good people in Kansas, and this certainly made the news, learned that because that got taken out of the FAA bill, quite honestly along partisan lines, it not only affected what people thought about our  ability to govern, but they wonder what on earth Congress was doing to not take care of this. And they understood ultimately that this was all about politics. 
   Today, we have brought this back together. Mr. Moran, my colleague from Kansas, and I have worked together and said, we're going to try to bring America together to do this very, very commonsense fix. Everybody knows we're using less and less gas. Hallelujah. And there's less money going into the trust fund. Everybody knows that the price of construction is skyrocketing and we have to do this. Let's get on with it. It's going to affect $120 million of funds right there in Kansas. 
   But I will tell you what else it does. It affects people's ability to think, can Congress come together and work? I believe that we can.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. We have to do two things. We have to fix this. But today we have an opportunity to show the American people that we will put partisan politics aside and we are going to do the right thing for the American people. 
   I think we have got a twofer today. I strongly suggest and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill and do the people's work.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1421. It solemnly commemorates the 25th anniversary of the tragic October 1983 terrorist bombing of the United States Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, and it remembers those who lost their lives and those who were injured. 
   On October 23, 1983, at approximately 6:20 in the morning, a large truck packed with explosives crashed through security and slammed into the lobby of the United States Marine Corps Barracks. The vehicle's driver, a suicide bomber, detonated explosives the equivalent of 12,000 pounds of TNT, crumbling the 4-story building and killing marines, soldiers, and sailors while they slept. Two hundred forty-one servicemembers lost their lives that day, making this day in October the single bloodiest day in the Marine Corps history since World War II. 
   America's first encounter with suicide bombings becomes even more tragic when we remember that our brave men and soldiers were in Beirut there to provide opportunity for others to live in peace. As part of a multinational peacekeeping force, the Marines had deployed to serve as a catalyst for peace in a volatile and violent region of the world. They were proudly serving the principles of freedom to ensure that men and women may live in a peaceful and free world. It is an unconceivable evil that would violently target those who volunteer to bring goodwill and peace to a nation. 
   With grave hearts, we commemorate the 25th anniversary of the 1983 terrorist bombing of the United States Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. Let us honor all 272 members of the Armed Forces who gave their lives that day and recognize the 60 Americans who survived the attack. These military men and women served proudly, and many made the ultimate sacrifice that others around the world may know the gift of freedom.     
   They came from 39 States and Puerto Rico, and the sacrifices of these honorable military men and women will never be forgotten. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important resolution, and on behalf of myself and my husband, former Marine Staff Sergeant Steve Boyda, Semper Fi. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to acknowledge the leadership and the good work of my friend and colleague, Mr. WALTER JONES of North Carolina. I think the American people sometimes don't see bipartisanship, and I would just like to congratulate him for the many things that he has done to work across the aisle on behalf of our servicemen and women and on behalf of the American people in keeping this country safe. 
   Too often, all the American people see is a lack of bipartisanship, and this is one where we come together on this resolution and on so many others on behalf of our servicemen and women, and, as I say, on behalf of keeping the American people safe and secure. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I have no further requests for time. I am prepared to close after Mr. Jones has. 
   I continue to reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. BOYDA of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I just wish to, before we close out, acknowledge the service of Mr. LaHood from Illinois. Again, a true patriot and somebody who has reached across party lines on a regular basis to find resolutions on some of the toughest issues. I just appreciate that, and I certainly appreciate the moment of silence. Thank you very much. 
   Again, on behalf of a very grateful Nation, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important resolution. 
   I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
