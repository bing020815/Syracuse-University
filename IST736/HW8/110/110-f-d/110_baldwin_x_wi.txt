<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As part of our Nation's bicentennial celebration in 1976, Congress passed a joint resolution re-emphasizing existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag, especially recommending its display on a number of different holidays, including Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May. 
   Omitted from the list was Father's Day. H.R. 2356 would amend the Federal flag code to include Father's Day, the third Sunday in June, among important holidays on which to fly the American flag. 
   The law now provides that, in addition to the important occasions listed in the flag code, ``the flag should be displayed on all days.'' I know that this is the custom in every community in the United States. 
   Still, I think that it is important for the flag code to recognize both mothers and fathers, who raise the next generation, inculcate them with the values they need to be good citizens and good neighbors. 
   I want to thank our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his efforts to enact this worthwhile legislation. 
   And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to honor fathers in the flag code, just as we now honor mothers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to join the gentleman from Iowa in giving special recognition to our colleague, Mr. Tiahrt of Kansas, who has also worked on this issue and is sponsoring similar legislation. This really is a remarkable bipartisan effort. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is simple, yet sensible legislation to accord equal honor to fathers as to mothers in the statutory guidance on flying our Nation's flag on special days of the year. I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (RECOGNIZING 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF LOVING V. VIRGINIA LEGALIZING INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 431, a resolution I introduced along with the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), commemorating the 40th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, the landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing interracial marriages within the United States. 
   I thank Chairman Conyers for expedition consideration of this resolution so it could be brought to the floor before the actual date of the anniversary which is tomorrow, June 12. 
   In June of 1958, two residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Mildred Jeter, a black Native American woman, and Richard Perry Loving, a Caucasian man, were married in Washington, D.C. Upon their return to Virginia, Richard Perry Loving and Mildred Jeter Loving were charged with violating Virginia's anti-miscegenation statutes, which made their marriage a felony.     
   They challenged their convictions, culminating in the June 12, 1967, U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Loving v. Virginia, striking down the remaining anti-miscegenation laws that were still in effect in 16 States. 
   In the unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court rejected bigotry against interracial relations, recognizing an individual's right to marry under the 14th amendment. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote: ``Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our very existence and survival ..... To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the 14th amendment, is surely to deprive all the States' citizens of liberty without due process of law.'' 
   The opinion also stated that ``the 14th amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.'' 
   The Loving decision marked a critical step forward in our Nation's struggle toward equal rights for all, particularly full marriage equality. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, from 1970 to the year 2000 the percentage of interracial marriages has increased from 1 percent of all marriages to more than 5 percent. The number of children living in interracial families has quadrupled between 1970 and 2000, going from 900,000 to more than 3 million. Because of the decision's profound impact in our society, numerous cities and towns across this country have already proclaimed June 12 Loving Day in commemoration of this decision. 
   Indeed, the Supreme Court's opinion forcefully rejected the argument employed by Leon Bazile, the trial judge of the case, who defended his decision convicting the Lovings as part of God's plan. Unfortunately, after 40 years, similar types of arguments are still being employed by a few to deny full marriage equality to everyone. 
   In commemorating the legacy of Loving v. Virginia in ending the ban on interracial marriage in the United States, H. Res. 431 reaffirms the Loving court's recognition that marriage is one of the ``basic civil rights of man'' at the heart of the 14th amendment protections. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this timely resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, the matter before us today, the Iraq Supplemental, is before us for the first time. However, this is not the last time that we will vote on this bill. This bill will go to the Senate and from the Senate to a Conference Committee and from there back to the floor of this house. If the President exercises his veto power, we may ultimately vote on this matter as many as three or four times. 
   Today, I make no commitments about what I will do or how I will vote when this matter comes back to this house. How could I? I don't know what this bill will look like when it comes back ..... I don't know what it will say. Rather, I rise to explain how I will vote today, as this bill comes before this house for the first time. 
   It is clear to me that today, we have only two options. We can send to the Senate the bill before us, with binding language to end the war or, should this bill fail, we will send a bill that gives the President unchecked power to continue his misguided, mismanaged war without end. 
   That is the choice today. And my vote will be ``yes'' to advance the bill which begins to end the war. Reaching this decision has been difficult. My deliberation has been long and thoughtful. The difficulty of the decision may seem somewhat surprising given the rather stark description I just provided of the choice before us. However, there are several reasons why this decision has been hard. 
   First, the bill before us, despite its binding language to end the war, is far from perfect. It does not end the war soon enough. It mishandles the issue of Iraqi oil. It fails to address necessary safeguards to prevent this President from taking military action in Iran without Congressional authorization. The bill's shortcomings are reason enough for a no vote. 
   Second, until today ..... until this vote ..... I have played a different role. My job yesterday, and the day before (like so many war opponents) was to fight to make the language in this bill stronger and to make this legislation better. And having failed to accomplish all I sought to achieve provides me with another reason to vote no. 
   Third, until this day I have voted against all of the Iraqi war spending bills. I strongly favor using the power of the purse to end the war. That this binding language to end the war is attached to a war funding bill provided me with yet another reason to vote no. 
   Many on the left have invoked the words of Saul Alinsky in describing today's vote: ``..... I start from where the world is, as it is, not as I would like it to be,'' he says in his book Rules for Radicals. ``That we accept the world  as it is does not in any sense weaken our desire to change it into what we believe it should be--it is necessary to begin where the world is if we are going to change it to what we think it should be,'' Alinsky continues. So today we start where this congressional world is, with this imperfect bill as the vehicle to begin to end the war. 
   The choice is clear, today we can begin to end the war, or we can stand in the way of doing so. I will vote to end the war.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution expressing disapproval of the President's decision to escalate the war in Iraq. 
   During the past 4 years, I have embraced, stood by, and prayed with Wisconsin families as they said their last goodbyes to their brave sons and daughters and husbands and wives. Those fallen soldiers have served with the utmost loyalty and courage, trusting decision-makers in Washington, the President, his administration, and this Congress to do the right thing. Like almost all of my colleagues, I have visited with wounded troops at Walter Reed and at home and joined with families and communities to send troops off to war and to welcome them back home. All of them, all of them, the dead, the wounded, the deployed, the returned, and their families, deserve political leaders who will make decisions worthy of their enormous sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, we have fallen well short of that goal, and we will only honor their sacrifices when we acknowledge this and end the war. 
   I want to review just some of the things that we now know. We all know that this is a war of choice, not a war of necessity. We all know that Iraq posed no imminent danger to America that would justify what this administration called a ``preemptive'' war. We all know that Iraq had nothing to do with the tragic September 11 attacks that our Nation suffered. We know that few in the world stood with America as we undertook this nearly unilateral war. And we now know that our war in  Iraq has diverted our attention and our resources from efforts to combat terrorist threats to our Nation. 
   And beyond that, we know now that worldwide resentment of our military presence in Iraq has become a central recruiting tool for terrorist organizations worldwide. Therefore, we know that this war continues to make America less safe and more vulnerable. 
   What else do we now know? We now know that the planning and execution of this war was wrought with enormous miscalculations. We know that more than 3,000 American servicemembers have lost their lives in Iraq, and we know that between 56,000 and 61,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed since the war began. And based on polls released Monday, we know that 68 percent of Americans disapprove of the President's handling of this war. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was among the first group of House Members to speak out against the prospect of going to war in Iraq, and I voted against authorizing the use of force in Iraq; and as an early and consistent critic of the war, I understand the importance of offering a new course in Iraq. We must bring an end to our military occupation and replace it with a program of humanitarian relief, rebuilding political stabilization, and diplomatic engagement. We must participate in a robust regional diplomatic effort, including direct discussions with Syria and Iran, to promote stability in Iraq. And I think that this effort will be well received by Iraq's neighbors because regardless of whether these countries are close allies of the United States or not, Iraq's neighbors have more to gain if Iraq is stabilized and more to lose if it is not. 
   We must also heed the advice of many, including the Iraq Study Group, and acknowledge that other conflicts in the Middle East require our attention and leadership if the region is to achieve lasting stability. Therefore, we must also initiate a new push for Arab-Israeli peace. I believe that Congress has not only the right but the responsibility to assert its constitutional role as a co-equal branch of government in overseeing the conduct of this war and bringing it to an end. In doing so, I believe all options, including using the power of the purse, should be on the table. 
   The United States is the lone superpower in the world today. And along with that awesome power comes responsibility to humankind. America's reason for maintaining its superpower status must be to export the best of our democratic system of governance and the hope of the American Dream to the rest of the world. But these cherished ideals cannot be exported through force. We must teach and lead by example

We all know that Iraq had nothing to do with the tragic September 11 attacks that our Nation suffered. We know that few in the world stood with America as we undertook this nearly unilateral war. We now know that our war in and occupation of Iraq has diverted our attention and our resources from our multi-faceted efforts to combat terrorist threats to our Nation and its allies. And beyond that, we now know (based upon last year's declassified intelligence estimates) that worldwide resentment of our military presence in Iraq has become a central recruiting tool for terrorist organizations worldwide to increase their ranks. Therefore, we know that this war continues to make America less safe and more vulnerable as long as it persists. 
   What else do we now know? We now know that the planning and the execution of the war following our invasion were wrought with enormous miscalculations. We now know that billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars have been lost or squandered through no-bid contracts, lack of accountability measures and lack of Congressional oversight under the previous Republican majority. We know that more than 3,000 American service members have lost their lives in Iraq. We know that between 56,000 and 61,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed since the war began. And, based on polls released Monday, we know that 68 percent of Americans disapprove of the President's handling of the war in Iraq and 72 percent of Americans believe that things are going badly in Iraq. 
   The situation in Iraq today has variously been called an all-out civil war or more simply a state of chaos. 
   For years many Americans, including many members of this Congress from both parties, gave this war a chance. It is time for 
   this administration to give peace a chance. It is time for the President to pay attention to the vast yet still growing majority of Americans that want us to get out of Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was among the first group of House Members to speak out against the prospect of going to war in Iraq. I voted against authorizing the use of force in Iraq, and as an early and consistent critic of the war, I understand the importance of offering a new course in Iraq. Many of my colleagues have introduced bills that would redeploy our troops in a responsible manner within a reasonable time frame, while focusing on aggressive diplomatic efforts to stabilize the Middle East. A number of these bills and resolutions establish concrete benchmarks for the Iraqi government. It is long overdue for this Administration to start paying attention to these alternative proposals, that chart a new course in Iraq. I believe that we must redefine our mission in Iraq. We must bring an end to our military occupation and replace it with a program of humanitarian relief, political stabilization,and diplomatic engagement. We must participate in a robust regional diplomatic effort, including direct discussions with Syria and Iran, to promote stability in Iraq. And I think that effort would be well received by all Iraq's neighbors, because regardless of whether these countries are close allies of the United States, or not, Iraq's neighbors have more to gain if Iraq is stabilized and more to lose if it is not. 
   We must also heed the advice of many, including the Iraq Study Group, and acknowledge that other conflicts in the Middle East require our attention and leadership, if the region is to achieve lasting stability. Therefore, we must also initiate a new push for Arab-Israeli peace. 
   I believe Congress not only has the right, but the responsibility, to assert its constitutional role as a co-equal branch of government in overseeing the conduct of this war and bringing it to an end. Our Constitution explicitly authorizes Congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies. If Congress is given the power to make wars, we must also exercise our power to end wars. In doing so, I believe all options, including using ``the power of the purse,'' should be on the table. 
   The United States is the lone superpower in the world today. Along with that awesome and unprecedented power comes responsibilities to humankind. America's reason for maintaining her superpower status must be to export the best of our democratic system of governance and the hope of the American Dream to the rest of the world. But these cherished ideals can't be exported through force. We must teach and lead by example. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I support the resolution, I strongly believe Congress needs to do more to represent the will of the people and pursue all options that would lead to an end to this occupation and this war.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (PROVIDING FOR CONCURRENCE BY HOUSE WITH AMENDMENTS IN SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 797, DR. JAMES ALLEN VETERAN VISION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Filner. 
   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 855, the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act that I introduced earlier this year. This bill fixes an inequity in the current paired organ statute that has resulted in a denial of appropriate disability compensation to blinded veterans. 
   Congress has rightly recognized that some human organs or limbs are designed to work in pairs: legs, hands, kidneys, lungs, ears and, of course, eyes. In the instance of eyes, blindness in one eye profoundly affects depth perception even if sight is fully retained in the other eye. The paired organ statute was written to assist those veterans who experience a service-connected loss of a paired organ or limb. The statute recognizes the interdependency of paired organs and endeavors to treat the combined disability created by a nonservice-connected loss, injury or degeneration of the remaining paired organ or limb as though it was the result of a service-connected disability. In general, the paired organ statute accomplishes this task, with the exception of its treatment of eyes and loss of sight. 
   I want to share with you the story of Dr. James Allen, after whom this legislation is named. Dr. Allen is a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine in my district. He has worked at the Veterans Affairs Hospital for 33 years and treated numerous eye patients, including veterans who are blind. 
   One example is Mr. Donald May. Don is a World War II veteran who lost his right eye in a hand grenade explosion. A few years ago, Mr. May became legally blind in the nonservice-connected left eye. He applied to the Department of Veterans Affairs for help and was denied further benefits. He was told that the current law in regard to paired organs did not apply to him, even though he was legally blind in his service-connected right eye. 
   After Dr. Allen brought the plight of his patients to my attention, I began to research why these veterans were being denied the benefits I felt they deserved, benefits that I believe Congress intended to grant them. Through my work with the Blinded Veterans Association, we discovered that while the current paired organ statute covers blindness, in practice few, if any, veterans have ever been able to qualify for such compensation. 
   In theory, the statute provides that a veteran who is service-connected for blindness in one eye could qualify for additional disability compensation if they become blind in the remaining eye for nonservice-connected reasons. However, the statute does not define the term ``blindness,'' nor is any provision made for impairment of vision in the nonservice-connected eye short of blindness. 
   Rather than using visual acuity of 20/200 or loss of field of vision to 20 degrees as the definition of legal blindness that has been adopted by all 50 States and the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs uses a much more restrictive definition, 5/200, as a rating for legal blindness, which in rough layman's term is the equivalent of having an eye with light perception only. As a result, few, if any, blinded veterans are able to qualify for additional compensation under the paired organ statute. 
   H. Res. 855, the Dr. James Allen Veterans Vision Equity Act, fixes this problem. It defines blindness as impairment of vision where the impairment is to a visual acuity of 20/200 or less or of a peripheral field loss of vision of 20 degrees or less. This change in the law would only affect a small percentage, estimated to be roughly 5 percent of the 13,000-plus veterans who are service-connected for loss of vision in one eye. Yet such a change would send a powerful message that our Nation's blinded veterans and the hardships that they have faced are not forgotten. 
   Indeed, our Nation's blinded veterans face significant challenges in the labor market. The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research found that for individuals with visual impairments, to the extent that they are unable to read letters, the employment rate is only 30.8 percent, compared to 82.1 percent for those without disability. 
   I want to mention that this resolution complies with the PAYGO rules. The costs associated with H. Res. 855 are fully offset. This bill directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to match and compare VA needs-based pension benefits data, parents' dependency and indemnity compensation data, health care services data and unemployability compensation data with the National Directory of New Hires maintained by DHHS, for the purpose of determining eligibility for such benefits and services. According to the GAO, such data matching will help reduce fraud and abuse within the VA system as it determines eligibility and benefits to those veterans thought to be unemployable but are indeed working. 
   I would like to just thank Chairman Filner, Subcommittee Chairman John Hall, as well as Congressmen John Boozman and Vic Snyder for their unwavering support of this bill. I also want to thank the staff of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for their help in advancing this legislation. 
   H. Res. 855 is a modest but important step in restoring fair treatment to those veterans blinded due to their service to our country and to further our commitment to them. Their sacrifices and their service to this Nation should be matched by our desire to improve the quality of life for them and their families. 
   Earlier this year, the Blinded Veterans Association had found over 200 soldiers returning from Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom who are blinded in one eye due to their service-related injuries. They could be benefited in the future by this legislation. 
   I strongly encourage all my colleagues to support H. Res. 855.

   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to honor the hundreds of thousands of American students across the country who will participate in the National Day of Silence this Friday to call attention to anti-LGBT name-calling, bullying, and harassment in their schools. 
   By taking a vow of silence, students from more than 5,000 middle and high schools will call attention to hate-motivated harassment faced by individuals in school and in work, and they will work toward improving their school climate. 
   This year's event will be held in memory of Lawrence King, an 8th-grade student who was shot and killed on February 12 by a classmate because of his sexual orientation and gender expression. Larry's death is an unnecessary reminder of what we already know: lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students continue to face pervasive harassment and victimization in schools. 
   As students use their silence to demand schools are safe for all students, it is my hope we in Congress use our voices to ensure that it will be so.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 797, the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act. 
   This bill fixes an inequity that has resulted in the denial of appropriate disability compensation to blinded veterans. 
   I wanted to share, first of all, the story of Dr. James Allen after whom  this legislation is named. Dr. Allen is a distinguished, caring professor of ophthalmology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine. He has worked at our veterans hospital for nearly 33 years and treated countless eye patients, including many veterans who are blind. 
   One such patient is a Mr. Donald May. Don is a World War II veteran who lost his right eye in a hand grenade explosion. A few years ago, Mr. May began losing vision and ultimately became legally blind in his other nonservice-connected eye. He applied to the Department of Veterans Affairs for help, but was denied further benefits. He was told that the current law in regard to paired organs did not apply to him even though he was legally blind in both his service-connected right eye and his nonservice-connected left eye. 
   After Dr. Allen brought the plight of Don May and many other patients to my attention, I began to research why these veterans were being denied the benefits that I felt they deserved, benefits that I believed Congress intended to grant them. Through my work with the Blinded Veterans Association, we discovered that while the current paired organ statute covers blindness in theory, in practice few if any veterans have been able to qualify for the additional disability compensation under its terms. 
   Congress has rightly recognized that some human organs and limbs are designed to work in pairs: our legs, our kidneys, our lungs, our ears, and of course our eyes. In the instance of eyes, blindness in one eye profoundly affects depth perception, even if sight is fully retained in the other eye. 
   The paired organ statute was written to assist those veterans who experience a service-connected loss of a paired organ or limb. This statute recognizes the interdependency of paired organs, and endeavors to treat the combined disability created by a nonservice-connected loss and injury or degeneration of the remaining paired organ or limb as though it, too, were the result of a service-connected disability. In general, the paired organ statute accomplishes this task except its treatment of loss of sight. 
   With regard to eyesight, the statute does not adequately define the term blindness, nor is any provision made for the impairment of vision in the nonservice-connected eye short of blindness. 
   Rather than using a visual acuity of 20/200 or a loss of field of vision 20 degrees, as is the definition of legal blindness that has been adopted by all 50 States and the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs uses a much more restrictive 5/200 rating for legal blindness. I was asked to describe exactly what that 5/200 means. Really, in layman's terms, it is the equivalent to having light perception only, but the specific definition is somebody with the ability to see at 5 feet what most of the rest of us could see at 200 feet. 
   As a result, few if any blinded veterans are able to qualify for additional compensation under the paired organ statute.     
   H.R. 797, the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act, fixes this problem. It defines blindness as impairment of vision where the impairment is to a visual acuity of 20/200 or less or a peripheral field loss of 20 degrees or less. This change in the law would only affect a small percentage, estimated to be roughly 5 percent, of the 13,000-plus veterans who are service-connected for loss of vision in one eye. 
   Yet, such a change would send a powerful signal to our Nation's blinded veterans that their hardships are not forgotten. Indeed, our Nation's blinded veterans face significant challenges in the labor market. 
   The National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research found that for individuals with visual impairments, to the extent they are unable to read letters, that the employment rate is only 30.8 percent compared to 82.1 percent for people without disabilities. Given this employment trend, and the unique socioeconomic experiences of our veterans, it is even more urgent that Congress correct this one last inequity in the current paired organ statute and address the life-altering impact of blindness on our veterans. 
   I want to mention also that in compliance with our pay-as-you-go rules, section 2 of H.R. 797 fully offsets the cost of additional vision benefits. It directs the Veterans Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to match and compare VA needs-based pension benefits data, parents' dependency and indemnity compensation data, health care services data and unemployment data with the National Directory of New Hires maintained by HHS for the purpose of determining eligibility for such benefits and services. According to the GAO, the General Accountability Office, such data-matching project would help reduce fraud and waste within the VA system as it determines eligibility and benefits to those veterans thought to be unemployable, but who are indeed working. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Filner, Subcommittee Chairman John Hall, as well as Congressman Boozman, Congressman Snyder and Congressman Miller for their unwavering support of this bill. I also want to thank the staff of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for helping advance this legislation. 
   H.R. 797 is a modest but very important step in restoring fair treatment to those blinded due to their service to our country and to further our commitment to them. Their sacrifices and service to this Nation should be matched by our desire to improve the quality of life for them and for their families. 
   I want to note that the Blinded Veterans Association has identified over 200 soldiers returning from Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom who are blinded in one eye due to service-related injuries and could perhaps in the future benefit from this legislation. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 797.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, in the United States, the law forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of a person's race, color, sex, religion or national origin. It forbids discrimination based on age or disability, perceived or real. These protections were not easy to achieve, but we are better for them. 
   Today, ENDA seeks to expand the law to prohibit job discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation, and my amendment would also include gender identity. 
   We have worked steadily over the years to rid our Nation of irrational hate and fear against gay and transgender Americans that too often results in violent hate crimes, ostracism, bullying and discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations or education. 
   Today, at least 282 cities and towns and 19 States across the country have protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation in both public and private sector jobs. And more than 93 local jurisdictions in 11 States have laws that include protections based on gender identity. 
   195 American businesses employing more than 8.3 million American workers have exemplary policies that protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender employees, consumers and investors; 58 percent of these firms provide employment protections on the basis of gender identity. 
   It is time for Congress to catch up to our communities and American businesses. Today we can strengthen our laws against discrimination in the workplace. 
   While gay and lesbian Americans are now out and accepted in record numbers, not everyone understands the issue of gender identity. Few understand how a person's body might not match their internal sense of gender.     
   This is not a new phenomenon. It is not a fad. And it is certainly not a reason to lose one's job. 
   Some have asked why it is essential to include protections for transgender Americans in this legislation. The answer is that this community shares a common history with the rest of the lesbian, gay, and bisexual community, a history of suffering, discrimination, and too often violence, just for being who they are. 
   The importance of nondiscrimination laws cannot be overstated. Substantively, they provide legal remedies and a chance to seek justice. Symbolically, they say that in America we judge our fellow citizens by their integrity, their character, their talents; and not their sexual orientation or gender  identity, race or religion, age or disability. 
   Irrational hate and fear have no place in our society. If we truly believe in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; if we truly want to protect the most vulnerable in our society; if we continue to profess that all men are created equal, then we must work towards achieving the American Dream for all, and not just for some. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. My amendment reflects my belief that we should be acting on an inclusive ENDA, covering both sexual orientation and gender identity. Now, those of us in politics know that it is much easier to protect a provision in a bill from removal on the floor than it is to add a provision to a bill once it has been reported out of committee. This amendment is no exception to that rule. But while I believe that a roll call vote on this amendment would demonstrate strong support for an inclusive ENDA, I believe that it will fall short of adoption. 
   People have asked why I pressed for and insisted upon bringing an amendment to the floor and maintaining the option to withdraw it without a vote. The reason is simple: I believe that those who will be left behind by this bill deserve to hear on this House floor that you are not forgotten and our job will not be finished until you too share fully in the American Dream. 
   So at the moment at which the closing arguments are made, I will withdraw this amendment with a commitment to my colleagues and all Americans committed to equality of opportunity and ending discrimination that I will do everything within my power to make this measure whole again.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (CRANE CONSERVATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Thank you, Chairwoman Bordallo, for recognizing me today. 
   I rise today in support of the Crane Conservation Act of 2008, legislation to help protect and preserve the world's 15 species of cranes for generations to come. Cranes are the most endangered family of birds in the world, with 11 of the world's 15 crane species at risk of extinction. Their special characteristics and unique ability to bring people together across cities, States, and international boundaries places them in a class worthy of our conservation efforts. 
   Cranes are revered throughout the world for their beauty, grace, and long-distance migrations, frequently spanning numerous countries. In fact, their appeal is so vast that they figure prominently in the culture, folklore, and art of many people around the world. They are featured in the silks, sculpture, poetry, and folk tales of many cultures. And, because of their long life spans, they have become symbols of longevity and good fortune. 
   These magnificent birds have served as ambassadors of harmony and peace in the international arena. Representatives from nations with various political struggles have reached beyond the instability to address the conservation of cranes. In fact, just about a year ago, representatives from bordering nations, including India, China, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and others, met in an attempt to overcome strained relations and send a message of goodwill for the sake of protecting this threatened species. Similarly, African nations which share troubled borders have also joined together in recent years to stop the illegal trade of cranes. 
   In North America, the whooping crane is the rarest of the crane species. Back in 1941, only 21 whooping cranes existed in the entire world. Today, there are almost 400 birds in existence. The resurgence is attributed to the birds' tenacity for survival and to the efforts of conservationists in the United States and Canada. In fact, since 2001, coordinated efforts have focused on encouraging young whooping cranes to migrate from their breeding grounds in Wisconsin's Necedah National Wildlife Refuge to their winter destination in Florida. In an effort to reintroduce migratory flocks into their historic range in the eastern United States, the recovery team used ultralight aircraft to train and lead the young cranes on their spectacular journey stretching from city to city and State to State. Fortunately, these efforts have been successful, and the Crane Conservation Act would complement them, both domestically and internationally. 
   The bill will provide the resources to support initiatives to protect cranes and their habitats, which have deteriorated due to industrial development, pollution, and other human disturbances, including wars. 
   The bill will also provide the means for the United States to fulfill various international obligations and commitments, thus having a large environmental and cultural impact across the globe. Additionally, the Crane Conservation Act will provide resources for the United States to bring people and governments around the world together to protect ecosystems, develop adequate habitats, and encourage overall goodwill. Specifically, the Crane Conservation Act will authorize up to $5 million per year to be distributed in the form of conservation project grants to protect cranes and the wetlands and grassland ecosystems on which they depend. 
   Congress has passed similar bills in support of globally significant and endangered wildlife species, including tigers, rhinos, elephants, and neotropical migratory birds. And just as these efforts took significant steps in international wildlife conservation, the Crane Conservation Act would play a similar and promising role in improving endangered wildlife and their habitats. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the Crane Conservation Act.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
    Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. 
    All Americans deserve access to affordable, comprehensive health care--to meet both their physical and mental needs. I believe that Americans should be provided comprehensive coverage for mental health services. Mental illness and substance abuse are real and treatable health problems--just like hypertension, cancer and heart disease; yet millions of hardworking men and women still find that their health plans place strict limits on coverage for mental health benefits. 
    I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 1424. This bill will finally provide for equity in coverage of mental health and substance-related disorders. 
    We know all too well the inequities that currently exist for those seeking mental health care and substance-related care. They are subjected to higher co-payments, higher deductibles, and more restrictive treatment limits. 
    I have heard hundreds of heart-wrenching stories from my constituents in Wisconsin about the effects that these inequities have had on their families. 
    One woman's story was especially poignant about the inequities of the current system. In the same year, both her husband and her daughter required major medical care because of life-threatening conditions. One had a disease of the kidneys, and one suffered from severe clinical depression. Both patients required emergency visits and extended treatment. Both patients were compliant and followed their doctor's treatment instructions. Both patients were covered under the same family policy. 
    But the insurance paid for twice as much of the costs associated with the kidney disease than they did for the severe depression, because depression is a mental illness. 
    And while her husband underwent multiple treatments for his kidney disease, her daughter was told after a few psychiatric visits that her insurance would not pay anything toward further visits because she had used up her allotted number of visits for the year. 
    These higher patient costs and treatment limits are unconscionable. I am delighted that H.R. 1424 will require equity in financial commitments and equity in treatment limits for mental health and substance-related disorders as compared to medical and surgical benefits. In addition, it will prohibit discrimination by diagnosis and provide Americans with the same mental health coverage that Members of Congress have. 
    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 1424.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman for his courtesy in yielding me time. 
   In lieu of offering an amendment this evening, I appreciate the opportunity to briefly share with Members a concern regarding the education title of this bill. I have learned that taxpayer dollars in this bill, combined with taxpayer dollars at the State and local level, are used to purchase textbooks printed and manufactured in countries that censor these teaching materials. 
   Madam Chairman, one of the consequences of outsourcing to cheaper labor sources overseas is that an increasingly large number of American textbooks and educational materials are printed overseas, especially in China, a country which the State Department's 2006 Country Report on Human Rights concludes actively censors all publications. 
   The State Department's Human Rights report reads, ``By law, only government-approved publishing houses are permitted to print books. The State Press and Publications Administration controls all licenses to publish. The Chinese Communist Party exerts control over the publishing industry by preemptively classifying certain topics as off limits.'' 
   In addition, ``the government does not respect academic freedom and increases controls on political and social discourses at colleges, universities, and research institutes.'' 
   Madam Chairman, the Chinese Government is forcing the same censorship on American students and teachers, and let me just explain how this happens. 
   An American publishing company develops a textbook or any educational material and decides to print it overseas because they can save on printing costs by doing so. But the material content will be censored by the government-sanctioned publishing houses to conform to Chinese requirements. The Dalai Lama, Tiananmen Square, and balanced discussions of Tibet, political freedoms and descriptions of democratic participation and public protest will intentionally be left on the cutting room floor. 
   And then a well-meaning, well-prepared unsuspecting teacher or school district buys this textbook for their classroom, a textbook which contains no mention of the Dalai Lama and a decidedly altered discussion of politics and culture, even American politics and culture because Chinese censorship laws do not discriminate between Chinese and American texts and contexts. 
   And ultimately public funds meant to educate our children are simultaneously suppressing human rights and freedoms, and limiting exposure and curriculums on important topics of history, politics and culture. 
   The same situation exists, with far more harmful consequences, for teacher manuals because if a lesson does not exist in the teacher's curriculum, chances are that the students won't be taught that lesson. 
   Madam Chairman, the lesson that our students truly need to learn, and which must not be censored, is that State-sponsored censorship should not be supported with public dollars. I hope that my colleagues will join me in future efforts to teach our schoolchildren that ethics and morals and their education are more important, and more valuable, than cheap labor and production costs. 
   Again, I thank Chairman Obey for the courtesy of yielding this time.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Studies show that 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men will be a victim of rape or attempted rape in their lifetime and that, on average, a person is sexually assaulted in the United States every 2 1/2 minutes. In my State of Wisconsin, there were 5,628 sexual assaults reported in the year 2004, the last year statistics are available. This marks a 3.7 percent increase from the previous year. Nationwide, we know that children and young adults are most at risk. Forty-four percent of sexual assault victims are under the age of 18, and 80 percent are under the age of 30. 
   Although most victims are younger women, the effects of sexual assault cross all racial, social, religious, ethnic, and economic boundaries. Whether the crime is rape, incest, child sexual abuse, stalking, or sexual harassment, sexual assault impacts our schools, our workplaces, our streets, and our homes. Survivors are our sons, our daughters, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our grandparents. 
   In addition to the physical effects of victimization, the emotional scars felt by sexual assault survivors may persist long after the physical scars have healed. Sexual violence costs an estimated $127 billion per year in medical expenses, lost productivity, treatment of psychological trauma, and pain and suffering. Yet we know that only 41 percent of sexual assault survivors pursue prosecution by reporting their attack to law enforcement officials, and despite the support services offered by the National Sexual Assault Hotline and more than 1,000 crisis centers across the Nation, fewer than 50 percent of survivors ever tell anyone about their experience. These statistics are staggering and unconscionable. Despite the alarming prevalence of sexual assault, there is a clear and significant need for more public education and awareness. 
   National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month does just this. Observed each year in April, this dedicated month provides a special opportunity to educate Americans about sexual violence and to encourage the prevention of sexual assault, the improved treatment of its survivors, and the prosecution of its perpetrators. 
   As part of the National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we recognize national and community organizations, as well as private sector supporters, for their work in promoting awareness about sexual assault. We also applaud public safety, law enforcement, and health professionals for their hard work and innovative strategies to increase the percentage of sexual assault cases that result in the prosecution and incarceration of offenders. 
   Along with my colleague, Congressman TED POE from Texas, I introduced House Concurrent Resolution 330 to recognize April 2008 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. By supporting this resolution, we highlight the efforts of individuals and agencies that provide rape crisis intervention and prevention services. We also call attention to sexual violence as a major public health issue and raise awareness of the need for increased resources for preventing sexual violence. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to quickly extend my thanks to a number of advocates for their work on sexual assault prevention. In Wisconsin, we are incredibly lucky to have the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault working to create the social change necessary to end sexual violence. My thanks to the Coalition and their member organizations across the State for the important work that they do. 
   Since the first national observance of Sexual Assault Awareness Month in 2001, many Members of Congress have been actively involved in ensuring congressional support for efforts to raise awareness around sexual violence. I wholeheartedly thank all the cosponsors of this bipartisan resolution for once again lending their names to this worthy cause. 
   Finally, I want to extend my sincerest thank you to my colleague, Congressman TED POE, for his strong support as the lead sponsor of this resolution. Mr. Poe has been a dedicated advocate for victims and victims' rights in this Congress, and I have very much admired his commitment to ending sexual violence in all forms. Thank for your hard work and leadership on this resolution. 
   Although we have made significant progress, we still have far to go in eradicating the harm inflicted on our community by sexual assault. I urge all of my colleagues to fully support this resolution recognizing the National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CHAMP Act, and our chairmen who have worked so hard to craft this bill deserve great credit. It is a very strong measure. 
   There are many reasons to support this bill, but chief among them is the fact that this bill will provide health care coverage for an additional 5 million low income children, bringing the total to 11 million insured infants and children covered under SCHIP. This represents real progress at reducing America's 46.6 million uninsured people, and I am proud to support this progress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am also proud to note that the CHAMP Act does not pit children against seniors, as has been suggested by many of the Republicans, but instead works to improve health care for both children and seniors. 
   The bill includes many investments in Medicare that will directly benefit the health of our seniors. The bill includes a physician fix so that our doctors will not be subjected to the harsh 10 percent scheduled cut in reimbursement, and, providing this fix will ensure that beneficiaries have continued access to their physicians. 
   In addition, this bill provides many more protections to Medicare beneficiaries by expanding and improving the programs which ensure that Medicare remains affordable to those with lower income. The CHAMP Act also expands access to preventative benefits and mental health benefits for all Medicare seniors. 
   But back to my first point. If this Congress stands for anything, it should stand for children, for providing them with comprehensive health care, for giving them the support and care they need for a healthy life.  
   I am reminded of the first day of this session when Speaker Pelosi invited all the children to join her at the podium. This Congress should be judged based on how we protect our Nation's children. That is this vote.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, the House today has a historic opportunity to expand upon the principles of equal rights and equal protection embodied in our Constitution by passing the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. 
   This Act would offer Federal protections for victims of hate crimes targeted because of their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. These characteristics are included in this hate crimes legislation, not because they deserve any special protection as opponents of this legislation claim, but because of the history of particularly heinous and violent crimes committed against individuals based on such characteristics. That's what warrants this inclusion. 
   I wanted to share several stories about why this legislation is so important. I only have time for one. Let us never forget the story of Matthew Shepard, who was brutally attacked by his hateful, homophobic assailants and left to die on a fence in a remote area of Wyoming. 
   Matthew's death generated international outrage by exposing the violent nature of hate crimes and its horrific effect on the entire targeted commune. The sponsors of the Senate hate crimes legislation have renamed the bill the Matthew Shepard Act. Today we have been joined by Matthew's mother, Judy Shepard and a lead investigator in this case, David O'Malley, who are still courageously advocating for the passage of this legislation more than 8 years after Matthew's death. 
   The passage of hate crimes legislation is long overdue. This will be critical for both symbolic and substantive reasons. The legal protections are essential to our system of ordered justice and essential for ensuring that those who commit heinous crimes are punished. But on a symbolic basis, it is important for Congress to enunciate clearly that hate-based violence targeting women, gays, lesbians, transgender individuals and people with disabilities will no longer be tolerated.  
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman CONYERS, Chairman SCOTT, and the staff of the Judiciary Committee for their diligent work in bringing the bill to the floor. 
   Hate crimes are different than other violent crimes because they seek to instill fear into a whole community--be it burning a cross in someone's yard, the burning of a synagogue, or a rash of aggravated batteries of people outside a gay community center. These are crimes motivated by prejudice and meant to send a message to society and others who  belong to the same category. This sort of domestic terrorism demands a strong, federal response because this country was founded on the premise that persons should be free to be who they are--without fear of violence. 
   I want to share with you a few reasons why the passage of this legislation is so urgent and necessary. Last week in Committee, we heard from a very young man, Mr. David Ritcheson, who was brutally beaten last year by two individuals due to his ethnicity as a Mexican-American. Mr. Ritcheson spent the next 3 months and 8 days in the hospital, recovering from severe internal injuries. Yet because the attack took place in a private yard rather than an area of public access, the FBI had no grounds to investigate the attack under existing hate crimes laws. 
   The story of Brandon Teena also demonstrates the need for this legislation. Dramatized in the movie ``Boys Don't Cry,'' Brandon was raped and later killed after the discovery of his biological gender by two acquaintances. Five days before his murder, Brandon reported his rape and beating by the same perpetrators, but the Richardson County Nebraska Sheriff would not pursue the case against Brandon's attackers. 
   Let us never forget the story of Matthew Shepard, who was brutally attacked by his hateful homophobic assailants and left to die on a fence in a remote area of Wyoming. Matthew's death generated international outrage by exposing the violent nature of hate crimes and its horrific effect on the targeted community. I remember the impact locally in Wyoming. I was in the midst of my first campaign for Congress in October 1998. Many gay and lesbian youths roughly Matthew's age were working on my campaign. I remember the impact of the crime on them. They were afraid for their safety, and that is precisely the effect these crimes have. The sponsors of the Senate hate crimes legislation have renamed the bill the 
   Matthew Shepard Act, and today we are joined by Matthew's mother Judy Shepard and the lead investigator in his case David O'Malley, who are still courageously advocating for the passage of this legislation more than 8 years after Matthew's tragic death. Mr. Speaker, the passage of hate crimes legislation is long overdue. 
   The passage of H.R. 1592 today will be critical for both substantive and symbolic reasons. The legal protections are essential to our system of ordered justice and essential for ensuring that those who commit these heinous crimes are punished ..... but on a symbolic basis, it is important for Congress to enunciate clearly that hate-based violence targeting women, gays and lesbians, transgender individuals, and people with disabilities will no longer be tolerated. 
   The opponents of this legislation will disseminate a lot of misinformation today in order to derail this bill. But make no mistake, the legislation we are considering today has been carefully crafted to protect an individual's First Amendment right to speech, expression, and association. It also provides much needed federal resources to local law enforcement authorities without usurping local authority. Finally, the bill is fully consistent with Supreme Court precedence on both First Amendment and interstate commerce cases. 
   Our society is not perfect; the passage of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act will not make all hate crimes go away. H.R. 1592 is about giving state, local, and federal law enforcement authorities the necessary resources and tools to combat violent crimes based on prejudice and intended to terrorize a group of people or an entire community. Such hate crimes are in desperate need of a federal response, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3406, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments Act. 
   This vital legislation restores the civil rights protections that Congress intended for people with disabilities in passing the ADA in 1990. In the years since passage of the ADA, courts--including the U.S. Supreme Court--have narrowed the protective reach of this law, undermining Congress' intent. It is flatly unacceptable that Americans who experienced disability-based discrimination have been denied protection of the ADA and barred from challenging discriminatory conduct. This bill is an important and necessary remedy, and I'm grateful to our champions in the House, Mr. HOYER and Mr. SENSENBRENNER, as well as Senator HARKIN and others who shepherded the ADA Amendments Act through the Senate. 
   Importantly, the ADA Amendments Act addresses the restrictive interpretation of what it means to have a ``disability'' and therefore be protected against disability discrimination. In Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, the Supreme Court ruled that the definition of disability must be read ``strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled'' and, to meet the definition, an individual must have an impairment that ``prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives.'' 
   Due to that and other narrow court interpretations, people with HIV who have been fired, not hired, or suffered other adverse employment actions have been denied the protections of the ADA. Although the ADA clearly intended to protect people living with HIV from being discriminated against based on having HIV, many have had their lawsuits derailed by disputes over whether they meet a narrowly interpreted definition of the term ``disability.'' For people living with HIV, all too often whether or not they could proceed with their discrimination claim has turned on the court's view of evidence as to their child-bearing ability and intentions: highly personal, intimate matters that are completely unrelated to the discrimination they experienced. 
   The ADA Amendments Act remedies the courts' misinterpretation of the ADA by explicitly stating that the definition of ``disability'' must be interpreted broadly to achieve the ADA's remedial purposes, by clarifying the definition of ``disability'' through examples of ``major life activities,'' and by providing that the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity must be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. Of significance for people living with HIV, among the listed examples of ``major life activities'' are ``functions of the immune system,'' as well as ``reproductive functions.'' Under these new provisions, many individuals who were incorrectly denied coverage under the ADA will now be protected from discrimination. Some examples follow: 
   Rubin Cruz Carrillo was fired from his job as a flight attendant 1 day after he told his employer that he had been diagnosed with HIV and asked to speak with his supervisors about this under ``strict confidentiality.'' Because he was fired immediately after disclosing his HIV 
   status, Rubin believed that the airline terminated him because of his disability and filed suit under the ADA. To show that his HIV infection ``substantially limits'' a ``major life activity,'' Rubin explained that he decided not to have children because of the risk of infecting his female partner or their resulting child through unprotected sexual intercourse. The trial judge discounted his testimony, saying that Rubin was ``not an expert in the medical field of immunology or reproduction.'' The court concluded that Rubin had not established that he had a ``disability'' because he failed to introduce medical evidence that HIV substantially limits a man's ability to reproduce. Therefore, the court ruled Rubin was not entitled to the protections of the ADA. 
   In contrast, another judge on the same Federal district court found that a female with HIV was entitled to ADA protection. Yesenia Rodriguez alleged that she was discharged  from an assignment because she had HIV. The court found that she was ``disabled'' under the meaning of the ADA, based on her testimony that she decided not to have more children due to the possibility of transmitting HIV to her child if she did. 
   Other courts have granted summary judgment for employers (dismissing discrimination claims) on the grounds that the employee with HIV did not establish that his HIV was a ``disability.'' For example, Fabio Gutwaks'' discrimination claim was dismissed after the court concluded that he had failed to establish that he was substantially limited in the major life activity of reproduction because he testified that he did not currently, or previously, desire to father children. Similarly, Albenjamin Blanks' claim was dismissed after he testified that he and his wife had decided not to have any more children long before the discriminatory conduct occurred and that his wife had undergone a procedure to prevent her from having any more children. 
   The ADA was meant to prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities. Yet, many people with HIV have been denied coverage under the ADA and therefore left without any legal recourse against discrimination. Under the ADA Amendments Act, these men and women will all be assured legal protection for discrimination based on their HIV status, irrespective of their child-bearing intentions or lack of expert testimony about HIV's impact on child-bearing. 
   By passing the ADA Amendments Act, we reaffirm the right for American workers--including any American living with HIV--to be judged based upon their skills, talents, loyalty, character, integrity and work ethic. I am pleased to support this bill to ensure that all Americans have a fair opportunity to work.

   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. 
   The scientific advancement that has been made in sequencing the human genome is groundbreaking. We have only just begun to understand how we can harness the vast amount of information that is included in our genetic code to benefit human health and longevity. The ability to predict disease will greatly increase our opportunities for early treatment and prevention efforts and this can have a real impact on people's lives. 
   So I am proud to support the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. This bill will provide strong protections to prevent employers and insurers from denying health coverage or job opportunities on the basis of predictive genetic information. Providing this protection will ensure that Americans are not unfairly penalized, either by health insurers or by employers, for something that is a part of their genetic makeup. In addition, these protections will encourage individuals to participate in genetic research, which will lead to new technologies and new therapies. 
   This important nondiscrimination protection is necessitated by the advancements in science, like the mapping of the human genome. And Congress is responsible for making sure that our laws keep up with these scientific advancements, so that we can fully realize the value of these discoveries. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of it.

But unfortunately, according to the Census Bureau, 47 million Americans are without health insurance. Millions more encounter a health care system that is inadequate in meeting their basic medical needs because they are underinsured. 
   According to a recent Commonwealth Foundation study, there are 16 million Americans who are underinsured, meaning their insurance did not adequately protect them against catastrophic health care expenses. That means that 63 million Americans, or one-in-five Americans, have either no health insurance, have only sporadic coverage, or have health insurance coverage that leaves them exposed to high health care costs. 
   Additionally, even those with health care coverage are faced with rising health care costs. As our economy continues to falter and the price of food and gas rises, high health care costs are straining more and more family budgets. The lack of affordable comprehensive health care affects every congressional district in the Nation. 
   To highlight this issue and the real impact that is being--that being uninsured has on the lives of Americans, I have reserved this time to share some of the letters that I have read in my office from constituents who have had difficulty in obtaining and affording comprehensive health care coverage. 
   Too often here in Congress, we speak of health care issues and the antiseptic jargon of policymakers and lawyers. We talk about Medicare Part D and insurance risk pools, but people across America are hurting. And these letters tell their stories in their own words. 
   I represent a district in south-central Wisconsin, and while the letters I read may be from Wisconsinites, they speak to the difficulties that people all over America face every day. 
   I'm going to start with a few letters about the ever-increasing price of health care. 
   Vickie in Beloit, Wisconsin, writes, ``I am a 51-year-old woman, and was recently in the hospital. I have no insurance and my bill was almost $22,000. I was unconscious when I was taken there by ambulance, so I didn't know they were going to run all of these tests which were going to be the biggest part of my bill. I really have no idea how I'm going to pay this. I inquired about health insurance about 6 months ago, and it was over $700 a month.'' 
   Ross in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, writes to me, ``I am 78 years old. My wife is 82. We have Medicare part A, B, and D and supplemental insurance. There is so much that is not covered that we spend ALL our Social Security on medical costs and stuff that Medicare doesn't cover, like hearing aids and dental bills. If we didn't have some income besides our Social Security, we would both be in a nursing home, but I am not sick.'' 
   Michael in Poynette, Wisconsin, writes that ``I am a Federal employee and a member of the Wisconsin Air National Guard. This past year we were granted a wage increase of roughly 2.3 percent. At the same time, the cost of our Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan benefit increased by up to 44 percent. Along with this, many of the co-pays also increased. This has put a tremendous strain on my colleagues in the Wisconsin Air National Guard, many who have been deployed three or more times in support of operations throughout the Middle East region.'' 
   Ed in Monroe, Wisconsin, writes, ``My wife and I live in the gap. Between our Social Security and the disability policy she had, we get too much money to qualify for help, but not enough to really get by. With the donut hole in Medicare D, we would only be able to get my wife's meds for three months if it were not for samples provided by her doctors. Four out of her 10 meds would take 65 percent of our total income if it were not for the help of that doctor. I live with chronic pain because of a cancer treatment, but as the years go by, it helps less and I have other medical problems that are gradually getting worse. I have a wife and a son that I have to take care of because neither can do it all for themselves. I am the one who battles with Social Security and the insurance companies. I have to deal with problems that arise with their medications, their finances and many day-to-day things. Every time I hear a politician talk about cutting Medicare and other programs for the elderly and disabled, it scares me to death because I am just hanging on by a thread.'' 
   Glen in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, writes, ``My wife and I are retired and are on Medicare and supplemental insurance with drug coverage through my former employer. Our monthly cost for both is about $1,050 a month. With next year's increase, it will take my whole monthly pension to pay for our health insurance. It's like an adjustable rate mortgage that only increases.'' 
   Sue in Beloit, Wisconsin, writes, ``My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. After treatment began, we found out that the insurance company had a small loophole for the treatment of cancer. Under our insurance, they have a $13,000 limit per year on radiation and chemotherapy. That amount did not even cover the first treatment of either radiation or chemo. I was not going to have my husband die for lack of treatment, so we started to use our savings and available credit to pay for  medical expenses. My husband later died. After having completely depleted our savings and facing insurmountable credit card debt, I had no choice but to file bankruptcy last year.''     
   Michelle in Middleton writes: ``My sister had been diagnosed with a possible brain tumor. She has a job with minimal pay and minimal insurance. It pays for the first $1,000 of medical costs per year and then the patient is to pay the next $5,000 before it kicks in again. She cannot afford this. She has already incurred the $1,000 of cost and bills are piling up. She has no idea how she will ever pay for all of the medical care she has needed and the stress is huge. Medical care should be a right of all. We all pay if prevention and early intervention don't happen.'' 
   Michelle brings up an important point in her letter because people without comprehensive health insurance are often not getting the care that they desperately need. A recent study released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that cost prevented 41.1 percent of uninsured adults from seeing a doctor that they needed to see. 
   Madam Speaker, I'd like to next focus on the connection between employment and health care. Only about 40 percent of businesses who employ low-wage or part-time workers offer health benefits. And at $11,480 per year, the average family's health insurance premium now costs more than a minimum-wage worker makes in a whole year. 
   And as we all know, the costs of health care are rising far faster than inflation. Between 2000 and 2006, health premiums for employer-sponsored insurance jumped 87 percent, far outpacing inflation's 18 percent overall increase over the same period of time. 
   Many of my constituents feel trapped. Either they cannot find jobs that offer good health care benefits, or they do have jobs that offer health insurance but they feel that they can't leave those jobs for fear of losing that health insurance. 
   Lisa in Beloit, Wisconsin, writes me. She says: ``My husband and I have been without insurance on and off for the last 8 months. My husband is diabetic and his insulin can run up to $500 a month, not to mention all the other medications he takes. Thank God for the VA and their assistance. So we are managing with his health issues, but I have not had any well-woman check-ups in a long time because I either had no insurance or the work I was doing, I couldn't get any time off to go to a doctor. I have made quite a few job changes in the last year to find the right fit for me, and I feel that I have finally found one, but my concern is that why do we have to suffer health-wise? Why do I have to rely on employers for benefits and be at their mercy, employment-wise, in order to obtain health care?'' 
   Carolyn from Madison, Wisconsin, writes: ``In 2002, I left my full-time job to pursue my dream of having my own business. Unable to afford COBRA, I looked around for affordable insurance with a high deductible. Imagine my surprise when five companies turned me down because of my controlled hypertension and 30 pounds overweight. I struggled for over a year, paying $150 a month for medication at the pharmacy. I developed extremely painful neuropathy in my feet and was unable to seek medical treatment for the condition because I had no insurance. So I just suffered, and I do mean suffered. After more than a year of endless suffering, I had no choice but to take a part-time job driving a school bus so that I could get health insurance. Eventually I had to give up my business because I no longer had the strength or energy to handle a growing business as well as a part-time job.'' 
   Frank in Madison, Wisconsin, writes: ``I'm a 42-year-old male who has diabetes. I cannot get private health care coverage due to my illness. Two years ago, I stepped out of a corporate job to start my own business to fulfill a dream. I was not prepared for the fact that I would not be able to purchase a private health care policy for myself, due to my preexisting condition of diabetes. After 2 years of self-employment and lack of adequate health care coverage, I have no choice but to let go of my dream to own my own business and go back to working for a corporation so I can again receive health care coverage.'' 
   Bonnie in Janesville, Wisconsin, wrote: ``I have, for years, had to be the one in our household, to maintain health insurance because my husband is self-employed. I could not take just any job I wanted. It was so nice when he turned 65 and was able to get Medicare. I was able to take a job that offered a plan for just singles. Since starting this job, I have had significant health issues. I have tried to keep working because I will be unable to find insurance and I can't afford the COBRA payments. I realize that there are people worse off. But I find it so difficult some days to have to come to work; if I work part-time, I would have no insurance to cover my health expenses.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the high cost of health care affects employers as well as employees. 
   Greg in Verona, who owns a small business, wrote me recently. He writes: ``Since 1998, we've been providing health care to our employees. Every year, we've had double-digit increases in our costs. This year, the insurance company has informed us that we'll be paying 42 percent more next year, which will lead to one of several eventualities: 
   ``1. We'll have to reduce what we cover as a benefit for our employees and hopefully retain them. Reality is, many will leave and we'll have trouble replacing them. 
   ``2. We'll eat the increase but offer no employee raises for the next 3 years. 
   ``3. We'll raise our prices and force customers to look elsewhere for the services that we currently provide them. 
   ``The very real possibility is we'll end up with some element of all of the scenarios and end up not being able to keep the doors open. Very scary thought when one considers that my business has been around for 55 years.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I also get many letters from constituents who are nearing 65 but are not yet eligible for Medicare. I'd like to share some of their stories with you, too. 
   Daniel in Madison, Wisconsin, writes: ``I am close to 57 and the combination of my disability and age are making work more difficult all the time. I have been thinking about retirement, but I found that if I do retire, I would lose my medical assistance that I count on for my medical needs. This is due to the fact that I would receive a small State pension. Pensions are considered unearned income, even though the pension was part of our compensation for working. One cannot have any unearned income and receive medical assistance. This seems very unfair. People with disabilities have a difficult time getting employed if they need benefits. Now I find it's just as hard to stop working and retain the needed medical benefits.'' 
   Marilyn in Oregon, Wisconsin, writes: ``Tammy, I am writing you this e-mail to let you know how frustrated I am with the health insurance coverage in this country, especially for people over 50. I recently lost my job. I did not reach my retirement age. I was only 2 years away. My husband and I have had to use our life savings to pay $700 a month for health insurance. I just received a letter that the premium is going to go up next year $60 a month. My only choice is to cancel, since we have used up almost all of our savings. My husband and I do not know what to do for health insurance anymore.'' 
   Charlotte in Baraboo, Wisconsin, writes: ``I am 54 years old and work 40 hours a week. A lot of jobs in our area have health care but might as well not offer any. It is really bad insurance. I know a lot of people in their 50s that have health problems that make it very hard for them to continue working, but they have to in order to have insurance for their health problems. Many of them would like to retire.'' 
   Madam Speaker, simply put, our health care system is failing and America knows this. Among the thousands of letters regarding health care that I receive, there is a common thread, a common theme that binds them together; and that common theme is an overwhelming frustration with a system they know just is not working and a call for those of us in Congress to take action. 
   Here are some more stories. Michael in Burlington, Wisconsin, writes: ``My late daughter was diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis and Gorham's vanishing bone disease in March 2005. We  found out how much a child with a terminal illness costs a person. My wife and I used every amount of credit and refinanced our house three times just to take care of her. Since her death, the bills mounted so bad that now we will have to file bankruptcy and we have already been foreclosed on our home. 
   ``Secondly, my wife was born with a hole in her heart. In 1972, the doctors repaired the hole. In doing so, through the blood transfusion they gave her hepatitis C. Now she is preexisting at 37 and can't get life insurance and has been repeatedly denied health care coverage. Her mental breakdown because of the death of our daughter left the insurance companies another reason not to let her have health care. This needs to change.'' 
   Sherry in Lake Delton, Wisconsin, writes: ``I live in a place where most jobs are low quality and low paying and don't offer health insurance benefits. I have had jobs on occasion that have offered insurance, but they have never lasted due to the fact that this area prefers to believe that you are not entitled to a life if you work here. In 1995, I gave birth to my first and only child. In my quest to find employment that would allow me to afford raising my child and pay enough for me to support her without working 18 hours a day, I met my future husband. I was employed when I sustained a work injury that went through on workman's comp. I was left with an injury that was never addressed and bills that workman's comp refused to pay. This injury has prevented me from even applying for better jobs, as the physical pain prevents me from performing many tasks that I have done in the past. My inability to bring a decent income to our home has created major stress on my husband. My marriage is falling apart daily due to health problems and my inability to support my husband. I tried to apply for Badger Care, Wisconsin's Medicaid program, and was told that we slightly exceeded the limits for a family of three, but if I was willing to leave my marriage and my home, that they would be more than happy to give me everything that was available. This just doesn't make any sense.'' 
   Cindy from Fitchburg, Wisconsin, writes: ``I was in a motorcycle accident in Wyoming in 2004. The driver lost control on a gravel road. I ended up on the bottom of a mountain. I was found unconscious and covered in blood. Unfortunately, the people I was with didn't take me to a hospital. It wasn't until I was driven back to Wisconsin that I was taken to a hospital. When I did go to the hospital, doctors told me I should have died. 
   ``My company where I worked had been sold just prior to this trip to Wyoming. I was supposed to start a new job when I returned. During that transition, I had just a few months without health insurance. I could not afford COBRA at $426 a month along with rent. 
   ``The ER in Wisconsin did a CAT scan and recommended that I follow up with my doctor. At this point, I had problems talking, walking, and was in a great deal of pain. I had to give up my apartment and move in with a friend. I was able to continue my health care with COBRA paying for it with my unemployment. But once my unemployment ended so did my ability to pay for health insurance. My savings and 401(k) are all gone. 
   ``My condition worsened without medical treatment. I had tried to get medical assistance, but was refused because I have no dependents and have not been diagnosed as terminal. I had applied for SSDI, which now takes 2 to 3 years for approval. 
   ``I have been left with no income, unable to work, no insurance, and no home. The doctors told me that it may be possible for me to work again, if I can resume my medical treatments. As of now, I have no chance.     
   ``With private health insurance or universal health care, I may have been taken to the hospital the night of the accident instead of being left to die. I would have gotten the treatment needed to prevent my brain from swelling, which caused further damage I may not have had today. 
   ``If there were a mandatory law that people had to carry vehicle insurance, it might have also helped. If SSDI didn't have a 2 or 3-year waiting list, I may be able to get the health care and finances now for me to get better and return to work. If there were some dollars set aside for people without insurance, would my GP have helped? 
   ``This can happen to anyone at any time. I was a homeowner, I had a professional career, and now I'm left without any help. I thought the United States was the richest Nation in the world. How can a human being be discarded?'' 
   Julie from Beloit, Wisconsin writes, ``I was just notified that my insurance company will be raising my house insurance by nearly $100 per year solely based on my credit report. Eight years ago, I had a sterling credit report; in fact, I was able to get a very low interest loan for the house that I bought because of it. Five years ago, I had a medical emergency which caused me to default on two credit cards and to create medical bills I have no hope of ever repaying. I had the choice between buying bandages and ointments, which are not covered by my insurance, for my legs or making my monthly credit card payments. I chose life. For as my doctors told me, I would have eventually lost my legs, if not my life, if I had not sought treatment. 
   ``I know it's legal for insurance companies to do this just as it is legal for businesses to do a credit report on potential employees, but that doesn't mean it's right. I can see the point, to some extent, if poor credit rating were caused by irresponsibility. What I do not get is why people whose sole financial error was to have a health care crisis should be penalized for it. 
   ``It does not take a rocket scientist to see that this will affect the poor, the elderly, and the disabled the most, who are often already either underinsured or uninsured. As for me, I will have to raise my deductible substantially and seriously consider filing for bankruptcy in the hopes of eventually improving my credit rating.'' 
   Eva from Madison, Wisconsin writes, ``I am contacting you in regards to my desperate need for public health care. I am a grad student. I recently sprained my ankle playing soccer and had to go to the emergency room for x-rays. My bill came out to $1,242.50 because I can only afford a measly insurance that has only catastrophic coverage. This is a ridiculous amount of money for such a visit, and it causes me to consider those less fortunate than me who have even more serious injuries and less familial support. This cost can truly make waves in the lives of people.'' 
   Suzanne from Stoughton, Wisconsin writes, ``It is time to have the government deal with health care. We are covered under COBRA, which will run out in March. The cost is going from $500 per month to $900 per month. We checked with Blue Cross, and they refused us coverage because of a preexisting condition. They will not even offer a waiver for this preexisting condition. We checked with the Wisconsin State Insurance Program, which will cover us for $1,200 a month. Please let people over 60 buy into Medicare. It is impossible to find a job that offers health insurance.'' 
   Silvia from Fitchburg, Wisconsin shared her story with me. Silvia was uninsured when she was hospitalized with the need for an appendectomy. Even after the hospital charity program reduced her bill, she still owed over $11,000 to the hospital. Sometimes bill collectors call her at home five times per day. Silvia chips away at the bills, sending $20 or $50 a month. 
   Roberta from Janesville, Wisconsin writes, ``I think the insurance bills for both medical and dental are horrendous. Both my husband and I work full-time with two small children, living paycheck to paycheck. My insurance costs have caused us many heartaches, with us owing more money than what needs to be paid. As a result, I will not get a needed medical procedure done. 
   ``Something drastically needs to change in the United States of America where hardworking individuals and families can get the treatment they need without going broke.'' 
   Patricia from Madison, Wisconsin writes, ``We need to fix health care. I have to choose between food, heat and medications. I have lost 80 pounds because of this. Please help.'' 
   Heather from Waterloo, Wisconsin writes, ``I am married. And together with my husband I own a home. We live a modest, middle class life, managing to always have what we need, except  health care. My husband has excellent health care at his job, but for me to also be covered by his plan we would need to pay nearly $400 per month. That is two-thirds as much as our home mortgage. 
   ``Through school, I have worked less and less in order to maintain health coverage. I have only been able to afford short-term major medical coverage. I am grateful that we can afford this, but it does make a difference. Even now, if I have a sore throat, I will wait a few days to see how I feel. I will wait because if I don't need to go, I certainly need to save the money. This is disturbing to me as a nursing student because I know the importance of early treatment and prevention. And it's upsetting to me as a person because I value my health. It's unacceptable to me as a citizen because I know there are other people just like me who wait and get sicker or can't take the medications that they need.'' 
   Brad from Mount Horeb, Wisconsin writes me, ``I write you today to urge you to take action on a growing crisis in America, health care. I strongly believe that we need a national health care plan to insure all Americans. 
   ``My major concern with the current system is when people attempt to obtain health insurance, insurance companies refuse them because of past health history. Let's face it, insurance companies are in business to make a profit. The best way to make a profit is to ensure the healthy so that you can minimize the claims you pay out, and not insure those who need medical care or who may potentially need medical care. 
   ``I am 38 years old with a family of four. I currently participate in a health savings account. For all practical purposes, I pay for all of my own medical needs, including the recent birth of our daughter. 
   ``I recently attempted to switch insurance providers. The insurance companies will insure me, but they will not insure my daughter for any type of treatment for her asthma for 3 years, along with no drug coverage for life. The policy I was requesting had a $10,000 deductible, yet they still refused coverage.'' 
   Lisa from Madison writes, ``I'm a very healthy person, and my husband and children are very healthy. We cannot get insurance. I think everyone should attempt to get an individual health insurance policy just to see how impossible it is. I'm not a risk, really, I am not. I am terrified right now because we are uninsured.'' 
   Carol from Madison, Wisconsin writes, ``As someone who has had no health insurance at all for 3 years, I can tell you that it was pretty miserable being one of the millions of people in this country without health insurance. Not long ago, my best friend died at age 42 because of ovarian cancer because she did not have health insurance and waited too long to see what was causing all of her symptoms. Yes, people in America actually die from not having health insurance.'' 
   Darla from Fitchburg, Wisconsin wrote, ``I lost my job because of unpredictable attendance due to my health issues. Upon losing my job, I signed up for COBRA. Last week I received a letter indicating my COBRA eligibility ends soon. In order for me to get health coverage, I would have to work at least 20 hours per week. My physicians believe that would do me more harm than good relating to my health issues. 
   ``If I do not get some kind of health insurance, I will need to stop all treatments, and I have no money to pay for doctor services. My prescription drugs will have to stop, as I will not be able to pay for them either. What can I do?'' 
   Kimberly from Madison writes, ``I'm writing today because of my family's frustration and anxiety over health care. Although we hear a lot of rhetoric about making health care more affordable and/or more available for Americans, nothing is happening, at least not soon enough. 
   ``My husband recently started his own business. Obviously it will take some time for his company to see any profits, much less income. In the meantime, we are without health insurance. I am 5 months pregnant, and we have a 2-year-old son. Because of my preexisting condition, we cannot buy affordable health coverage. COBRA would cost us $1,200 per month. I am currently applying for Medicaid and other forms of public assistance as a last resort. This is ridiculous. 
   ``As someone with no insurance, I wonder what could possibly be the problem with implementing a public health care system. Oh, I have heard the horror stories about having fewer choices in doctors, longer waiting lists for procedures, and less incentive among doctors and researchers to develop new techniques. But what's most frightening to me is the chance that my son might get sick or my baby might be born with expensive complications while we are uninsured. 
   ``I am not naive. I know that funding public health care is an issue. But is it wise to sacrifice the health and well-being of American citizens to avoid the challenge of implementing a change? I, for one, would be satisfied to pay more for goods and services if I could rest assured that my family's basic health care needs were being met.'' 
   David from Cross Plains, Wisconsin writes, ``My wife and I have been self-employed for over 18 years and have paid thousands of dollars for health insurance premiums. As of a few months ago, we had to drop out and are now without health insurance. The cost is completely out of reach; in fact, it's nuts. Now that I am 50 years old, it's not a matter of if I will ever have health problems, it's when. Tammy, we will lose everything we have ever worked for. So much for the American Dream. Now we look forward to dying broke and possibly homeless.'' 
   Victor from Stoughton, Wisconsin writes, ``My wife can only work part-time because of her health. Her employer offers a generic policy that costs $3.97 a week and requires no background check. This policy covers basically nothing. Medical supplies, check-ups, doctors visits necessary on a routine basis for my wife to survive are now not covered. My wife is uninsurable because of her health, and we have been turned down for health insurance that we have applied for. We cannot believe that this is happening to us.'' 
   Ronald from Deerfield, Wisconsin writes, ``I was on COBRA insurance for 3 years, which ended this past fall. I spent from March until September trying to get private insurance, but could not because of my neck injury. I was, in effect, looked at and dismissed by 33 private insurance companies because of my preexisting condition with my neck injury. Just imagine how you would feel after being dismissed by this many companies. I was finally insured through disability and Medicare. The sad reality of it is that if I want to try to work full-time again, I cannot, because in doing so, it would cost me the only insurance option I have left. 
   ``The truth is that many other countries can and do provide equitable health insurance to all of their citizens no matter what preexisting conditions they have or their ability to pay or what income level they have. I believe this country does have top-notch medical facilities, but not decent or equitable insurance for poor and middle-income families.''     
   Susan, from Baraboo, Wisconsin, writes, ``I'm writing you today regarding health insurance coverage for single people with no children. As of this time, I feel that I am left out of the loop in regards to this topic. I am 42, and last September, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. In January of this year, the company that I worked for informed us that they would be closing down. I was laid off in December while I was out due to my cancer treatments. I have been searching for health care everywhere because my COBRA will be going up, and I am on unemployment and am barely able to pay the $244.76 for the coverage now. I cannot get insurance because of the breast cancer. The high-risk insurance program in Wisconsin is too expensive for me to get coverage since they want 4 months of premiums up front, and they only cover some things. What are single people supposed to do? We don't qualify for any government assistance because we are single. We cannot go without insurance. There are no programs to help us out. So, when you are working on health care in the House of Representatives, please remember that there are other single people out there also in my shoes. I am at a crossroad because I have no avenue for assistance when it comes to health care. Come November, I will be unable to get coverage when I need it at this point in my life.'' 
   Janet from Portage, Wisconsin writes, ``I have a 53-year-old brother  who has psoriasis all over his body and arthritis that is caused by this. Three weeks ago, he fell and needs surgery on his shoulder to repair it. He has no job, no money and no insurance. We started looking for a program to help him. There are none that we can find. There is nothing to help him get his shoulder fixed, but after it heals wrong and he is disabled because of it, then there are programs to help him. They will not help get it fixed so he could find a good job. Instead, they would rather support him for the rest of his life instead of trying to help him now.'' 
   Gail from Janesville writes, ``My husband recently lost his job. He applied for over 100 positions only to be told that he lacked a college degree or he is overqualified or they can only pay $8 an hour. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in June of 1998 and again in 2003. I have gone through breast cancer twice and have undergone a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. COBRA has run out, and without a stable income, we cannot afford to pay the premiums of our own health care policy. My husband is 59 years old, and I am 58, and we have no medical coverage. I have looked at every insurance company and get turned down because of my medical history. All our lives we have paid into these insurance companies only to be turned away when we need coverage the most.'' 
   Lastly, Madam Speaker, I want to relay a story that was shared with me by Laurie, a fourth grade teacher in Madison, Wisconsin. Laurie recently had a student fall during recess and break his foot. Laurie writes me. 
   ``As he was waiting in extreme pain and cold for the school nurse to get to him, he cried to an assistant, waiting with him, `I can't go to the doctor. We don't have insurance.''' That a 9- or 10-year-old child should even think something like this is an atrocity. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope that my colleagues will join me in recognizing that obtaining comprehensive, affordable health care presents a very real challenge for millions and millions of Americans. We can not turn a deaf ear on our constituents' pleas for help. I invite my colleagues to join me in working on this most pressing domestic priority--to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. 
   Thank you, Madam Speaker. I yield back my remaining time.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (ALS REGISTRY ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2295 the ALS Registry Act. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a fatal, progressive neuro-degenerative disease affecting approximately 5,600 Americans each year. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans have ALS at any given time with an average life expectancy of 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. Today, no single national patient registry collects and stores information on the prevalence and incidence of ALS. 
   The ALS Registry Act would create a nationwide registry at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for ALS and other related motor neuron disorders. The patient registry would collect data which is urgently needed for ALS research, disease management, and the development of standards of care. This will allow us to make real progress toward better understanding ALS, and to develop measures for prevention, treatment and cure of this dreaded disease. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Representative Eliot Engel, for his dedication to bringing this bill before us today. Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2295.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (DEXTROMETHORPHAN DISTRIBUTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 970, the Dextromethorphan Distribution Act of 2007. 
   Dextromethorphan, commonly known as DXM or DEX, is an active ingredient in many over-the-counter cough and cold medications. When used as directed, DEX has proven to be an effective cough suppressant; but sadly, an alarming number of teenagers and young adults are abusing prescription and over-the-counter medications by taking much larger than recommended doses to get high. 
   H.R. 970 attempts to curb the misuse and abuse of DEX by restricting the sale, purchase, trade, and distribution of DEX to registered producers of drugs and devices. The legislation is aimed at preventing would-be drug dealers from purchasing DEX wholesale and selling it over the Internet and on the streets. 
   Similar legislation passed the House during the 109th Congress but was not enacted into law. Today, we renew our commitment to America's young people by passing this legislation. We are also reminding parents and guardians to remain vigilant in the often difficult task of talking with our young people about drug misuse and abuse. Even if your child does not abuse products containing DEX or any other over-the-counter medications, odds suggest that they know somebody who does. 
   I want to acknowledge and commend our colleagues, particularly Congressman Fred Upton and Congressman Rick Larsen, for their committed work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 970.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH MONTH -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 448, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that there should be established a National Cancer Research Month. 
   Preventing and ultimately finding a cure for cancer is a major public health challenge. The resolution before us calls for the establishment of a National Cancer Research Month, a time to bring public awareness of the nearly 200 forms of cancer and bring hope and a cure that cancer research provides. Providing a National Cancer Research Month will remind us that basic, clinical, epidemiological, and behavioral research are integral to identifying causes and developing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cures for cancer. 
   This resolution also highlights the contributions of the American Association for Cancer Research, an organization that has been on the forefront of cancer research for more than 100 years. The American Association for Cancer Research was founded in 1907 by a group of 11 physicians and scientists interested in cancer research. 
   As the oldest and largest scientific organization in the world focused on every aspect of high quality, innovative cancer research, the American Association for Cancer Research has established a reputation for scientific breadth and excellence as premier researchers in the field. 
   Today, the American Association for Cancer Research accelerates progress towards the prevention and cure of cancer by promoting research, education, communication, and advocacy  and fostering the exchange of knowledge and new ideas among scientists dedicated to cancer research, providing training opportunities for the next generation of cancer researchers and increasing public understanding of cancer. 
   On this, their centennial year of service, we commend the work of the American Association for Cancer Research and applaud their effort to make cancer research a national and international priority. We owe a debt of gratitude to organizations like the American Association for Cancer Research for their contributions in advancing the public awareness of cancer and for excellence among its membership in the field of cancer research. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson), for his work in raising this important issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 133, supporting the goals and ideals of a Long-Term Care Awareness Week. Long-term care is an often overlooked part of the continuum of care for many Americans, and many of us find ourselves ill informed and ill prepared to make choices for our own long-term care needs and those of our loved ones. 
   According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, long-term care represents a variety of services that include medical and nonmedical care for people who have a chronic illness or disability. Most long-term care is to assist people with the activities of daily living, such as dressing, bathing, and using the bathroom. It is important to remember that you may need long-term care at any age. The need for support and health services for persons who have diminished capacity for self-care is projected to strain both public and private resources. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Con. Res. 133 calls for public education about the need for long-term care so that people of all ages throughout our Nation are better prepared to meet their own long-term care needs. Planning for long-term care requires us to think about possible future health care needs. Making the right decision about long-term care requires us to look at all of the options before us and to make informed decisions.  
   I want to recognize and thank my colleague from South Dakota (Ms. Herseth Sandlin) for introducing this resolution and carrying it to the floor. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 182, recognizing the need to pursue research into the causes, treatment and eventual cure for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, IPF, supporting the goals and ideals of National Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Week, and for other purposes. 
   IPF is a debilitating and generally fatal disease which afflicts more than 128,000 Americans, with more than 48,000 new cases diagnosed each year. IPF is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed and is a disease marked by progressive scarring of the lungs, causing an irreversible loss of the lung tissue's ability to transport oxygen. 
   The legislation before us today recognizes the need to pursue research into the causes of IPF. H. Con. Res. 182 expresses support for the work of advocates and organizations in educating, supporting and providing hope for individuals who suffer from the disease and supports the designation of National Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week. 
   This is an important piece of legislation, and I would like to commend my colleague and friend Mr. Deal for all of his hard work on this issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 507, the Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007. 
   A small but significant portion of children have visual impairments. It is estimated that vision impairment affects approximately 1.2 out of every 1,000 8-year-olds. When detected early, many childhood vision abnormalities are treatable, but the potential for correction and normal visual development diminishes with age. Vision problems can occur at any point during a lifetime, but tend to be particularly damaging to school-age children. 
   Impaired vision can result in adverse physical, emotional, and social consequences. For instance, a child may miss learning opportunities by failing to explore his or her environment. Additionally, if a child is visually impaired, he or she may be unable to imitate social behavior or understand nonverbal cues. 
   Early recognition of eye disease results in more effective treatment and that can be sight saving and sometimes even life saving. Yet, many children under the age of five do not receive any vision screening at all. 
   The Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007 would authorize a grant program to provide comprehensive eye exams for uninsured children with vision disorders, with priority for children under the age of 9. Funds would be used for treatment and services to correct vision disorders identified through eye exams and to increase public awareness of visual impairment in children. H.R. 507 would require States receiving funds to contribute a 25 percent match of funds for each Federal dollar obtained through the program. 
   The bill before us today makes great strides in providing access to an array of vision-related services, including vision screening services that can help uninsured children in low- to moderate-income families. 
   I want to thank my colleagues for their commitment and strong support of this legislation, and particularly commend my dear friend and colleague, Representative Gene Green, for his unwavering dedication to this issue. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this vital and important legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (MELANIE BLOCKER-STOKES POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION RESEARCH AND CARE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 20, the Melanie Blocker-Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act of 2007. 
   The birth of a child can be a joyous and exciting time, but following childbirth, some women may experience postpartum disorders that can adversely affect a woman's mental health. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, about 10 percent of new moms experience postpartum depression, a form of depression that can develop within the first 6 months after giving birth. 
   For women with postpartum depression, feelings such as sadness, anxiety, and restlessness can be so strong that they interfere with daily tasks. Rarely, a more extreme form of depression known as postpartum psychosis can develop. Postpartum depression and psychosis can have an adverse effect on a woman's mental health and impair their ability to bond with their newborn child. 
   The legislation before us today will go a long way towards helping to increase awareness of postpartum depression and psychosis. H.R. 20 encourages the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the National Institutes of Health to expand and intensify research on postpartum depression and to conduct and support research in an effort to find a cure for postpartum depression and psychosis. 
   Furthermore, this legislation encourages the NIH to carry out a national campaign to increase awareness of postpartum depression, and it directs Health and Human Services to make grants to help with coordinating the effective delivery of essential services to individuals with postpartum depression, as well as their families. 
   I would like to extend a special thank you to our Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee chairman, Mr. Rush, who has championed this bill's cause. His commitment to ensuring that women who suffer from postpartum depression better understand their condition and have access to the resources that they need has been unwavering. I commend him for his hard work, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this life-saving legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as may consume. 
   I rise in support of H. Res. 524, expressing the sense of the House with respect to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, DBA. 
   DBA is a rare genetic bone marrow disorder affecting children and adults, 90 percent of whom are younger than 1 year of age when they are diagnosed. DBA results in severe anemia due to the failure to produce red blood cells. The symptoms may vary greatly, from very mild to severe and life-threatening. Unfortunately, because DBA is a rare disease, there is limited research being done, and treatment options are not optimal. 
   The resolution before us today as amended expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that we should encourage further efforts to clarify the natural history of DBA, continue efforts to raise awareness and ease access of information about DBA, encourage research efforts that will advance treatment options and seek a cure and encourage cross-institutional research initiatives to study the intricacies involved in this rare inherited disease. 
   This is an important piece of legislation, and I would like to acknowledge and thank my colleague Representative Carolyn McCarthy for her hard work and dedication on this issue. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1727, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act. I am honored to have known Christopher and Dana Reeve, and it is fitting that we are considering this bill today just after the 3-year anniversary of Christopher's death. 
   As we know, sometimes hardships and painful experiences are the starting point for an incredible advocacy, and this was certainly the case with Christopher and Dana Reeve. In turn, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act reflects our desire to carry out their work and improve the lives of, and hasten better treatments and cures for, people living with paralysis. 
   Madam Speaker, as many of my colleagues may be aware, millions of  Americans live with paralysis. Two million Americans live with paralysis of the extremities; a quarter million Americans live with spinal cord injuries; 4 million Americans live with the effects of stroke; 250,000 to 350,000 Americans have been diagnosed with some form of multiple sclerosis; half a million children and adults in the U.S. have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy; and 30,000 Americans, as we have just heard, live with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
   This legislation is multifaceted and seeks to address several aspects of paralysis research and quality-of-life issues. The bill expands research on paralysis at the NIH by encouraging collaborative research to connect scientists doing similar work and enhanced understanding and speed discovery of better treatment and cures. The bill also encourages research to enhance the daily function of people with paralysis, including improving their functional mobility, assessing the efficacy and outcomes of medical rehabilitation therapies, and developing improved assistive technology to improve function and independence. 
   Lastly, the bill seeks to improve the quality of life and health of persons with paralysis and other physical disabilities by supporting programs to disseminate information involving care and rehabilitation options. It also coordinates best practices designed to support and advance quality-of-life programs for persons living with paralysis and other physical disabilities. 
   Madam Speaker, Christopher and Dana Reeve used their visibility to work on behalf of families in all parts of this country who face the challenges of paralysis and impaired mobility. I have been honored to carry on their work and am honored to work on this legislation with Congresswoman Bono, Congressman Langevin, and Congressman Bilirakis. I am also thankful to have had the opportunity to work with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation and the thousands of paralysis advocates who have worked for the passage of this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (COVER THE UNINSURED WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight during Cover the Uninsured Week to draw attention to a national crisis. 
   According to the Census Bureau, 46.6 million Americans are without health insurance. Millions more encounter a health care system that is inadequate in meeting their basic medical needs because they are underinsured. 
   According to a recent Commonwealth Fund study, there are 16 million Americans who are underinsured, meaning that their insurance did not adequately protect them against catastrophic health care expenses. That means, in total, 61 million Americans have either no health insurance or only sporadic coverage, or have insurance coverage that leaves them exposed to high health care costs. Sixty-one million Americans is nearly 21 percent of all Americans, one in five. 
   The lack of affordable, comprehensive health care affects every congressional district in this Nation. To highlight the issue and the real impact that being uninsured has on the lives of Americans, I have selected some letters that I have received from my constituents who have had difficulty in obtaining and affording comprehensive health care coverage. Too often here in Congress we speak of health care issues in antiseptic jargon of policymakers and lawyers. But people across America are hurting, and these letters tell their stories in their own words. 
   I represent a district in south central Wisconsin, and while the letters I read may be from the State of Wisconsin, they speak to the difficulties of people all over the United States, difficulties people face every day. I am going to start with a few letters about the ever-increasing price of health care. 
   Eva from Madison, Wisconsin writes: ``I am contacting you in regards to my desperate need for public health care. I am a grad student. I recently sprained my ankle playing soccer and had to go to the emergency room for x-rays. My bill came out to $1,242.50 because I can only afford measly insurance that only has catastrophic coverage. This is a ridiculous amount of money for such a visit, and it causes me to consider those less fortunate than me who have even more serious injuries and less familial support. This cost can truly make waves in the lives of people.'' 
   Suzanne from Stoughton, Wisconsin writes: ``It is time, time to have the government deal with health care. We are covered under COBRA, which will run out in March. The cost is going from $500 per month to $900 per month. We checked with Blue Cross, and they refused us coverage because of a preexisting condition. They will not even offer a waiver for this preexisting condition. We checked with the Wisconsin State Insurance Program, which will cover us for $1,200 per month. Please, let people over 60 buy into Medicare. It is impossible to find a job that offers health insurance.'' 
   And then there is the story of Sylvia from Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Sylvia was uninsured when she was hospitalized with a need for an appendectomy. Even after the hospital charity program reduced her bill, she still owed over $11,000 to the hospital. Sometimes the bill collectors call her at home five times a day. Sylvia chips away at this bill sending in the most she can, $20 to $50 a month. 
   Roberta from Janesville, Wisconsin writes: ``I think insurance bills for both medical and dental care are horrendous. Both my husband and I work full time, with two small children, living pay check to pay check. My insurance costs have caused us many heartaches, with us owing more money than what needs to be paid. As a result, I will not get a needed medical procedure done. Something drastically needs to change in the United States of America where hardworking individuals and families can get the treatment they need without going broke.'' 
   Roberta brings up an important point in her letter, because people without health insurance are often not getting the care that they desperately need. A recent study released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that cost prevented 41.1 percent of uninsured adults from seeking a doctor when they needed to seek care. 
   But getting needed care is also difficult for Americans who have health insurance because of the financial strain relating to high premiums, high health care costs, increasing copays, deductibles. These place an incredible strain on American families, often forcing them to choose between needed health care and basic necessities like food.     
   It is no wonder that illness, injury and medical debt is responsible for nearly 50 percent of all personal bankruptcies in the United States. Only about 40 percent of businesses who employ low-wage or part-time workers offer health benefits. And at $11,480 a year, the average family's health insurance premiums now cost more than a minimum wage worker makes in a year. And as we all know, the costs of health care are rising faster than inflation. Between 2000 and 2006, health premiums for employer-sponsored insurance jumped 87 percent, far outpacing inflation's 18 percent overall increase over the same period of time. 
   Patricia, from Madison, Wisconsin writes: We need to fix health care. I have to choose between heat and food and medications. I have lost 80 pounds because of this. Please help. 
   Heather, from Waterloo, Wisconsin writes: I am married and together with my husband I own a home. We live a modest, middle-class life, managing to always have what we need except for health care coverage. My husband has excellent health care at his job, but for me to also be covered by his plan, we would need to pay nearly $400 per month. That is two-thirds as much as our home mortgage. Through school, I have worked less and less in order to maintain health coverage, and I have only been able to afford short-term, major medical coverage. I am grateful that we can afford this, and it does make a difference. However, even now, I have a sore throat and I will wait for a few days to see how I feel. And I will wait because if I don't need to go, I will certainly save the money. This is disturbing to me, as a nursing student, because I know about the importance of early treatment and prevention. And it is upsetting to me as a person because I value my health. It is unacceptable to me as a citizen, because I know there are other people just like me who wait and get sicker or can't take the medications they need. 
   Mr. Speaker, simply put, our health care system is failing, and America knows this. Among the thousands of letters regarding health care that I receive, there is a common thread, a common theme that brings them together, and that common theme is an overwhelming frustration with the system, a system they know is just not working, and a call for us in Congress to take action, bold action. 
   Brad, from Mount Horeb, Wisconsin writes: I write to you today to urge you to take action on a growing crisis in America: health care. I strongly believe that we need a national health care plan to insure all Americans. My major concern with the current system is that when people attempt to obtain insurance, insurance companies refuse them because of past health history. Let's face it. Insurance companies are in business to make a profit. The best way to make a profit is to insure the healthy so you can minimize the claims you pay out, and not insure those who need medical care or may potentially need medical care. 
   Brad goes on to write: I am 38 years old, with a family of four. I currently participate in a health savings account. For all practical purposes, I pay all of my own medical needs, including the recent birth of our daughter. I recently attempted to switch insurance providers. The insurance companies will insure me, but they will not insure my daughter for any type of treatment for her asthma for 3 years, along with no drug coverage for life. The policy I was requesting had a $10,000 deductible, yet they still refused the coverage. 
   Lisa, from Madison, Wisconsin writes: I am a very healthy person, and my husband and children are very healthy. We cannot get insurance. I think everyone should attempt to gain an individual health policy just to see how impossible it is. I am not a risk. Really, I am not. I am terrified right now because we are uninsured. 
   Carol, from Madison, Wisconsin writes: As someone who has had no health insurance at all for 3 years, I can tell you that it was pretty miserable being one of the millions of people in this country without health insurance. Not long ago, my best friend died  at age 42 because of ovarian cancer because she did not have health insurance and waited too long to see what was causing all of her symptoms. Yes, people in America actually die from not having health insurance. 
   Darla from Fitchburg, writes me. She says, ``I lost my job because of unpredictable attendance due to my health issues. Upon losing my job I signed up for COBRA. Last week I received a letter indicating that my COBRA eligibility ends soon. In order for me to get health coverage, I would have to work at least 20 hours per week, but my physicians believe that it would do me more harm than good relating to my health issues. If I don't get some sort of health insurance, I will need to stop all treatments, as I have no money to pay for doctors' services. My prescription drugs will have to stop, as I will not be able to pay for them either. What can I do?'' Darla asks. 
   Kimberly, from Madison, Wisconsin writes to me, ``I am writing today because of my family's frustration and anxiety over health care. Although we hear a lot of rhetoric about making health care more affordable and/or more available for Americans, nothing is happening, at least not soon enough. 
   ``Let me briefly share our story,'' Kimberly proceeds. ``My husband recently started his own business. Obviously, it will take some time for his new company to see any profits, much less income. In the meantime, we are without health insurance. I am 5 months pregnant, and we have a 2-year-old son. Because of my preexisting condition, we cannot buy affordable health coverage. COBRA would cost us $1,200 per month. I am currently applying for Medicaid and other forms of public assistance as a last resort. This is ridiculous. 
   ``As someone with no insurance, I wonder what could possibly be the problem with implementing a public health care system. Oh, I have heard the horrible stories about having fewer choices in doctors or longer waiting lists for procedures and less incentive among doctors and researchers to develop new technologies. But what is most frightening to me is the chance that my son might get sick, or my baby might be born with expensive complications while we are uninsured. 
   ``I am not naive. I know that funding public health care is an issue. But is it wise to sacrifice the health and well-being of American citizens to avoid the challenge of implementing a change? I, for one, would be satisfied to pay more for goods and services if I could rest assured that my family's basic health care needs were being met.'' 
   David, from Cross Plains, Wisconsin writes, ``My wife and I have been self-employed for over 18 years, and have paid thousands of dollars for health insurance premiums. As of a few months ago, we had to drop out and are now without health insurance. The cost is completely out of reach. In fact, it is nuts. Now that I am 50 years old, it is not a matter of if I will have health problems, it is a matter of when. Tammy, we will lose everything we have ever worked for. So much for the American dream. Now we look forward to dying broke and possibly homeless.'' 
   Victor, from Stoughton, Wisconsin, writes, ``My wife can only work part time because of her health. Her employer offers a generic policy that costs only $3.97 per week and requires no background check. This policy covers basically nothing. Medical supplies, check-ups, doctors' visits necessary on a routine basis for my wife to survive are now not covered. My wife is uninsurable because of her health, and we have been turned down for health insurance that we have applied for. We cannot believe that this is happening.'' 
   Ronald, from Deerfield, Wisconsin writes, ``I was on COBRA insurance for 3 years, which ended this past fall. I spent from March until September trying to get private insurance, but could not because of my neck injury. I was, in effect, looked at and dismissed by 33 private insurance companies because of my preexisting condition with my neck injury. Imagine how you would feel, after being dismissed by this many companies. I was finally insured through disability and Medicare. The sad reality of it is that if I want to try to work full-time again, I cannot, because in doing so it would cost me the only insurance options that I have left. 
   ``The truth is that many other countries can and do provide equitable health insurance to all of their citizens, no matter what preexisting conditions they have, or their ability to pay, or what income level they have. I believe this country does have top-notch medical facilities, but not decent or equitable insurance for the poor and middle-income families. 
   Susan, from Baraboo, Wisconsin writes me, ``I am writing you today regarding health insurance coverage for single people with no children. As of this time, I feel that I am left out of the loop in regards to this topic. I am 42, and last September I was diagnosed with breast cancer. In January of this year, the company that I worked for informed us that they would be closing down. I was laid off in December while I was out due to my cancer treatment. I have been searching for health care coverage everywhere because my COBRA will be going up, and I am on unemployment and barely able to pay the $244.76 for the coverage now. I cannot get insurance because of the breast cancer. 
   ``The High Risk State Insurance Program, which is the Wisconsin program, is too expensive for me to get coverage, since they want 4 months of premiums up front, and as they only cover some things. What are single people supposed to do,'' Susan asks? ``We don't qualify for any government assistance because we are single. We cannot go without insurance. There are no programs to help us out. So when you are working on health care in the House of Representatives, please remember that there are other single people out there also in my shoes. I am at a crossroads because I have no avenue for assistance when it comes to health care. Come November, I will be unable to get coverage when I need it at this point in my life: 
   Janet from Portage, Wisconsin writes, ``I have a 53-year-old brother who has psoriasis all over his body and arthritis that is caused by this. Three weeks ago he fell and needs surgery on his shoulder to repair it. He has no job, no money, and no insurance. We started looking for a program to help him. There are none that we can find. There is nothing to get him help to get his shoulder fixed. But after it heals wrong and he is disabled because of it, then there are programs to help him. They won't help him get it fixed so he can find a good job. Instead, they would rather support him for the rest of his life instead of trying to help him now: 
   Gail, from Janesville, Wisconsin writes, ``My husband recently lost his job. He applied for over 100 positions, only to be told that he lacked a college degree, or he is overqualified, or that they can only pay $8 an hour. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in June of 1998, and again in 2003. I have gone through breast cancer twice, and have undergone a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. COBRA has run out, and without a stable income, we cannot afford to pay the premiums for our own health care policy. My husband is 59 and I am 58, and we have no medical coverage. I have looked into every insurance company and get turned down because of my medical history. All our lives we have paid into these insurance companies, only to be turned away when we need the coverage the most.''     
   Lastly, I want to relay a story that was shared with me by Laurie. Laurie is a fourth grade teacher in the Madison, Wisconsin, public school system. Laurie recently had a student fall during recess and break his foot. Laurie wrote: ``As he was waiting, in extreme pain and cold, for the school nurse to get to him, he cried to an assistant waiting with him, 'I can't go to the doctor. We don't have insurance.''' 
   That a 9- or 10-year-old boy should think even something like this is an atrocity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that as Cover the Uninsured Week continues, my colleagues will join me in recognizing that obtaining comprehensive, affordable health care presents a very real challenge for millions upon millions of Americans. We cannot turn a deaf ear to our constituents' pleas for help. I invite my colleagues to join me in working on this most pressing domestic priority to provide affordable health care for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate bill, S. 793, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008, to authorize research and public health activities relating to trauma and traumatic brain injury. The version of the bill we are considering today represents bipartisan and bicameral consensus. 
   The purpose of S. 793, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008, is to authorize funding for research, treatment, surveillance and education activities related to trauma and traumatic brain injury at the National Institutes of Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Reauthorizing the traumatic brain injury program will strengthen the goal of understanding and addressing traumatic brain injury and strengthen our commitment to all those who experience traumatic brain injury. 
   I want to acknowledge my friend the gentleman from New Jersey, Congressman BILL PASCRELL, for his incredible leadership in the House on this important matter. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in its support. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (NATIONAL BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER EARLY DETECTION PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, it is high time we reauthorize the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. This important program provides breast and cervical cancer screening to low-income, uninsured women who otherwise would have little or no access to such care. Early detection is a woman's most powerful weapon against breast or cervical cancer because early detection, followed by early treatment intervention, greatly increases a woman's odds of beating cancer; and we know that our vigilance is having results as this is the second straight year of declining cancer deaths. 
   The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program is a Federal-State partnership that builds on the existing public health infrastructure and involves all sectors of the community in outreach and delivery of services. 
   Established in 1991, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program provides low-income women who have limited or no health insurance with breast and cervical cancer screening, education, outreach, and case management services. Administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program provides access to mammograms, pap tests, surgical consultations, and diagnostic testing. The program is operational in all 50 states, four U.S. territories, the District of Columbia, and 13 American Indian or Alaskan Native organizations. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program also works with nonprofit organizations that provide supplemental funding for screening, education, outreach, case management and treatment services. 
   To date, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program has provided nearly 6.5 million screenings to 2.7 million women, detecting almost 30,000 breast cancers, almost 90,000 precancerous cervical lesions and 1,700 cervical cancers. 
   This reauthorization will strengthen this important program by increasing the program's authorization level. At its current $205 million funding level, it is estimated that the program only provides services to 20 percent of all eligible women in the United States. This additional authorization would enable the program to provide 147,000 more screenings per year. 
   In addition, it will assist rural communities and special populations by permitting a five-State demonstration program for States to receive a time-limited waiver of current regulatory requirements in order to provide greater emphasis on education and outreach, while ensuring that women continue to have access to life-saving screening services. 
   I have been honored to work on this reauthorization, and I want to thank the American Cancer Society and the Susan G. Komen Foundation for their continued support of this critical program. 
   In addition, I have been honored to work with my colleague, Congresswoman SUE MYRICK, in advancing this important legislation. In the war against breast and cervical cancer, we know that screening and early detection saves lives. I am very proud and pleased that on this issue Republicans and Democrats are working together to support a life-saving program. I urge all of my colleagues to support this reauthorization.

<DOCNO>Ms. BALDWIN. (SUPPORTING THE OBSERVANCE OF BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 230, a resolution supporting the observance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. As an original cosponsor of this resolution, I am proud to speak out in favor of greater support for breast cancer awareness and prevention. Through my work with Congresswoman Sue Myrick in reauthorizing the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, I am well aware of the challenges that lie ahead in preventing and ultimately finding a cure for breast cancer. 
   As my colleagues may know, breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women between the ages of 45 and 54. Many of us have witnessed a family member or a friend struggle with the devastating effects of breast cancer. We must ensure that these women do not suffer alone. 
   With this resolution, we affirm our solidarity with the 2 million-plus breast cancer survivors as we seek to find a cure for this and other cancers. We also pay tribute to the volunteers and health care professionals who work to combat breast cancer every day. 
   H. Con. Resolution 230 supports the observance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time to reemphasize the importance of monthly breast self-examinations and annual mammograms. As in the case of many diseases, early detection goes a long way toward ensuring survival. As many of my colleagues know, approximately 98 percent of women who are able to detect breast cancer in its most early stage survive. We must use this opportunity to educate women, all women, to ensure that they take the necessary steps to protect themselves from this potentially fatal disease. 
   I also rise to pay tribute to our friend and our colleague, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis, who lost her life to breast cancer earlier this month. We are reminded that breast cancer can strike anyone. This resolution also expresses our gratitude to national and community organizations, such as the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, that have made us all aware of the power of the pink ribbon, been on the forefront in raising awareness about this disease and provided information to better understand this disease. 
   I also want to thank my colleague Representative Ginny Brown-Waite and the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues for their leadership on this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support this very important resolution. Observing Breast Cancer Awareness Month gives us an opportunity to educate the  public on the importance of monthly breast self-exams and annual mammograms. It also gives us an opportunity to salute those who work every day in raising awareness about breast cancer and our health care professionals who work with patients to fight it. 
   Again, I want to commend the work of my colleague, Representative Ginny Brown-Waite, for her work on this important issue, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and yield back the balance of my time.
