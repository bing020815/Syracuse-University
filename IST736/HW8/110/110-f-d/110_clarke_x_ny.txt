<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Madam Chairman, the Employee Free Choice Act serves as a remedy to the squeeze on the middle class, due, in part, to the large scale erosion of workers fundamental freedom to bargain for better wages and benefits. Over the last several decades, workers' rights have come under increasing attacks. Even though workers in the United States under the National Labor Relations Act have the right to organize and collectively bargain, violations of these rights include the firing of employees for union activity. 
   In committee, Madam Chairman, we heard testimony of witnesses who spoke either in support for or against the bill on the House floor today. I find it difficult to understand how, in good conscience, Americans who, a generation before benefited from union activity, would be this opposition to this bill. 
   During organizing campaigns, 25 percent of employers illegally fire at least one worker for union activity. 
   The chance that a pro union worker activist is fired for his or her union activity today is now 1 in 5. 
   78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced employees to attend one-on-one meetings against a union with their own supervisors, and 92 percent of the employers forced employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings against the union. 
   75 percent of the employers in organizing drives hire consultants or other union busting firms to fight the organizing drive. 
   The middle class squeeze has created a human rights crisis in this country. The Nation, the economy, and the employees benefit from the workers having the freedom to join together to bargain for better wages and benefits. 
   I wanted to just take a moment today because this piece of legislation will now bring justice to what has been a real injustice to the American people. I had the occasion to sit in on our committee hearings. Today I just wanted to bring to everyone's memory a gentleman named Mr. Ivo Camilo. He worked for the Blue Diamond Company for 35 years. He signed a letter with 58 coworkers saying that they wanted the right to organize and wanted that to be respected. A week later, Mr. Camilo was fired. 
   Today I cast my vote on behalf of Mr. Ivo Camilo, who sacrificed for each and every American the right to organize. He sacrificed his livelihood for all of us and for future generations. Thank you very much, Mr. Camilo. 
   And I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this legislation.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF NATIONAL CARIBBEAN-AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. First, I would like to thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the lead sponsor on this legislation, for her ongoing commitment and diligence in championing such an important resolution. She has served as a true advocate for national recognition of Caribbean people and their descendants in the United States. I also want to thank Congressman Higgins for his leadership and his support and management of this resolution to the floor today. 
   As a second generation Caribbean American, American by birth, Caribbean by parentage, specifically Jamaican, I am proud to be a cosponsor of H. Con. Res. 364. National Caribbean Heritage Month is for the millions of Caribbean people and their American descendants, an affirmation and much deserved recognition of their role and contribution to the growth and development of our Nation, as well as the region within this hemisphere from which these Americans, like myself, have come. 
   Caribbean American Heritage Month was created to herald the unique historic relationship between the people of the Caribbean region and the United States and the many great contributions they have made to our country. For centuries now, Caribbean Americans have fortified this great Nation. Alexander Hamilton, born 1755 in the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, was the first Caribbean American from New York to serve in this body, then known as the Continental Congress. He has held numerous cabinet positions, including Secretary of State. Another influential New Yorker of Caribbean ancestry, Colin Powell, also held the position of Secretary of State in more recent times. 
   As it relates to my district, I must mention the late, great Caribbean American of Barbadian and Guyanese  ancestry, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, who worked in the Congress from 1969 to 1983 and was the first black woman to run for President of our Nation. Ms. Chisholm paved the way for me to serve in this body, second in the line of succession in the same constituency that she once served.

   Ms. CLARKE. As a Caribbean American woman and a Member of Congress, it's my hope that we can continue to improve our diplomatic and economic relationships and arrangements with many of our neighbors in the Caribbean region, such as Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica and other Caribbean nations. 
   The Caribbean communities, known as CARICOM, have worked with their citizen ambassadors in the American Caribbean diaspora to develop a diversified economy that is favorable to foreign direct investment from the United States and human resource and intellectual capital from the region. As such, the Caribbean nations have cooperated on tax enforcement matters, transparency and exchange for information with the United States. 
   These Caribbean nations are also strategic partners and assist the United States' counter transnational terrorism activities, crime and illegal narcotics importation. These contributions and importance of the Caribbean region to the United States is reflected in the millions of people who contribute to acknowledge the pride heritage of the region by way of the Caribbean Carnival styled parades and festivities that occur across this Nation.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (HAITI -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus and its members, we are presenting this evening during our message hour a call to action, that is Haiti, country in crisis. 
   We have witnessed this year, so far in the hurricane season, tremendous distress, death and destruction. I want to start by expressing the sympathies of myself and the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, our condolences and support for the people of Texas and the Gulf Region, who have been toiling under storm after storm after storm and dealing with the destruction that comes from nature's wrath, as some would place it. 
   In this context, I wanted to speak a bit this evening with my colleagues and with the public about the need to actually look at what happens, not at the point at which the hurricane ends on our shores, but also its path and the  death and destruction that it leaves in the wake of its path. 
   I am speaking of the Caribbean region in our hemisphere, and the many nations in those waters that have been devastated by the series of hurricane activity this year, be it the island nation of Turks and Caicos or the island nation of Jamaica, the island nation of the Dominican Republic, the island nations in the Caribbean region have been rocked by this year's hurricane season thus far. I have had the opportunity to join with Congressman KENDRICK MEEK and Congresswoman DONNA EDWARDS from Maryland on an emergency codel to destination, Haiti. 
   The devastation that we witnessed firsthand on that nation is truly a call to action. As you can see here, this year we have had a number of storms from Category 1 to Category 5 in their strength. The nation of Haiti in just 3 weeks was struck by four storms, Tropical Storm Fay, which hit on August 16; Hurricane Gustav, which hit on August 26; Tropical Storm Hanna, which hit on September 1; and then Hurricane Ike, which hit on September 7. 
   It is estimated that over 850,000 people have been affected by this storm on the island nation of Haiti, and almost half of those affected were children. It is estimated that over 500 people have been killed and rescuers and aides are only beginning to reach some of the hardest-hit areas, as I speak to you right now. It is also estimated that over 150,000 people are internally displaced, and only about half of those people are in shelters. 
   You will notice that I have been saying, as has been estimated, and this is the case, because Haiti has lost its ability to communicate across its island. The destruction that has rocked that nation has eight of Haiti's 10 geographic departments, which have been flooded. All of the major roads and bridges granting access to many of the hardest-hit areas have been washed away. 
   Haiti's prime minister says that 1 million people or more may be homeless. The storms have crippled Haiti's already delicate infrastructure, and most of the City of Gonaives, which is the second-largest city on the island, is damaged so badly that it cannot be repaired. Local officials are considering moving the entire city to another part of the island that is on higher ground. 
   We had an opportunity to meet with President Rene Preval on our codel, and he said to us, this is the Katrina of an entire nation, but we are suffering without a fraction of the means that Louisiana had. A lot of infrastructure that was destroyed by Hurricane Jean in 2004 was recently rebuilt and recently destroyed by this latest series of storms. 
   This includes the hospital in Gonaives. Radio NPR reports that in the Grand Ravine neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, 700 people are living in a school where there is no running water, no electricity, no beds and often no food. People have been packed in there for weeks, but all is not lost. I was proud to see that, very swiftly, the United States has moved into action to aid our neighbors and our friend known as the island nation of Haiti. 
   Upon arriving in Port-au-Prince, we saw a lot of helicopter activity and were informed that the USS Kearsarge is in port in Port-of-Spain providing needed humanitarian assistance and aid.     
   As I said earlier in my presentation, all of the major roads and bridges have collapsed. That has isolated many of the communities and the cities that have historically been connected in commerce and in bringing foods and goods and services across the island. So the only way that people can be fed, can be given water, can be administered medicine is through the air, and we are proud to know that our aircraft carrier is there, as we speak, administering that much needed aid and support. 
   I want to thank the young men and women I met there who sought not robbery but, rather, to change their mission, to move along with their admiral and captain and crew into the Caribbean Sea from Latin America and over to Haiti where they're working night and day to try to preserve as much life as possible. I can tell you that, from my observations, this is a mammoth task. The mammoth task exists because Haiti remains flooded out. 
   In Gonaive, we did a flyover, and we were able to see in the streets where people live. There was rushing water, like rivers, flowing past people's homes, flowing over all of their planting grounds, and making it so that people were actually risking their lives in simply trying to get from point A to point B. Many of the residents have taken to their rooftops to live. In other areas, we witnessed the levels of mud that have accumulated as the waters have receded. In some areas, there are as much as 2 to 4 feet of mud before people's homes, in the roadways, in the byways of the communities in which people live. 
   We had an opportunity to pass over Haiti's breadbasket, an area in Haiti where new harvesting was taking place--the planting of rice. That entire area is completely flooded out, having basically killed off this planting season for Haiti, and so we have a nation in crisis. The crisis is one of a magnitude that I, personally, have never witnessed before. The circumstances become more and more dire with each passing moment. 
   Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere, and it is one of our closest neighbors, just a little over 700 miles away from Miami, Florida. Many in Haiti were looking forward to the harvest of rice crop. Unfortunately, much of it, if not all of it, has been destroyed by these storms just as the food crisis in that country was beginning to abate. 
   The USAID has moved in. They are providing as much as they possibly can in terms of response. They have allocated $7.5 million in humanitarian assistance. The total value of U.S. Government humanitarian assistance is currently $20 billion. According to the USAID, Haitian Government officials have stated that these recent storms have caused an estimated $265 million in damage, particularly affecting their housing stock, agriculture, public infrastructure, and education. 
   In meeting with the newly installed Prime Minister for Haiti, Madam Michele Pierre-Louis, we were informed that the children's school has been postponed until the month of October, somewhere around October 3. My observations are that we will have to move with all deliberate speed to help and to assist in the recovery and in the rescue of those people in the various departments residing in the nation of Haiti in order for that part of their lives to be resumed. 
   We are not in this alone. I was very glad to see that the international community has responded as well. The U.N. troops and peacekeepers are on the ground, helping with the civil society, and the embassies of many of their partner nations--namely Canada, France and Brazil--are also collaborating with their local relief NGOs to bring as much to bear in this forward movement to get Haiti back on its feet, and it's going to take a coordinated effort to make sure that this is done in a timely and in a coordinated manner. 
   It is my hope that, through tonight's discussion, through tonight's presentations, we will see the need as a Nation to respond and to keep our response going and that when the TV cameras and the press crews have left Haiti that we will remember that this is a nation that is struggling to stand on its feet and that its civil society is extremely fragile. These storms have compounded what has been an ongoing challenge for Haiti to feed its own people. 
   So, this evening, I wanted to just share some of what I witnessed in the emergency codel commission by the Congressional Black Caucus, and I want to express gratitude to Speaker Pelosi and to Congressman KENDRICK MEEK for being so expedient in putting this codel together so that we could bring back the relevant facts to this body and to make sure that we're able to do all that we can do as we rebuild here in our own Nation and to make sure that, as to the hemisphere that we reside in, we are good neighbors and that, for our own sakes and for the sakes of the people who reside in Haiti, we do all that we can to make sure that they are on a safe road to recovery. 
   Having said that, I'm joined by a number of my colleagues this evening, all of whom have had longstanding ties to the nation of Haiti, all of whom have worked very hard in this body to make sure that we remain true to our  values as a Nation. They have been there throughout many crises in Haiti. 
   I'd like to acknowledge Congresswoman Donna Edwards of Maryland, Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California and Congresswoman Maxine Waters of California to make their statements.

   Ms. CLARKE. I want to thank the gentlelady from Maryland, our newest member in the Congressional Black Caucus, Ms. Donna Edwards, for her courage and her nimbleness. She rearranged her schedule very quickly to heed the call for her expertise and her ability. Donna has come to us with a background and expertise in the philanthropic world, and she shared that with the prime minister, with the Ambassador to Haiti, and so I know that she will be called upon in the future as Haiti rebuilds to bring that expertise to bear. 
   I want to thank you for being my traveling partner, and I look forward to working further with you and the CBC and our colleagues to make things happen for the Nation of Haiti. 
   I'd like to acknowledge someone who really doesn't need an introduction, but has been one of the foremost experts on the island nation of Haiti, has been an outstanding, outspoken advocate for the people of that island nation, none other than the honorable MAXINE WATERS. She's being acknowledged for 5 minutes, or as much time as she may consume.

   Ms. CLARKE. Thank you very much, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, for your leadership, your commitment as a remember of the CBC, and a Member of the House of Representatives. You have been very outspoken and a real leader in addressing these challenges that are before our international community, our friends, and our allies. 
   So this evening, if I didn't see it for myself, I would not believe it. Haiti is in crisis. As we stand here today, lives are tenuous. And what Haiti needs immediately we've been able to identify. Haiti needs as much support as we can give from this body, as much as we can orchestrate through our Department of Defense. 
   There is a need for watercraft that can travel across the waters to get to very remote areas that have been cut off by land; there's a need for assessment to take place as quickly as possible about the structural soundness of the infrastructure that currently exists, any modern technology that can be utilized to pump waters back into the seas to help dry out those areas. 
   Certainly food products are very important. We see a hunger crisis coming down the pike of a magnitude that I don't think we every witnessed in this hemisphere. We need clean water. The waterways of Haiti have been contaminated by the death and destruction around them, the death of humankind, the death of livestock. They need clean drinking water, they need medication and medical support because we are anticipating and trying to get ahead of any outbreaks of airborne diseases, of mosquito-borne diseases.     
   They need support for those who are struggling with their own health conditions currently. 
   We've asked the President of the United States to move forward with temporary protected status for Haitians, to halt the deportation of Haitians from the U.S. To send individuals into that environment right now is cruel and unusual punishment. We hope that the administration will heed this call at this time. 
   There are immigration issues, but there's an unprecedented international relief effort going on right now in Haiti, and the last thing that the Nation can do right now is provide for those who are returning deportees. 
   Despite the frequent report of drowning caused by unsafe refugee boats collapsing, the current conditions and crisis in Haiti may trigger an exodus of Haitian immigrants to the United States. Desperate times call for desperate measures. You have desperation climbing each and every day. 
   Since fiscal year 1998, the Coast Guard has interdicted well over 1,000 Haitians each year. Over 1,000 Haitians have already been interdicted in 2008. 
   Temporary protected status is the most inexpensive, immediate form of aid the President can single-handedly provide, and we ask that he make this possible as soon as possible. 
   There are currently six countries that are protected under TPS provisions: Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Burundi, Somalia and Sudan. And while other countries under similar circumstances have been afforded relief through TPS, Haiti has been overlooked time and time again. 
   Remittances are currently one-third of Haiti's gross national product. If we indeed want to underpin and undergird this country in its recovery, it is critical that we look at every vehicle and instrument we have at our disposal to help the people of the island nation of Haiti. 
   So we've put some recommendations forward. We look forward to further debate and conversation here in the House of Representatives. Haiti is a country in crisis. I've seen it. I know it. It is our time now to act upon it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for giving us this time as the Congressional Black Caucus. I want to thank our chairwoman, CAROLYN KILPATRICK, for her vision and leadership and her insistence upon us traveling on this emergency codel. 
   I'd like to thank again my colleagues Congressman KENDRICK MEEK for his leadership in this codel and his ability to get things moving and done through his affiliation and work as a member of the Armed Services Committee. 
   And I'd like to thank our newest Member, DONNA EDWARDS, for her leadership. She is a rising star. She is a part of making things happen here on the Hill, and it's just a source of pride and inspiration to work with her on this very important endeavor.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ABOLITION OF THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Thank you very much to Representative Payne and to the gentlelady from California. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 272, a resolution commemorating the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. 
   The abolition of the trade was an important milestone in the fight against slavery, but that campaign continued throughout the 19th century and it still continues today. 
   Currently, 27 million people are held in slavery around the world. Like the slaves of the past, slaves of today are controlled by violence, and suffer the theft of their labor and humanity. 
   Our commemoration today rings hollow if we do not learn from the lessons of the abolition movement of the past. That botched emancipation of 1865  forced four million ex-slaves into the economic social society with no access to education, political participation or equal citizenship, nor a true recognition of their humanity. 
   As I reflect on my own history as a descendant of African slaves who were survivors of the Middle Passage, my ancestors, kidnapped, brutalized and brought to the island Nation of Jamaica West Indies where centuries later my parents were born, who then migrated as subjects of the Queen to Brooklyn, New York, where I was born. 
   The history of Africans in the Americas has been suppressed as evidenced by the lack of presence in our school's curriculums. Today, we see the results of granting freedom without dignity. People of African descent still face economic inequality, social inequality and racism. 
   Slavery can be brought to an end within our lifetime. Madam Speaker, it is my prayer that someday soon this body will be celebrating of the global eradication of slavery. And in the spirit of the liberation and suffrage of my ancestors, the Civil Rights movement, human rights for every man, woman and child will be recognized. The liberty and the dreams of all will be attained through their collective will will not go unnoticed. We are not going to achieve true liberty unless and until we all embrace our collective and diverse humanity together.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING CARIBBEAN DRUG CRIME -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the Representative from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for yielding time, and for his words about this important resolution. 
   I also wholeheartedly thank Chairman HOWARD BERMAN of the Foreign Affairs Committee along with Western Hemisphere Subcommittee Chairman Eliot Engel, full committee ranking member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and subcommittee ranking member Dan Burton for their support and great help in moving this legislation through committee to the House floor. 
   The release of the U.N./World Bank report, ``Crime, Violence and Development: Trends, Costs and Policy Options in the Caribbean'' should be a wake-up call for every American interested in the security of our Nation. 
   As the report points out, a variety of factors, including some for which we in the U.S. are partly responsible, such as a seemingly insatiable and heavy illicit legal drug consumption and extremely problematic deportation policies has contributed to our neighboring Caribbean region having the highest crime rate in the world. 
   While today the region remains a wonderful place for Americans to visit, and most hospitable tourist destination in the world, in the long term, if this trend continues, it will wreak serious social, economic, and security troubles for many of the tranquil Caribbean nations. 
   Allowing this situation to deteriorate for years to come will ultimately create a security threat, not just for the Caribbean states, but, indeed, for our own country, as well as an unstable Caribbean region, and would create a vast vulnerability in America's border security. 
   Many of the problems identified by this report have long been recognized by Caribbean leadership. These emerging democracies and developing nations are doing everything within their means to collaborate on the safety of their respective nations and, by extension, our hemisphere. 
   Now, with the confirmation provided by this report in hand, ignorance is no excuse. The U.S. must partner with its Western Hemisphere neighbors and allow it to find workable solutions that will help the people of the Caribbean and ensure long-term security and stability of our region. 
   As the daughter of Caribbean immigrants, and a district that boasts the largest concentration of Caribbean Americans in the Nation, and as a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I ask my colleagues to support this resolution calling for the U.S. to take up the solutions contained in the very important U.N./World Bank report. If we act now, we will help our allies to reduce crime greatly at levels before the situation becomes far less manageable and a threat to the Western Hemisphere that is, indeed, within our global community.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act of 2008. The effects of global warming and climate change, as evidenced by wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floodings has been experienced by hundreds of thousands of Americans. These things, coupled with the energy crisis, are calling out for investment in renewable energy. 
   We must be ever cognizant that future generations will inherit a myriad of complicated environmental challenges. By encouraging schools to incorporate environmental education into their curriculum, H.R. 3036 will give future generations a solid understanding of environmental issues and a knowledge base that will equip and empower them with the tools needed to overcome the environmental problems that plague our civil society and our environs. 
   I am pleased to have language from my bill, H.R. 5902, the GREEN Act, incorporated into this bill. My bill's language would give schools the option of integrating an environmental justice curriculum into their own educational program. 
   Located in my congressional district, the Brooklyn Academy of Science and the Environment provides an innovative example of how environmental justice concepts can be used as an integrating context for learning. Created through a partnership with the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, Prospect Park Alliance, and the New York City Department of Education, this is one of New York City's first public environmental education high schools. 
   In closing, I want to thank Congressman Sarbanes for being a champion for America's scholars and for his consistent leadership on environmental education and for including my bill, H.R. 5902, as part of the No Child Left Inside Act of 2008, a bill that I believe will greatly transform our Nation in the years to come.

   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and give praise to the gentlewoman from Ohio for her management of this very important legislation and, of course, to our distinguished chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the dean of our New York delegation, for his leadership on this issue and bringing this issue to the floor today. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 3648, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, because Americans need relief. We need relief. And under this bill, the mortgage debt forgiven through foreclosure, sale, or loan restructuring would no longer count as taxable income. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is extremely vital to many New Yorkers, since a subprime tsunami is now sweeping across this Nation and many experts confirm that this wave will continue well into the next year with no end in sight. As a result, foreclosures are increasing at an alarming rate. 
   As we count the last days of 2007, many expect more than 14,000 foreclosures to be filed in New York City alone. Mr. Speaker, Congress must do all that it can to help Americans to keep their homes. So today I will cast an ``aye'' vote in support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, which helps struggling homeowners cope with the unanticipated penalty of foreclosure.

   Ms. CLARKE. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) for his leadership in this body and the management of this bill.

That is why I am proud that H.R. 3933, a bill that I introduced, has a significant place in the heart of the HEART Act, which makes permanent three provisions that bring vital tax relief to help our soldiers and their families. 
   This bill assures military compensation is excluded from income if it is earned in the combat zone or while hospitalized for wounds, diseases, or injuries received in combat, and permits active duty Reservists to make penalty free withdrawals from retirement plans and ends the penalties. 
   I want to thank Mr. Rangel for his consistent leadership on this issue and for including my bill, H.R. 3933, as part of the HEART Act of 2007.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (THE DRUG CONVICTION QUESTION AND FEDERAL STUDENT FINANCIAL AID -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, both the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that under the Bush administration the military has increasingly granted so-called ``conduct waivers'' to allow more people with criminal records, including drug convictions, to serve in the Armed Forces. As a matter of fact, conduct waivers granted for felonies and other crimes constitute the majority of all waivers, about 60 percent for the Army, and 75 percent for the Marine Corps. 
   It is important to note that the vast majority of such convictions stem from juvenile offenses, but at the same time, a provision of the Higher Education Act, which Congress is currently in the process of reauthorizing, bars young people with drug convictions from receiving Federal financial aid to go to college. I find it absolutely alarming that the Bush administration seems to think that youth who are prone to youthful indiscretions and get into trouble with drug use are, on the one hand, not worthy of Federal support to obtain a college education, but on the other hand, are perfectly fit to go and to fight the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Because of what many have termed the ``Drug War Draft,'' countless students with minor drug convictions are turned away from the university financial aid office only to be funneled across the street to the military recruiting office. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with giving young people with past drug convictions an opportunity to redeem themselves in service to our country by joining the armed services, it is a moral outrage that current law blocks redemption through educational opportunities to these same individuals. 
   When asked about the conduct waivers, the Army's Operations Chief Lieutenant General James Thurman stated, ``You've got to give people an opportunity to serve.'' Well, I thoroughly agree with the general, people should be able to contribute to this society in whatever way they best can, whether by enlisting in the military or by enrolling in school and obtaining the skills needed to become productive members of our workforce, our communities, and by extension, our Nation.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (INTERNATIONAL FOOD CRISIS AND HAITI -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Madam Speaker, moving from food for fuel to food for food, we come to the floor tonight to talk about the international food crisis. We're going to look at the causes and effects and possible solutions. We're also going to take a closer look at the situation in Haiti, a country that is only approximately 400 miles off our coast, our neighbor in the Western hemisphere, a country that is arguably one of the worst off in this global food crisis. 
   There are many causes of the food crisis that we face now. Some of the causes are recent developments and others have been developing for years. 
   This year we saw lower crop yields because of weather and global climate change. There is increased demand for processed foods from countries with growing middle classes like China and India. There's an increased demand for biofuels like ethanol, which is primarily made from corn. And in response to high commodity prices, a number of countries introduced export bans to preserve food for their own populations, while decreasing the world's supply. 
   This graph illustrates the record-high food prices that brought on this crisis: Wheat prices up 81 percent in 2007; soybean prices up 71 percent in 2007. Rice, which feeds almost one-half of the world's population, its price increased 144 percent since January of this year. Corn prices shot up 24 percent since January of 2008, and the rise came right after this Congress passed a landmark energy bill requiring increased use of ethanol. 
   The effects of this food crisis. We know that in the industrialized countries, food purchases accounts for 10 to 20 percent of consumer spending. However, in developing countries, that figure is more like 60 to 80 percent of consumer spending. 
   People in poor countries already spend a much greater percentage of their incomes on food, and now they are forced to spend even more on food. 
   This food crisis is pushing people into poverty and worsening the situation of those already living in poverty. The World Bank estimates that more than 100 million people will be pushed into poverty because of rising food prices. 
   Rising food prices have led to food riots around the world, across Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. In Pakistan and Thailand, troops are guarding farmers' crops. In Egypt, troops are baking bread for the thousands of people waiting in bread lines. 
   The situation in Haiti. Haiti has the lowest, poorest standard of living in the Western hemisphere. About 80 percent of the Haitian population currently survives on less than $2 a day and survives on one meal a day. Most of Haiti's basic food commodities are imported, leaving the country especially vulnerable to fluctuating world commodity prices. 
   Late last month, the perfect storm of high energy and oil costs and commodity expenses erupted in what has been described as food riots. 
   Haiti's poorest have resorted to selling mud cakes, a mixture of mud, oil and sugar that quiets rumbling, hungry stomachs. 
   Rising food prices threaten security in Haiti. Protests over the rising costs of food last month turned violent with six people killed, including a U.N. peacekeeper. 
   High food costs in Haiti in part also led to political unrest, with the dismissal of Prime Minister Jacques Edouard-Alexis just recently. 
   As we look at what is happening in Haiti today, it's a reminder to us that the economic climate of the United States, our ability and capacity to influence and impact commodities around the world have a ripple effect, and that what we do in the U.S. to secure ourselves, we must keep an eye to our neighbors in more vulnerable circumstances, such as the Nation of Haiti. 
   We here in the U.S. Congress recently had a codel sponsored in part by the CBC to Haiti, and while there, we had an opportunity to talk about what we need to do to be supportive of our neighbor in the Western hemisphere. 
   And one of the major concerns for me in this trip was just some of the issues and concerns that we as Americans have not been as educated about. For instance, were you aware that the average age in Haiti is under 50 years old; that the mortality rate is extremely high; that the age for mortality for most women is 56 years of age and for men, 52 years of age; that the average Haitian eats only one meal a day? These are issues that need to be of concern to us. 
   Why is that? It needs to be of concern to us because certainly, as one of our closest neighbors, one of the democratic allies of the Western hemisphere, these conditions, if sustained over a long period of time, speak to a humanitarian crisis, speak to destabilization, not only of Haiti but of the entire region, which includes a border that is 400 miles away from the U.S. border. 
   And so we here are looking at congressional action that will address this food crisis. One of the things that we have quickly moved to do in the Democratic Caucus is an emergency supplemental appropriation which was passed just last week which included $1.86 billion in funding for food aid in PL 480 programs, administered by the U.S.D.A. and USAID; $200 million in development assistance; $400 million for disaster assistance; and $20 million for the World Food Programme. 
   The farm bill passed just last week also included provisions allowing the  USAID to preposition more food overseas to respond to disaster faster; in addition, more money for non-emergency food aid, like development projects; increased discretionary funding for emergency food aid programs like Food for Peace and U.S. Agency for International Development to the tune of about $2.5 billion have also been expended; extension and expansion of Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act, or the HOPE Act, which provides for duty-free preferences for imports from Haiti. 
   And then the Jubilee Act passed last month which would assist Haiti in its international debt load and recommends the immediate cancellation of Haiti's outstanding debts. 
   Solutions for the food crisis. With respect to Haiti, we need to extend temporary protected status to Haitians in our country, allowing them to work legally here, enabling them to send remittances home. This is the most inexpensive form of aid we can grant to Haiti. When remittances are sent home, it forms about a quarter of Haiti's GDP at this point, and so we would be doing not only ourselves a service but a service to the people of Haiti and Haitian Americans here in our hemisphere. 
   On the global level, we need to meet the immediate need including funding shortfalls of $755 million at the World Food Programme and $240 million at USAID, which this Congress has already begun to do. 
   We need to strengthen our social safety nets like nutrition programs and school feeding sites to prevent future food security issues from reaching the crisis level. 
   I've spoken to you already about the youth of Haiti and the fact that the population there is so very young. We need to be clear that malnutrition is running rampant, and if we really want to help Haiti to change course, we must start with their young, and we must be able to improve the opportunities for children to have access to nutritious meals. 
   We need to increase agriculture development aid to assist developing countries in establishing their own agriculture infrastructure, so countries won't be so dependent on foreign supplies in the future. And that's a pretty complex scenario, because when we look at the way that our farm system has been set up in the United States, it has really created a paradigm where, due to the subsidies that we make to our farmers, it is actually less expensive for Nations abroad to purchase our rice than to grow and compete against the subsidized market. So we will have to find a balance there to enable farmers in Haiti to expand and to be prepared to export to other Nations and be able to compete at real prices with the production of rice in our country and other countries around the world. 
   And finally, we need to significantly increase investments in agricultural research so our scientists can develop better crops that can withstand disease, drought and produce higher yields, and then deliver those crops to farmers around the world. 
   I am just so honored to be joined this evening by a number of my colleagues who also attended the codel, some of whom are members of the CBC, some of whom are members of the Hunger Caucus here in Washington in the U.S. House of Representatives, and it is my pleasure at this time to yield to the gentlewoman from California, the Honorable Barbara Lee.

   Ms. CLARKE. Let me thank you, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, for your leadership, along with Chairwoman Kilpatrick, for seeing how important it was for us to be on the ground in Haiti as a delegation with a presence to bring some comfort and some hope to the nation that our eyes are not shut to the crisis that is taking place there, and that they do have friends, allies, and supporters here in the United States that will not forsake them, that that nation can know now that the United States' eyes are wide open. And as we see their fate go down, we know that it is our responsibility not to let it happen, and that we will be vigilant around the resource and support that is required to help Haiti to stand up and to go forward in the 21st century boldly and 
   stronger than ever before. 
   So I want to thank you again, Barbara Lee from California, for your ongoing commitment. I've come to this Congress to meet you and to see the work that you have been doing and just to join my voice in synchronization with you so that we can sing a louder song for the causes that you have championed even before I arrived here. Thank you. 
   The gentleman from Texas, Al Green, you, too, were a part of our delegation. Thank you for joining us in this Special Order to talk about international hunger and the crises in Haiti.

   Ms. CLARKE. Thank you very much, Congressman Al Green. Thank you for your impassioned comments this evening. 
   I think it's important that when we speak of the need to build out our relationships around the world, that as we've travel to many regions around the globe, that we not neglect our own hemisphere, that we recognize that there are nations of people. And I think what's important to point out is that Haiti is a nation about the size of Maryland in terms of geographic size. It has 9.3 million people there. So when you hear the statistics quoted about the number of people in poverty, when you hear about the number of children in poverty, the percentage of people making $1 or $2 a day, put that in the context of a population of 9.3 million people, and then you get the sense of what we're talking about in terms of a humanitarian crisis.     
   Let me now turn to the gentlewoman from Illinois, who has joined us and has been a fighter and one who has stood up and has produced on behalf of the  Hunger Caucus and the people of Haiti, Ms. Jan Schakowsky.

   Ms. CLARKE. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) for her breadth and depth of knowledge of the relationship that the United States has had with the Nation of Haiti and what we need to do to turn the tide around. It's a critical piece, and certainly as we look at our hemisphere going forward in the 21st century, what our expectations are for the development of not only the United States of America but our neighbors in the region, your words, your knowledge is going to be a critical part of what we are going to need going forward. And I thank you for taking the time to be a part of this Special Order. The people of the United States thank you for your commitment and certainly the people of my district who are really  concerned about their family and their relations in Haiti. Thank you for your commitment, and we look forward to further conversation and collaboration on the issue of hunger internationally and specifically the rebirth and the regrooming of Haiti. 
   And I would like to just point out life expectancy, again, for women in Haiti is 56 years old. Life expectancy for men in Haiti, 53 years old. It's amazing in the 21st century that less than 400 miles away from the United States of America, we have people dying in the prime of their life due to a lack of food, due to lack of opportunity. They can stand on the edge of their shores and see the bright lights of Florida shining across the seas, but they can't reach for that level of potential within their own boundaries and their own nation. And when we look at the relationships that we establish with other nations around the globe, one has to wonder why, with a nation the size of Maryland and the population of 9.3 million people, we haven't seen fit yet to establish the type of relationship that creates a symbiotic relationship, fertile land on a fertile island; yet people are starving. 
   At this time I would like to acknowledge my cohost for this evening's Special Order. She is no stranger to most of us, to all of us. She has been an outstanding leader in this Congress and has been an outspoken leader, the most knowledgeable person that I have had an opportunity to interact with on international affairs, on homeland security, and has been a true mentor to me, and that's none other than the Congresswoman and the gentlewoman from Texas, the Honorable Sheila Jackson-Lee.

   Ms. CLARKE. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding and for posing that question because certainly Haitian Americans are very aware of the history, the role that they played in helping the United States acquire what was then called the Louisiana Territory that completed our United States and the side-by-side battle in the Revolutionary War. And they wonder why the relationship has not been a much more prosperous one between the two nations, why they have been forsaken over so long. 
   Haiti has been an independent Nation for over 200 years, 205 years, to be exact, and certainly have been worthy of being a partner in the development in this hemisphere. And they are concerned. They are concerned that perhaps there is some bias involved, there's some discrimination because they're a Nation 95 percent of African descent, and they have been used during different times in our history to halt the spread of Communism. But they have never reaped any real reward or collaboration. 
   I think we are all open now, understanding that we are connected. We are in a global economy, we are in a global world. As our prices spike, the impact has a ripple effect around the world, as we talk about food for fuel versus food for food, what the impact has been around the world. I think that is most demonstrably shown with the Nation of Haiti. And none of us can turn a blind eye to that. 
   So I want to thank the gentlelady for raising that question. We are winding down now. To my cohost, thank you very much for, again, being a mentor and someone who provides guidance and understanding around some very complex issues with regard to why we do or do not do the things that we need to do, that are imperative for us to do in terms of our international relations, in terms of our hemisphere, in terms of just getting information permeated throughout the body to get a consensus on a way to go.     
   I think we are well on the way. We have got some commitments so far. We want to be vigilant in our oversight and seeing them go through. But we do want to press for TPS. We know that that can be a real part of the economic sustainability of the Nation, which is critical, and while we come in with other strategies for immediate relief for the hunger that takes place.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Thank you so much, Mr. Meek. It's great to be back here once again with the 30-Something Working Group in what I call my sophomore year of my freshman term. I wanted to just share some reflections on the economic stimulus package, because I think before we even get to the point of looking at where our economy is today, there should be a moment to pause and look back about 7 years ago when our Nation's budget was in surplus. And in such a short amount of time we've seen our economy just totally get out of kilter, get out of whack, a lot of hocus-pocus being done in the markets, particularly around subprime mortgages, in addition to the fact that there's just been a slow economic growth in some of the sectors that have traditionally provided that economic growth and boost in our economy. 
   But it's great to know that we all recognize the writing on the wall, and that there wasn't the type of struggle that we have seen around other pieces of legislation with regard to economic stimulus. It was bipartisan effort, and we recognized that it was important and critical that we do this timely, we do it targeted, and we make sure it's temporary because, as my colleague, Mr. Meek, has already stated, we're borrowing this money. But we know it's important. It's important to jump-start our economy. It's on life support right now, and this is just the type of jolt that we need. It, as has been stated, gives hundreds of dollars to people who will spend it. That is the ultimate goal here is that we spend this money, that we get it back into the stream of economic growth as quickly as possible.     
   And that will be going to 130 million American families and seniors, including about 8.3 million families in my home State of New York. And what we were able to determine is that the average rebate for New York families would be about $807, putting an estimated $6.7 billion into the hands of New Yorkers, into the hands of those who really, really need it. 
   And I think what is so crafty about the stimulus package that the Democrats led here in our caucus was the fact that we looked at the struggle that our parents are having; that for our children there's going to be a rebate for each child in the family; that there will be an ability for us to make sure that our small businesses are able to invest in new equipment and that workers will have half a million jobs by the end of this year. 
   We are looking at providing relief for lower wage and part-time workers by guaranteeing at least $300 for those who are making at least $3,000 in earned income. 
   This is phenomenal. It's unfortunate that we have to come to these measures, but we know that this stimulus is going to be going directly to those who have suffered the most in our economic crises right now. And I think that the Democratic caucus has certainly led the way with innovation with regard to this stimulus package, and I want to commend, to the extent that I can, the folks on the other side of the aisle who saw that this was a much needed measure and did not spend a whole lot of time debating it but putting it in place, so that by May of this year, we should begin to see some of this really kick into effect across this Nation. It's extraordinary. 
   You know, our Democratic Party worked with our Republican counterparts in the House and the Senate and the administration to pass this quick relief to help prevent a full-fledged recession, but we didn't get everything we wanted. We really didn't just get everything we wanted. We got it done quickly. 
   I believe that we need to expand upon the stimulus to keep the relief coming, because even after the rebate checks come, there are people who will continue to be hurting. We need to increase funding for food stamp programs and unemployment benefits, then we need to address the infrastructure problems in our country, Mr. Speaker, including needed repair to our schools, waste water systems, transportation systems, which will also create jobs. We need to invest in affordable housing. That creates jobs. But it also creates local economic development. 
   Creating jobs through many different means, and the buzz word is ``green'' jobs, which is, of course, looking at renewable energies and how we really embed that into our economy, so that as we wean ourselves off of the dependency of foreign oil, we see the growth of industry across this Nation from the rural parts of our Nation to the urban parts of our Nation, like New York City, where green jobs can be a major engine for sustainable growth in our Nation. 
   Of course, we have looked at summer jobs, which is critical. This is a way that we can immediately impact, particularly on our young people and their families, is by giving them that opportunity for exposure to the workplace in the summer job capacity, job training for our workforce, to reorient them to a lot of the emerging industries that we have. We just need the jobs. 
   So we have a full plate ahead of us. Economic stimulus is just the beginning. That is just shocking the system so we can begin to put the treatments in place to repair and restructure it, and I'm really looking forward to that, because coming out of this Democratic caucus had real innovation, real forward thinking, and real focus on the needs of our people. 
   As has been stated, Mr. Meek, you are struggling with the foreclosure crisis in your community. I'm struggling with it in my community where we're in the process of rolling out a series of clinics so that people will feel free to come forth and have their financial situations assessed, their mortgages assessed. Those that can be refinanced, we want to get them in the stream right away, because this is predicted to be a foreclosure phenomenon that will last a number of years. 
   So we want to try to head it off at the pass for those who may be struggling today. And this economic stimulus package can at least put some funds into the stream by helping homeowners who are struggling with their mortgages and who are in danger of losing their homes. 
   So I'm excited about the fact that the President signed the package today and that we can get the wheels of the bureaucracy moving to get this stimulus into the stream, into our communities, into the hands of our families as quickly as possible. It's really an important measure, and I look forward to seeing it implemented in each of our communities.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. What I found interesting was our commitment to small business in the stimulus package. I think that too often small business is overlooked and forsaken for the big, megacorporate folks who are always getting the tax breaks. But this stimulus package also takes into account our small business, our ``mom and pop,'' our emerging new start-ups and other organizations in our communities. 
   The plan will double the amount small businesses can immediately write off their taxes for capital investments made in 2008 from $125,000 to $250,000, and for purchases of new equipment up to $800,000 from $500,000. And that's significant because with the cost rising for materials, and there is a rising cost for oil, and people don't recognize what the rising cost in oil alone does to small business, particularly for those who have to have their goods or their services trucked or shipped. All of that goes into the bottom line of someone who is trying to operate a small operation. It also provides immediate tax relief for all businesses to invest into new plants and equipment by speeding up the depreciation provisions so that firms can write off an additional 50 percent off of investments purchased in 2008. That is extraordinary. 
   That is extraordinary because, again, because small business is really saddled with the weight of an economy that has been skyrocketing, particularly with the cost of oil and with the cost of doing business overall just escalating each and every year. 
   And we expect that there will be about $7.5 billion sent out to small business and small business investments over the next 10 years, close to $44 billion in 2008 alone. 
   So we have looked at every sector of our economy that may be struggling as a result of the sluggishness of the economy at this time, and a recession in some areas; some folks would say even depression in others. But for our businesses, it's important that we provide that buffer so that they're enabled to continue to grow, notwithstanding the challenges that they're facing right now. 
   So we have covered many bases with this stimulus package. We have covered both the home and the family as well as the small business environment of our communities. And I hope that, as you've said, everyone will take advantage of the rebates and the incentives that have been built into this stimulus package because we are counting on you to spend it out there. It's important. We want to make sure that we can provide the life support to our economy that's required so we don't fall in any deeper into economic crisis. 
   And this is just the opening salvo. We have a lot more to work out for our communities, for our Nation with regard to sustainable job development and job growth, and I'm looking forward to that part of the conversation, because we are in the 21st century here. We've got the talent, the expertise. We've got the ability out there. We have to be able to make sure that we drive the process of economic growth right here starting from the Hill.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Meek, I think you're being too kind. We have to put this where this is. The President released his last budget, and this budget is devastating. It's a Republican budget that plunges our country deeper into debt, a debt that we will pass onto our children, our grandchildren, and maybe even our great-grandchildren if we don't turn this situation around and turn it around quickly. 
   In the area of health care alone, the types of cuts in Medicare and Medicaid for our seniors and to low-income Americans, it's unconscionable. Again, we're facing a crisis in health care. And what are we seeing? Cuts. Cuts to the SCHIP program that are almost $20 billion over the next 5 years. After all we've done to try to expand the program for all eligible children, the National Institutes of Health funding frozen just as we're about to have some breakthroughs in research around Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease and cancer and other diseases that we're desperately looking for treatment and cure for. I mean, in the area of education, and this is supposed to be the leave-no-child-behind administration, we see that the budget totally eliminates crucial programs that provide to the States for technology in classrooms. It eliminates vocational education programs altogether. It completely eliminates the supplemental  educational opportunity grants, Perkins loan programs. I mean, our commitment to the development of our Nation has to include a robust educational system. 
   We are in competition with nations from around the world. And in other nations they're cranking out their engineers and their scientists by the hundreds. We're struggling to keep up. We're struggling to be competitive. This Republican budget does nothing to aid in our cause to go forward in a robust manner. It reduces the funding for after-school programs by over 26 percent. 
   These are the areas where our communities, our States across this Nation need the support systems in place now that we have a 21st century society where parents are working, where they're not going to be there necessarily all the time at 3 o'clock to pick up their children from school. This is that period of time where all law enforcement agencies will tell you that children get into trouble between 3 and 6 o'clock. Here we see this Republican budget does not take into account the realities of the lives of the constituents that we present. So we're going to have to bring that to the table and make sure that is a part of the conversation as we move forward to shape what has been presented to us, which is really something that is devastating to our Nation at this time. 
   Homeland security. Now this is an area that really hits home for me. Coming from New York City, knowing what has gone into just building out a new bureaucracy to address our concerns for safety and for real protection of our homeland, to hear after all that our first responders have done to really bring themselves up to speed to be able to meet the needs of their jurisdictions, to then have the Federal Government renege on its commitment to them is a shame and it's a sham. To cut assistance to firefighters where local fire departments have needed equipment to keep our communities safe is unconscionable, totally unconscionable. For example, in New York State where New York City's FDNY are considered national heroes, almost $32 million have been cut in funding. Where do they get that money from? Where are these departments around this Nation going to be able to make up for the shortfall of the commitment made to them by our national leader? Unbelievable. 
   Cuts to homeland security grant programs, which funds every State based on risk by $750 million, that's an ounce of prevention there, and we see it being pulled away.     
   The important Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, homeland security funding received an increase of only $5 million, which is not even enough to keep up with inflation. So what are we talking about here? 
   I often hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and their concern about border protection. Well, this is it folks. And it's the other side of the aisle that has turned the other way in addressing the priorities through this budget. Cuts to port security, critical transportation infrastructure, targeted infrastructure protection grants programs, and other important homeland security programs, right before our very eyes. And one of the areas that I would have thought we would have really just taken a little time to get fixed up, the Office of Appeals of Redress, which was totally left out of the budget, this department is the department that is responsible for enabling us to travel across this Nation. And for those who have, unfortunately, been put on the terrorist watch list, this is the area where just a little bit of funding would have made the difference between how we are currently conducting business that has shown a low value for our civil liberties and really bringing our processes up to date to meet the needs of real Americans. 
   So it's devastating. This budget is not reflective of the needs that Americans have been talking about, are concerned about, and it's unfortunate. But it's my hope that we will push, we will move, we will negotiate so that we can get some of this turned around in time for it to make a difference in our lives. 
   Just think about cuts to child care development block grants, when so many parents now need that extra assistance to be able to make sure that their families are well taken care of as they earn income to keep up with the cost of living. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, as my colleague Mr. Meek talked about, this is critical in the northeast region where energy costs are skyrocketing and we're seeing some of the worst record winters in my lifetime, perhaps in many folks' lifetime, and not only here but in the Midwest and up the whole northern seacoast. 
   Social services block grants, these have been the areas where our communities have been just sort of held together by a safety net. It continues to be cuts. 
   And then of all places, veterans' health care. We talk so much about our concern and our gratitude to veterans particularly in this time of war, and it is just so hypocritical to see the type of budget cuts that are taking place in terms of health care services for our wounded warriors. This is unbelievable. 
   The Republican budget also assumes that the alternative minimum tax is not fixed. This assumes a significant increase in taxes for over 21 million Americans after 2009, 21 million Americans, and enacting a permanent fix to prevent this tax from taking effect will cost about $313 billion over the next 5 years, and it is something that we as Democrats are committed to doing. Yet nothing, we receive nothing in this budget that indicates that we are gearing up to address this very important issue for working-class Americans. 
   The Republican budget does not contain accurate numbers for the cost of the Iraq War, as has been stated by my colleague Mr. Meek, and the administration requested $70 billion, but the average monthly cost of the war is over $10 billion a month. That means that the true cost of the war will be upwards of at least a baseline of $120 billion next year. 
   So as you can see, we have a real dilemma. The dilemma is do we accept the last budget of Mr. Bush, the Republican budget, which continues to plunge our country deeper and deeper into debt, or do we, as we have in the Democratic caucus, continue to push, to organize, to negotiate, to make sure that the needs of all Americans are attended to in this upcoming budget? It's a mammoth task, but I believe, Mr. Meek, we are up to it. It is critical that we do this. We have to get on good ground going forward. I mean, it's going to take a lot to get us out of this deficit. 
   First of all, we are going to have to bring an end to this war in Iraq because that's unfettered spending. That's unfettered spending. But, simultaneously, we need to really set priorities for the American people. And that priority has to be demonstrated in the budget that we pass here. It has to be demonstrated in the way in which we fund the critical areas of our growth and our development as a Nation. And, believe me, this budget falls far short of that. 
   It's time for folks to get their act together. This Republican budget plunges this country deeper into debt. We cannot afford that. We must become much more sober about our work here and recognize that in order for us to grow, we have to make sure our educational system is sound, our health care system is sound, and certainly make sure that our homeland is protected. And based on what we have received thus far, the Republican budget falls extremely short of that, and that is totally unacceptable. 
   So, Mr. Meek, I know that our time together here is winding down. I just wanted to say that this is a very important time for this House. And as we look at our priorities going forward, the stimulus package gave us a window into where we are right now, and that is we are in an economic crisis. And anyone who can't see the writing on the wall is walking around with blinders on. When you compound the economic distress that we are in with a budget that doesn't account for hundreds of billions of dollars that can be spent at a moment's notice, particularly in the misadventure in Iraq, and neglects to build the infrastructure of the Nation, areas of education where we become competitive, our talent is cultivated and developed, providing the support systems for working families like child care support, being able to make sure that we are healthy enough as Americans to continue to do the job and being productive, these areas are very important and crucial areas for us to move this Nation in the 21st century.  
   I think President Bush has thrown up his hands. This was his last budget. This was the best that he could do. And, unfortunately, it fell too short. 
   I want to thank you, my colleague, for sharing this time. I look forward to participating with you further in the future. 
   And I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this time during the 30-Something Working Group.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (THE CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Madam Speaker, today I rise to express my dismay regarding  the housing crisis. It's a multifaceted housing crisis. It's a mortgage crisis for home buyers. It's an inventory crisis for the affordable rentals. It is an investment crisis for public housing. 
   Two top executives at Countrywide Financial are expected to receive a combined golden parachute totaling $19 million, and while these top executives cash out their stock options, hardworking Americans are left struggling, trying to prevent the loss of their homes and ultimately their financial ruin. 
   It is truly incredible how the Bush administration, SEC Chairman Cox, Treasury Secretary Paulson, and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke have seen fit to extend billions of dollars for a Wall Street bailout but won't provide additional, adequate aid to borrowers fighting every day to save their properties. 
   Today, we are looking at one of the biggest financial catastrophes since the Great Depression. 
   Brooklyn, New York, has five of the top 10 neighborhoods with the highest subprime lending rates, including East Flatbush, which is located in my district. 
   Madam Speaker, after analysis and examination, the sharp increases in foreclosures are connected to predatory lending practices from abusive lending institutions. New York City will likely see more than 10,000 foreclosures this year, which is roughly double the number of foreclosures in 2004. 
   But while Washington is concerned about the impact of the subprime mortgage crisis on Wall Street, on Main Street many hardworking people are getting left behind. Hardworking families and individuals like those I represent in central Brooklyn have for far too long been targets of predatory lending practices; yet this administration comes to the rescue of the high-profile executives and leaves the very people who they are sworn to serve, defend, and protect to fend for themselves. 
   We must not forget that there is another dimension to the housing crisis occurring in communities less traveled by many, in the community where many are suffering from the affordable rental housing crisis. These families are being squeezed out of their homes as landlords convert their apartments to high-priced condominiums, earning double-digit rent increases or opting out of Federal subsidy programs such as Mitchell-Lama or project-based section 8 as more affordable rental apartments are being lost while the demand increases. 
   Let's not forget as well public housing's vital role in this housing crisis. Public housing is home to more than 400,000 New Yorkers. The New York City Housing Authority, which has a running deficit of more than $200 million every year, has been severely reducing their spending on security, maintenance, sanitation, and repairs, leaving many residents living in uninhabitable conditions. 
   NYCHA had to lay off employees and close youth centers in an attempt to preserve its core services, and in housing projects located in neighborhoods such as Brownsville, Brooklyn, crime continues to reach into the lives of our families. 
   Public housing is essential to New York City, and this negligence simply cannot continue. 
   So, in conclusion, Madam Speaker, the Bush administration's actions, or lack thereof, clearly demonstrates that instead of preventing the devastating loss to our communities by providing financial assistance to homeowners, providing full funding to reduce the affordable housing stock from dwindling, and preventing public housing units from deteriorating, our President has taken the path of least resistance by bailing out corporate fat cats and turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the hard-working families of my district and of our Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues to turn this devastating condition around and restoring the pride and dignity of responsible, thriving communities.

   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to give my enthusiastic support to the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, H.R. 2669. I want to thank Chairman Miller for his leadership in this matter. 
   In the advent of the 21st century, the question we must ask ourselves is, what have we done to ensure the success of our Nation, the development of our civil society? Education has been and will always be the portal for our advancement. 
   The cost of attending college has increased by 40 percent over the past 5 years. As a result, students are graduating with more debt than ever and postponing enrollment or avoiding college all together because they just can't afford it. This legislation is a much-needed sigh of relief for traditional college students, working families and adult learners in my home district in Brooklyn, New York, and across this Nation. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act cuts interest rates in half on subsidized student loans over the next 5 years, increases the amount of Federal loans available to students, and so I ask your enthusiastic support for this groundbreaking legislation.

   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, it has been extraordinary. 
   To the gentleman from Florida, I would like to thank you for welcoming me and all of my colleagues with open arms, and just to say to you that it is very clear that the winds of change are  blowing here in the House of Representatives. And I find it just sort of ironic that the rhetoric does not necessarily match the outcome. We do see bipartisan voting taking place right now, and I think the American people need to know that this 110th Congress in the first 100 legislative hours today alone by a margin of 356-71 voted for cutting interest rates in student loans. 
   Now, if my recollection is clear, in the 109th Congress I doubt that that would have ever occurred. And I think that we need to give credit where credit is due, and credit is due to the winds of change that the people of the United States have made clear through their votes in the November election. We have heeded that very significantly in the first 96-odd hours of the 100 hour agenda, and we have done the American people good. We have done them good. 
   So I am excited about it. I am just a freshman from Brooklyn, New York, but I am trying to make my way, and I see that we have heeded the call and that we are active in pursuit of the mandates that the American people have set forth for us.

   Ms. CLARKE. I thank the gentleman from Florida. 
   I just wanted to pick up on all the excitement. I think the velocity and the momentum that has been built in the 110th Congress is something that is reverberating around the Nation. 
   As I went back to my district over the King holiday weekend, the enthusiasm and just the whole buoyancy of how people feel about the work we have been doing, it is uplifting, quite frankly. I think we need to capture that and make sure we use that as a motivation to continue along this path. 
   Just think about going home to New York City and people talking about real homeland security. We passed legislation that directly impacted on the town from which I am from. And certainly as someone whose father was in the World Trade Center in the 1993 attack, we recognize how very serious it is to reapportion the formula based on risk.     
   And just last week we were able to make that adjustment. We were able to organize things so that we can address port security and first responders in a meaningful, tangible way based on risk. And that says a lot about how we are going to operate as a body. 
   Everyone in New York saw the formulas before as just some of the most overt political pandering that you could possibly do. But now we have restored to them the faith that we can do what we have been sent to do, which is to create policy that protects and that uplifts our Nation. 
   And so my hat is off to the leadership, Speaker Pelosi, and everyone who has really tapped into the pulse of the American people. Because when you talk about a minimum wage raise in a city like New York, where the cost of living has been something that has created such a gap in people's lives, where raising the minimum wage just enables them to get by, is extraordinary for the rest of our Nation. It is extraordinary for all of us. 
   And we have an obligation to continue along this path, in making sure that everything that the American people have demanded of us, and I think the 6 in 2006 has really made it tangible, addresses that in a forthright way. I feel really great about where we are right now, and I look forward to working with all of these gentlemen in a movement to really move our civil society to where it needs to be, to make that paradigm shift and focus us as one of the greatest nations of humankind.

   Ms. CLARKE. Thank you very much to the gentleman from Connecticut for sharing that, because I can only say ``ditto.'' 
   We are, I believe, doing what needs to be done for the future of the Nation. While we see the immediate impact because we were campaigning and there were certain issues that had come before us, when I look at the fact that 8th graders, who will be entering college in 5 years, will be paying half the interest rate that current college students are paying, we are making a substantive difference in people's lives. That could encourage that one student who was saying there is no way my family can afford it to say, you know what, I can make it. And that is what this is about, future generations. 
   I want to thank the leadership, Mr. Meek, Mr. Ryan, for giving us this forum in which we can reach out to the American people to come together in common cause with our colleagues, and even some of those folks on the other side of the aisle, to really do the work that is needed to be done for future generations. We have been doing it in the first 100 hours, and I look forward to doing it even more so as we move forward in the 110th session. 
   I yield to you, Mr. Ryan.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) for the time and for the opportunity to discuss an important issue to me. 
   With every passing day, I hear more talk about how to prevent illegal immigration. We're discussing it at this very moment. Many proposals to deal with undocumented immigrants involve punishing them through deportation or what has been termed as ``touchback,'' which requires immigrants to expel themselves and pay a heavy, extremely punitive fine. 
   However, we could best reduce the number of undocumented immigrants by improving and reforming our own government bureaucracy. While many Members of this body believe that every undocumented immigrant walked across the southern border, the fact is that 40 percent of them enter our country legally, and many of them have only broken the law after falling through the cracks of a vast bureaucracy. 
   Back home in Brooklyn, New York, an area that boasts immigrants from every corner of the world, I have personally talked to countless people who were frustrated because they had no intention of breaking the law, but simply became tied up in an overly complicated and backlogged system as their applications were delayed until their visas expired and suddenly they were here illegally. 
   I'm further concerned with the proposed fee increases at CIS to process applications. All of the people who emigrate here from other countries have come looking for a better life. Many of these people work hard at jobs that pay so little that most Americans do not want to take them. 
   We cannot expect these individuals to pay astronomical fees that they cannot afford, as this effectively creates another barrier to citizenship for many immigrants who only want to make an honest living, and leaves those who cannot pay in undocumented limbo. We in Congress must ensure that CIS has the funding it requires to be efficient and effective without resorting to taking money from those who cannot afford the extremely punitive costs. 
   As the debate on immigration reform progresses, it is vital that we address these issues and ensure that CIS will be able to help everyone who desires to play by, and be in compliance with, the rules. It is simply not right that many people have been deemed criminals simply because our government is ill-equipped to process these applications or because we have made it totally unaffordable. 
   I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) for his efforts at improving the legal immigration process, and I look forward to working together to bring about improvements and reforms to an immigration system that is reflective of the 21st century United States.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (RELIEF FOR ENTREPRENEURS: COORDINATION OF OBJECTIVES AND VALUES FOR EFFECTIVE RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Chairman, first, I want to commend Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for her leadership on this issue and for bringing this bill to the House floor. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1361, a bill to improve the disaster relief program of the Small Business Administration and to provide relief for entrepreneurs. This bill addresses the problems with the SBA's disaster loan program, which was implemented to provide timely financial assistance in the form of low-interest loans and working capital for businesses devastated by disasters. 
   In New York City, after 9/11, small businesses that once prospered near the World Trade Center had difficulty recovering from that tragedy. Four years later, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, many applicants of SBA disaster assistance were frustrated with the agency's response or lack thereof. 
   Many businesses found their loan applications were delayed in backlogs that took over a year to process without a well-informed, centralized point of contact within the agency. 
   For entrepreneurs struggling to get back on their feet, the old adage ``time is money'' is much more than a cliche. Economic distress can quickly digress into systemic unemployment for the thousands of employees and bring extreme hardship to America's families. 
   I support the intent of this bill because it will ensure that the SBA performs comprehensive, risk-based, disaster planning on an annual basis and that the agency has mechanisms in place to maintain its disaster readiness over the long term. 
   This new bill will also enhance the SBA's disaster loan program by improving the manner in which disaster  loans are processed, approved and disbursed, and by providing the agency with the additional financial assistance tools that are intended to better fit the various needs of small businesses following a disaster. 
   I will cast an ``aye'' vote in support of an unamended H.R. 1361, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.  
   The RECOVER Act of 2007 is a bill that will ensure that members of Congress are adequately informed about all aspects of SBA's disaster assistance and disaster planning programs so that they may provide the SBA with the support they need to fulfill their vital mission following a disaster.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, our chairman, Ms. CAROLYN KILPATRICK, and the 42 other members, it's my privilege to come and discuss the topic of the hour--I believe the topic of the century--and that is the collapse of our financial service sector and the proposed bailout that we've all heard of this past weekend. 
   You know, it wasn't that long ago that I heard a gentleman who was serving as Secretary of State to the United States saying to us, when we launched into Iraq and we knew that there was going to be a whole lot of trouble and it was going to be an expensive venture, that if we went in there and we broke it, we own it. Well, ladies and gentlemen, another example of breaking it, now owning it. 
   You know, the Bush administration and the folks on the other side of the aisle turned a blind eye and a deaf ear in the name of so-called ``free markets''--which, in fact, is not free and all Americans are learning today it's costing us $700 billion; very, very expensive lesson. Because when the call for regulation in this sector went on deaf ears and more deregulation was the mantra, and keeping the free market free led to this feeding frenzy that now has all of us pulling out our hair wondering how we got here. Well, I can tell you that in communities like mine, we got here because people were given bad loan products, they were given subprime loans. There was no investigation, due diligence done to make sure that individuals could, indeed, understand the terms and conditions in which they were being subjected. And we turned a blind eye to that. We felt that the crisis in the subprime market was only for those people, and it wouldn't impact on the overall society. So we said, well, poor  them, and they should have known better. Where are the folks screaming ``they should have known better'' now? Where are they now that the so-called folks in the know who should have known better allowed their corporate interests and corporate greed to supercede their obligation to our Nation, to our overall economy, to our well-being, where are they today? Well, they're meeting behind closed doors. 
   There are meetings taking place all over the place this evening, folks trying to scramble here and there to come up with the best deal for ``the bailout.'' Well, I can tell you that in just about all of the offices of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus the phones are ringing off the hook. They're ringing off the hook for people who have had to file bankruptcy because they had no health care insurance and someone got ill in the family and they had to use everything they owned to pay off health care costs that have skyrocketed and they've had to refinance and refinance and refinance their homes over and over again to get the money needed to help in a health care crisis. And we're getting phone calls from people who got their economic stimulus rebate only to face skyrocketing oil costs and gasoline costs and costs of living just going up while their wages have stayed stagnant. And we're getting calls from individuals who, due to lack of real management in these financial firms, are mid, low-level employees that are now unemployed and who also bought into the ``American dream'' and their mortgages are coming due and they don't know where their next check will come from. 
   Well, we are in an economic crisis, and I think we need to not have amnesia at this time. We need to remember where all of our financial woes have come from. They've come from an administration and a party that the free market is truly free, that the need for regulation is something that is not a part of being Americans when we regulate every other part of our lives and we regulate just about everything else we do except for the feeding frenzy and the greed that is taking place in this Nation over the past 12 years. 
   It's unfortunate that we've arrived at this moment in time, and it's a very expensive wake-up call for all of us. I understand that folks are moving very aggressively to address the financial crisis, as quoted by our speaker, Nancy Pelosi, ``to aggressively address the financial crisis.'' ``We will investigate the Bush administration's mismanagement of financial regulation, how it led to this crisis, and what solutions Congress can act upon.'' 
   ``I don't think the American people want us to wait until next year. We would hope to have something as soon as we can.'' And I agree. We must have some accountability here. This is not a time to use fear tactics, to get people to just go along, to get along. This is a time for accountability.     
   We are at a time where the crossroads have come and where we're right at that fork, and either we will continue with the same or we will make a change for the betterment of our civil society. 
   Let me just say that, as we look at this bailout, it is our hope that we will look at Main Street and, as opposed to the trickle-down economics that got us to where we are today, that we will start at Main Street and will look at the needs of those who have been given these flimflam subprime loans and will work to make sure that we can keep Americans in their homes. We need to come out of this process with a corridor or with a pathway for American families to be able to renegotiate their terms in the same way that our financial institutions are asking for the renegotiation of their terms. 
   What is good for those who have benefited from this feeding frenzy, from this bonanza, from this greed, from this run-on money is good enough for those who have had to pay the cost. It is our hope that that will be a part of what ultimately is negotiated so that we can pass in this House a bill that is reflective of the desire of the American people. 
   The financial rescue that we are asking to consider this week will require some legislative solutions. It will conduct investigations into how Wall Street actually got into this crisis, and it will clean up what has become a huge mess, and it will insulate Main Street from Wall Street. We want to know how we will prevent this from ever happening again. 
   Congress is ready to work, but we are ready to work as coequal partners in this process. We are not willing to have the administration dictate to us the terms under which we will do what needs to be done to set our financial house in order. It's not up to us to simply hand over a $700 billion blank check to those in the financial sectors who are now in crises and hope for a better outcome. 
   The CBC, working along with our colleagues throughout this body in the New Direction Congress, will work to protect taxpayers' interests. We will make sure that the necessary safeguards that we believe will provide a responsible solution will include independent oversight and protection for homeowners with reasonable limits on executive compensation for CEOs and for other top executives. 
   I think one of the things that really boggles the mind of the average, everyday American is the fact that the corporate CEOs have gotten away with wrecking their corporations while receiving bonuses--golden parachutes--when they're asked to leave. Now, for the average, everyday American, when they don't perform well at their jobs, all that they can expect is an escort out the door of their employers'. Yet somehow we've gotten it so twisted that we are actually giving rewards for bad performance. This has got to stop. 
   I do not understand how in a day and time when we're asking for accountability from everyone that we would enable these individuals who have been reckless in their endeavors to walk away scot-free. So we are clear that whatever we legislate this week will have implications for those who are in executive office and for those who are seeking to receive compensation as they depart from jobs poorly done. 
   I see that I have been joined this evening by the very distinguished gentleman from Chicago, Illinois, by a gentleman who has been a part of the Congressional Black Caucus for quite some time now and who has been a leader in education, in labor and in understanding the challenges of our urban communities across this Nation. I know he, like so many other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, has been getting phone calls throughout the weekend, starting Friday into today, nonstop, from his constituents who have been raising their concerns and their issues about the crisis that we're in, and they've been giving their advice about what they would like to see from us as a body representing their interests. 
   So, at this time, I yield as much time as he would like to consume to the gentleman from Chicago, Illinois, Congressman DANNY DAVIS.

   Ms. CLARKE. I thank the gentleman from Chicago, Illinois for his eloquence and for the sharing of his insights based on the constituency that he represents and based on the years of knowledge and on the years of experience that he has had here in Washington in dealing with these matters. 
   This is truly an unprecedented time, but we have got to look back a bit to really get a sense of how we got here. Follow me on this chart over here. It's building a wall of debt. 
   When you look back at the year 2001, our debt was at $5.8 trillion. Fast forward to 2009, and it is projected that our debt will have basically doubled in that time. Then let's also recollect the philosophy of the Bush administration and of the Republicans of this body. There was a great proclamation about the ownership society. That is, we want to make sure that this Nation is underpinned by the need and by the capacity and by the ability to own. 
   Well, at the end of the day, what we see is that we own a whole lot of debt. On top of this debt, we're going to be owning $700 billion in poor assets, in assets that no one else was able to leverage to create profit. There were all of those loans that were given to those who wanted to be a part of the ownership society. In their hearts, they knew it was the best thing to do, but they were seized upon by unscrupulous individuals who provided a product that was basically a pipe dream.     
   We were all part of the ownership society, all right. And in the words of Colin Powell, you broke it, you own it. And I just find it quite interesting that everyone is getting on TV, particularly those who were responsible because of their lack of stewardship, because of their breaking of the public trust, to say, you know, no one is to blame here. Well, when you pursue policies that create such damage to American finance, American households and communities, the American psyche, well, I think you need to own that too. 
   So today we are talking more about some of the proposals that are coming before us. I just want to put in a word about the fact that in this whole ownership society there was also a lack of discipline, and discipline can be shaped up in a number of different ways. 
   The way I like to discuss it, it has to do with regulation. I find it ironic that there are people in the financial world, real bigwigs, who have not been able to come to grips with the fact that their joyride is over, that happy days are not here again, but that they have driven our economy into the ground, and they are all lining up right now to want to be part of the solution, without regulation, without accountability. 
   Those days are over. I can tell you that the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the members of the Democratic Caucus, the Members of the new Congress are not going to sit by idly have false proclamations made without substantiation. 
   We have back in March of 2008 when we spoke about the issue of regulation and the need for regulation, our own President saying, ``I'm deeply concerned about law and regulation that will make it harder for the markets to recover, and, when they recover, make it harder for this economy to be robust.'' 
   Well, Mr. President, the markets failed with no regulation. Regulation was not a part of the equation here. 
   Then you have our nominee in the Republican Party, Senator McCain, who says, ``I am always for less regulation. I would like to see a lot of the unnecessary government regulations eliminated.'' March of this year. Now, everyone knew. Everyone knew this was coming down the pipe, and they are now the ones calling for regulation. 
   Well, now that the horse is out of the barn and the crisis has hit, it is easy to make that determination, because hindsight is 20-20. But when reasonable people pleaded, held hearings to talk about the need to regulate what was going on, when we saw predatory lending becoming a cancer, a gangrene in communities of color, when we saw the subprime foreclosure market just eat communities alive, there was no mercy. There was a wink and a nod, and the feeding frenzy continued. 
   Then it spread to the prime market, and the feeding frenzy continued. It continued so much so that in many of these financial institutions folks were almost delusional about the condition that their companies were in. Overnight it seemed, all of a sudden everything came cascading down. 
   You know, for the average American, we don't get bailouts. We get reprimanded. We get marginalized. We get being told that we are irresponsible. Yet I hear none of that terminology for all of these folks who have not only upset the U.S. market, their reckless behavior has upset the world market. The world market. 
   We have an over abiding obligation in the United States of America. We are looked to around the world for our excellence, for our ability to handle our affairs, and that has been eroded to nothing under the Bush administration. Not in one area can we say that we have held to the American ideals, and this economic crisis marks that. 
   Let me also share with you something you already know, and this has to do with our economy, it has to do with the loss of jobs. Back when Bill Clinton was President of the United States, as you can see, our economy was robust and we were on a path to prosperity with respect to job growth and development. 
   Under the Bush administration, in just 8 years we have brought so many families, so many communities into poverty. The number of new jobs needed per month to keep pace with the growth in the working age population, 150,000. And look at the performance of the Bush administration. 
   This says it all, folks. We are in an economic downturn. Individuals are unemployed, health care costs are skyrocketing, energy costs are through  the roof, financial markets are crashing. All of this, all of this did not happen overnight. It certainly hasn't happened since the new Congress. This was a building process. 
   And for individuals to stand up and say that it was the Democratic Congress that caused this to happen, it is insulting the intelligence of the American people. It started during a period of time where the philosophy was 
   in place that anything goes in the free market. It started when there was a philosophy in place that said that the ownership society is one that does not need to be regulated. It started and continued on a path of destruction under the leadership of the Bush administration. 
   Compounding that is the continued war in Iraq. Compounding that is the cost of health care, that grows exponentially each month. Compounding that is the loss and the hemorrhaging of jobs. So Wall Street has now caught up and our economy is so fragile that meetings are taking place throughout Capitol Hill in every nook and cranny to save, to save, our financial well-being. 
   When we say our financial well-being, it is truly our financial well-being, because we have known in urban communities for quite some time when the unemployment rate was rising that something was wrong. It was an indicator. When people began losing their homes, filing for bankruptcy. When folks who had formerly been middle-class had quickly in the blink of an eye become part of the working poor or homeless, no one shed a tear. And now every news media outlet is crying the woes of the financial giants. 
   Well, I guess this is the day of reckoning, and this is the time where the great equalizer is making things happen in real time, because this Congress has an obligation, and I certainly will not be voting for any bailout that does not include a bailout of the people that I represent. 
   When the Bush administration took office in 2001, it inherited a projected surplus for 2008 of $651 billion, $651 billion when they took office from the Democratic President Bill Clinton. The unemployment rate as we know it today continues to increase, from 4.7 percent to 6.1 percent, and shows no sign of slowing down. We are truly, truly being governed by an administration that has moved in the wrong direction, and our economy is a reflection of those policies. 
   So what is the House of Representatives being asked to do? Well, this week we will begin going over a number of proposals. The package that has been talked about so much in the press puts limits on executive compensation and sets the economic structure in a way in which we will advocate help for homeowners from foreclosure so the crisis will not cripple our communities. 
   We are calling for oversight. Oversight. The Government Accountability Office needs to monitor the progress of any proposed programs. We are granting the Treasury Department way too much power as estimated and as called upon by many of you out there in our communities, and there needs to be much more transparency. 
   The anything-goes Bush administration policies have been irresponsible. The non-regulation of financial institutions has led to this crisis, let there be no mistake about it. There is a lot of spin going on out there. There are a lot of folks who want to sugarcoat what has been in my estimation a dereliction of duty. 
   We need to move in a new direction, with responsible regulation and safeguards for middle-class folks, for folks who live in urban centers who have been paying for all of these bailouts. We will also launch an investigation of the regulatory failures and mismanagement that has treated our financial system as a cash cow for some. And, most importantly, we will build a future of financial security for those who are hurting in our Nation right now, in particular those who are in the working and middle-class. 
   It is clear that the administration has requested that Congress authorize in very short order very sweeping and unprecedented powers for the Treasury Secretary to confront a financial crisis of what people are saying are epic proportions. Well, that is going to come at a price as well. This administration has not demonstrated that it can be charged with the responsibility of managing the affairs of this Nation in a way in which harm is not done to its people. So, good luck with that one. 
   In working with the administration, we will strengthen the proposal by ensuring that the government is accountable to taxpayers in any future action under this broad grant of authority. 
   Now, we don't want to make this seem as though we are not going to work in a bipartisan manner. We are. But we are not going to have shoved down our throats policies that promote more of the same bad behavior. That behavior is gone, it is in the past, and we are saying that if you want to collaborate, we are willing to work with you, but there has to be a recognition of the failures so that we don't repeat them in the future.     
   When the Bush administration took office in 2001, there was a projected surplus of $651 billion. Today we stand on the advent of having to bail out the financial institutions of this Nation to the tune of $700 billion. 
   While people say that, well, this is not going to impact the budget because we are seeing this really as an investment as opposed to an expenditure, well, we have to expend it first, and we have to create an environment that encourages the purchase of what has been bad business. How we shape that is really up to those in the financial sector to come to the table. 
   But I can tell you, the American people will not be left holding the bag here. They will not be left holding the bag for those who decided that they were going to treat this country like their own personal ATM and that they were going to bankrupt us at a time when we should be experiencing great prosperity. 
   The debate has begun, the conversations are being had throughout the Capitol across party lines. As we concern ourselves about our financial instability, we reflect on those who live in our communities, who are senior citizens, who could have been hoodwinked into partially privatizing their Social Security and the proposals that are coming out of the Republican party to partially privatize and invest for health care. 
   If we had pursued those policies, can you imagine the hysteria in so many parts of our community where people have invested their lives, their well-being in a scheme that benefited the most wealthiest sectors of our Nation? 
   Can you imagine that under the Bush administration the tax cuts that were given to this same class of folks, the wealthy, and you look at the rising of the deficit, and you look at all of these indicators of greed, of free-market greed, you have to ask yourselves, do we and can we trust, again, an administration and a party that would be so derelict of duty, that would be so frivolous as to cause the type of hardship that we are all digging deep to endure right now? 
   Well, in this new Congress, under the Democratic leadership of Speaker Pelosi, that type of behavior has come to an end. As we debate, as we go over all of the proposals, as we vet every line, every comma, every period of what is being proposed for legislation, I assure you that the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, under the leadership of Congresswoman CAROLYN KILPATRICK, will keep their finger on the pulse of what is happening and what has happened and what must never be allowed to happen again within our communities, within communities across this Nation that have had to bear the brunt of this feeding frenzy, have had to shoulder the burden of economic crisis way before Wall Street met its day of reckoning. 
   We will be there to make sure that there is some parity for those who are struggling each month to keep up with that mortgage payment, for those who are concerned about how to juggle the mortgage payment with the home heating oil payment and the health care costs, for those who are still caught in the credit crunch and their child's tuition bill is coming up, to those who are just trying to get by and do their part as Americans. You are not forgotten in this new-direction Congress. 
   We stand with you, as a part of you, as we struggle through this debacle in our financial sector. I assure you, at the end of the day, we will come out of this process much stronger, much wiser, and certainly understanding  that the days of free-for-all feeding frenzy, unregulated financial markets in the United States are over. By extension, we will be setting an example for how business will be conducted around the world. 
   I thank you for being a wonderful Speaker pro tempore and for being there as we have our conversations during our CBC hour to open eyes and ears about the challenge that we will face this week. We will face it with all courage and dignity.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida, Ms. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, for her leadership on this issue, and at the advent of the Week of the Young Child, that we would take this time to really put things in focus. 
   You know, every time I go home to my district on the weekends there is a particular constituent of mine that no matter where he sees me, we say something to each other. He started this when I was running for office. And he said to me, ``Yvette, if you ever get elected, remember the children.''     
   Every time I run into the gentleman, he says the same thing to me over and over, and now that's how we greet each other: ``Remember the children.'' And while we're going through all of the challenges that we are facing in day-to-day life as adults, remembering the children is probably the most poignant message that we could give to this administration and, quite frankly, give to our constituencies and to this Nation. The investment we make in our youngest, most vulnerable today will be the difference in where this Nation will be in the next decade, the next score, the next 100 years. And the short-sightedness for so long in providing the real resource and support that our families need, that our parents need, that our mothers need, to give their children really what I believe they should be entitled to, because as you've stated already this evening, the science point to it. The earlier that we begin the education process for our children, the more advantaged they are. In communities of color, that means closing the gap, the achievement gap. We know this. It's well documented. Science backs it up. Yet the will, the will to really address this issue is really what we are addressing this evening. 
   And when we think about the fact that we were innovative enough to know that creating a Child Care and Development Block Grant was important, that's fluff with no substance when there's no funding to it. 
   And I have been very fortunate. I kind of grew up in the day care movement. Many people know my mother as a former councilwoman. But even prior to that, she started her career, one part of her career, let me put it that way, because she is the renaissance woman, but one of my earliest recollections of my mom and the work that she did was being a teacher's aide in a classroom in an early childhood education center. Some people call them day care centers. But I saw the certified teachers in the classroom. I saw the nutritious meals, the educational curricula that were developed just for these students. So I know better. I know that these are early childhood education. 
   She worked her way up from being a teacher's aide to an assistant teacher and then to a full class teacher. She then went on to become a day care director and then became a supervisor of several day care centers within our city's extensive child care system. 
   So the thousands, if not tens of thousands of lives that I've seen personally touched by an early childhood education experience, we can't put a dollar figure on it. These are young people who I run into today that say, ``I used to go to your mom's day care; I'm now a doctor.'' ``I used to in your mom's day care; I'm now a teacher.'' ``I used to be in your mom's day care; can I write you a check?'' I'm like, all right, that's really worth it. That's really worth it. 
   And I make light of it, but it's really up to us, the 110th Congress, to really push the envelope where this is concerned. This is where the rubber meets the road. We find ourselves in some really challenging times when it comes to workforce, workforce demands, the individuals who will be future employees. And we have talked about the challenge of our public school systems and truly adequately educating our students and our scholars when we have this opportunity right now to make it clear that we do stand for the education of our children. We do stand for providing for young children this opportunity to get that head start in life.

   Ms. CLARKE. I think it's a very important point because one of the challenges that our very extensive public day care system is experiencing in the city of New York is the stress between being a certified teacher in the public day care center, the salaries received there, versus maybe a couple more course credits and going into the straight into the public schools that calling for more teachers, more qualified teachers, certified teachers, and so we see a bleeding of the system. We went through a very extensive time of advocacy, activism to really mobilize for early childhood education, for day  care, for working parents, for working mothers, and now we are seeing an erosion, all a reaction to a lot of what we have seen in terms of the cuts. So in New York City, where we have had this longstanding system of over 330 day care centers throughout the five boroughs that employ almost 6,000 caregivers, we're seeing day care closings. 
   And that doesn't mean the demand is gone. The demand continues. The waiting list continues in perpetuity. There will be some children who won't get this opportunity. They will be disadvantaged.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. That's right. So there are some real challenges that we have to look squarely in the eye. And we have to ask ourselves what about the children? How are we preparing ourselves to sacrifice as a society to make sure that in 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, we are one of the most competitive nations in the world? 
   We're struggling with those answers and trying to balance it all out now, but it begins with an investment that we make in our young. 
   And what we are seeing in terms of these cuts and in terms of the rhetoric coming from the Bush Administration do not bode well, notwithstanding all of what we hear about his care and his concern for the families of our Nation. 
   Put the money for the mouth is. That's what I say. Put the money where the mouth is. We want to expand and institutionalize early childhood education so that the United States is, indeed, the most competitive when it comes to development of our scientists and development of our engineers and development of those who will have to compete globally as our economy continues to morph with young scholars coming from other nations who have decided, notwithstanding their GDPs, to invest in the education of their children. 
   And so I just wanted to stop in and share some of my experience with you, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, and to say to my colleagues that we have to stand up. This is a critical issue, and as we reflect on the week of the young child, it is important that we not forget that they come from a community of families, and those families are struggling. They need to be able to be at the job on time. They need to be able to know that their children are safe and in a wholesome environment while they are at work. And that's what these child care centers and these early childhood education environments create for the children and for their parents: a sense of relief and a sense of well-being both for the child and the family.

   Ms. CLARKE. Would the gentlewoman yield a moment? Just think about the mobility of a family that is unable to have their child care subsidized, the time that it will take for them to be able to gain firm footing once their children now get into public schools. And then the challenges they may face with learning deficits, quite frankly, because there are children of means who are being given an opportunity to be in stimulating learning environments when some working class parents just can't afford it. And without the support that we can give, we are really handicapping. We are really tying the arms of these families and these communities. And we know that if we just give people a chance in this society, they can make the best of it. And that can make a difference from one generation to the next.

   Ms. CLARKE. Would the gentlewoman yield a moment? It is an imperative. As I have said, since I've been on the Hill these past 15 months and have looked just about every crisis in the eye from mortgage foreclosure to the war in Iraq to you name it, education, health care, it all points back to the fact that we are at a specific juncture in our Nation's history that requires courage. And that means the courage to make the proper investments for the growth and development of our Nation. 
   There is no more worthy an investment for us to make than in these children, than our children, our Nation's children. They will be inheriting from us a millstone around their ankles if we don't do right by them today. 
   With the challenges that we are facing in terms of the debt build-up in this Nation, it is going to take a whole group of really smart people, really intelligent folk, who use the ingenuity of who we are as Americans to take us to the next level. That investment starts now. You can't invest it in me. It's too late for me. The investment is in our children. 
   So I thank the gentlelady again. This is a very important special order that we are here, we are at the advent of the Week of the Young Child and that we are speaking out for those families that don't have a voice here, that don't have the high-paid lobbyists, that are really working every day, and they come home, they hug their babies and they just want an opportunity for that baby to succeed. 
   In many instances, those children are struggling like salmon swimming upstream in environments that are less than wholesome. And were they to be in an early childhood education setting, they would be sure to get a nutritious meal every day. They would have a loving caregiver that also is there to stimulate the growth of the intellect and the brain. And that is why these dollars that are requested, which are really not breaking the bank by any means, are so critical and can reap such dividends in the long run if we do right by them today.

   Ms. CLARKE. The achievement gap is real. It is well-documented. And if these children had that Head Start, had the early childhood education, it closes the achievement gap by leaps and bounds. The clock to education doesn't start when we slide that child into the kindergarten door. There is so much more that goes into it. And I am a witness to what early childhood education can do. I have seen it for generations in New York, for working-class parents, parents that by no means are wealthy, but we had a period of time in our city's history where we understood that early childhood education was a critical component to not only helping working families but to giving those children that educational boost, that stimulating environment, that healthy and wholesome environment while their parents were at work. 
   There is nothing worse than a parent that has to worry about their child. We hear these horrible stories about people who go to work and leave their child in a car, or worse leave it with a younger child that is then caught in a situation where harm comes to them. We need to be able to allay those types of fears for parents. And this is a win-win-win scenario, our investment in Head Start and Child Care and Development Block Grants. It's a win-win-win scenario.

I don't think there is a dollar value that can you truly put on the work that these women and men do with our youngest, most vulnerable ones. And they make that sacrifice. Wouldn't it be awesome if they were rewarded and our communities were rewarded and our families were rewarded with a government that responded and really put the funding in place, to not only raise the level, but to get rid of all of those waiting lists that we see. What a difference that would make in every one of our communities around this Nation.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. First, let me just thank you as a member of the class of 2006 to be here with my colleagues this evening to really address what is a moral imperative. Taking care of our young, taking care of our elderly, being in a position to actually have our future secured by making sure that our children are healthy and well-focused, well-nourished and ready to compete in this Nation is a critical part of what makes America America. So to hear that this morning, before the President's coffee got cold, he had vetoed the SCHIP legislation, bipartisan legislation that we delivered to him on their behalf, was really disheartening. 
   I think that it is imperative that Americans really press upon this body that we make sure that we override this veto. $3.50 a day. That is what it would cost us to cover the children who are currently uninsured, to provide them with preventive care so that they are able to reach their God-given potential, so that they don't have to sit up in the classroom with headaches and stomachaches and other ailments, perhaps communicable diseases that could cause an outbreak. Meningitis was one of the major issues in many of our schoolhouses last year. We have a President that sort of stood in the way of that. He has just made it unequivocally clear that this is not a policy that he will pursue. 
   I think it is our obligation as representatives of the people to pursue this and make sure that we get it right on their behalf. Hubert Humphrey was absolutely right. It is a moral imperative, very much so. I hope that every American feels that this evening when they look at their children this evening, when they look at their grandchildren this evening, they will count their blessings that they are able to sit with their child today and their child is not in need of a doctor's care. For those who are in need of a doctor's care, that they will pray for a mother like Deamonte's mother who went around trying to find coverage for her child, who tried to get a doctor to see her son though she did not have insurance and who was turned away. As a result, her son met his demise. 
   My colleague, the doctor is in the House.

   Ms. CLARKE. Would you put a pin in it right there for me, my colleague? I just also wanted to quote two other Senate Republicans. Senator ORRIN HATCH said, We are talking about kids who basically don't have coverage. I think the President has some pretty bad advice on this, you think? 
   Then Senator SUSAN COLLINS says, I can't believe the President would veto a program that benefits low-income children. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are talking bipartisan effort here. As we salute and talk about the heroism of those who would fight for our freedoms abroad, we have got to bring some heroics here right now. This is one of those issues where the faint of heart should not be casting a vote. 
   This goes to the fiber, the core of who we are as a Nation, not as a party, not as an individual, but as a Nation. Where are we going to set the bar for what is acceptable in leadership and what is not? I say that the President in this case has abdicated his responsibility as a leader. 
   Our children need us. Their health care is critical to the growth and development of our communities. For every child that falls ill, we have more and more that we have to invest in getting that child to wellness. In the meantime, the educational advances that that child should have been making have not been made. The turmoil within the home and family, the setbacks there, and, by extension, the entire community 
   Mr. Speaker, so I just wanted to point out to you and just to highlight, as you both have, my colleagues, that this is not a Republican issue, this is not a Democrat issue, this is an American issue, and we have got to focus on this like a laser. It is now up to us in this House of Representatives to make sure that our colleagues recognize their responsibility and leadership to override this veto.

   Ms. CLARKE. What I think most Americans find most mind-boggling is just the mindset that our President has been in in terms of his whole rationale for the veto. He at one point said the SCHIP plan is an incremental step toward the goal of government-run health care for every American. 
   I am saying to myself, first of all, there is a bit of hypocrisy here, because we have the Commander-in-Chief, who I believe gets a Federal health care plan himself, saying that we are moving towards government-run health care, when he knows in fact that government doctors and government health plans do not deliver the services of SCHIP. It is private doctors, private health care that do, under private insurance. So, there is this false justification he came up with. 
   He at one point even talked about, well, the SCHIP bill, the proposal would result in taking a program meant to help poor children and turning it into one that covers children in households with incomes up to $83,000 a year. I am saying to myself, this bill does not expand eligibility for SCHIP. The focus of the bill is on expanding health care coverage for low-income children who have no health insurance. 
   So there have been these false statements in justification of a decision that he made, which I really believe was in retribution, quite frankly. When we get to that level of angst, I guess, in our decisionmaking, it is time to sort of pack it up. 
   I think right now it is important that, as a legislative body, we take control and consciousness of the moves that we have to make on behalf of the American people, because, obviously, our Commander-in-Chief has decided to submerge himself into a bipartisan fight with himself. We have said here that we agree as Democrats and Republicans that this is important, and he is off on a whole other planet.

   Another thing that the President has said, the SCHIP proposal would move millions of American children who now have private health insurance into government-run health care. What planet is he on, Doctor? The main impact of this bill would be extending coverage to low-income children who would otherwise be uninsured.

It is the folks who attend religious services with us. It is their children. We need to call our representatives, e-mail our representatives.

   Just think about the lives in between, the children's lives in between that will be adversely impacted if we are unable to override the President's veto. 
   We don't have any time to waste. The imperative is there. And I think there isn't a parent, an aunt, an uncle or grandparent who doesn't understand what it is to stay up late at night when their child is ill and to feel helpless. Compound that with the fact that you can't even go to a doctor until, as your President says, they are sick enough to be wheeled into an emergency room.

Under the leadership of our Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, this Congress has risen to a new level of stridency and of focus with regard to the issues that are impacting every district across this Nation. So we have to be very clear. We may not see the tangible results right this second, but they are all lined up and we have already seen a number of really extraordinary pieces of legislation passed here in the House. We have even seen the College Cost Reduction Act signed into law. 
   We should not overlook those things, and understand that none of that came easy for us. We had to put ourselves on the line. We had to stand up and be counted. We will do that again with SCHIP. This is just another bump in the road, but I believe without struggle there is no progress.

When we recognize that no one is disposable in our society, we have an obligation to reach out and to provide for those who can't provide for themselves.     
   If we take care of a child today who's low income, that child becomes a productive part of our society. They will be taking care of us as we grow older, and it's a cycle and it's a circle, and when we understand that, then we know how important this vote is coming up. And we want to urge our colleagues across party lines, hold the line on SCHIP, hold the line on SCHIP. Our low-income children, our children in our communities, our families who are just struggling to make ends meet need us to be there for them to override this veto.

I am joining my colleagues on the floor in pursuit of justice for the second-generation victims of the wicked attack of our Nation in New York City on September 11 and to demand basic health care support and services for those whose physical well-being was adversely and irreparably impacted by the horrific attack on the World Trade Center. 
   As was stated by the gentlelady from New York, I was elected to the New York City Council the year our dear city was attacked. I became Chair of the Committee on Fire and Criminal Justice Services, as well as a member of the Health Committee where we examined year after year what the impact of the aftermath, the work that our first responders, the residents of the area were feeling as a result of having been misguided, misled by our own Federal Government through the leadership, or lack of leadership some would say, of the administration through the Environmental Protection Agency which said to New Yorkers that the air we were breathing was okay and that we would be fine, only to find out that today many are diseased. 
   I also watched as a very close friend, a very best friend and companion of mine, rushed out on September 11 to the pile, a member of Local 79, who heard the call. And as I speak with him each and every day, I am reminded that he is one of the lucky ones. But every now and then when he coughs, I wonder could this be the advent of a serious health crisis that was precipitated by his heroism on that day. 
   I cannot fathom why on the advent of the 6th anniversary of this most tragic event in our history this administration has not seen fit to do right by its most courageous citizenry. This is a problem that not only affects many thousands of people throughout the New York region, but also countless thousands throughout the country who bravely came to New York City and helped my hometown in our time of need. 
   Immediately following the attack and imminent collapse of the World Trade Center, first responders, construction workers and volunteers from across every economic sector and walk of life converged upon what we know as Ground Zero to perform search and rescue missions. 
   From the outset, these heroic individuals went in without a second thought about their own personal well-being. They just wanted to save anyone who might have been buried alive and/or to help recover the bodies of those who had perished, heroes and heroines, without whose efforts New York City and our Nation never could have recovered as quickly as it did. 
   Later, many of these same workers went through the lengthy process of cleaning up the demolished site. At the time, the EPA declared the air to be safe to breathe, a statement we now know to have been false. Because of their efforts in helping our country to recover, these men and women ingested vast amounts of toxic dust and harmful chemicals. The result is a plague of debilitating and deadly diseases, some of which are rarely seen in nature. Only now, 6 years later, are many of these  diseases and complications showing themselves. In fact, many of the people who spent time near the site may not show any problems until several years further down the line. Even the best experts have no clue just how many of these individuals will actually fall ill of long-term complications from the exposure. 
   Of course we cannot change the past so there is nothing anyone can do about exposure that already took place. All we can do now is make sure that these victims receive the medical treatment they deserve. Bureaucratic red tape and legal challenges have left these second generation victims overwhelmed by deteriorating health as well as a lack of meaningful financial support from a grateful Nation. Many are going bankrupt under the weight of escalating health costs and the loss of income to their homes and families. And what about the families? 
   Furthermore, there has been no assistance offered to the many nonresponders who worked on the scene and the area residents who breathed the tainted air that entered their homes. These people are also victims of the attacks, and require support for health problems that are only now manifesting. 
   This is why I am compelled to add my name and wholehearted support behind the Maloney-Nadler-Fossella 9/11 Health Compensation Act. This comprehensive bill establishes programs to monitor and treat everyone exposed to the dangerous toxins found at Ground Zero. 
   Whether you are a police officer or firefighter, construction worker, area resident, government employee or anyone else who spent significant time at the scene, you are entitled to treatment for any disease that doctors find is linked to your work immediately after the attacks. 
   Some of my colleagues from outside the New York region may wonder why they should support such a bill. They say it does nothing for their own States or districts, so why bother voting for it.     
   I feel the reasons could not be clearer. The diseases being developed by victims of Ground Zero are horrid. Already well over 100 deaths have been partially attributed to toxins from the site. Not long ago, a 34-year-old detective collapsed and died while playing with his young daughter due to complications from exposure. There are victims requiring double lung transplants because of damage caused from dust and chemicals. Others develop rare cancers 
   These people are heroes to the Nation. They went in and helped resuscitate not just a city but an entire country that had been shocked, frozen, traumatized and unsure of how to react. It should be a matter of national honor to help these victims who have rushed in where we all rushed out. 
   I wholeheartedly support the Maloney-Nadler-Fossella bill as a cosponsor, and I look forward to joining my colleagues and the AFL-CIO this weekend at the World Trade Center site as we rally in support of fulfilling victims' long-term health care needs. 
   I thank the gentlewoman from New York for her extraordinary leadership with regards to this matter, and I look forward to pursuing what is right and what is just on behalf of our fellow New Yorkers, fellow Americans and their families.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in unwavering support of our troops. I support our troops who are stationed around the globe and, particularly, those stationed in harm's way in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. That is why I wholeheartedly support H. Con. Res. 63 which disapproves  of the President's decision to deploy more than 20,000 additional combat troops to Iraq, because support of our troops means I must vote to move them out of harm's way. 
   This 110th Congress debate marks the beginning of the end of the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq and a realignment of our strategy utilizing America's might against the war on terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, we now know that nothing said in justification of this war was fact. It was all fiction created by this administration to justify the unjustifiable. 
   Our military service men and women are doing their duty. They have accomplished their mission. They have brought Saddam Hussein to justice. Remember, ``Mission Accomplished.'' 
   This administration has distracted us from the real war on terror, the war with al Qaeda. When are we going to bring Osama bin Laden to justice? 
   In Afghanistan, U.S. Central Command General Tommy Franks, the war's operational commander, misjudged the interest of our Afghan allies. He ran the war from Tampa, with no commander on the ground above the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. The first Americans did not arrive until 3 days into the fighting. 
   It is noted that Osama bin Laden slipped through the cordon ostensibly placed around Tora Bora as U.S. aircraft began bombing on November 30, 2002. More precisely, bin Laden was in Tora Bora on November 26, 2002, spoke to his fighters about the fight being a holy war, then, as quickly as he had come, bin Laden vanished in the pine forest with four of his loyalists walking in the direction of Pakistan.     
   Bin Laden escaped somewhere between November 28 and November 30, 2002, in Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, Department of Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said, ``He,'' meaning Osama bin Laden, ``doesn't have a lot of good options.'' Obviously, that was false. 
   Further, it was reported that the administration pays bin Laden no attention, and that is evidenced by the fact that official reports no longer identify Osama bin Laden as a threat. The administration anticipated that they would have bin Laden erased by September 11, 2002. They failed at that mission. 
   Again, the failure of this administration to get the job done, to secure our homeland, and to get the man who masterminded the attacks upon us and continues to recruit and train al Qaeda agents is parallel to the failures of the mission in Iraq. The administration did not plan to fail; they failed to plan. 
   I support the men and women who put their lives on the line for our liberty. I am indebted to them, the sacrifices that they have made, and that is why I support this resolution. We must redeploy and make preparations to leave Iraq today. 
   As the representative of the 11th District from New York, I and my constituents deeply resent the lies and deceptions thrust upon us to justify this war by creating a distraction away from homeland security we all require as an inalienable right. The fire that I witnessed that refused to die was stamped out by the resilience of New Yorkers, Americans who believe in our democracy and the ultimate victory of good over evil. 
   The question I have and the question of the people from New York and the rest of America wants answered is: When will Osama bin Laden be brought to justice? 
   Thanks to the failed policies of this administration, Iraq is now in the midst of a civil war. Due to the lies and deceptions, the civil war in Iraq is now raging. We must redeploy our troops now. Thus far, there are 135,544 troops deployed in Iraq today.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 7, a resolution offered by the gentlelady from California calling on the League of Arab States to recognize the genocide that is currently taking place in Darfur, Sudan. The facts regarding the situation on the ground are indisputable. The Government of Sudan, through its proxy militia, the janjaweed, have been launching a scorched earth campaign in Darfur. More than 400,000 people have been murdered, and more than 2 million have been forcefully displaced. 
   This resolution calls upon the League of Arab States to acknowledge the genocide in Darfur and to pressure the Sudanese Government to take steps to bring the killings to an end. 
   The purpose of the League of Arab States is to coordinate the cultural and securities policies of its member states, of which Sudan is a member. If genocide or any atrocity is taking place in one member state, the other member states have a duty to recognize and act to end it. 
   Sudan has not moved to end the slaughter of its innocent civilians in Darfur. The international community, in particular the League of Arab States, must be united in its call for Sudan to end the genocide, stop the pillaging, stop the rape of women and girls, disarm the janjaweed and prosecute those responsible.

   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 68 honors the life and accomplishments of Gian Carlo Menotti, and recognizes the success of the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, South Carolina, which he founded. 
   I would like to thank Representative Brown from South Carolina for bringing this important resolution to the floor. 
   Gian Carlo Menotti was born July 7, 1911, at Cadegliano-Viconago, Italy. At the age of 7, under the guidance of his mother, he began to compose songs, and 4 years later he wrote the words and music of his first opera, ``The Death of Pierrot.'' 
   Following the death of his father, his mother took him to the United States, where he was enrolled at Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music. There he completed his musical studies. 
   His first mature work, the one-act opera buffa, ``Amelia Goes to the Ball,'' was premiered in 1937, a success that  led to a commission from the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera especially for radio, ``The Old Maid and the Thief,'' the first such commission ever given. 
   ``The Consul,'' Menotti's first full-length work, won the Pulitzer Prize and the New York Drama Critics Circle Award as the best musical play of the year in 1954. 
   In 1984, Menotti was awarded the Kennedy Center Honor of Lifetime Achievement in the Arts. He was chosen 1991 Musician of the Year by Musical America, inaugurating worldwide tributes to the composer in honor of his 80th birthday.

   Mr. Speaker, the importance of getting children outside and involving them with the environment is critical to the survival of our planet, and this bill takes the first step in that direction. National Garden Month will introduce children, particularly children from the city, such as Brooklyn, where I represent, who would not be exposed to the outdoors an opportunity to involve themselves in gardening and the outdoors.

   One of the basic reasons that every child must have an education in music is that music is a part of the fabric of our society. The intrinsic value of music for each individual is widely recognized in the many cultures that make up American life. 
   Music helps shape individual abilities and character. Success in society is predicated on success in school. Skills learned through the discipline of music transfer to study skills, communication skills, and the cognitive skills useful in every part of the curriculum.  
   Participation in music brings countless benefits to every individual throughout life. The benefits may be psychological, spiritual or physical. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution and support the next generation of music lovers.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF BIPARTISAN CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for her leadership and for being here to give guidance during this hour for the CBC. And I want to thank our chairwoman, Ms. Carolyn Kilpatrick, for seeing fit to add this particular perspective to the conversation that we are having with our Nation around the Children's Health Insurance Program in our States.     
   And, Mr. Speaker, I'm elated to stand with my colleagues today to once again voice my support, my wholehearted support for children's health insurance coverage, also known as SCHIP. 
   Just over a week ago, the President vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have provided 10 million American children health coverage through SCHIP. Since the beginning of my tenure here, you know I'm a freshman, in this 110th session, this is the second time the President has vetoed important health care legislation with broad bipartisan support; the other veto being an expansion of potentially life saving stem cell research. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and duty to stand with my fellow Democrats, telling this administration that this veto will not deter nor distract us from protecting the health and well-being of our children. 
   The people that I represent in central Brooklyn have spoken loud and clear, and so has the rest of America. Republicans and Democrats alike have expressed their dismay with the President's decision to veto this bipartisan legislation. Additionally, the country overwhelmingly supports the Children's Health Insurance Program. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll indicates that 72 percent of the country supports the extension and reauthorization of the CHIP program. Governors of both parties across the country support the bipartisan bill. 
   Now, following the veto, the fight for health insurance for 10 million low-income children moves back to this body where the hard work of rebuilding and building consensus among both Democrats and Republicans has already taken place. Now, the rubber-stamp Republicans who have sided with the President and are standing between 10 million low-income children and their health care must hear from the American people. We will override the President's rejection of health coverage for 10 million children, but the voices of the American people must be heard by those in Washington. 
   SCHIP was created to provide health care coverage for children and families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford private insurance. It costs, as my colleague, STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, has already stated, less than $3 a day to cover a child through the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   Ensuring kids is also cost-effective for taxpayers, who pick up the tab for indigent care in emergency rooms, the most expensive way to care for a child's health, as well because a healthy child is more likely to succeed in education and life. 
   Over the last 10 years, the children's health program has proven to be popular and successful, with 6 million children now enrolled in the program. The bipartisan children's health insurance bill has broad bipartisan support. It's supported by 68 Senators, including 18 Republicans; it's supported by 43 Governors, including 16 Republicans; it's supported by more than 270 organizations representing millions of Americans; and it's supported by a strong majority of the American people. 
   This bipartisan bill renews and improves the Children's Health Insurance Program, providing health care coverage for 10 million children, preserving coverage for 6 million children currently covered by SCHIP, and extending coverage to nearly 4 million uninsured children according to the nonpartisan CBO.  
   Ironically, this morning I had an opportunity, along with my colleague, NYDIA VEL&#193;ZQUEZ, to attend a press conference hosted by the Working Families Party, ACORN, SCIU and Mothers in Our Community to reach out to a corporation in New York called KKR in midtown Manhattan. This is an investment firm that owns Toys-R-Us and Dollar General. These two toy retailers have already subjected America's families to massive and unprecedented recalls of millions of poisonous lead toys that have flooded the market. This is a great concern. If we don't get a commitment for a code of conduct protecting our children from lead poison, our holiday toy-buying season could mean putting the health of millions of American children at risk. 
   This concern is compounded by this administration's reckless disregard for our most vulnerable, our children. Just imagine the confluence of two of these things happening at the same time. Right now, parents and families, mothers are concerned about lead-tainted toys. And at the same time, when we need health care coverage that can identify lead poisoning, that can help to ameliorate some of those concerns, because, on the one hand, our safety is not being protected through the consumer protection, we need to have SCHIP in place. 
   Two-thirds of uninsured children are currently eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid. This bill is simply designed to give States the resources and incentives to enroll children who are eligible but not signed up for SCHIP and Medicare. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to be here to say that when we look at communities of color, in particular, black communities across this Nation, it has been this type of safety net health care that enables our communities to grow from strength to strength. These are just those American policies we need to give our families the boost they need so that when children go to school with asthma, they can be treated, they don't have to be out for days on end. When our children have hepatitis, tuberculosis, when they have any type of communicable disease, these diseases can be treated quickly before they reach the level of crisis in the emergency room. 
   SCHIP gives us that tool to be able to make sure that Americans are safe and secure, that their health and well-being is something that we all value as part of the American fabric of who we are. 
   And so I want to thank you, STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, for anchoring this hour for the CBC. When we think about our communities and how critical this legislation is, not only for our communities, but for all Americans, this transcends race, ethnicity, gender. It's American children. I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to share this time with you.

   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Chairman, first I would like to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#225;zquez) for her leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today and her steadfast commitment to the small businesses of our Nation. 
   I support the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act, which encourages participation by qualified small businesses and improves key sections of the Small Business Act to prevent fraud in the SBA's contracting programs. 
   H.R. 3867 requires the Small Business Administration to immediately implement the Women's Procurement Program after 7 years of no action by the administration to put the program in action. 
   It will allow agencies to limit competition for Federal contracts only to women business owners in industries that have been closed to them. This legislation now requires SBA to evaluate industries where women entrepreneurs are economically disadvantaged and gives the SBA authority to waive any restrictions where women-owned enterprises are substantially underrepresented. 
   I believe this bill will finally correct the imbalance in the number of women-owned businesses nationally when compared to their presence in the Federal marketplace. 
   H.R. 3867 also strengthens the HUBZone program by requiring construction contracts to be performed within a reasonable distance of the particular HUBZone the contractor is to benefit. It will limit construction contract awards being performed more than 150 miles from the primary office location of the HUBZone-approved company. 
   The Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act modernizes the 8(a) program to update and revise qualification requirements and ensure that 8(a) contracts go to qualified companies. 
   This bill provides an opportunity for all qualified small businesses to have a fair opportunity in the Federal marketplace. I want to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for her steadfast commitment to the women, minority-owned and disabled veterans and disadvantaged small businesses of America. I  strongly support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.

   Chairwoman McDonald was a trailblazer who paved the way for me and many others to be elected and to serve in the Congress. I am ever mindful of the legacy of integrity and excellence that she has imparted to each and every one of us. I embrace it and can truly say that she has touched my life. Though we were colleagues in this body for a short while, we had many moments of interactions that were truly empowering. She never missed a moment to be encouraging and complimentary. 
   Just a week ago or so before the chairwoman took her leave from the Congress, we encountered one another in this very Chamber. She inquired of me about how I was doing. My response to her was, ``I'm just trying to keep up with you, Madam Chair.'' She smiled her beautiful and elegant smile and said to me, ``You're doing it, girl.'' 
   It has truly been a blessing for me as a freshman to have been acknowledged and encouraged by this truly remarkable, elegant and extraordinary role model. The legacy of Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald will never be forgotten. It has been imparted to all of us and it will certainly always reside with me.

<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Chairman, I wish to thank Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King and Chairwoman  Jackson-Lee for their vigilance on this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007, H.R. 1401. In the past, Congress has passed laws to improve air and maritime security. With this bill, Congress is finally taking the very important step of securing America's vast ground transportation systems. 
   It is particularly important for my home city of New York, which has spent far more of its own treasury than any other city on securing its citizens. Along with providing much-needed funding for security improvements to mass transit, bridges and tunnels, this bill will also help fund police and counterterrorism task forces to patrol the areas and react to emergencies. 
   Further, this bill provides $100 million over the next 4 years to bring about long-anticipated safety and security renovations at Penn Station, which sees thousands of New Yorkers and tourists from across America each day. 
   I am particularly proud of the language included in the bill that ensures labor unions will play an integral role in the solution. Unions will now be eligible to receive a portion of the grant funding, allowing them to work hand-in-hand with transportation carriers on how to improve the safety of the workers and passengers alike. 
   Also, for some time, many local governments and agencies have been concerned about their lack of involvement with the Federal side of the transportation security process. For years, Federal security inspectors have refused to consult with transit agencies about how best to patrol their facilities. This new bill will force DHS and DOT to work together with State and local governments when deciding how the Federal Government will interact with local agencies. 
   H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007, is an excellent bill that will revolutionize transportation security in America, and I wholeheartedly recommend that my colleagues join me in voting ``yes'' for this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (PASSING OF RUSSEL TIMOSHENKO -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, early in the morning on Saturday, July 7, I awoke to an unusual sound; it was the sound of a police helicopter circling over the community in which I reside. Typically, when you hear a police helicopter you know that something has gone wrong in the community. They are usually searching for a suspect in a crime. 
   Today, I stand before this body and before you, Mr. Speaker, with a heavy heart. The reason behind that circling was the injuring, critical injuring of an officer, a police officer. And it is with a heavy heart that I stand before you today to honor the life and contribution of a fallen hero, a great American patriot, New York Police Officer Russel Timoshenko. Last weekend, he was tragically shot in the face and the neck and succumbed to those fatal gunshots this weekend. 
   Officer Timoshenko was born in Belarus and immigrated to the United States in the early 1990s, when he was only 7 years old. 
   Upon his graduation from Tottenville High School in Staten Island, New York, Russel attended City College and majored in economics while playing on the lacrosse team. I understand, like myself, he loved to dance. 
   Prior to completing his studies, he decided to become a New York City police officer. During his short career on the force, Officer Timoshenko made 15 arrests. And although Officer Timoshenko had only been on the force for 1 1/2 years, his commitment to protect and serve the least and the greatest in our community embodied the true sentiment of a public servant, and he was highly regarded among his colleagues. 
   Officer Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, were both shot during a routine traffic stop in Brooklyn in the early morning of Saturday, July 7. Officer Yan survived because of his bulletproof vest, and I pray for his continued speedy recovery. Unfortunately, Officer Timoshenko was shot in the head, and the two bullets that struck him cut across his spinal cord just beneath his brain. Officer Timoshenko did not survive his wounds. 
   Officer Timoshenko's untimely death was a direct result of the proliferation of illegal guns in my community. His life was taken in service to our city and in pursuit of his oath to protect and serve. And, in so doing, there are three less illegal handguns on the streets of New York. 
   I stand with the New York City Police Chief, Commissioner Kelly, Mayor Bloomberg, and Governor Spitzer in the fight against illegal gun trafficking into our city, and also in aggressively working to make our neighborhoods safe to live, work, and play. 
   To the parents and family of Officer Timoshenko, please accept our thanks for sharing him with us. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to share the life of such a fine human being. And on behalf of New York's 11th Congressional District, I offer my sincerest condolences, and pray that God will grant the family comfort and peace at this time.

   During the attacks of September 11, the lives of nearly 400 persons from Brooklyn, New York, came to an abrupt end due to terrorists who used commercial airliners as guided missiles and crashed them into both of the World Trade Center Towers in lower Manhattan. In accordance with the attacks, more innocent lives were lost due to an adequately communication infrastructure. This bill will help to address this shortfall in our first responders' ability to coordinate future rescue efforts. 
   I cannot think of a better way of honoring the memories, sacrifice and dedication of New York City's first responders: Fire Department of New York--FDNY; Emergency Medical Service--EMS; New York Police Department--NYPD; and the Port Authority Police Department--PAPD. 
   Terrorism is not an Islamic issue or a Muslim issue, it is a human issue. No matter what form or by whom it is perpetrated, terrorism is a direct threat to our civil society. I believe that these recommendations will help restore civility in our world. We must continue to demonstrate that Americans are good people, and overall, we want to help each other. Our diplomatic efforts will become more robust, our presence will be more visible and our day to day activities with our neighbors around the world, more meaningful. The bill's provisions include requiring major improvements in aviation security, border security, and infrastructure security; providing first responders the equipment and training they need; beefing up efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; and significantly expanding diplomatic, economic, educational, and other strategies designed to counter terrorism. 
   Overall, Mr. Speaker, I believe the recommendations will help make our nation safer and will limit the likelihood of a similar attack on our country. I fully support this legislation and encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.

   Ms. CLARKE. Madam Speaker, to the manager of this bill, Congressman Meeks, and to the sponsors of this bill, my colleagues, Congressman Towns, Congressman Frank, Congressman King, Congresswoman Vel&#225;zquez, and Congresswoman Waters, I want to say thank you so much for having the vision and the foresight to work across the aisle to do a great service to not only the people of the city of New York, but to this Nation. 
   Starrett City is the last bastion of federally subsidized housing developments of this nature in this Nation. And as we look at the challenge that it faces today, we are looking at a crisis head-on for affordable housing around this Nation. 
   Our willingness to come together in the 11th hour to put a remedy in place speaks to our resilience and our ability to address challenges that we face in the 21st century. And as these concerns grow greater and greater and the housing crisis gets more and more in depth, with millions of moderate and low income families in peril's way, today's legislation, H.R. 5937, says that this Congress is willing to stand up and do something, and that we've been sent here to solve the problems that our communities are facing today. 
   I want to congratulate Congressman Castle for standing forward today in a bipartisan way. It may seem to some that this is just a piece of legislation that will impact New York, but when we stand up for New York and Starrett City and Spring Creek, we're standing up for all Americans who are facing such peril.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (COMMENDING HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of House Resolution 1429, which recognizes September as National Emergency Preparedness Month. I would like to thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Etheridge) for managing this very important resolution. 
   This resolution applauds the public servants at the Department of Homeland Security for their outstanding dedication to securing our Nation. More importantly, the resolution also encourages citizens to prepare themselves and their families to respond to emergencies, whether it's an act of terrorism, a natural disaster or another crisis. 
   As the sole member of the Committee on Homeland Security who resides in the City of New York, I am keenly aware that one of the most important lessons from the tragic attacks on September 11, 2001 and from Hurricane Katrina is that each and every American must be vigilant about their preparedness for an emergency. 
   As we all know, with the recent bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Pakistan, terrorism is alive and well and continues to be a very real threat in this world. Likewise, this country has experienced widespread wildfires in the West, numerous tornadoes in the Southeast, overwhelming floods in the Midwest, and late this summer the Gulf States were wracked by Hurricanes Fay, Gustav, Hannah and most recently Ike. 
   The dedicated workers of the Department of Homeland Security and other Federal agencies successfully coordinated with State and local officials and the private sector to assist with the pre-positioning of lifesaving equipment, evacuation efforts and search-and-rescue methods. Similarly, we saw Members helping their fellow brothers and sisters in their time of need. 
   This marks the fifth year that DHS has observed September as the National Emergency Preparedness Month. In promoting this, DHS has partnered with over 1,700 organizations, including the American Red Cross, in its efforts  to reach out to the public. Since this is National Emergency Preparedness Month, this is an ideal time for all of us to collectively prepare for all types emergencies. Among the department's recommendations to help Americans prepare for emergencies are: Number one, get a kit. Build a disaster supply kit that includes enough supplies for each family member for 3 days and remember to check the kit every 6 months. Number two, make a plan. Every family should develop, communicate and practice their evacuation or other sheltering. Number 3, be informed about the type of disasters or emergencies that may occur where you live, work and/or play and how they can affect you, your family and community. Number 4, get involved. After preparing yourself and your family for possible emergencies by getting a kit, making a plan and being informed, take the next step in getting involved in preparing your community. 
   I ask my fellow colleagues to encourage their constituents to visit the Federal government's Citizen Corps website at www.citizencorps.gov to learn how we can bring key community figures together to plan for, mitigate, respond to or recover from an emergency. 
   I am also happy to note that more than 2,200 State, local, tribal and territorial governments in all States and U.S. territories have formed Citizen Corps Councils, and that every day, new councils are formed in communities around the country. 
   Before I close my remarks, I would like to thank and express my gratitude to Homeland Security Chairman Bennie G. Thompson and Ranking Member Peter King for their support for this resolution and their leadership on preparedness issues. 
   Further, I want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Henry Cuellar of the Subcommittee on Emergency Communications, Preparedness and Response for sponsoring H.R. 5890, the Citizen and Community Preparedness Act. Mr. Cuellar has championed the authorization of Citizen Corps, and he, too, encourages every citizen to get involved to improve their individual and community's preparedness. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my Republican colleagues for cosponsoring this resolution. After all, preparedness is not a partisan matter. 
   In closing, I want to honor all of the sheroes and heroes who dedicate their lives to keeping Americans safe. I urge the citizens of this great Nation to visit the website, www.ready.gov so we can all learn how to be vigilant, alert and prepared for an emergency. 
   I urge all my colleagues to adopt this resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (FAIR, ACCURATE, SECURE, AND TIMELY REDRESS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Lungren, nearly everyone in the homeland security community agrees that having a single comprehensive list of terrorist suspects is an important tool in keeping America safe. 
   However, there are flaws in how the terrorist watch list is maintained and used. Perhaps the biggest problem is that every single day, countless Americans are misidentified as terrorists. These errors most commonly occur when an innocent person's name happens to be similar to one listed in the database. This results in wasted time, both for law enforcement, because they're using resources investigating innocent people, and for the general public who face the prospect of being wrongly detained and possibly altogether prevented from going about their business. 
   Most commonly, this affects air travelers who are screened against the watch list more often than anyone else. Currently, each time a reservation is made, airlines must determine whether a customer is a potential match based on information they receive from our government. 
   Every day, thousands of people are pulled aside, required to go through special procedures, detained, or even denied boarding altogether, at great cost to frustrated travelers who miss flights, which ruins plans, and at great cost to companies which depend on business travel whose employees miss meetings and lose productivity. 
   Because of the terrorist watch list that is being used for screening agencies, many people other than domestic air travelers have also been impacted by misidentifications. Some of these people include international travelers delayed or denied entry to the country by CBP; potential foreign visitors denied visas by the State Department, and other workers, port workers who have been incorrectly denied a transportation worker identification card, which is now required to work at a port facility in the United States. In the future, this will likely become a greater issue, as more potentially sensitive activities are tied to screening against the watch list. 
   In 2007, TSA attempted to address this issue by initiating a redress process called DHS TRIP. But this program has multiple problems, and its scope is limited just to air travelers. Because of the program's limitations, many travelers go through the process only to find they are again misidentified as terrorists in the future. 
   The FAST Redress Act solves this problem by granting DHS the tools to create a department-wide Office of Redress and Appeals, a one-stop shop for any individual who feels they are being incorrectly identified as a terrorist  whenever they have contact with our government. 
   Using the Office of Redress, people can voluntarily submit to our government and be put into a single comprehensive cleared list, ensuring they will avoid future misidentification when dealing with any Department entity. 
   This bill also allows the Secretary to enter into intergovernmental memorandums of understanding so this cleared list can be used by all government screening entities. 
   This bill will greatly streamline the process for the countless people who, just because of their names, are regularly misidentified as a terrorist, creating a single, high visible office within our government for everyone who wants to clear their names. 
   I'm very thankful to Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King, along with TS&IP Chairwoman Jackson-Lee and Ranking Member Lungren for recognizing the importance of this issue and their great bipartisan efforts pushing the FAST Redress Act forward. 
   I also thank the staff on both sides of the Homeland Security Committee for their hard work and the time they put into this bill. 
   Further, since introduction, this bill has received the strong support of the National Business Travel Association, who recognize its benefits for the business travel community. I thank them for their support which remains instrumental as we continue to make this bill law. 
   Finally, I'd like to thank the people of Central Brooklyn that filed into my district office week after week seeking relief after being misidentified against the watch list.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening feeling compelled to speak on an issue that has had an adverse and devastating impact in my district and many districts across this Nation. The phenomenon known as subprime lending, which has grown so rapidly over the past decade or so, has made it possible for many New Yorkers with modest incomes and poor credit histories to purchase homes. 
   The question is, at what cost? The Federal Government has found that subprime loans made up 32 percent of all mortgages in New York City last year, which is up from 28 percent in 2005. 
   However, an estimated 364,433 subprime loans remain outstanding. As a result, as we stand here tonight, Brooklyn has 4,864 homes facing foreclosure. 
   When certain unscrupulous lenders aggressively and deceptively convince vulnerable borrowers seeking relief in their pursuit of the American Dream to accept unfair and abusive loan terms, many of these same borrowers have, unfortunately, lost their homes, leaving them displaced, penniless, and bankrupt. 
   Today, mortgage finance programs in the subprime lending industry are growing more severe, with soaring loan default even diminishing home prices. These defaults have depreciated about $71 billion in housing wealth. I must tell you this evening that this crisis will and is currently affecting State economies. 
   It has been estimated that there will be 1.3 million foreclosures from mid-2007 through 2009 in subprime mortgages, resulting in an estimated loss of $102.4 million in property taxes. 
   Also, it has been reported that the subprime mortgage crisis will cost States $917 million in lost property revenue through the end of 2009 and more than $103 billion in lost property values, including $9.5 billion for New York. 
   What is alarming to me is that there have been reports which have found that embedded within this American crisis there appears to be real racial disparities when it comes to subprime lending. For example, one report stated that blacks and Hispanics are 30 percent more likely than whites to be charged with higher interest rates. Additionally, in New York, blacks are five times and Hispanics almost four times more likely to pay higher interest rates for homes.  
   Even in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, which is located in my district, an astounding 44 percent of blacks and Hispanics earning between $40,000 and $50,000 received their loans from subprime lenders. We must make a conscious and focused effort to address the subprime lending crisis in predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods in New York City and across the Nation. 
   What is so ironic about this issue of the subprime mortgage crisis is that as a former New York City council member, my colleagues and I saw this crisis arise as representatives of the municipality. We even passed legislation, anti-predatory lending legislation, yet the legislation went nowhere due to the threat of litigation by the financial services sector. Now the crisis is upon us. Hundreds of thousands of Americans across this country are facing this crisis. 
   I am supporting and will champion any and all measures that ensure that all borrowers, especially those living in underserved communities, are no longer hurt by the recent events and tactics occurring in the mortgage market. 
   It is our responsibility, and in the public interest, to make certain that we eliminate predatory practices that have the potential to financially harm mortgage consumers living in America. 
   If we do not, I believe that we will generate an environment where predatory lenders will continue to actively sell high-cost, high-risk mortgages in many communities, including underserved communities, making the American Dream of all Americans an American nightmare.

   Mr. President, we are on edge. The American public have said no to the war in Iraq and you have turned a deaf ear to this American admonition. 
   What does a troop escalation mean to American families? 
   More of our women and men, sons and daughters, brothers and sister, neighbors and friends will lose their lives or the life of someone they love, more families, such as the family of Operations Specialist Joseph Alomar, who gave his life in honor just this past week, and LCpl Nicholas Whyte, who gave his life this summer. More families, Mr. President, will be mourning. More of the American tax dollars will be spent on the war, rather than on building better schools, hospitals, roads and bridges.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (HAITIAN FLAG DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pride and pleasure today to rise to inform the House, on this Friday, May 18, Haitians throughout the diaspora celebrated Haitian Flag Day. 
   Since the creation of the Haitian flag on May 18, 1803, the day has been observed as Haitian Flag Day to Haitian Americans throughout the diaspora. This day has become a source of pride synonymous with unity and a symbol of freedom and individual liberty for Haitian people. 
   Later this week, I will introduce legislation to commemorate this historic and celebrative event. The 18th of May, Haitian Flag Day, is the most celebrated holiday in Haiti. 
   Just to put this day in context for most Americans, there are some historical facts that I would like to share with you. 
   When Napoleon Bonaparte envisioned a great French empire in the New World, he had hoped to use the Mississippi Valley as a food and trade center to supply the island of Hispaniola. First, he had to restore French control of Hispaniola, where Haitian slaves under Toussaint L'Ouverture had seized power. Napoleon soon realized that Hispaniola must be abandoned. Accordingly, in April of 1803, he offered to sell Louisiana to the United States. 
   President Thomas Jefferson had already sent James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston to Paris to negotiate the purchase of a tract of land in the lower Mississippi, or at least guarantee of free navigation of the river. Surprised and delighted by the French offer of the whole territory, they immediately negotiated the treaty. 
   At one stroke, the United States would double in its size, an enormous tract of land would be open to settlement, and the free navigation of the Mississippi would be assured. 
   Although the Constitution did not specifically empower the Federal Government to acquire new territory by treaty, Jefferson concluded that the practical benefits to the Nation far outweighed the possible violation of the Constitution. The Senate concurred with this decision and voted ratification October 20, 1803, this all precipitated by the revolution of freed slaves on the island of Haiti. 
   The Spanish, who had never given up a physical possession of Louisiana to the French, did so in a ceremony at New Orleans on November 30, 1803. And in a second ceremony December 20, 1803, the French turned Louisiana over to the United States. 
   I would like to also honor those brave Haitians who fought for American independence at the siege of Savannah, Georgia, in 1779: The Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint-Domingue, a regiment of soldiers who formed one-tenth of the allied army before Savannah in the fall of 1779. This unit was comprised of over 500 free men of color from the island of Haiti and was the largest unit of men of African descent to fight in the American revolution. 
   The battle of Savannah, on October 9, 1779, reminds us that significant foreign resources of men, money and material contributed to the eventual success of the cause of American independence. 
   The presence of the Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint Domingue was made up of free men who volunteered for this expedition is startling to most people and surprising to most historians. 
   Men of African heritage were to be found on most battlefields of the revolution in large numbers. A subsequent unit of Haitians was part of the French and Spanish campaign against Pensacola, where they faced some of the same regiments of British troops that their comrades faced in Savannah. 
   Haiti, much smaller in population than the United States, was attacked by armies as large as those sent against America by Britain. The Haitian victory over the legions of Napoleon was achieved with much less foreign assistance than the United States enjoyed. 
   It is these types of historical events put in the context of our Nation today that we celebrate with the Haitian Americans in diaspora, their accomplishments and achievements in the growth and development of our Nation. 
   Many key figures in the Haitian War of Independence gained military experience and political insights through their participation in Savannah, most notably Henri Christophe, a youth at the time, but, in his adult years, a general of Haitian armies and King of his nation for 14 years.  
   There is little appreciation in the United States for the events that led to the formation of the Haitian nation. Influenced by both the events of the American Revolution and the rhetoric of the French Revolution, the people of Haiti began a struggle for self-government and liberty. 
   The first nation in the Western Hemisphere to form a government led by people of African descent, it was also the first nation to renounce slavery. 
   The Haitian national flag is indisputably a symbol of general pride whose origin is tightly linked to a history of struggle for freedom. 
   As you all already know, the Haitian flag was first presented in 1802 when Haiti was fighting against the French for independence and it was realized that both armies fought under the same flag. 
   After the modification of the flag in 1807, the phrase ``L'UNION FAIT LA FORCE'', meaning that through unity we find strength, was re-adopted. 
   The Haitian constitution of 1987 describes the new flag as: Two (2) equal-sized horizontal bands: a blue one on top and a red one underneath; The coat of arms of the Republic shall be placed in the center on a white square; The coat of arms of the Republic will be a Palm tree surmounted by the liberty cap and under the palms a trophy with the legend: In Union there is Strength; 
   This weekend, I joined with hundreds of my Haitian constituents as we celebrated Haitian Flag Day together. For as long as I can remember, Haitians have gathered in my district of Brooklyn, NY to recognize this historic day. 
   I ask my colleagues to please join me in recognizing the world's oldest black republic and the second-oldest republic in the Western Hemisphere celebrate the ideals of unity, strength and freedom embedded in the Haitian Flag by becoming a co-sponsor of the Haitian Flag Day resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Altmire, and to my colleague the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) and to my colleague the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), it is great to be here with you once again. I just wanted to come and have a conversation with you folks out there and, of course, my colleagues here. 
   I was in my office when I heard the wrap-up of the last Republican hour, and I thought I heard one of my colleagues state that we are in this economic crisis currently due to the last 13 months of Democratic control. I couldn't believe what I heard, because I thought to myself, what a joke. Who does he think he is fooling with this type of baseless rhetoric? 
   Americans know exactly who and what caused this economic downturn. Pointing the finger right now does not help us to put milk in the refrigerators of our neighbors and our constituents, and it certainly doesn't fill the gas tank, and it certainly does not enable people to stop fretting about whether they can make next month's mortgage payment. 
   One of the things that we can all be grateful for is that this Democratic-controlled Congress saw fit to rise to the occasion to forecast what we see as a real economic downturn by putting forth in a bipartisan way an economic stimulus package that we hope will bring at least a moment of respite, a moment where folks can catch their breath and catch their bearings as we present to them the opportunities to refinance their homes and the opportunities to just sort of take a look at the landscape and be able to catch up. 
   Right now, everyone is sort of running after themselves and trying to catch up with the mounting costs of just living today. And it is really just not a time for us to be pointing fingers. It is a time for us to put our shoulders to the wheel with real solutions for all Americans. 
   Certainly this ``New Direction'' Congress has enacted an economic stimulus package that brings relief to our families and provides recovery rebates starting next month, that raises loan limits for mortgages backed by the FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and allows our families to get mortgages with better terms. That is the type of language that Americans want to hear today. That is what the families of my district need to know is coming from us today. 
   When you think about the fact that we are going to be putting hundreds of dollars in the hands of more than 130 million American families who will spend it immediately to invigorate the economy, then you know that we are concerned, that we are not just saying that you got yourself into this, now get yourself out. 
   I noticed that no one said to Bear Stearns, you got yourself into this, now get yourself out. We decided as a nation that we had to make sure that the underpinning of our economic society was not withdrawn from under us. We need to do that for every single family here in America. We need to get that done. 
   Listening to our caucus and the conversations we are having as Democrats around phase two of our economic stimulus is quite heartening; knowing that we are examining what is needed to really get this economy going, which means really innovation, which  means bringing to the table the idea that we cannot continue to buy oil which is not an unlimited source, but that we have to look at renewable energies and the type of industry that will be developed in the years to come through that industry and looking at our infrastructure that has not been addressed, at least in my lifetime, that we know that we are going to need to get this done over the next decade or so. 
   So all of these things are on the table. These are things we are discussing as Democrats in terms of phase two, because we know that this stimulus is just the beginning of a multi-pronged strategy that we must take to ensure the future economic growth and strengthening of America. 
   So I want to just thank my colleagues for their continued focus, and not being distracted by those who would rhetorically joke about what is really a major concern to so many Americans right now as they sit at their kitchen tables, at their dining room tables, and they look at the energy bills that have come in from a very harsh winter and a very rough climate in many parts of the country, as they look at the fact that the cost of milk per gallon is now the same cost as gasoline per gallon, as they look at what it takes to travel from one part of this Nation to another, the cost, or from their homes to where they work each day, the cost. All of this is what we need to be focused on, and I am really excited that we are on our way. 
   We talked about the war in Iraq, and there is a direct correlation between what is happening with us economically and what we are able to do economically when we have got so much invested in a war in Iraq. 
   Just this last week, we have looked at 5 long years of war. I can't ever recall in my lifetime, and that is just to give you a sense, of us ever being at war this long. It says something to those who have given their lives and who are veterans of the wars of years gone by and those who would give their lives as our soldiers in the future that we can't be reckless about the call to arms in this country. 
   Some would say that what we have done with the war in Iraq has not been the best moment in our history. So as we look at the fact that over 29,000 Americans have been injured and more than 31,300 have been treated for non-combat injury and illness, I hope that we will also focus on the redeployment that will ultimately have to take place once the Iraqi government stands up. It is in the capacity to do so, and we are hoping that these things will happen simultaneously, quite frankly. But that we also pay attention to these families in our communities, of the walking-wounded warriors who will need our support and will need our help as they readjust to coming back to an America that has a faltering economy, that is struggling to keep its own people in their homes. 
   We need to pay very close attention to what is happening with our veterans, and this Democratic Caucus, this Democratic Congress, has been in the forefront of veterans' rights, of veterans' benefits, in a way that no other part of this government has paid attention to it. 
   So when I hear my colleagues in the last Republican hour focus on trying to cast aspersions at what the Democratic Congress has done, I really hope that they will join us in the bipartisan effort to focus on what is real. What is real are the veterans that are coming home to our communities and the struggles of their families and the duress that their families have been under in just trying to make ends meet on veterans' salaries. It is the struggle that everyone in our communities is facing, whether it is personally or it is a neighbor, in seeing those for-sale signs going up throughout the neighborhood. These are the issues that we are concerned about.

   Ms. CLARKE. The gentleman from Florida really has emphasized what we know is a challenge for America right now. And we are making the marriage here in our conversation, the marriage between the fact that we have to disengage from Iraq, that we realize that our policies have failed there, that it is now a diplomatic mission more so than anything else. And, yes, there will be a cost to redeployment, but the cost to American families has been extensive. And as our brave men and women come back to the United States of America, come back to our respective communities and they face the economic challenges that we have all been facing over the past couple of months, couple of years in some communities, that just compounds the whole reintegration process that is going to be required, the health care, the ongoing health care that is going to be required. And I think that we have positioned ourselves as a Congress to really meet those issues. We know what the challenges are. We have heard firsthand. 
   And when you look at our first economic stimulus package that will provide child tax credits as a rebate to these families, when you look at that expansion of financing opportunities for those who may be in mortgage crisis; and, believe me that we can't separate the wounded warrior from the home they own in the community and the cost of gasoline to get back and forth to the VA hospital and the milk that they have to buy for their child.     
   This economic stimulus is going to be of support to those families as well. But they are going to face what we are facing as civilians in a very special way. And I know that the work we are doing here, Mr. Altmire and Mr. Ryan, is making a difference in their lives. That is why it was important for me to talk about the baseless rhetoric that I heard coming from across the aisle because I don't want Americans to overlook the fact that we have raised the bar and set the standard for how we are going to treat one another as Americans, how we face our challenges head-on, and come up with the solutions that are most important. 
   Right now there is a crisis in health care. There is a crisis in affordable housing and mortgage financing, and there is a crisis called Iraq. There is a direct correlation if you put the equation together, the type of money that we have been spending on this war in Iraq, and let's not forget our soldiers who are also fighting in Afghanistan, but the primary cost, the overwhelming cost is going into the war. 
   And our hope is that we will down surge, redeploy, have a surge in diplomacy and get our economic house in order in the United States of America and treat our veterans and their families as they ought to be treated, treat all Americans as they ought to be treated, and help them through this time of extreme pressure and extreme challenge. 
   I am proud to be a member of this Democratic caucus that has looked at the landscape in its entirety, that is dealing with it in a holistic way. We are not compartmentalizing these issues because one has a direct bearing on the other. 
   I see Mr. Ryan standing here in rare form, and I know he wants to chime in.

   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Ryan, you've put your finger on the pulse of what we are trying to accomplish here. It is our responsibility to redirect those who would take the debate to its lowest common denominator and distract the American people from the realities of where we are today. 
   Where we are is a Democratic Congress that has risen to the occasion, that has filled in the gaps and is holding the line while others would seek to continue failed policies that are costing us more and more and more with each day. Basically mortgaging, you know, the lives of our children and our grandchildren in order to pay for it, while at the same time neglecting all that needs to be done to make sure that we can live a decent standard of living here in this country. 
   So we have fought this and we are still fighting. I yield.

   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am very supportive of our troops around the globe and in particular those who are in harm's way in Iraq. I wholeheartedly support H. Con. Res. 63. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the President's January 29, 2002, State of the Union address, in regards to protecting America, responding to terrorist threats and capturing Osama bin Laden, he said, this is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out our inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world. 
   States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. 
   Secretary Rice, after being named Secretary to succeed Colin Powell, warned 6 months before the invasion in Iraq that Saddam Hussein could deploy a nuclear weapon, saying that the administration did not want a smoking gun. We want to know as New Yorkers, when will we find Osama bin Laden

   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am very supportive of our troops around the globe and in particular those who are in harms way in Iraq. I wholeheartedly support H. Con. Res. 63. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the President's January 29, 2002, State of the Union address, in regards to protecting America, responding to the terrorist threat and capturing Osama bin Laden, he said (meaning Iraq): ..... This is a regime that agreed to international inspections--then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world. 
   States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be Catastrophic. 
   Secretary Rice, after being named Secretary of State to succeed Colin Powell, Secretary Rice warned six months before the invasion of Iraq that Saddam Hussein could deploy a nuclear weapon, saying that the administration did not ``want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.'' according to the Washington Post. We now know that these assertions were a fiction created by this administration to justify the unjustifiable. 
   U.S. Central Command Gen. Tommy Franks, the war's operational commander misjudged the interests of our Afghan allies. He ran the war from Tampa with no commander on the scene above the rank of lieutenant colonel. According to another Washington Post April 17, 2002, article; The first Americans did not arrive until 3 days into the fighting. 
   As a representative from NY whose constituents resent the lies and deception thrust upon us to justify this war and creating a distraction away from the homeland security we all desire the question is: When will Osama bin Laden be brought to justice. 
   The article continues by identifying that Osama bin Laden slipped through the cordon ostensibly placed around Tora Bora as U.S. aircraft began bombing on Nov. 30. More precisely, bin Laden was in Tora Bora on Nov. 26, spoke to his fighters about ``holy war'' then, as quickly as he had come, bin Laden vanished into the pine forests with four of his loyalists walking in the direction of Pakistan. bin Laden escaped according to the Christian Science Monitor, somewhere between Nov. 28 to Nov. 30 as confirmed by Arabs and Afghans in eastern Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support our troops and that is why we must commence the redeployment of our troops today. Thus far: 
   There are 135,544 troops in Iraq today. 3127 or 2.3 percent of U.S. soldiers have been killed in service to our country. 
   Seventeen percent or 23,279 U.S. soldiers have been seriously wounded in service to our country. 
   Twenty percent of the troops wounded have received serious brain or spinal injuries; 30 percent of U.S. troops develop serious mental health problems within 3 to 4 months of returning home. 
   During the President's tenure, he has requested a cumulative total of more than $700 billion to pay for the war effort in Iraq; $9 billion of U.S. taxpayers money is unaccounted for. 
   The State of New York has lost 143 soldiers, 16 from Brooklyn. U.S. troops continue to die from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have been sent to Iraq with poorly constructed and poorly armored equipment. Pentagon war planners have created a high level task force that has spent $6.7 billion on how to combat IEDs. 
   Thousands of Americans are dead, thousand more will die if we don't get our troops home and get them redeployed today. I oppose the President's call for 21,000 more troops to go to Iraq. I support our troops and that's why I want them home where they belong.

<DOCNO>Ms. CLARKE. (FEMALE TROOPS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. CLARKE. Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq has presented numerous hardships for our troops, their families, and by extension, our Nation. Over 3,000 American soldiers have been killed. Every day brings news of more explosions and more soldiers coming home with traumatic brain injuries and other maladies. However, this war has been a particular hardship for our Nation's courageous female troops. 
   In this, the first full week of National Women's History Month, I feel it is vital that we recognize the historic trials being faced by the women who are defending our country. As of 2005, there was a record 203,000 female troops on active duty in military, along with many thousands more National Guard and Reserve troops activated to work in Iraq. 
   Like their male counterparts, many of these female troops never expected to fight in a war and certainly not for such an extended period of time. Countless soldiers are mothers who joined the National Guard and Reserves to give back to their country. Now they find themselves half a world away from their homes and families, fighting a war on the sun-hardened battlefields of Iraq with no resolution or end in sight.
