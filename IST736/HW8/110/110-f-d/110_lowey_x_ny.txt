<DOCNO>Mrs. LOWEY. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House H.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs. 
   I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee. 
   I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds. 
   The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad. 
   For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world. 
   The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges. 
   The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. 
   The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs. 
   As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill. 
   This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008. 
   There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs. 
   With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position. 
   The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur. 
   This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the military aid to Egypt can be released. 
   Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants. 
   This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there. 
   Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House. 
   In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.     Insert offset folio 420/1 EH20JN07.001     Insert offset folio 420/2 EH20JN07.002     Insert offset folio 420/3 EH20JN07.003     Insert offset folio 420/4 EH20JN07.004     Insert offset folio 420/5 EH20JN07.005     Insert offset folio 420/6 EH20JN07.006     Insert offset folio 420/7 EH20JN07.007 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Wolf, my ranking member, again. I do believe that we have created a good, strong bipartisan bill. I appreciated the comments on both sides of the aisle. Although there may be some differences, I know that when the amendments are presented, these differences will be apparent. 
   I do hope in the final analysis, as a result again of both Republican and Democratic members of the committee, this bill passes. This is a good, strong bill, and it is so needed by the people of this world. I know that both my ranking member and all the members of the committee and myself understand the important responsibility we have in this committee, and I look forward to passing this bill tomorrow with a good, strong vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mrs. LOWEY. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman WAXMAN and Ranking Member DAVIS of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   I rise in support of this bill and in particular, the provisions extending whistleblower protections to federal employees who work on national security matters, including those employed by the Transportation Security Administration. 
   The simple fact is that TSA screeners are treated differently than other Department of Homeland Security personnel. That is why I authored the provisions in the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007, which the House passed in January, that would give TSOs whistleblower and collective bargaining rights. 
   Astonishingly, the President has threatened to veto the 9/11 bill over this provision. 
   TSA screeners are frontline security workers who perform a crucial and often grueling job that requires training, experience, and patience. We need workers who have mastered the job and providing whistleblower protections to TSA employees is part of a broader strategy to ensure that these individuals will make a career of protecting our Nation. 
   I intend to vote for this bill not only to strengthen protections for whistleblowers and restore accountability to the federal government, but to advance this critical TSA provision through the legislative process and show the President that we are serious about giving our frontline security workers the same rights as other Department of Homeland Security personnel. 
   I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1591 and commend Chairman Obey, Chairman Murtha, and our Speaker for putting together a bill that protects our troops, responds to the will of the American people, and preserves our Nation's interests. 
   Our men and women in uniform have served with honor and courage, but we are not doing our part. Our Armed Forces are not battle-ready, nor is their mission clear and achievable. There is no definition of victory. The nature of the battle has changed, and our troops now find themselves policing a bloody civil war. It is well past time to set clear parameters for this war. 
   Since the beginning, this war and reconstruction efforts have been ill-managed. Just yesterday the Iraq IG reported yet again on how unprepared the administration was for the task of reconstruction. The Defense Department had no strategy for restoring government institutions, establishing security, or rebuilding infrastructure, and the State Department was cut completely out of the work. 
   There continues to be a lack of coordination and strategy to achieve our objectives. Putting billions of dollars more into this war without any parameters and risking the lives of more of our brave men and women is not only foolish; it is immoral. As the New York Times editorial noted on Thursday, if the President won't step up to the task of setting benchmarks and ensuring the safety of our troops, then it falls to us, this Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill does just that. We are stepping up to our responsibilities. This legislation does not micromanage the war, as many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim. It is a very carefully considered approach to bringing accountability to the execution of the war and to the reconstruction efforts. Moreover, it sets a date certain for the end of this war so we can bring our troops home. 
   No amount of American blood or treasure can help Iraq if the Iraqis don't help themselves. The Maliki government must exhibit the political will to confront extremists on both sides of the Sunni-Shia divide, to give all segments of society a stake in Iraq's future, and to put Iraqi revenues towards the hard task of reconstruction. Congress didn't pull these benchmarks from the air. They were put forth by the Iraqis and by President Bush in his January 10 speech. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are already into the fifth year of this war. The bill provides the funding the President requested, but it does not do so unconditionally. This bill sets benchmarks, provides a date certain for withdrawal. 
   The days of open-ended commitment and unilateral check-writing privileges are over. This bill deals with Iraq responsibly, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment and would like to thank Representative Dicks for providing over $320 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities. 
   Our contributions to the arts and humanities are the standard by which our history as a society will be measured. A strong public commitment to the arts and humanities, along with a dedication to freedom, is the hallmark of great civilizations. History has shown that religious and political freedoms go hand in hand with greater artistic and literary activity, and that the societies that flourish and have a lasting influence on humanity are those that encourage free expression in all of its forms. This is a lesson that resonates with people of every age, background, and belief, and one that we can guarantee our children learn. 
   Our support for the arts and humanities also has a profound impact on our economy. In my Congressional District, there are close to 2,000 arts-related businesses, providing more than 9,000 jobs. This creates a substantial economic impact. Nationally, the arts industry generates $134 billion in economic activity, sustaining over 5.7 million jobs. 
   Even more significant is the return on the investment for the American taxpayer. While the federal government spent just over $250 million on the NEA and NEH in Fiscal Year 2007, it collected over $24.4 billion in tax revenue related to the arts industry. Federal funding for the NEA and NEH is crucial to the arts community, helping leverage more state, local, and private funds. Clearly, the numbers show that investment in the arts is important not only to our national identity, but also to our national economy. 
   Mr. Chairman, we must act decisively to commit ourselves to our national heritage and culture, by voting to properly fund the NEA and NEH. I urge my colleagues to support creativity and reflection, to support our economy, and to support the continued growth and expression of democracy in its fullest form by rejecting this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, today is a solemn day for New Yorkers and all Americans as we remember the men, women, children who lost their lives 7 years ago on September 11, 2001. For many of us the wounds of that terrible day are still raw, as are the reminders that are now woven into our daily lives. The pain associated with the loss of loved ones, the still incomplete skyline of Manhattan, the terror alerts, the checkpoints, the baggage searches and the war. 
   The attacks of September 11 were intended to strike at the heart of our country, our values, and our way of life. In spite of this incredible act of hatred and violence, however, Americans remain united not only in our resolve to defeat those who want to do us harm but in our unwavering support for our Armed Forces, first responders, and the intelligence community who have answered the call to protect us at home and abroad. It is in this spirit that we remain committed to honoring the memories of all who lost their lives on that horrible day and commending those who continue to risk their lives since then to bolster our homeland security, protect our ideals and values, keep our communities safe, and ensure that America never again experiences such an evil act of violence on our soil.  
   Thank you, Mr. Ackerman, for sponsoring this resolution, and God bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   As a New Yorker, I must tell you as honestly and openly as I can, that the hours that we have spent on this issue are an embarrassment, an affront to every New Yorker who experienced 9/11, who went down to that site, and saw our brave men and women responding to the emergency, every New Yorker who went to a funeral, to talk to a family about the loss of their loved one because of the lack of interoperability for one thing. 
   I cannot understand how my friends on the other side could be spending all these hours debating earmarks when we should be passing one of the most important bills of the House. 
   As Chair of the committee that funds State and Foreign Operations, I've always worked in a bipartisan way. I know my good friends, DAVID PRICE and HAL ROGERS, have always worked in a bipartisan way. We should get on with the business of this bill, and I would be embarrassed to have a constituent watch us, spend all night, all day focusing on Member-directed projects. 
   You and I know that they need to be evaluated. A process has been in place for transparency. I think we've moved in a very positive direction. So let's get on with the business of this bill. 
   We have no higher priority than to take every action necessary to protect our country, and I would just like to highlight a few of the provisions in this bill that are so important. 
   The first would create a pilot program to screen airport workers, and I've worked in a bipartisan way on this issue. In March, two airport workers in Orlando boarded a plane and made it to Puerto Rico with a bag containing firearms and drugs, and this incident set off an alarm, reminding us that we've waited far too long to take sufficient action. Those who have unfettered access to sterile and secure areas of airports need to be physically screened. Meticulously screening passengers but giving workers open access is like installing an expensive home security system and leaving the back door open. This bill is the first step to close this loophole, something that is supported by Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   Aviation security enhancements are not limited to airport worker screening. The bill makes the necessary investment to purchase and install explosive detection systems. Last year, British authorities uncovered a plot to destroy airliners over the Atlantic, which the terrorists believed would be on the same scale as the September 11 attack. We have to do all we can to reduce our vulnerabilities, particularly to known threats that terrorists have attempted to exploit. 
   The second item I would like to applaud is the inclusion of much-needed funds for interoperability grants. After September 11, I wrote a bill to require the administration to create an office and grant program dedicated to interoperability and to implement a national strategy. Since that time, the office has been created, and last year's appropriations bill included my strategy proposal. This bill would fund that grant program, which the House overwhelmingly approved in January as part of the 9/11 bill. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to go back to their districts and ask first responders what the Federal Government can do to help them. I guarantee that one of the most frequent responses will be interoperability and communications problems. This bill provides not only the funding, but language on standards and other planning provisions that are beneficial.  
   Third, this bill significantly enhances our ability to protect our ports. One of the biggest fears of security experts is that a terrorist will bring a nuclear weapon into the country through a port. This bill nearly doubles the funding for grants to protect ports and provides much-needed funding for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to develop and deploy the next generation of radiation portal monitors. 
   A fourth improvement is transit security. In the last 5 years, terrorists have attacked trains in Madrid, London and Mumbai.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, this bill would provide $400 million, more than twice the amount previously provided, for first responders to reduce this glaring vulnerability. 
   This bill is full of substantive provisions to assist first responders that we need to debate. For example, I look forward to considering several substantive amendments such as one submitted by my friend on the other side of the aisle that would assist a program that provides a ring around New York to prevent a terrorist from bringing a nuclear weapon into the city. But we can't have that debate and others about making our Nation safer if the minority continues to insist on pushing procedural roadblocks. 
   In addition to serving on the Appropriations Subcommittee, I'm a member of the Homeland Security authorizing committee. We know that the threats against our country are real. Let's end these procedural delaying tactics. 
   Although the chairman, the ranking member and the members of the committee have produced a really important bill, I know that many Members who are here getting up to speak may have additional thoughts, additional ideas to make our homeland safer. Shame on all of us if we're spending the time arguing procedural tactics and not focusing on the homeland security issues that are before us. As a New Yorker, I am personally offended. Let's move on with it.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1157, the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act. The bill is the product of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, and in my judgment truly represents a fair compromise that will lead to meaningful changes in how breast cancer research is conducted throughout the Federal Government. 
   The bill passed by voice vote in the Energy and Commerce Committee. It will improve the caliber of breast cancer research, improve transparency for breast cancer research dollars and vastly increase the role of advocates in determining research priorities. 
   I would like to thank a few key individuals who have been an integral part of advancing this legislation. First of all, my partner on this bill, Congresswoman SUE MYRICK. She has done a yeoman job, and we have worked together for a very, very long time. Congratulations. Of course, her staff, Sarah Hale; the Senate sponsor of this bill, Majority Leader HARRY REID and his staff, Carolyn Gluck; Ranking Member Barton and his staff, Ryan Long; Minority Whip ROY BLUNt and his staff, Cheryl Jaeger; Health Subcommittee Chairman, my good friend Congressman Pallone, we came to the Congress together, and his staff, Bobby Clark; and, of course, Chairman Dingell and his staff, in particular Jessica McNiece and Greg Rothschild, who have spent countless hours on this bill. Without their commitment to advancing a bipartisan product, frankly, we wouldn't be here today. 
   The bill is a really good one, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Thank you to Chairman Obey, Ranking Member Walsh, and their staff for their hard work in crafting this bill. 
   At the start of the year, Chairman Obey asked us to consider not only the challenges of today, but those of the year ahead, and I believe the bill does just that. The bill addresses the appalling reality that 46 million people in this country lack health insurance by providing a $200 million increase for community health centers, $75 million for grants for States to develop plans to cover their uninsured, $75 million for States to create insurance pools for high-risk individuals. Furthermore, recognizing that one of the best ways to keep women healthy is to provide them with access to high-quality family planning services and other preventative health care, the bill provides a $27 million increase to the Title X family program for low-income women. 
   The bill acknowledges that millions of students are shut out of college for financial reasons or lack of preparation in the early years and increases the maximum Pell Grant award by $200, restores proposed cuts to supplemental education grants, and increases both GEAR UP and TRIO. 
   The bill provides desperately needed relief to after-school programs by increasing 21st Century Community Learning Centers by $125 million. As a result of the Republican-controlled Congress level funding this program for more than 5 years in a row, thousands of children, including more than 34,000 in New York could lose these programs if this increase isn't approved quickly. 
   At a time when we're on the cusp of finding cures for some of the world's most devastating diseases, this bill increases our investment in biomedical research, and the bill provides a $700  million increase for NIH which would allow for hundreds of new research grants. 
   However, I would be remiss if I didn't express my disappointment that the mark also includes an increase by the same amount for abstinence-only programs when there is mounting evidence questioning the accuracy of some of the curriculum taught in those programs.  
   We all agree that we must teach our children that abstinence is the best way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. We should all also agree that abstinence-until-marriage programs must provide children with the most medically accurate information available. Unfortunately, study after study has found that many of these programs teach inaccurate and even harmful information to our young people. 
   I also hope to work with Chairman Obey as the bill moves through the legislative process to reverse the potential damage of the large Workforce Investment Act reduction that was passed during Committee markup. If these cuts are enacted, New York could lose approximately $28 million in worker training funds. 
   Despite these two concerns, this bill--for the first time in a number of years--takes big steps towards addressing some of our nation's most pressing challenges. I am proud to support it, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, thank you to Chairman OBEY and Ranking Member WALSH and their staffs for their hard work in crafting this bill. 
   This conference report goes a long way towards addressing the current and future needs of millions of Americans and their families. 
   It provides relief for families that desperately need child care and afterschool programs; for teachers anxious to receive classroom training or 
   professional development; for students who won't be able to attend college without an increase in the maximum Pell Grant; and for the elderly who depend on LIHEAP to help pay for the rising cost of home heating oil. 
   What some of my friends on the other side of the aisle who intend to vote against this conference report don't seem to understand is that the programs funded in this bill literally make a life-or-death difference in the lives of millions of American families who are struggling to make ends meet. 
   We find a way to pay $12 billion every month for the war in Iraq, yet some of you will fight tooth and nail against the additional $9.8 billion in this bill that will help 436,000 more disadvantaged children receive math and reading assistance; or 130,000 more children receive afterschool care; or support 600 additional research grants at NIH; or provide 1.2 million uninsured Americans access to healthcare at community health centers. 
   It is outrageous, and it is unconscionable. 
   Chairman OBEY should be commended for what he accomplished in this bill, and I urge every member in this body to support the conference report.

<DOCNO>Mrs. LOWEY. (HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MIKE M<em>c</em>NULTY -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. And I want to thank you, my friend from New York, for organizing this Special Order. 
   I think, frankly, it would have been more appropriate if we had organized it in the Chinese restaurant down the street because I know that there have been many special hours where Mr. Ackerman and Mr. McNulty and those of us that were lucky to join you really had wonderful evenings together, talking about the Congress, talking about life in general, and families. 
   I want to rise today, Mr. Speaker, to recognize the accomplishments of my good friend, Representative Mike McNulty. 
   I didn't know you for all the 39 years of dedicated public service, but since you've been here, we've worked closely together, and I consider you a really good friend. Mike's exemplary commitment has earned the admiration of constituents and colleagues alike. 
   And Mike and I had a very special relationship. I do remember when it came time to get committees--and in those days, Mike McNulty and I were fortunate to be asked to be on both Ways and Means and Appropriations. And the gentleman that Mike was knew that appropriations was my first choice. And MIKE was generous enough--and perhaps wise enough--to choose the outstanding Ways and Means Committee. But I do remember those discussions, and I remember how gracious and elegant you were. 
   I also remember, Mike McNulty, the time when I was exploring running for the Senate. And I had traveled a bit around New York and I met quite a few people. And no matter what, and no matter who was the opposition, every time I would come to the floor Mike said, ``I'm with you. I'm with you.'' Mike is the kind of friend who, when he's with you, he's with you, and you can always count on Mike McNulty. 
   I also remember--and perhaps I won't discuss it on the floor today--that Mike McNulty and my husband have had a very special relationship. We've had some good times together. And Mike would always say, ``So, where's Steve? Where's Steve? We have some business to do today.'' And I'll remember those times, and I do hope we get to share many more. 
   Mike, I also remember what a special experience it was for us both to get blessed by the Pope. And I remember very clearly Mike McNulty and others who have had that experience before said, fill your pockets, fill your pockets with rosary beads. And boy, I filled my pockets so that I still have draws of them left, Mike McNulty. So if there's anyone special that needs a little bit of blessing from our special trip with the Pope, I would be very happy to share it with you.     
   Now, when I look back at Michael's background--a graduate of the College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., Mike began his career by serving as the youngest town supervisor in New York. 
   It's hard to believe that after 8 short years as town supervisor you were elected mayor of the Village of Green Island, New York, that you served until 1977 when you were elected to represent New York's 106th Assembly District, that in the New York legislature you served as the chairman of the assembly's Democratic study group, and that you chaired the subcommittees on alcoholism and corrections and transportation capital improvements. Later, you were appointed to the Legislative Commission on Rural Resources, an administrative review commission. In 1988, the same year I was elected, you were elected to represent New York's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. In 1992, you were elected to represent New York's 21st Congressional District, which includes Albany, Montgomery, Schenectady, and Schoharie Counties with almost 80 percent of the vote. 
   I don't know how you did that. I've never gotten 80 percent of the vote, Michael. 
   You were reelected for your 10th term in the United States House of Representatives in 2006, serving on the Armed Services Committee, the Small Business Committee, the International Relations Committee, the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. You're currently serving on the Ways and Means Committee for the 15th year on which you chair the Subcommittee on Social Security. 
   Again, you've been such a tireless advocate for seniors. You championed the needs of hardworking families as a member of the Labor and Working Families Caucus, and you've really balanced your distinguished career with an equally impressive family life.  
   We've talked about your wife of 37 years. Now I've been married 47 years, Michael, so I wish you good luck and success for the future when you'll be spending a lot more time with family--with Nancy and your four daughters: Michele, Angela, Nancy, and Maria, and with your five grandchildren. I have eight, so they can continue to work on that. They are Lola, Daniel, Teigin, Elijah, and Morgyn. 
   We've had such wonderful times together. I have such enormous respect for you. You're a real gentleman. You're a hard worker. You're the kind of person who I am proud to have as a friend and who I am proud to serve with in this Congress. 
   I want to congratulate you on your very successful career in public service and on your unparalleled devotion to your constituents. There is a lot more work to be done, so even though you're going home to be with family and friends, I know that all of the many challenges that we all face together will continue to attract you and will compel you to continue your great career in public service. 
   So thank you, my friend. I look forward to continuing to work with you and to keeping in touch with you. You're very, very special, and we all love you. 
   Thank you.

<DOCNO>Mrs. LOWEY. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my good friend, my colleague, Mr. Wolf, I look forward to working closely with you. And as you may know, or I am surprised if you don't know, my staff was working with your staff every single step of the way, and your input and the input of your staff was invaluable. So we can have further discussions. Thank you very much. 
   And I want to commend Chairman Obey and all the staff on both sides of the aisle, because we worked on the bill together, for their tireless work. 
   It is a shame, frankly, that the Republican leadership of the 109th Congress failed to finish its work on the fiscal year 2007 appropriations bills, leaving vital programs in the lurch. 
   And while this bill is the result of the Republicans' abdication of duty in the 109th Congress, it is a fair, balanced, and bipartisan attempt to continue essential government programs and services and address critical priorities. 
   Specifically, this joint resolution provides a total of $4.55 billion for global HIV/AIDS and TB, almost $300 million above the President's fiscal year 2007 request, including $724 million for the Global Fund. We have also increased PEPFAR funding by $75 million over the President's request to put hundreds of thousands more people on lifesaving medications. 
   In addition to keeping the momentum in our HIV/AIDS initiatives, the joint resolution also addresses the ongoing genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Two-and-a-half years after Congress declared the atrocities to be genocide, violence continues unabated. This bill provides $50 million in additional funds for the only peacekeepers on the ground, the African Union forces. 
   Additionally, this bill meets our commitment for Israel and Egypt as requested for fiscal year 2007. 
   And, finally, having just returned from Afghanistan, I do believe there is still a glimmer of hope that our assistance can make a positive impact there. I am pleased that the joint resolution provides over $1 billion for reconstruction programs, counternarcotics and other priorities. And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution.

<DOCNO>Mrs. LOWEY. (DIRECTING PROVISION OF GRANTS FOR INTERNET CRIME PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAMS -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Ms. LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ's legislation, which would make grants available for Internet safety education programs. 
   Advances in technology have resulted in new conveniences, greater access to information, and the ability to correspond easily and quickly with individuals around the world. However, the recent explosion of social networking sites and internet chat-rooms has also created opportunities for predators to target children easily and anonymously. 
   Eighty-seven percent of teens use the internet on a regular basis, and according to the Justice Department, one in five children between the ages of ten and seventeen has received a sexual solicitation or has been approached online in the last year. The internet provides students with a world of information and has become a necessity in many of our everyday lives, yet it unfortunately can expose our kids to a world of potential dangers without adequate protections. 
   For example, early this year a teenage girl in Florida was found one day after she snuck out of her house to meet who she thought was a 24-year-old man she met on MySpace, but turned out to be a 46-year-old high-risk sex offender. Several social networking sites have implemented some security measures, but sex offenders have found ways to get around them. That is why I applaud efforts such as those by Attorney General Cuomo to ensure that social networking sites meet the safety standards they advertise. 
   It is imperative that we do everything we can to make the internet as safe as possible for our children. At the local level, many of our law enforcement agencies and schools are doing wonderful work using internet safety curriculum to educate students on how to avoid dangerous, inappropriate, or unlawful online behavior. 
   As a mother and grandmother, I am fighting at the federal level to reduce the risk that our children face online from child predators. That is why I am so pleased that today the House is considering five different pieces of legislation, several of which I have cosponsored, that promote internet safety and crack down on child pornography. 
   Ms. S&#193;NCHEZ's bill would create a grant program for organizations that promote internet safety. These grants will help crime safety groups such as the National Crime Prevention Council develop programs to better educate children, parents, teachers, libraries, and others on the dangers of potential online criminal activity and cyberbullying. 
   The SAFER Net Act, sponsored by Ms. BEAN, authorizes $5 million for a national public awareness campaign to promote internet safety. Several internet safety programs exist, but the federal government must do a better job ensuring that parents and schools are able to utilize those programs. 
   Mr. POMEROY's KIDS Act would close a dangerous loophole by requiring sexual offenders to include e-mail addresses and instant messaging screen names when complying with registration and notification laws. Notification laws have enabled parents to know when a sexual predator has moved into their neighborhood, but not their inbox. 
   As a member of the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children Caucus, I know that the passage of this series of bills is a significant step in our efforts to protect children as they use the internet.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mourn the loss of my friend and colleague Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   Stephanie Tubbs Jones was a kind and caring friend, a hard-working and diligent colleague, and a committed representative. She was also a trailblazer--she was the first African-American and the first female prosecutor in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, the first African-American woman to be elected to serve Ohio in the House of Representatives, and the first African-American woman to serve on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. 
   Stephanie Tubbs Jones was an inspiration to me and to others who aspire to represent their constituents with passion, dedication, and integrity. A champion of voting rights, she stood up for those who lacked a voice to ensure that they are not denied the most fundamental right of our democracy--the right to vote. 
   In her role as Chair of the House Ethics Committee, she led the House of Representatives in ensuring that Members of Congress live up to high standards. She understood that increasing Americans' confidence in their government requires honest and ethical behavior by their leaders. 
   All those who loved Stephanie Tubbs Jones, including her son Melvyn Leroy Jones II, and her sister Barbara Walker, are in my thoughts and prayers. 
   As we mourn the passing of this intelligent, hard-working, and caring representative, we celebrate her accomplishments. We are reminded that despite the tragedy of her passing, her life was a blessing for her colleagues, her friends, her family, her constituents, and so many who needed a champion.

   Mrs. LOWEY. It is my pleasure to thank our distinguished chairman, Mr. Oberstar, for your expertise on these very important issues. 
   On September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 flew directly over New York's Indian Point Nuclear Facility on its way to the World Trade Center.     
   One year later, a taped interview on al-Jazeera indicated that al Qaeda initially planned to include a nuclear plant as one of its targets. The Indian Point nuclear power plant is less than 50 miles from New York City. 
   The FAA's post-September 11 no fly zone around the plant was lifted in November 2001. Since that time, I've worked with my Hudson Valley colleagues to protect Indian Point from any potential terrorist threat, including calling for a no fly zone around the facility. 
   Will the chairman commit to working with me to ensure that both the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Aviation Administration are protecting the airspace around this facility and protecting the more than 20 million people who live near Indian Point from all aviation threats?

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule and of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, specifically division J on State and Foreign Operations.

I also wanted to thank Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Obey for their knowledge and their commitment to the priorities in this bill. 
   Just a few highlights. For those of us who did read the bill, what do we have, 20 hours, 3,500 pages. I am sure if you all divided it up, you would have a good understanding of what is in that bill. 
   Some highlights: $6.5 billion, $796 million above the President's request, for HIV/AIDS and other global health programs; $1.5 billion to address humanitarian emergencies, including Iraqi refugees; $550 million for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Darfur, funding for Liberian security sector assistance and increased assistance for Africa; an expansion of basic education, safe water, environmental programs; $1.544 billion, 344 million above the Senate-passed level, for the Millennium Challenge Account. This funding will allow them to undertake all planned compacts and threshold programs this year. It maintains Israel's qualitative military edge. It maintains our development and security assistance to the people of Pakistan, assistance central to helping them fight al Qaeda, the Taliban and associated terrorist groups. 
   And I want to especially thank our staff for their tireless work in crafting the bipartisan bill, the division J of this Consolidated Appropriations Act. This bill will help make America be more secure and improve the lives of millions around the world, and I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, which would rename the Wykagyl Post Office in New Rochelle, New York after Robert Merrill. 
   I want to thank Chairman Waxman for his support of this bill and for placing it on the suspension calendar today. 
   Born on June 4, 1919, Robert Merrill spent his life performing from the grand stages of the world's opera houses to Broadway and music and television. He set the standard for theatrical and musical excellence. 
   Robert Merrill was a favorite of U.S. Presidents, performing at the invitation of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan. He was the only singer to perform before Congress, the Cabinet and the Supreme Court, and Mrs. Roosevelt at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt memorial service held in the U.S. Capitol. 
   In 1968, President Johnson appointed him to the National Council on the Arts, and President Clinton awarded him the National Medal of Arts in 1993. 
   Throughout his career, Merrill performed as a soloist with every major orchestra in the United States and many of the world's great conductors, including Arturo Toscanini, Leonard Bernstein and Herbert von Karajan. His annual coast-to-coast recitals included performances at such venues as Wolf Trap, the Hollywood Bowl, Philadelphia's Mann Music Center. 
   Often referred to as ``America's Star Spangled Baritone,'' he was well known for singing the ``Star Spangled Banner'' at Yankee Stadium. In 1969, Merrill began singing the national anthem on opening day for the New York Yankees, a tradition that continued for over 25 years. 
   In addition to his dedicated singing career, Robert Merrill also lent his talent and presence to community and local charities, including volunteer work at the New Rochelle Hospital and New Rochelle Public Library. 
   For over 50 years, Robert and his wife, Marion, made New Rochelle, New York their home and were active supporters of West Chester Community College, the West Chester Arts Council and the New Rochelle Arts Council. 
   Mr. Speaker, Robert Merrill spread his talents and love for the arts all over the country, enriching all who experienced his performances. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring this great American by passing this legislation.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 1591 and commend Chairman Obey for your efforts to protect our troops, respect the wishes of the American people, and preserve our Nation's interest in this bill. 
   Our troops have served with honor and courage. However, they should be deployed only when battle ready and with a clear and achievable mission. Neither is the case today in Iraq. Recent reports indicate the troop surge is not working. The number of casualties rose again in March, and this bloody trend continues. 
   We have heard from this administration that it is not willing to negotiate on Iraq. Frankly, their unwillingness to compromise has led us to this point, and the right of the American people to be heard is nonnegotiable. No amount of American blood or treasure can help Iraq if the Iraqis don't help themselves.  
   The Maliki government must exhibit the political will to confront extremists, to give all segments of society a stake in Iraq's future, and to put Iraqi revenues towards the hard task of reconstruction. That is why this bill asks the President to certify that the Iraqis are doing their part in meeting critical benchmarks. 
   In addition, I am pleased the conference report includes nearly $200 million in increased funding for Afghanistan, $80.3 million for Jordan, $45 million for Liberia, $769 million for Lebanon, much needed assistance for Sudan and Somalia, increased funding for disaster and refugee aid to Iraq, increased accountability through funding expanded mandates for the special Inspector General and the State and USAID IG operations. 
   While this bill provides most of the funding requested by the President, it puts in place safeguards and oversight to stop waste, fraud and abuse with U.S. taxpayer dollars in Iraq. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. I thank my distinguished colleague from New York for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 64, a resolution expressing the sense of the House that the Government of Bangladesh should drop all charges against Bangladeshi journalist, Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury. I want to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) for his leadership on this issue. 
   In May of 2006, the American Jewish Committee awarded Mr. Choudhury the Moral Courage Award. Unfortunately, he was not there to receive this honor because more than 2 years earlier he was arrested while attempting to board a flight from Bangladesh to Tel Aviv. Mr. Choudhury's passport was confiscated, his house and possessions were raided, and he was first cited for a passport violation because Bangladeshi law prohibits travel to Israel. Subsequently, he was charged with sedition, accused of espionage, and imprisoned for 17 months.  
   What is his crime? Mr. Choudhury spoke up for interfaith dialogue, he published articles critical of Islamic extremism, and he appealed for greater religious tolerance and freedom. For these ``crimes'' he is charged with sedition, an offense punishable by death. 
   Mr. Choudhury has already been harassed and subjected to harsh interrogation techniques in prison. His newspaper offices were bombed by Islamic extremists in July of 2006, and he was physically attacked in October of 2006. 
   This resolution calls on the Government of Bangladesh to immediately drop the charges against Mr. Choudhury, to return his confiscated property, to stop intimidation tactics against him, and to protect him from future harassment. 
   Mr. Choudhury advocates peace and tolerance. It is time that Congress sends a strong and clear message: we are watching, and we will not allow Mr. Choudhury and others like him to be silenced. 
   I hope you will join me in strongly supporting H. Res. 64.

   Mrs. LOWEY. I thank the gentleman, the very distinguished, extraordinary Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res 322, which recognizes the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel. 
   For all of us who gathered around the Passover table this weekend to pledge ourselves, ``next year in Jerusalem,'' the Jewish State of Israel is a commitment of both mind and heart. It is a homeland for the Jewish people persecuted, slaughtered and driven from their land for centuries, and it continues to be a safe haven for refugees from around the world. 
   One of the most compelling experiences of my life was greeting the Ethiopian Jews as they arrived in Ben Gurion Airport after their dramatic rescue as a part of Operation Solomon in the 1980s. I also will never forget visiting with the children of Yemin Orde in northern Israel. This youth village is home to orphaned, disadvantaged and at-risk children from over 20 countries, and it exemplifies Israel's humanitarian commitment. Israel has offered its technical expertise in search and rescue, medicine, and humanitarian aid in the aftermath of nearly every modern disaster, from Katrina to the tsunami. 
   Israel is also an intellectual and cultural hub: Eight Israeli citizens have received the Nobel Prize, and Israeli technology has helped countless farmers in dry-weather areas and provided low-cost, life-saving drugs to millions. 
   Moreover, Israel is a source of stability and a voice of reason in a neighborhood plagued by extremism and violent uprising. Its commitment to democracy and freedom of expression is unshakeable, and it is our most reliable partner in our efforts to combat terrorism, enhance human rights and basic freedoms, and encourage free institutions. 
   It is simply incredible that all of this has occurred while Israel is under constant threat. That is why I rise today to commend the State of Israel and the Israeli people on their commitment to democracy, peace and advancement. May the next 60 years bring continued prosperity and the realization of permanent peace for this great nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2063, the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act. 
   And I want to thank my good friend Congresswoman Lois Capps and Congressman Deal for your support on this very important legislation. 
   More than 11 million Americans suffer from food allergies. Each year several hundred of these individuals die and an estimated 30,000 receive lifesaving treatments in emergency rooms due to food-induced anaphylaxis. Despite the critical nature of these allergies, the only way to prevent dangerous reactions is to avoid all foods that contain allergy-inducing ingredients. And while there have been vast improvements in food labeling, this is still easier said than done, particularly for millions of children in school-based settings.     
   Unfortunately, we have a patchwork of policies, regulations and State laws to address this problem. Food allergies and the risk of anaphylaxis are simply too dangerous to not have a more uniform approach to safety. 
   The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act, which I first introduced in 2005, would require the Department of Health and Human Services to provide schools across the country with uniform guidance on how to create management and emergency plans for students with food allergies. These guidelines, which will be developed in consultation with the country's leading scientists and public health officials, will help schools tailor management plans to their students' individual needs, while also giving them confidence that the measures they are taking have the stamp of approval from the Federal Government. These guidelines are not only critically important in keeping children safe throughout the school day, but in ensuring that there is uniformity in how schools address this growing problem. 
   With the enactment of this legislation, parents will no longer have to worry about their children's safety if they move to a different school district or State. And most importantly, parents will no longer be charged with creating these policies on their own. This commonsense legislation will give schools, teachers and parents the information they need to keep food-allergic children safer and deserves the support of every one of my colleagues. 
   I would like to thank Senator Dodd, who is pushing a similar bill in the Senate, Leader Hoyer and his staff, Ivana Alexander, Chairmen Dingell, Miller and Pallone and their staffs, particularly William Garner and Bobby Clark, for their support of this bill, and of course Jean Doyle, my legislative director, for her tireless efforts on this issue. I would also like to thank Anne Munoz-Furlong from the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, Todd Slotkin from the Food Allergy Initiative, Dave Bunning from the Food Allergy Project, and Dr. Hugh Sampson from Mt. Sinai Hospital for their tireless work on behalf of all individuals with food allergies. 
   This bill will take an important step in protecting children with food allergies. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. I want to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King for moving this bill to the floor in a bipartisan manner. 
   The President's budget request for fiscal year 2008 includes only $41 million for TSA for surface transportation, less than 1 percent of the TSA budget. From fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2006, DHS distributed approximately $387 million for rail and mass transit security grants. On average, that is only one penny of Federal homeland security funding spent for each of the 9.5 billion transit passenger trips each year. This number is miniscule compared with the average Federal security investment of $9 per airline passenger trip. 
   This legislation represents the first step in closing the enormous gap between Federal spending on aviation security and spending on security for rail and public transportation. 
   As we saw in the uncovered plot to bomb the Herald Square subway station in New York City, as well as the horrific attacks in Madrid, London and Mumbai, terrorists are targeting mass transit systems, and we must do what it takes to protect and secure our transportation networks. 
   This bill, for the first time, authorizes dedicated risk-based funding for the security of railroad carriers, public transportation systems, and over-the-road bus systems. 
   It also provides for fire and line-safety improvements to be made at Amtrak tunnels throughout the critically important Northeast corridor, including six tunnels in the New York City area. 
   Every day, thousands of my constituents join more than 7 million riders traveling on Metropolitan Transit Authority trains and buses throughout the New York metro area. They expect and deserve to know that the Federal Government is just as committed to rail security as it is to other homeland security priorities. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mrs. LOWEY. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bill, and I want to thank the chairman for your important work on this bill. 
   I am very pleased that one of the first acts of the Democratic Congress is to finally enact the long overdue recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   This bill contains language I first proposed in the 108th Congress to create a dedicated grant program for emergency communications, which the Republican-controlled Congress rejected at least five times, including in stand-alone amendments. 
   Communications failures that forced first responders to use runners to relay messages on September 11 and following Hurricane Katrina more closely resemble the time of Paul Revere than the technology available in 2007. The post-September 11 world demands 21st-century preparedness. 
   Many of us have long recognized that we are not prepared to respond to the next emergency until our first responders can communicate with one another. The legislation addresses this massive gap in our Nation's communications capabilities and will improve safety for hundreds of thousands of first responders who protect our communities each day. 
   In addition to the interoperability provisions, I am very pleased that this bill includes my proposals to fix the flawed grant funding formula, improve airport screening by providing important rights for screeners, and overhauls the troubled National Asset Database. 
   I urge your support for this vital piece of legislation that includes long-overdue improvements for first responders. I thank the gentleman again for his leadership, and I look forward to working together with the people on the other side of the aisle to get this done.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007. 
   This bill includes a provision based on legislation I introduced with Representatives TANNER, LOBIONDO and HULSHOF that would not only freeze compliance thresholds under the 75 percent rule at 60 percent, it would require CMS to consult rehabilitation facilities in developing recommendations on more appropriate criteria than the 75 percent rule for determining IRF admission policy. 
   The legislation will stop CMS in its tracks from continuing to implement an out-of-date 75 percent rule that is 100 percent wrong for Americans, and ensure that millions of individuals will continue to have access to the critical care and medical services provided by rehabilitation facilities. 
   There are a number of individuals I would like to thank for their tireless work on this legislation: Chairman Rangel and the entire Ways and Means staff, particularly Jon Sheiner, Cybele Bjorklund, and Janice Mays; my partners on this legislation, Representatives TANNER, LOBIONDO, HULSHOF, and  their staffs, Vicki Walling, Dana Richter, and Erik Rasmussen; and my legislative director, Jean Doyle. 
   And last but certainly not least, the key advocates from hospitals in my district in New York: Dr. Walsh from Burke Rehabilitation Center, Maggie Ramirez from Helen Hayes Hospital, and Keith Safian from Phelps Memorial Hospital.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the House amendment to H.R. 2764 to highlight the key elements of division J, the Department of State, foreign operations, export financing, and related programs appropriations act of fiscal year 2008. 
   This amendment reflects a bipartisan, bicameral process. We worked tirelessly with ranking member WOLF, Senator LEAHY, and Senator GREGG to create a product that addresses our strategic priorities and our national security interests, as well as increases assistance for programs that promote development, reduce poverty, meet humanitarian needs and respond to global health crises. 
   Despite our bipartisanship, the President's intransigence forced us to make difficult cuts to worthy programs. His unwillingness to compromise with Congress, while spending $12 billion a month in Iraq, is both fiscally and  morally irresponsible. We have worked to limit the damage of this President's misplaced priorities, and I appreciate Chairman OBEY and Speaker PELOSI's commitment to robust foreign assistance. 
   Division J includes over $5.3 billion for State Department operations in the United States and abroad, and exceeds the President's request for worldwide security protection to ensure that our diplomats and development workers remain safe and secure. It also provides $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges, and $366 million for public diplomacy.

<DOCNO>Mrs. LOWEY. (CATCHING OPERATIONAL VULNERABILITIES BY ENSURING RANDOM TESTING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5909 and begin by thanking Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King, Subcommittee Chairwoman Jackson-Lee, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Lungren for moving this legislation to the floor. 
   My bill, the Catching Operational Vulnerabilities by Ensuring Random Testing, or COVERT, Act would prohibit the advance notification of covert tests on transportation systems without direct approval from the highest officials in our Homeland Security operations. 
   This legislation bolsters accountability and integrity for covert testing within our transportation systems overseen by the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. 
   The core principles and goals of covert testing are undermined when individuals are alerted in advance that a test or evaluation is imminent. In fact, in case we haven't figured it out, there is nothing covert about activities employees already know will occur. Unfortunately, there have been a number of reported incidents in which covert tests may have been compromised as a result of advanced notification to Transportation Security officers. 
   The Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security found that between August 2003 and May 2004, Transportation Security Administration officials at San Francisco International Airport compromised covert testing efforts by tracking testers throughout the airport utilizing surveillance cameras, then notifying screening personnel in advance of the testers arriving at security checkpoints. The Inspector General also found that Transportation Security officers at Jackson-Evers International Airport in Jackson, Mississippi, reported receiving advance notice of covert tests conducted by TSA's Office of Inspection on February 12, 2004. 
   Finally, led by Chairman Thompson's efforts, the Homeland Security Committee discovered on April 2006 an e-mail sent via TSA's net hub system from the Office of Security Operations to all Federal security directors and other TSA airport officials informing them of testing at airports throughout the country. 
   In this unfortunate instance, while the e-mail may have violated TSA protocols, it did not constitute the sharing of sensitive information under the law. My legislation will close that loophole, making it a violation to tip off employees before covert tests without high-level approval at TSA and DHS. 
   During mark-up of this legislation, the Homeland Security Committee adopted an amendment allowing local law enforcement to be notified prior to a test if directed by the administrator providing for personnel flexibility by clarifying that only one individual is necessary to serve as a cover agent supervising testing, and including a study on implementation of these procedures and their impact on the Department's effort to improve transportation security. 
   I want to make it very clear to my colleagues that this bill does not tie the hands of DHS or TSA. It simply ensures that any decision to notify personnel in advance must come directly from the TSA administrator, the Inspector General of the Department, or the Comptroller General at GAO to ensure the safety of the traveling public and the testers. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5909.

   Mrs. LOWEY. I will probably need an additional 4 minutes to respond, if you have it, Mr. Chairman, to Mr. Lungren on this very, very important issue that he has been referencing concerning drilling. 
   We've been hearing frequently from my colleagues, my good friends like Mr. Lungren, from President Bush, and from other Republicans in the Congress. They continue to argue that opening more of the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas drilling will lower gasoline prices. But we can't drill our way to energy independence. The United States has only 1.6 percent of the world's oil reserves, but Americans consume 25 percent of the oil used around the world every day. Nearly 80 percent of oil and 82 percent of natural gas believed to exist on the Outer Continental Shelf is located in areas that are now open for leasing.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
   Only 10.5 million of the 44 million leased offshore acres are actually producing oil or gas. So oil companies, my colleagues, are reaping billions in record profits, $123 billion in 2007 alone, received billions in subsidies in the 2005 energy bill, but they are not using the Federal lands already open to development. Given this, opening sensitive areas to drilling makes no sense. 
   For example, ExxonMobil made $40 billion in profits last year alone, but has only increased investment in drilling and production by $3 billion over the last 5 years. Oil and gas companies have stockpiled 9,000 drilling permits--9,000--my good friends--drilling permits--without expanding domestic production. 
   The New Direction Congress is working to make America more energy independent and secure, lower costs to consumers, grow our economy with hundreds of thousands of new green jobs, and reduce global warming. This Congress has fought for historic new commitments to American-grown biofuels, sustained investments in clean renewable energy, large-scale efficiency improvements to buildings and  transportation, enhanced tools to crack down on OPEC price fixing and price gouging, and to investigate the effects on price of rampant commodity speculation. And this Congress has forced the President to increase supply and thereby lower costs by not continuing to fill the almost full Strategic Petroleum Reserve starting June 30. 
   I'm sure this debate will continue, my colleagues. And it seems to be a mantra of many of my good friends on the other side of the aisle, but I do wish there would be more focus on the oil companies using the drilling leases that they have and taking some of those profits and investing them and producing the oil that we need. 
   So I thank you, I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend on the other side of the aisle for focusing on this issue. I'm sure we'll continue this discussion. But I would like to conclude by thanking everybody, because it has been a bipartisan effort, and I encourage support of H.R. 5909.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to put a statement in the Record expressing outrage at the continued violence and genocide in Darfur.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today burdened by many emotions--sadness, disappointment, frustration and most of all, anger. Anger because it has been three years since Congress declared the atrocities occurring in Darfur to be genocide--and yet the violence continues. Anger because 2.5 million people are still displaced--living in camps, unable to return to their homes. Anger because humanitarian workers are even more endangered today--unable to deliver vital services to large swathes of the population. And anger because not a single individual has been brought to justice for these crimes. 
   The crisis in Darfur requires sustained diplomatic action--including international pressure on those nations that support the Sudanese regime and allow President Bashir to equivocate on his promises. 
   It is unacceptable that 3 years have passed and there is still insufficient protection for civilians on the ground. 
   The AU/UN force must be deployed immediately. There is no time to waste. The people of Darfur have waited long enough.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to express my appreciation to my good friend and colleague, ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, and I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for his support of this bill and for his help bringing it to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which would designate the Federal building and United States Courthouse in White Plains, New York, as the ``Charles L. Brieant, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse.'' 
   Federal Judge Charles Brieant, Jr., a graduate of Columbia University and Columbia Law School, served in the United States Army Air Force during World War II. Appointed to the Federal judiciary by President Nixon in 1971, Judge Brieant rose to the high-profile post of Chief Judge of the influential U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a court well regarded for its legal prowess and well-reasoned decisions. His thoughtful interpretation of the law often earned great praise, and the United States Supreme Court agreed with Judge Brieant's rulings six times. 
   Additionally, Judge Brieant received many awards and honors, including the Servant of Justice Award from the Guild of St. Ives in 1998 and the Edward Weinfeld Award for Distinguished Contributions to the Administration of Justice in 2006. 
   Mr. Speaker, Judge Brieant can lay claim to hundreds of court decisions, many of which have impacted the lives of ordinary New Yorkers in extraordinary ways. 
   Judge Brieant is survived by his wife Virginia, their four children, nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. 
   Judge Brieant deserves our admiration and recognition for his selfless commitment to the law and public service. In fact, beyond the bench, Judge Brieant was instrumental in the construction of the very building we seek to name in his honor. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring this great American by passing this legislation.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. 
   The only purpose this amendment serves is to decrease access to family planning services and to mischaracterize the critical, life-saving work of Planned Parenthood affiliates. 
   Let me be clear. Under current law, Title X funds can not be used to pay for abortions. Nothing in the underlying bill changes that. Therefore, I am left to assume that the services the sponsor of this amendment wishes to cut include family planning, cancer screening, prenatal care and deliveries, fertility information and support groups, and support and advocacy for victims of sexual assault. 
   I am proud to defend the hundreds of Planned Parenthood affiliates, including the Hudson Peconic affiliate in my Congressional District. The dedicated work this affiliate and others like it engage in are the reason that more than five million men and women have access to any health care at all. 
   Their commitment is something that should be recognized and commended, not demonized. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mrs. LOWEY. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for your important leadership on this committee and to the ranking member. It's been a pleasure for me to work cooperatively in a bipartisan way. 
   I rise in strong support of the conference report which will make us safer by increasing the amount of risk-based homeland security grants, screening 100 percent of maritime and aviation cargo and improving intelligence collection and information-sharing capabilities. 
   I would also like to highlight the title on interoperability grants which completes the three-pronged interoperability proposal I put forward following September 11. 
   The dedicated grant program will significantly enhance the ability of public safety agencies to plan, build, and maintain communications networks as they will no longer have to make impossible decisions such as whether to purchase personal protective equipment or radios. It will ensure that first responders will have more advance resources than those used by Paul Revere. 
   This bill is a great victory for first responders.  
   I rise in strong support of the conference report, which implements many of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, actions that should have been taken years ago. 
   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee and the conference committee that resolved differences with the Senate, I know that many of us put a great deal of work into creating this legislation. I would like to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King for their tireless work. I would also like to thank our leadership for making this the House's top priority. 
   I would like to briefly outline a few of the many reasons why this bill makes our country safer. First, it mandates 100 percent scanning of all maritime cargo before it enters the U.S. The current system of scanning only some cargo when it has already entered the U.S. is inadequate. AI Qaeda and other terrorist organizations must be prevented from using a maritime cargo container to conceal a nuclear weapon. 
   Many have stringently opposed this provision and have stated that they will not support the conference report because of the perceived impact on business. I would respond to this argument by stating the job of Congress is to protect the American people, not stand in the way of commonsense security measures to make it easier for the business community to ship containers. The cost to scan each container is minimal compared to the cost of value of goods shipped in each container. And the cost is nothing compared to the consequence of what would happen if terrorists were able to detonate a nuclear weapon in the U.S. 
   Second, the bill greatly enhances aviation security efforts. Today, a great deal of cargo is placed on commercial aircraft without being screened. The bill closes this security loophole. It also authorizes $450 million per year for in-line explosive detection systems and provides a process for passengers who have been misidentified and placed on the ``no-fly'' or ``selectee'' lists to clear their names. 
   Third, it augments intelligence collection and information sharing. The bill properly organizes intelligence gathering agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, to enable them to better communicate potential threats with local first responders. One of the best ways to prevent an attack is to increase our intelligence gathering capabilities. This bill will help to provide assistance to State and local fusion centers and counter-terrorism officials. The excellent work of the New York Police Department's counter-terrorism division to detect and prevent potential terrorist plots exemplifies what can be accomplished by local law enforcement agencies. 
   Fourth, the bill advances our efforts to identify and protect critical infrastructure, one of the fundamental purposes of the Department of Homeland Security. The conference report includes provisions I proposed to review and update the National Asset Database and the subset National At-Risk Database. It also requires the Department to conduct annual critical infrastructure vulnerability assessments. 
   These are only four of the many examples of how the bill makes our country more secure. I would like to detail two particular provisions which have been two of my highest priorities since the September 11 attacks--interoperability grants and the first responder funding formula for homeland security grants. 
   Title III of the conference report completes the three-pronged interoperability proposal I first put forward following September 11. The Department of Homeland Security now has an office that coordinates first responder emergency communications efforts. It is in the process of implementing a national communications strategy, and this bill creates an interoperability grant program. 
   Communications problems have plagued first responders in every major emergency in the last 15 years. We witnessed this 12 years ago in Oklahoma City. It resurfaced at Columbine in 1999. It slowed our response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. On September 11, it proved to be a deadly problem. 
   Of the 58 firefighters who escaped the North Tower of the World Trade Center and gave oral histories to the Fire Department of New York, only three heard radio warnings that the North Tower was in danger of collapse. We will never know how many of the 343 firefighters who died that day while heroically rescuing thousands of workers were in the North Tower. Nor will we know how many of these lives would have been spared if they had had effective, interoperable communications equipment to receive the evacuation order. 
   The provisions in the emergency communications grant title are long overdue. More than 10 years ago, the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee stated that, ``unless immediate measures are taken to promote interoperability, public safety agencies will not be able to adequately discharge their obligation to protect life and property in a safe, efficient, and cost effective manner.'' 
   The 9/11 Commission included interoperability as one of its recommendations and the Public Discourse Project found that the Federal Government had made minimal progress on this priority. This legislation finally responds to the widely acknowledged vulnerabilities posed by poor communications capabilities. 
   A dedicated grant program, which I first proposed following September 11, will significantly enhance the ability of public safety agencies to plan, build, and maintain communications networks as they will no longer have to make impossible decisions such as whether to purchase personal protective equipment or radios. 
   This bill will not solve all of our interoperability problems. However, it will help to ensure that in the next emergency, our first responders are not left to the same strategies used by Paul Revere in 1775, which was sadly the case during Katrina just 2 years ago. This is a great victory for first responders. 
   A second item which I have been fighting for years to improve is the first responder funding formula. Title I of the conference report increases the percentage of DHS grants that are allocated on the basis of risk. For far too long the Department has awarded 40 percent of formula grants to State governments without any consideration of risk. The conference report will eventually lower this amount to 18.52 percent in 5 years. 
   On four occasions, the House passed legislation to increase the amount of risk-based  funding, including an amendment that I added to the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill. The compromise we are considering today, while far from perfect, is the product of several years of negotiations between the two chambers. Even with the conference report, I will continue my efforts to improve the manner in which grants are awarded. 
   As the old saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. After September 11, we experienced the cost of not being adequately prepared--the loss of almost 3,000 lives and tremendous economic impact. We must distribute homeland security funding on the basis of risk now so that areas most at risk have the resources to prevent and effectively respond to any potential attacks. 
   Attacks against New York, Madrid, London, and Mumbai illustrate that terrorists target the areas in which they can inflict the most damage. The Federal Government's efforts to prepare and respond to terrorism should reflect this reality. In addition, Hurricane Katrina highlighted the need to allocate resources to the areas most vulnerable to any type of emergency situation. We cannot afford to use homeland security funding as a type of revenue sharing. 
   This was one of the most prevalent recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. In 2005, the Commission gave the Federal Government an ``F'' for failing to allocate funding where it is needed. Had the provisions in the conference report been implemented prior to the date the report card was issued, this grade would have been better. 
   Regardless of the amount of the percentage of risk-based funds, the Department must do a better job calculating risk. In the Fiscal Year 2007 Homeland Security Grant Program allocation process, the Department made many decisions that resulted in awarding what were supposed to be risk-based funds to areas that do not face a high threat of being attacked. I plan on introducing legislation that would improve the manner in which DHS calculates risk and awards funds, strengthening the first responder funding formula provisions in this conference report. 
   In addition, I am disappointed that the conference report dropped the provisions that would have provided collective bargaining and other worker protections for Transportation Security Officers (TSOs). These provisions were included in both the House and Senate versions of the bill but were dropped from the conference report due to the President's misguided veto threat. 
   Transportation Security Officers are on the front lines protecting our airports and airplanes. They should be given the basic worker protections enjoyed by other DHS personnel. They perform a crucial and often grueling job that requires training, experience, and patience. We need workers who have mastered the job and will make a career of helping to protect the flying public and our skies. 
   That is why I am introducing stand-alone legislation today to provide the 42,000 screeners with basic worker protections. This would replace the increasing turnover and dissatisfaction with professionalism and a career path our screeners will pursue long-term. Highly trained and seasoned TSOs are part of our smart, comprehensive, and cost-effective efforts to prevent terrorist attacks and protect America's transportation system. 
   In its July 2004 report, the 9/11 Commission concluded that we are safer than we were prior to September 11, 2001, but we are not safe. The same is true today. While we will never be able to eliminate all threats or vulnerabilities, the implementation of this conference report is a substantial step forward.

<DOCNO>Mrs. LOWEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, a violent civil war is raging in Iraq, with atrocities against innocent civilians mounting every day. Our troops, our brave troops, are caught in the crossfire, dying and being maimed driving on local roads, patrolling neighborhoods and moving about by helicopter. What is their mission today? What is the strategic objective of the escalation proposed by the President? 
   President Bush's plan to deploy 20,000 additional U.S. combat troops to Iraq is not a new strategy, and nothing I have seen or heard has convinced me that this escalation will make a positive difference in Iraq or hasten the safe return of U.S. troops. In fact, General Abizaid said that ``more American forces prevent the Iraqis from taking responsibility for their own future.'' 
   Four previous troop surges between December 2003 and October 2006 have not made a dent in the level of violence nor in the number of U.S. casualties. We have spent nearly $500 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan, and yet inexplicably our troops still do not have the protection they need. Throughout this war, many in Congress have addressed the lack of equipment and protection for our troops. Now, military leaders are saying there are not enough armor kits and vehicles to protect these additional five brigades the President plans to send to Iraq. It is unacceptable to send more soldiers to Iraq, but it is unconscionable to send them without proper armaments or an explanation from the administration about how our troops will be protected. 
   Madam Speaker, 3,132 Americans in uniform have died and 23,417 have been wounded since the start of the war in Iraq. I visited our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed, Bethesda Naval Hospital, and, most recently, at Landstuhl Military Hospital in Germany during my visit to Iraq with the Speaker. 
   I stood at the bedside of a 23-year old severely wounded soldier, a soldier who was holding the hand of his 21-year old brother, currently serving in Iraq, and the hand of his father, who had also served in the Armed Forces, a soldier who will likely never come home. These families are making the ultimate sacrifice for our family. I am humbled by their commitment, their professionalism and dedication. We have a responsibility to our Armed  Forces, our citizens, and the constituents who have elected us to bring them home as quickly and safely as possible. 
   I am convinced that the thorough analysis and conclusions of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group are correct. Iraqi leaders must take responsibility for the country's security and government and we must engage the international community to work towards stability in the region. There is no military solution to the crisis in Iraq, and we cannot send more brave men and women to police a civil war. 
   As I have said many times before, there are no good solutions to the quagmire in Iraq. This war was ill-conceived, poorly planned and incompetently executed. The best military minds must now focus their efforts on the safe and responsible redeployment of our troops rather than on this escalation. I cannot support sending more of our brave men and women in uniform on a last-ditch, misguided mission. 
   We best support our troops, my colleagues, and our national interests, by adopting this resolution, and by expressing clearly on behalf of the American people our firm determination to change course in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, on August 16, 2007, the U.S. Government signed a new Memorandum of Understanding, MOU, with Israel to establish the security assistance framework for $30 billion in U.S. military assistance to Israel over the next decade. This agreement reflects the unshakable U.S. commitment to maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge in the region and increases assistance to help Israel meet its security needs in the face of growing threats in the region. I am a staunch supporter of this agreement which continues the strategic relationship between the U.S. and Israel and will help guarantee the security of both Israel and the United States. 
   Today, with the passage of the Continuing Resolution, Congress has declared its support for meeting our obligation for the first year of the MOU by approving a total of $2.55 billion in FY 2009 for Israel in Foreign Military Financing. The $2.55 billion in FMF funding includes $170 million in the FY 09 ``bridge-funding'' in the FY08 supplemental (P.L. 110-161) and the FY 2008 funding level of $2.38 billion. The Continuing Resolution also adjusts the funding level for Israeli Offshore Procurement to reflect the current percentage of Israel's FMF at $670,650,000, a longstanding provision that has proven critical to ensuring Israel's qualitative military edge. The congressional support for this agreement and the security of Israel is clear and unequivocal.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, the Bush administration requested an increase in econo mic support funds for Cuba from $9 million to $45.7 million. 
   Between 1996 and 2005, USAID and the Department of State signed contracts worth $74 million for Cuba programs, according to the GAO's study. The administration is asking for a 1-year, fiscal year 2008 request that is more than two-thirds the size of what was committed over the 10 years, from 1996 and 2005. This request is 500 percent of what USAID received in the last fiscal year. Given how ill-conceived and ill-managed the program is, there is no justification for an aid increase. 
   My friend from Florida has raised the GAO report and said that it has not recommended that funding be cut. But the objective of the report was not to recommend that funding should be increased or decreased. It was to examine the roles and objectives of the agencies implementing United States democracy assistance targeted at Cuba, and the characteristics and selection of the grantees receiving Department of State and USAID awards, the types, amounts, beneficiaries an d methods used to deliver assistance for selected grantees in 2005, USAID's monitoring and oversight of these grantees, and the availability of data to evaluate whether U.S. assistance has achieved its goals. 
   Although I believe that this program does little to help dissidents, and very little to expand political space in Cuba, we have continued funding at the same level as provided by our former colleague, Jim Kolbe, when he chaired the subcommittee. 
   The bill has $9 million, and requires USAID and the Department of State to present a plan for improved coordination and for oversight of the Cuba program. 
   GAO concluded in a November 2006 report that ``poor monitoring and oversight of the Cuba program did not provide adequate assurance that funds were properly used.'' 
   Administrative costs on the part of grantees were high, oversight of the goods chosen inadequate; specifically, according to the GAO study, there were instances in which cashmere sweaters, Godiva chocolates, Nintendo Gameboys, Sony Play stations were among the items purchased in the United States to be shipped to dissidents in Cuba. 
   The Cuba program is poorly managed and can be argued to be counterproductive. It is not a productive use of limited U.S. resources, and the result of this program is often to identify Cuban dissidents as U.S. funded opponents of the regime. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Before I yield to my colleague, I would like to respond to my good friend, the ranking member, concerning his concern about the impact on the dissidents. I would daresay as an American who is proud of our values, if we open travel and communication and trade between the United States and Cuba, they would really understand what it's like to be an American. And I feel that's the best way to free the dissidents and to create an open and democratic society. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am very proud to yield to my good friend, Mr. Delahunt.

   Mrs. LOWEY. With great respect for my good friend and ranking member, Mr. Wolf, we have just provided $2.863 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq, diplomatic operations and reconstruction. 
   In addition, there are $3 billion for unexpended IRF funds. This amendment is requesting $140 million in additional funding for democracy, rule of law and governance programs. The supplemental provided $250 million for democracy activities, $67.6 million for civil s ociety, $57.4 million for targeted development, $125 million in governance programs, and $150 million in rule of law activities. 
   The amendment is also requesting $16 million in additional funding for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism and demining activities. The recently passed supplemental provided $7 million for demining in Iraq. 
   Additionally, nowhere in this bill is there language restricting funding for humanitarian activities in Iraq. In my judgment, the administration should substantially expen d the funds we have provided before Congress provides additional funding for the same purposes. 
   And lastly, if the situation on the ground changes and our assistance can be used to make substantial achievements, we can address funding for Iraq as the President has requested, $2.893 billion in emergency appropriations for diplomatic operations and reconstruction in Iraq in fiscal year 2008. 
   So, my colleagues, my good friend is requesting $158 million for purposes that have already been funded in a $2 .8 billion supplemental. And there is another $2.893 billion supplemental coming up in September. I know that $158 million can be used for the tremendous needs around the world. 
   I strongly oppose this amendment, and I ask that my colleagues join me. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, my colleagues, I have a question for Mr. Boustany, my good friend, and the ranking member. I believe, Mr. Boustany, that you recommended that we fund this $158 million. Yet this amendment takes the money away from the State Department. Ambassador Ryan Crocker is doing a superb job. We just appropriated $2.8 billion in the supplemental. The American people have requested, and this Congress has requested, that we see some response to the benchmarks, that we see some response on the part of the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks that have been put in place. 
   So if I understand correctly, even though the supplemental funded, and I am not going to repeat it, every single category that my dear friend, the ranking member and my friend, Mr. Boustany, are advocating for, you want to fund $158 million with funds from the State Department which are supporting Ambassador Ryan Crocker and other ambassadors around the world who are doing such an amazing job repres enting us. 
   Mr. Chairman, I really think there is a disconnect here. I want you to know that for those of us who are opposing this amendment, with great respect, again, to my ranking member, we feel that the supplemental that has passed and the $2.8 billion that is coming up in September requested by the administration can address these issues if, in fact, there is an understanding that they are not being funded adequately. 
   So, again, I strongly object to this amendment. I strongly object to taking f unds away from Ambassador Ryan Crocker and our other ambassadors around the world and representatives of the State Department. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, with great respect, again, for our ranking member and for my friend Mr. Shays, who I know has been to Iraq many times, I do hope that i n light of the supplemental, which has been funded at $2.8 billion, and an additional supplemental which will be presented to the Congress in September for another $2.8 billion, we won't cut the rug from under our good friend, the competent Ambassador Ryan Crocker, and take this $158 million from the State Department for several lines that have been funded already in the supplemental. I won't go through that again. 
   Mr. Ryan Crocker represents us, and I am so proud of his good work. I would like to suppo rt him and the other good men and women in the State Department around the world. 
   So let's defeat this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment will move $1 million from the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account to the United States Institute for Peace to reconstitute th e Iraq Study Group. Although I feel compelled to point out the likelihood that by the time this bill is signed into law, the study on the effectiveness of the President's surge in Iraq will have passed, but, nevertheless, I support this amendment because I feel there is value added to reconstituting the Iraq Study Group, something that our ranking member continues to deserve kudos for establishing in the first place.

   Mrs. LOWEY. This amendment would cut $20 million from the contributions for international organizations. The question posed by this amendment is straightforward: Do you want to t ake funds away from an account that is saving lives every day around the world? 
   Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld last year told Senate appropriators that U.N. peacekeeping was an example of the benefit of empowering partner nations, and it would cost the United States taxpayers almost eight times as much.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to respond to the gentleman from New Jersey. 
   I do believe that nuclear nonproliferation must be a key focus of this committee and this Congress. In fact, in this bill because of the recommendations of so many members of our subcommittee and Members of Congress, we have increased money for nuclear nonproliferation efforts. So I look forward to working with the gentleman on this issue as we move ahead. 
   However, I do think that your offset, taking money from U.N. dues, is actually unwise and not a very good policy decision. 
   Many people have criticized the U.N., want to disband the U.N., want to cut off dues to the U.N., and then when we need the U.N., they wonder: What are we going to do if we didn't have a United Nations? 
   I look forward to working with the gentleman from New Jersey in strengthening the committees of the U.N. and working together to face the tremendous challenges we have internationally. So I support the gentleman's concerns about nuclear nonproliferation, and I look forward to working with the gentleman; but I strongly oppose taking the money from U.N. dues. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson).

   Mrs. LOWEY. This amendment would cut $203 million from our contribution to international organizations. This amendment fails to realistically address the effect our arrears have on our standing in the world community. At a time when the United States is increasingly relying on international organizations to further our security interests around the world, shortchanging our treaty-obl igated contributions to these organizations undercuts our foreign policy goals and undermines our reputation around the world. It also countermands our new Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad's call to pay our dues in full and on time. As of today, the United States is $291 million in arrears at the U.N. for regular budget contributions alone. The United States has chosen to belong to each of these organizations. They leverage U.S. taxpayer dollars and advance a wide range of U.S. foreign policy objectives, includi ng monitoring nuclear proliferation through the IAEA, creating norms for international telecommunications through the ITU, and fending off global pandemics through the WHO. 
   The administration and the Congress have underfunded and cut this account in recent years. This amendment would continue this trend. The United States has an $80 million deficit in the CIO account and the State Department is paying U.S. dues late or incurring arrears in virtually every organization in this account. Shortfalls to the CIO account in 2006 caused the State Department to pay all of its regular dues to the IAEA almost a full year late, even as we relied on that organization to track nuclear developments in Iran and North Korea; pay dues to our allies in the OECD almost a year late; pay all of our dues to the WHO about a year late, even as we asked WHO to help contain avian flu; and pay the vast majority of our regular dues to NATO a year or so late, even as we relied on that organization to shore up security in Afghanistan. 
   This amendment has no appreciation of the influence this increasing trend of paying late and underfunding international organizations has on our ability to sway others and it is difficult to justify why our priorities should be given full consideration when we chronically pay our dues late. Paying these international organizations late is counterproductive to achieving United States international security goals. The increasing trend of paying late and underfunding international organizations confounds U .S. demands for better management in them. 
   An example of this detrimental effect is seen at the World Health Organization which reports that the arrears owed by the United States are preventing well-managed budgets and resulting in programs not reaching optimal effectiveness for a year or more after they were planned to be fully operational. Further, other dues-paying countries take note when the United States fails to honor its commitments in these international organizations. As a result, our influenc e on making budgetary and policy decisions in them is lessened. For example, the U.S. consistently wants the Food and Agriculture Organization to increase its capacity to set worldwide food and plant standards, yet it is very difficult to justify why U.S. priorities for the FAO should be given full consideration when the U.S. is chronically paying its dues there about a year late. 
   Therefore, I strongly object to the gentlewoman's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment. 
   I agree with the intention of the amendment. And I thank my friend for raising this important issue. As we know, tuberculosis is taking a terrible toll on men, women, and children in the developing world, with approximately 3 million people dying every year. The recent highly publicized case of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis has brought this issue to the forefront, and the additional funding of this amendment will be used to strengthen the global tuberculosis treatment and care network. I appreciate the gentleman's interest in this issue and would be happy to accept this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield to my good friend, the vice chairman of the committee, Mr. Jackson. 
   Mr. JACKSO N of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of the gentlewoman's generosity in supporting the Payne amendment. 
   I want to just share with the full committee some of the views of the members of the subcommittee, because I think their views need to be taken into account. 
   While we overwhelmingly support the gentleman's amendment for an increase in $50 million, the offset does  have the effect, Mr. Payne, of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The com mittee worked very hard to increase the child survival account, which is another health care account that includes maternal health, that includes malaria accounts, and we worked very hard to increase the ESF account, which does impact profoundly sub-Saharan Africa, Afro-Colombian programs, and Israel and Egypt. And while these funds are extremely important, the subcommittee did the best that it could in the original mark to increase funding for tuberculosis, particularly the extremely drug-resistant strands of tuberculosis. 
   So I rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment, and I also rise in strong support of the committee's initial mark, which did everything it could within its power to increase child survival and ESF funds.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in opposition to this amendment because, as I have explained to Mr. Shays, I believe this is a really critical program. I would love to work with you on it. 
   This amendment would provide $50 million in funding for Community Action Programs. There is no funding in this particular bill for Iraqi operations and reconstruction. As I explained to the gentleman, the reason there is no funding in this bill is because of the $2.8 billion in the supplemental and the $2.8 billion requested in September for the supplemental. 
   I want to make it very clear that I agree with the gentleman that the Community Action Program and NGO partnership with USAID does really good work. In fact, CAP is the only program of its kind to operate outside the Green Zone in Iraq. I have been a strong supporter of their efforts. I have met with them repeatedly. I know of their good work. 
   By working fr om the community level up and assisting Iraqi moderates who have eschewed sectarian and insurgent violence, the CAP partners directly engage Iraqis in reconstructing their own communities. They create employment. They build nationwide grass-roots constituency for democracy. 
   Congress identified CAP as a priority when it appropriated $100 million specifically for CAP in the fiscal year 2006 supplemental. Additionally, we just provided $95 million for CAP in the 2000 supplemental. I want to make it clear t o my good friend from Connecticut that we put the money in after I met personally with representatives of CAP. 
   I understand the important work that they are doing. I have spoken to the CAP partners. They agreed that they do not need any additional funding in the regular fiscal year 2008 bill. They tell me they have enough to continue operations. As difficult as it is there, they are continuing operations through fiscal year 2008 at the current pace of operation. 
   They also noted that they worked very hard to stay under the radar in Iraq, which is what makes their great achievements possible. I want to make it clear that they have no interest, from my conversations with them, they don't want to be the foil in an Iraq funding debate. We have made it clear. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to make it clear once again that the reason we are not providing additional funding and we cannot provide additional funding to the CAP in this bill is because of the $2.8 billion in the supplemental, the $2.8 billion that is b eing requested. The CAPs have made it clear they don't need the money now. They are operating under the radar. If we are providing zero funding for Iraq in this bill, they don't want to be part of this debate. 
   This is not a partisan issue. They are doing very important work. It has nothing to do with any of the other debate on Iraq. It is what is needed now. There are tremendous needs around the world that we are trying to fill in this bill. 
   So, again, with great respect for my good friend, Mr. S hays, we have worked together on many issues. I appreciate your concerns. I agree with your concerns, but not in this bill; and I look forward to continuing to work with you as we move ahead. 
   I thank the gentleman.

   That is why we appropriated $100 million and then an other $95 million. But I want to make it clear, at least from my interaction from the CAPs, and I have had many discussions with the CAPs, they don't need the money now. They are operating under the radar. They are doing good work. And with the supplemental in 2008 that is coming up in September, they don't need the money now. They certainly welcome, if it is necessary, some additional funding to them. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Connecticut.

   Given the tremendous needs around the world, which I know you support, be it clean water or HIV-AIDS or peacekeeping, and we can go on and on, the CAP made it clear to me that they do not need the money now. Therefo re, I must reluctantly oppose this amendment, because I do not want to take the money from any other urgent needs that exist in the world today.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to accept this amendment. I thank the gentleman for his interest in basic education in Pakistan. As the gentleman knows, I have been a firm believer in basic education for a long time. The bill includes a total of $750 million for basic education programs. 
   The gentleman recently went to Pakistan. I had the privilege of going to Pakistan and visited the earthquake zones, and in fact I had the privilege of opening a school in the earthquake zone. These beautiful young girls looked at me and said, can you send us science teachers? Can you send us computers? We know this experience can be replicated thousands of times around the world. 
   So I really do appreciate the gentleman's commitment to basic education, and I look forward to working with the gentleman and accept his amendment.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from California (Mr. Cardoza) for bringing this important matter to the attention of the committee. This type of government-sponsored terrorism was a hallmark of Saddam Hussein's rule and cannot continue. It was endemic. Unfortunately, it seems that the practice continues, and I continue to worry that our assistance may not be benefiting the intended recipients. 
   I too am concerned about the plight of the Christian minority, and I am dedicated to using whatever tools we have available to ensure their rights are giv en due consideration. 
   Furthermore, I want to note for my colleagues that the recent supplemental included a requirement for a report on the ethnic and geographic distribution of the United States assistance programs reaching the Nineveh Plain region, which should give us a clearer picture of the situation facing Iraqi Christians. 
   I want to assure my friend that I, and I know my ranking member, who cares passionately about these issues, will work closely with the Congressman to ensure that this $10 m illion does go for its intended purpose of protecting the Christian minority in Iraq.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend from New York for bringing attention to these important issues. As you know, the former Chair of this committee, Mr. Kolbe, has been a leader on trade, and continues to share with us the importance of trade as we move forward in this process. 
   I thank you very much for focusing on his very important legacy. He was a great partner for me working together on this committee, and I also appreciate your mentioning Co lombia and the fact that we changed the balance of funding in this bill, putting more resources in the Fiscalia. When I was there, it was clear to me that they didn't have enough people to enforce the law to go after the narcotraffickers, so this was an important area, in addition to increasing funding for interdiction. Justice, rule of law, interdiction, and funding for the Afro-Colombians, and we know there has been a tremendous need. Thank you for your work. I look forward to working together. I know tha t my colleagues realize how important these issues are as well.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased that my good friend from California brought this issue to our attention. 
   I really want to thank you for your work on CTBTO, and I agree with you that the United States should show leadership and pay our full share of obligations that it owes to the CTBTO. 
   The bill tries to draw balance between the various programs funded within the nonproliferation antiterrorism account, but I understand the concerns my friend has raised and these are concerns of the committee. There are many members of the committee who are working very hard on this issue, and it is my intention to continue to work with you as the bill moves through the process.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, despite the best efforts of our prevention programs, the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to grow. In 2006, 4.3 million people were infected with the virus; and for every new treatment patient in 2006, six additional people became infected with HIV. If we do not slow the pandemic, treatment costs alone in 2010 could be as high as $11 billion. Unless this trend is reversed, global efforts to expand treatment will falter and our global effort to address the pan demic will fail. 
   That is why it is so critical to maximize the effectiveness of the $5.062 billion for HIV/AIDS programs provided in this bill and make sure that our prevention programs work. 
   A recently released Institute of Medicine report entitled, ``PEPFAR Implementation,'' stated: ``The earmark has greatly limited the ability of country teams to develop and implement comprehensive prevention programs that are well integrated with each other and with testing, care, and treatment programs.'' These congressionally mandated funding restrictions are hampering our overall prevention efforts.     
   Therefore, and I want to make it very clear to my colleague, the bill allows the President to provide funding for HIV/AIDS prevention at his discretion. It does not change the underlying PEPFAR law, nor does it require that the President change the amount of funding for any particular prevention programs. In fact, it doesn't require the President to change the programs at all. The language simply provides flexibility to design the most effective prevention programs. 
   Effective HIV/AIDS prevention initiatives must be designed to respond to the local social and cultural conditions. These efforts should include all available options, including abstinence programs, comprehensive prevention programs, condom distribution, and medical interventions such as male circumcision and mother-to-child prevention programs to ensure that we use every tool at our disposal to stop this deadly disease. 
   We know that the only solution to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS is expanded and effective prevention programs. Our bill language again provides the administration with the flexibility to respond to the ever-changing pandemic in the most effective ways without the restrictions of arbitrary numerical targets. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. LOWEY. I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to my distinguished friend from Connecticut (Mr. Shays). 
   I oppose the Pitts amendment. I support strongly the attempt by the subcommittee to give the President flexibility to implement prevention programs that fit the countries' current AIDS epidemic. I salute the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief. I have been to Africa, Uganda, and Tanzania to see how the program works. 
   Everyone I spoke with pleaded with us to make sure that there was more emphasis on not A, B, but on C, condoms. Young child ren were asking that this be a factor in their schools. They said sex is going to happen no matter what you say. No matter what you say about abstinence or be faithful, it's going to happen. It is particularly disconcerting to think that someone who has chosen one partner and loves that partner, not knowing that that partner has been unfaithful, and, in fact, has AIDS, transmitting that disease to, in most cases, a young woman. 
   This makes eminent sense. I would like to think that we could get our religi ous beliefs out of this issue, not talking practically, but talking realistically. If you want to prevent deaths, you need to allow more condoms. 
   If you want to save lives, you need to allow more condoms. If you want to prevent pregnancies, you need to allow more condoms. If you don't want so much interest on other things like whether there should be abortion, you need to have condoms. 
   I weep thinking young kids go to school without teachers and go home without parents. We need to be doing more in A frica to spend our money better. 
   Thank you, Mrs. Lowey, for what you have done to give the President of these United States the flexibility with his team that puts PEPFAR into operation.

   Mrs. LOWEY. I would just like to clarify and ask either the ranking member or the gentleman a question. Number one, I'm puzzled that you don't trust the President of the United States and give him the discretion. We're not changing the law. We're just giving the President the discretion. Now, that's Number one. 
   Number two, I believe both gentlemen said that waivers can be issued. Of course waivers can be issued. I believe the gentlemen know that when a waiver i s granted the other countries may make up the difference. So, for example, if waivers are granted to 50 percent of the countries, I think of my trip to Arusha, Tanzania. And there was a hut right in the middle of this community, a Masai village, and there were 15 huts around it. And the chief of that village went from hut to hut to hut to hut, spreading HIV/AIDS. 
   Now, I'd be interested to know how this would work if the waivers are granted, and many of the other communities around the world have to make up for that waiver, how would this be done. 
   And the gentleman, Number three, has also talked about a comprehensive program. Well, we may agree. I believe in abstinence. I think it's great. And if it can be implemented in Africa and Asia and all the other countries that are spreading HIV/AIDS like wildfire, I'm perfectly in support. But we're talking about comprehensive programs, including abstinence. And I'm glad the gentleman agrees that this should be comprehensive programs including abstinence. Woul d you like to respond?

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I just want to clarify for my distinguished ranking member and my colleague from Pennsylvania that what this does is give the President of the United States of America the authority, the flexibi lity. 
   I believe in ABC, abstinence, be faithful, use condoms. But I want to make it very clear to my colleagues, when the administration uses the waiver, then the other countries of the world still have to meet that one-third percent when it comes to prevention, abstinence. All we're saying, again, is abstinence, be faithful, use condoms. 
   We have to prevent unnecessary abortions. We have to save lives. We have to make sure that we do whatever we can to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Reclaiming my time, to my friend the former Speaker, I want to thank you for the collaborative way you have worked with me and our ranking member, Mr. Wolf. I would like to commend you for your many years of dedicated and unyielding work on Colombia. 
   I, as you, have long been deeply concerned about the situation facing us in the war on drugs. We agree that increasing drug interdiction efforts is necessary. We also agree that Colombia is a vital partner and ally of the United States. 
   I want to say again that I fully recognize the strategic importance of Colombia. In no way does this bill reduce our steadfast support to our friends in Colombia. 
   I've tried, in this bill, working with my good friend, Mr. Wolf, to strike a more balanced strategy that shifts the aid from the military and strengthens civilian governments , humanitarian assistance and rural development. 
   I continue to believe that we need to attack the underlying and pervasive poverty that is at the root of the problems in Colombia, as well as the region. I've attempted to increase the social component in our assistance to Colombia and begin Colombianization of the the military package and place a greater emphasis on interdiction rather than eradication. 
   This bill also increases funding for judges, prosecutors and rule of law and creates jobs in the l egal economy. 
   Again, I say to my good friend from Illinois, I greatly appreciate your advice, the give-and-take you have provided as we drafted this bill. I want to assure the gentleman that the committee will continue to pay close attention to his concerns as we work through the next stages of the process.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the g entleman. I agree that the counterterrorism financing program is a vital tool in assisting foreign countries' efforts to identify, freeze and prevent the use of financial institutions, businesses and charitable organizations as conduits for money to terrorist organizations, including giving countries an investigative ability to follow the money trail and arrest terrorists preemptively. 
   I support the work of the Department of State, the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury in assistin g countries who are at risk to terrorist financing. However, overall budgetary constraints did not provide sufficient opportunity for us to increase the requested funding level at this time. 
   However, I want to assure you, this is a priority of this committee. This is a priority of this Congress. In fact, I have been a member for years of this same task force, the same committee of which you are cochair, I believe, and I look forward to working with you as the bill moves through this Congress to conferen ce to see if we can bolster those funds.

   Mrs. LOWEY. I understand the intent of this amendment, and we have worked to craft an amendment we both can accept. 
   As you know, I believe that the United Nations Development Program is a key partner in our efforts to address global poverty. Their programs work to spread democracy, to address global HIV/AIDS, to improve the environment, and to respond to natural disasters and crises. All of these programs are critically important and they are working. 
   Because of their broad mandate, they often work under very difficult circumstances, and it is their work in North Korea that has led to the rec ent allegations of inadequate controls on funds to North Korea. These are serious concerns and need to be addressed. 
   However, I want to point out to my colleagues that UNDP has reacted swiftly to these concerns by suspending its program and closing the office in North Korea. In addition, UNDP is working with its executive board to put new accountability and transparency measures in place. 
   In light of congressional concerns that have been raised on both sides of the aisle, I worked with the gentlelad y to negotiate this agreement which reduces UNDP resources in order to provide support to the U.N. Democracy Fund and the U.N. Entrepreneurship Fund. I appreciate the gentlewoman's interest in this issue and accept her amendment.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, under current law, the global gag rule, also known as the Mexico City policy, prohibits foreign nongovernmental organizations, NGOs, from receiving any U.S. assistance unless they agree not to use their own funds to perform or refer patients for abortion or to even advocate the legalization of abortion. This policy applies even when abortion is illegal in a country or when NGOs pr omote the legalization of abortion for cases of rape and incest. 
   The bill before us keeps the global gag rule intact with one important exception. It would allow for the provision of contraceptives, not direct funding, the provision of contraceptives to foreign NGOs to help reduce abortion, unintended pregnancy and the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
   Let me repeat that. The intent of the bill is to provide international NGOs U.S.-donated contraceptives, not funds for millions of men and women who desperately ne ed them. The provision provides absolutely no assistance for abortion. It is strictly prohibited in 10 other sections of this bill. 
   While I have made clear my intent to allow only for the provision of donated contraceptives, some of my colleagues have brought to my attention concerns that the language as currently written could be interpreted more broadly than intended. Therefore, to make it absolutely clear to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who may have concerns about the language, I am offer ing this amendment to my own bill to clarify the existing language by narrowing the provision in question by replacing it with the following language beginning on page 97, line 10 of the bill: 
   ``That, in order to prevent unintended pregnancies, abortions, and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, no contract or grant award exclusively for the purpose of providing donated contraceptives in developing countries shall be denied to any nongovernmental organization solely o n the basis of the policy contained in the President's March 28, 2001 Memorandum to the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development with respect to providing contraceptives in developing countries, or any comparable administration policy regarding the provision of contraceptives.'' 
   This amendment, which replaces the current provision in the bill with the one I just read, can leave no doubt in any reasonable individual's mind that the provision will provide contraceptives. It will not provide funding to foreign NGOs. In fact, this amendment would advance the Bush administration's stated goal of the Mexico City policy ``to make abortion more rare'' and protect women and children. 
   Filling the unmet need for contraceptives could prevent 52 million unwanted pregnancies, an estimated 29 million abortions, 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths, and 505,000 children from losing their mothers in just 1 year. These are statistics. How much more evidence do my colleagues need to be convinc ed that contraception reduces abortion, saves lives? It is simply not enough to say that you support family planning as long as the current restrictions remain in law, denying millions of the poorest men and women around the world access to contraceptives. 
   In my judgment, support for my amendment represents a good-faith effort to find common ground on this issue. I really do hope that we can all agree that voting against family planning and the provision of contraceptives, which my colleague from New Je rsey will ask you to do in a later amendment, and against the opportunity to provide more than 200 million men and women in developing countries with access to contraceptives is the most extreme vote any of us can take. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. LOWEY. I do thank my two friends and colleagues for their work on this important issue and for this opportunity to clarify the intent of the provision. I want to be very clear. The intent of this provision is only to allow for the donation of the contraceptives and not to provide funding. 
   While I disagree with broader interpretations of this language, I wanted to offer an amendment to clarify this provision. My amendment is crystal clear. It would only allow NGOs to receive U.S.-donated contraceptives, not funds, for distribution to millions of men and women across the globe in desperate need of these products. 
   I hope that our discussion and my clarifying amendment that I intend to offer will alleviate any concerns that you or other Members have about the intent behind this provision.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong opposition to the Smith amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, the bill before us keeps the global gag rule intact, with one important exception. It would allow for the provision of contraceptives, not direct funding, to foreign NGOs to help reduce abortion, unintended pregnancy, and the spread of HIV/AIDS. The amendment I offer today makes absolutely clear that no funding would be provided to international organizations that do not comply with the Mexico City policy. In addition, the provision provides absolutely no assistance for abortion. 
   This is strictly prohibited in 10 other sections of the bill. Every provision in this bill has been kept there that forbids U.S. dollars going to abortion. 
   There are tremendous unmet needs for contraception in developing countries that most need this assistance to address population and health crises, including the spread of HIV/AIDS and unintended and high-risk pregnancies. 
   The global gag rule has only made matters worse for decreasing access in many countries. U.S. shipments of contraceptives have ceased to 20 developing nations, including in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. In some areas, the largest distribution centers for contraceptives have experienced decreased access for over 50 percent of the women they serve. This decline in access to contraceptives has led to increases in unintended pregnancy and in the number of women seeking postabortion care. 
   It is clear that withholding contraceptives, my friends, does not reduce abortion. Providing contraceptives is the way to reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions. The numbers speak for themselves. Increased use of contraceptives in the last two decades has been accompanied by significant declines in abortion rates in a number of countries. For example, in Russia, the abortion rate declined by 61 percent, as has been mentioned, between 1988 and 2001, as modern contraceptive use increased by 74 percent. 
   Proponents of the Smith amendment will make several false claims. They  may say that this provision would provide funding or assistance for services and products other than contraceptives directly to international NGOs who are not compliant with Mexico City. It absolutely will not.     
   They will argue that the Smith amendment will not cut family planning funds in this bill. However, it will dramatically decrease the effectiveness of our international family planning aid by withholding contraceptives to the areas of the world that need them most to prevent unintended pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV-AIDS. 
   The other side will also say that my provision encourages abortion as a means of family planning. Nothing could be further from the truth. Abortion is already illegal in many of the areas that would receive contraceptives under my provision, particularly in African countries. Furthermore, these organizations do not promote abortion as a means of family planning. They provide family planning to prevent unintended pregnancies, thereby reducing abortion. 
   You may also hear that by providing contraceptives, these organizations will be able to use their own funds for other purposes prohibited by Mexico City. I have already made clear the incredible unmet need for contraceptives. In Uganda alone, the average number of births per woman is 7.1, while the unmet need for family planning is reported by married women at 35 percent. The bill will provide donated contraceptives, not funding, to groups that are unable to provide enough contraceptives in areas with severe shortages. 
   Furthermore, contraceptives are not fungible. They are used for contraception. Period. By filling the unmet need for contraceptives, each year we can prevent 52 million unwanted pregnancies, an estimated 29 million abortions, 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths, and 505,000 children from losing their mothers. 
   It is clear that voting for the Smith amendment and against contraceptives is an extreme position that will in fact hurt our efforts to decrease abortion. So if you really want to decrease abortion, if you really say you are for family planning, if you really want to save lives, if you really want to decrease HIV/AIDS, which is spreading throughout the world, vote no on the Smith amendment.

   Mrs. LOWEY. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to make it very clear in closing, we all may have different views about abortion. I respect your views. I may differ. Each person is entitled to their own conscience and their own views on abortion. 
   But this is not about abortion. Every provision forbidding U.S. dollars going to abortion is in this bill, and it remains in this bill. The choice is clear, my friend. 
   My amendment will provide donated contraceptives, reduce unintended pregnancies, reduce the number of abortions, prevent HIV/AIDS, save lives, save the lives of millions of poor people around the world. This amendment will save lives. Mr. Smith's amendment will lead to more abortions, put more lives at risk. 
   My friend, the choice is very clear. If you want to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, if you want to save lives, if you want to prevent abortion, you vote for the Lowey amendment and against the Smith amendment.

   Mrs. LOWEY. My colleagues, this is a difficult and sensitive issue that the House has debated many times before in many different ways. 
   We all know that Egypt is an important ally of the United States. We all know that Egypt plays a very important role in the Middle East, and that role will even be more crucial in the months ahead. We all know that Egypt was the first Arab country to have made peace with Israel, and that the peace, while not nearly as warm or as forward-leaning as many of us would have liked, has held for close to 30 years. That is why Egypt has consistently received more foreign assistance in this bill than virtually any country other than Israel. And that is true of this year's bill as well. 
   Nevertheless, there is a frustration level with our very good ally over two key issues, the Egyptian Government's increasingly harsh response to dissent of any kind and the government's failure to take serious steps to stopping the smuggling from Egypt to Gaza. 
   When Israel withdrew all of its population and military forces from Gaza nearly 2 years ago, one of the biggest concerns was what to do about Gaza's border with Egypt. Some in Israel argued that Israeli forces should remain at the border to ensure that it did not become an opening to allow the smuggling of weapons and terrorists to Gaza. Those who argue that Israel needed to completely withdraw and that Egypt could effectively play that role ultimately prevailed. Israel and Egypt even reworked parts of their peace agreement to allow for an expanded Egyptian force on that border. Unfortunately, however, those forces have not done the job, have not stopped the smuggling. 
   As was highlighted so vividly during the recent fighting in Gaza, the forces of Hamas are very well equipped. The bulk of that equipment has come through that border. Especially now that Hamas has effectively taken over in Gaza, it is critically important that Egypt do everything within its power, including stopping these armed shipments before they even get to the Gaza border, to put an end to this deadly arms trade. 
   The language in the bill does not cut aid to Egypt, which many have wanted to do, I can assure you. It simply fences off a portion of Egypt's assistance, pending a report and certification by the Secretary of State that Egypt is taking steps to, one, enact a new judicial law; two, to curb police abuses; three, to detect and destroy the smuggling network into Gaza. 
   I believe it is a moderate and reasonable approach to two very difficult and important issues that we have discussed on numerous occasions, to no avail, with our good friends in Egypt. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm very pleased to yield to my good friend from California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. For years, many Members of Congress and activists, including the Maryknoll nuns based in my congressional district, fought to shut down the School of the Americas. The school's very existence was undermining United States efforts to promote civilian control of the military and respect for human rights in Latin America. 
   So the Army closed the school of the Americas and reopened it a few weeks later with a new name, WHINSEC. Past questions about the School of the Americas has still not been resolved, giving us no basis on which to build a better, more credible, effective program at WHINSEC. We need to shine the light on the past of the School of the Americas in order to put WHINSEC on track to be a beacon of light for the militaries of Latin America. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. 
   I agree with the intention of the amendment and thank my friend for raising this very important issue. 
   I want to reiterate my support for the United Nations. I strongly believe in the mission of the United Nations. That plays an indispensable role in the world today. In fact, it has often been said that if the United Nations did not already exist, we would surely need to invent it.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express reservations regarding the gentleman's amendment. 
   I do share his deep concern over the refusal of certain countries to extradite to the United States any individual indicted in the United States for killing a law enforcement officer. I certainly do not condone the refusal of those governments to extradite those accused of murdering a law enforcement officer in order to allow the families of fallen law enforcement officers to see the person or persons involved face justice. 
   However, the remedy that the gentleman is proposing is not targeted at the central government but at all persons from those countries applying for a visa. I just have some reservations about punishing the people of a country because their government is doing something objectionable that goes against the way we would like to be seen in the world. 
   But I am prepared to accept the amendment and bring this matter to conference.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to remind the gentleman that this bill is $700 million below the President's request. We all understand that the Nation is at war. We have tremendous challenges. This bill provides important resources to address these challenges internationally. It is absolutely irresponsible, in my judgment. It is not in the national security interests of the United States of America. I strongly oppose this irresponsible amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Ms. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment. Now is exactly the wrong time to cut funding for foreign assistance programs. This is not the way to balance the budget. Instead of an overall cut, we should work to decrease instability worldwide and address the underlying problems that cause that instability. 
   The programs in this bill are pivotal to winning back the hearts and minds overseas. They address the most difficult problems in the world today, HIV-AIDS, famine, disease and disasters. The bill includes programs that work to address the root causes of global instability that require us to devote so many of our tax dollars to failed and failing states to ensure that we protect our Nation. It is these problems that have gotten us into the disastrous deficit that we are in and it is these problems that the programs in this bill will address. 
   This bill is a carefully crafted, bipartisan measure. It is currently $700 million below the President's request. We have already cut enough from these important foreign assistance programs, and this amendment would cut an additional $324 million. 
   Think about the most vulnerable and susceptible among us. This amendment would take $51 million from addressing global HIV-AIDS. Our goal is to turn the tide on this horrendous pandemic, not turn our backs. This bill currently has the funding to ramp up treatment, care and prevention activities. We can't turn around now. 
   I strongly oppose this irresponsible amendment. It is not consistent with our national security. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson) to shed some light on the misinformation that we have been hearing this evening about tax increases. 
   It seems to me, Mr. Jackson, that we have this huge deficit that has been brought about by the Republican majority in the past 10 years, at least. Would you like to comment on it for 3 minutes?

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, we have expressed our real concerns about these cuts and I strongly oppose this amendment. 
   In addition to the cuts that have been mentioned by my colleagues, I wonder if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the gentlewoman from Colorado in particular, really understands the impact of this across-the-board cut. 
   First of all, this bill has already been cut 2 percent from the President's request. Two percent. Now you are recommending another half percent. 
   You support a $120 million cut for Israel, Mrs. Musgrave? You support a $120 million cut in aid for our ally Israel? You support a $250 million cut for HIV/AIDS?     
   You support $200 million for foreign military financing; and my colleague, Mr. Israel, talked about the impact on the military that these cuts would cause. 
   My colleagues, this is a bill that is in the national security interest of the United States of America. We have heard many people on the other side of the aisle that we have to fight it over there. We don't want to fight it over here. 
   Well, when you are funding HIV/AIDS, when you are preventing avian flu, when you are funding our colleagues in the war on terror, we are fighting it over there rather than fighting it over here. 
   I strongly, strongly, would not support the cuts which you are recommending. I strongly oppose them. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept this amendment. 
   It is my understanding that it reiterates the restrictions on direct aid to the PA that are already in current law that are clearly included in this bill. I certainly expect the administration to abide by these restrictions, and I thank the gentleman for his amendment. In fact, I am wondering why the gentleman is offering the amendment if it is already included in the bill. 
   I also understand that my good friends on the other side of the aisle are whipping against this bill. This bill provides millions of dollars for Israel and for many good causes all around the world. So for those who are standing up as friends of Israel and want to protect Israel, I wonder why you are whipping against a bill that is providing millions of dollars for Israel. 
   And I thank the gentleman for your amendment.

   Mrs. LOWEY. I want to thank the gentleman for his amendment. I also am delighted to know that you will support the bill. It is a good bill. The ranking member and I worked very closely in a bipartisan way. I have the greatest respect for my friend and ranking member, Mr. Wolf. It was really disappointing for me to hear that the whip's office was working against the bill. 
   I thank you so much. It's a good bill. I appreciate your support, and I'm happy to accept this amendment because the current restrictions, which you rightly suggest, are in this bill.
