   Ms. SLAUGHTER. I think, Mr. Dreier, my good friend, that we have done a remarkable job considering we have been sworn in less than 24 hours. 
   We are, by no means, through when we finish the 100 hours, and we will be moving toward, again, a more just democracy in this House in the future. We have never said this is all of it. 
   Frankly, everybody has known what is in this package since we first unveiled it at the Library of Congress last January. 
   In addition, many of our colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle are already on record through votes on many of the things that we want to bring up. Certainly minimum wage, absolutely stem cell research, and what we want to do on ending the war. And the war itself is not addressed.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Let me say, just watch us, Mr. Dreier. I want to reiterate what I said last night: We have no intention of keeping our foot on your necks the way you did us. And you are just going to have to watch us and see. But you have voted against every one of these, along with many other things.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and thank her for her wonderful job. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we are taking up the third title of the new Democrat rules package which will restore civility to this body. 
   The House was always intended to be a place where civil discourse and the courteous exchange of ideas would be the normal state of affairs. 
   But referring to this portion of our rules package as the ``civility'' title is actually a civil term for what we are talking about: The restoration of democracy itself in the House of Representatives. 
   Over the last several years, parliamentary procedure has broken down here, and I don't know anybody who can deny that. The standard practices of this body, carefully designed rules that are fundamental to our democratic process, fell by the wayside. Far too often, they have been shunned and ignored whenever doing so fit the needs of the former majority. 
   At the end of 2003, the House took up a Medicare prescription drug bill. It is a perfect example of the broken legislation produced by a broken process. 
   Instead of proceeding in an open and transparent manner, conference discussions were held behind closed doors for months, excluding all Democrats. On one occasion, Democratic conferee Charles Rangel and Marion Berry, men who have spent their lives and careers fighting for the good of the Nation, were not let into the conference room and were physically prevented from coming inside, even though they had been appointed to be there. Why? Because the lobbyists were in the room. The lobbyists were writing the bills, not the Members of Congress, and certainly not the minority who had no fingerprint at all on the Medicare prescription drug bill. 
   That abuse of secrecy was for a good reason: It was bad for the country and the Republican conferees didn't want anybody to find out about it. But one group that did learn of its dangerous provisions was the Republican conference, and when the bill was brought to the floor on November 21, a significant number of principled Republicans refused to vote for it.     
   And so once again civil and democratic procedures were denied. The Republican leadership had lost the vote after the standard time allotted; so they simply kept it open. I have never seen anything like that in my years in the House. There were Cabinet Secretaries all over the floor. There were strangers or people we didn't even know on the floor as for over 3 hours they worked on people who were in tears, many of them, to make them vote for that bill. There was also a blanket liability exemption for drug manufacturers inserted into the language without the approval of the conference about 5 hours after the conference had been signed off on, and so absolutely the process was broken. According to reports, the President of the Senate simply walked over to the House side and inserted 40 pages into the bill. It amounted to a multi-billion dollar gift to drug companies. 
   Mr. Frist's liability exemption had been brought up during the conference process, but it was rejected, just like the Medicare legislation of 2003 had, in truth, been rejected by this House. But in each case, Members of the Republican leadership wanted something they couldn't get through the democratic process, and so they ignored the process. By doing so, they did more than pass flawed legislation. They undermined our democracy itself. 
   This democracy is a system designed to prevent abuses like these from occurring, a system constructed and improved over two centuries so that bad legislation could be exposed and voted down. 
   If we profess to care about democracy, the proof will be in the process. And, Mr. Speaker, we must save the democratic process in this House. How hypocritical is it that we try to spread democracy to other parts of the world when we disallow it in the American House of Representatives? 
   The civility portion of the Democratic rules package before us today will prevent the abuses of recent years from happening again. It will prohibit the Speaker from holding open votes just so the outcome can be changed. Democracy is the art of compromise, not the art of coercion. 
   We are also going to insist that conference committees operate in an open and fair manner and that House conferees sign final conference papers at one time and in one place. In other words, they have to be present at the conference to do so. Never again will the esteemed Members of this body on either side of the aisle be locked out of this democracy. In fact, Mr. Speaker, it does not go too far to say that about half of the American public was disenfranchised. Because of the closeness of the majority and minority, we left half of America out of the room. 
   This package prohibits the consideration of any conference report that was altered after it was signed by the conferees. If a conference can't agree on a legislative provision, it should not be in the conference report, period. If the Members of this body believe in the power of their ideas, there will be no need for tactics like those we have seen of late. An open, democratic, and civil process will promote good ideas and good legislation and will eliminate corruption and influence peddling. 
   In this new Congress and with this new rules package, we are standing up for our system of government and the needs of the people it serves and bringing back the government that they think they had, up until this last November. Democrats are going to return civility and common sense to this body, and I encourage everyone on both sides of the aisle to join us.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 1197 provides for the consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 2642, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008. 
   The rule makes in order a motion by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations to concur in the Senate amendment with three House amendments. The rule provides 2 hours of debate on the motion controlled by the Committee on Appropriations. The rule provides for a division of the question on the adoption of the three House amendments listed in the Rules Committee report. The rule also provides that the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations may insert in the Congressional Record dated May 15, 2008, such material as he may deem explanatory of the motion. 
   Madam Speaker, with a deep appreciation for the importance of the legislation before us today, the Rules Committee has reported out a rule that allows for a full, thorough debate on three amendments critical to the future of our Nation. This process will give each Member ample opportunity to vote their conscience on whether to fund the war or not, place conditions on our Iraq policy or not, or choose to support veterans over millionaires. 
   The legislation we are about to take up was forged with the idea of consensus. It meets the spending requirements made by President Bush, including the $5.8 billion that he asked for to strengthen the levees in New Orleans. In addition, it does not include a single earmark, except those explicitly requested by Mr. Bush's administration. 
   On the other hand, the legislation is not a blank check because it is important to remember why we are really here today. This is the sixth year of the war in Iraq. More than 4,000 United States service men and women, 28 from my district alone, are dead. Tens of thousands have been wounded and physically disabled, and far too many suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and a host of other mental health issues. What's more, the civilian death total is devastating. Millions, not thousands, of Iraqi men, women and children are dead. Millions more have been forced into camps or other countries that will accept them. 
   At a time of economic emergency, when the American family is under siege, the war continues to be waged at  a staggering cost to the American taxpayer and at the expense of our economic security. 
   A few weeks ago, the New York Times reported on the Bush administration's practice of paying off supposedly independent military analysts to shade the truth about what was really happening in Iraq. This administration was so concerned that Americans would find out the truth that they paid former U.S. military personnel to read from prescreened, whitewashed Pentagon talking points to hide from the American people what was happening in their name. 
   This may be the greatest foreign policy disaster in American history, and the American people overwhelmingly are calling for it to end. They have seen that this insurgency is far from nearing the end. They were told, ``Trust us. The Iraqi war revenues will pay for reconstruction.'' Yet the American people are feeling the pinch as their hard-earned tax dollars finance the rebuilding of a foreign nation while their country's own economy and infrastructure are falling apart. They were told, ``Trust us. We will make sure your sons and daughters have the equipment they need.'' Yet we have all seen the reports of desperate searches through junk heaps to refit ill-equipped armored vehicles. And we have all heard the tales of worried mothers scraping together the family savings to purchase adequate body armor for their children. 
   They were told, ``Trust us. We will ensure that our fighting men and women will be taken care of when they return home.'' Yet we all remember the disgraceful images of Walter Reed Hospital, the recent reports of appalling living conditions for troops stationed in the barracks at Fort Worth, Texas. 
   Under such circumstances, it would be an abdication of our duty to perpetuate a clearly unacceptable status quo. For that reason, the legislation we take up today represents a break from the past and a renewed chance of changing a stale, stagnant situation. 
   It does, indeed, provide immediate funding for our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan who are currently in the field. However, while the needs of our troops will always be at the forefront of our national priorities, funding for this war must not come in the form of a blank check. This funding only comes with conditions that will begin the process for ending this war. 
   The supplemental requires that troops begin redeployment from Iraq within 30 days, with a goal of completing a full withdrawal in 18 months. We do this not because we concede 1 inch to those who would do our Nation harm or because we lack the will to fight for our national security, we do this because basic respect for our military demands it. No longer will they be asked to fight an open-ended conflict whose finish line keeps moving. 
   And in keeping with this respect for our troops, the legislation mandates that soldiers must be properly rested and equipped to meet the administration's own standards for combat readiness before redeployment. 
   Furthermore, we will honor the parents who continue to serve our Nation by finally providing full funding for the military day care centers. 
   This legislation also keeps our promises to our veterans. Part of the cost of waging war is ensuring that our men and women in uniform have the resources that they need to resume their lives upon their return home. The bill before us dramatically expands the education benefits that veterans of the United States military will receive under the new GI Bill. Not only do our troops deserve this benefit and much more, but every dollar we spend on education today will come back to bolster our economy tomorrow. It is also an investment. 
   And I would add that this provision is fully paid for by asking the wealthiest, who saw their tax rates drop 19.6 percent in 2004, they have saved around $126,000 since that time, we are asking them please to give us $500 to help fund the GI Bill of Rights. 
   At no time ever before in the history of this country have we been burdened with massive tax cuts for the wealthy during a time of war. Obviously this has been a new idea of this administration. These actions of fiscal incompetence by the Bush administration left this country's economy struggling, and American families are paying the price. And no families are paying it more than the families of the men and women who are fighting this war. No sacrifice has been asked from any of the rest of us. 
   Rising levels of sustained joblessness require us to extend unemployment benefits to those workers who understandably cannot find a job. This bill does just that. 
   Additionally, up until this point, the American people have been unfairly asked to shoulder the full weight of the reconstruction effort in Iraq. The underlying legislation requires that U.S. reconstruction aid be matched dollar for dollar by the Iraqi Government, removing some of the pressure from families already struggling to make ends meet. 
   Furthermore, it prohibits the establishment of permanent bases in Iraq, blocking this administration from saddling the American people with a costly occupation long after the Army is gone. 
   Our fellow citizens have been sent to fight a conflict and a war far away from home, and we owe them not only our support and our deep thanks, and not only with words, but with the deeds that we commit to in this Congress. This bill is about who we are as a society and the values that we hold. 
   I am proud to support this rule and the underlying legislation, and I ask my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, let me say to my colleagues, voting for this rule gives the President not only what he has asked for the funding of the troops, but allows the people in the House who oppose that to have an opportunity to vote ``no.'' 
   We also note, in response to Mr. Reichert, that it does have an orderly withdrawal of troops beginning in December 2009, ending in 18 months. 
   This is a well-crafted piece of legislation of which I am extremely proud. I urge everyone to vote for the bill and rule and the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2768, SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H. Res. 918 provides for consideration of H.R. 2768, the Supplemental Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act, under a structured rule. 
   As the Clerk just read, the rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order all four amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee on this bill, including a full substitute. The amendments are debatable for 10 minutes each, except for the substitute which is debatable for 30 minutes. The rule also provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, like most Americans, I vividly remember the terrible mine tragedy at Crandall Canyon Mine in Utah last August as we waited day after day, praying for the safety of the miners. We watched with great trepidation and sadness as three rescue workers were also killed attempting to save six miners who were trapped in a horrific mine collapse, all of whom, I am sad to say, did not survive. 
   As a native Kentuckian and one who remembers vividly the mines and particularly the whistles in the middle of the night indicating something had gone wrong at the mine, I was touched by that tragedy on a very personal level. It reminded me not only of the dangers of the profession but also the important role of Congress to do all that we can to ensure their safety. 
   I was simply shocked by some of the disturbing facts that were revealed after just a brief review of the evidence. The Crandall Canyon tragedy appears to have been preventable, and the rescue effort handled by the Mine Safety and Health Administration was tragically mismanaged. 
   Following the tragedy, the New York Times and other publications reported that the Mine Safety and Health Administration ``failed to conduct the required inspections ..... at 107 of the Nation's 731 underground coal mines,'' and ``that the agency had misstated the number of inspections it had conducted, apparently to inflate its rate of completed inspections.''     
   How tragic that is when lives are at stake. Sadly, on the day of the accident, we saw it was not NIOSH that was in charge of safety for the miners, but the owner, concerned only with his bottom line. 
   Madam Speaker, the evidence shows that, despite significant progress over the last several decades, mining remains one of the most dangerous jobs in America. Mining fatalities occur at a rate more than seven times the average for all private industries, far exceeding other dangerous occupations. Last year alone, 56 miners died on the job in the United States. 
   Unfortunately, the tragedy at Crandall Canyon Mine was only the latest in a series of mine disasters, including three others last year which combined claimed 19 lives, the Sago Mine explosion, the fire at Aracoma Alma Mine, and the Kentucky Darmy Mine. 
   Madam Speaker, Congress owes it to the victims and to their families to perform a vigorous investigation to uncover what went wrong during these tragedies and how we can ensure that it never happens again. I am proud to say that we stand here today resolute in our promise to enhance the safety of our mine workers, bringing forth a bill that will aim to fulfill that pledge. 
   The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act, or H.R. 2768, will help to prevent future disasters as well as improve our emergency response should another tragedy occur. We took an important step last Congress enacting into law the MINER Act, the bill intended to prevent disasters such as Crandall Canyon. However, the administration made it crystal clear that it did not intend to go any further or move more quickly than required under the MINER Act, despite new evidence that quicker action is necessary to ensure the safety of miners. 
   This bill empowers the Mine Safety and Health Administration to protect miners, providing them with the much-needed authority to investigate mine operators and punish those that ignore or break the law. Unfortunately, too many persons on the Oversight Committee are mine owners themselves. By providing the agency with subpoena authority, it will be permitted to stop production in mines that do not pay off delinquent accounts, and to shut down mines that do not abate violations. That is certainly long overdue and should have been done at least a century ago. 
   The bill also requires oversight and accountability by the agency, demanding that MSHA take a more active role in protecting the safety of the workers. For example, MSHA will be required to carefully review every plan for the notoriously dangerous practice known as ``retreat mining'' and to physically observe the process when it begins. In addition, they will be required to issue emergency response plans. Remember that the Crandall Canyon Mine had already been retreat-mined before these miners started work. 
   Furthermore, the bill is an important tool to enhance the safety and security of miners. It creates a miner ombudsman office to process incoming complaints and to assist whistleblowers while establishing solid ground rules for independent investigation of multiple fatality mine accidents. In addition, it requires improved communications and tracking systems, and it cuts the coal dust exposure limit in half, which is so important because I learned yesterday from Chairman Miller that black lung disease, one of the most awful ways to live and die, is on the upsurge. 
   While this legislation takes groundbreaking steps to protect miners, we still have a long way to go to ensure that mining no longer carries the ominous description of ``one of America's most deadly professions.'' More must be done to reduce long-term health risks facing miners, such as  black lung disease, which can be just as deadly as on-the-job tragedies. We must expand on the MINER Act until tragedies like Crandall Canyon are a thing of the past and the death toll ceases to rise. Many oversight hearings conducted by the Committee on Education and Labor concluded that not only were the recent mining disasters preventable, but that the risk of a repeat incident is still very real. 
   I would like to take a moment to commend the House Education and Labor Committee under the wonderful leadership of Chairman George Miller. It was Mr. Miller who leapt into action to take on this immense responsibility. 
   This represents a marked change in the way the Congress has been operating following last year's election. Since Democrats regained control of the House and Senate last November, we have once again begun to use two of the most basic tools in our legislative tool box, they are oversight and investigation, and today's bill is no exception. 
   The bill shows our commitment to proactively advocate for working men and women, especially the victims and families of disasters like that that occurred at Crandall Canyon last August. We must do everything we can to ensure that every single miner is able to return home at the end of the day to their family. I am proud to say this is, at its heart, the true intention of this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chairman, I submit the following articles supporting H.R. 2768 from Lexington, Kentucky and Salt Lake City, Utah.   
   Unaddressed Risks: Additional Mine-Safety Measure Needed 
   Congress and President Bush nearly broke their arms patting themselves on the back last year when a new mine-safety act became law. 
   The measure had the coal industry's blessings and was about all that could get through the Republican-controlled Congress, even in a year when 47 miners were killed in accidents, including underground explosions in Kentucky and West Virginia. 
   The MINER Act was a decent start. But it was also riddled with weaknesses, including no provisions that directly addressed the conditions leading to the deaths of 12 men at the Sago, W.Va., mine. 
   There were no requirements that mines have rescue chambers or that miners' emergency breathing devices be subject to random checks to be sure they work. 
   Now it's time to do better. 
   The Supplementary Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act, known as S-MINER, is awaiting action by the House. 
   In addition to filling the previously listed gaps, the measure includes a range of health and safety improvements that have long been needed, including new limits on: 
   Retreat mining, in which coal pillars supporting the mine's roof are removed and which led to the deaths of six miners and three rescuers at the Crandall Canyon mine in Utah this year. 
   The use of coal conveyor-belt tunnels to ventilate mines, a practice that carries flames and poison gases to where miners are working when a fire occurs on a conveyor belt and that contributed to the deaths of two miners at the Aracoma mine in West Virginia last year. 
   Also, at long last, the measure requires more advanced technology for measuring dust levels in mines to prevent black lung, the smothering disease that is making a resurgence among American miners. 
   And, in a major advance for mine safety, the bill provides for independent panels to investigate mine accidents causing multiple deaths, injuries or entrapments. 
   Under the current law, the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration is responsible for investigating itself, an obvious conflict of interest. 
   The coal industry argues that it would be unfair to impose new safety requirements while it's still struggling to put last year's law into place. But that's a lame excuse when the proposed changes are so obviously needed. 
   Of course, no law will keep miners safe until Congress and a new president rebuild MSHA. 
   An inspector general recently found that while underground mining increased 9 percent from 2002 to 2006, the number of federal mining inspectors had decreased by 18 percent, from 605 to 496. 
   As a result, MSHA failed to conduct required inspections last year at 107 of the nation's 731 underground coal mines.   
   Toughen Mine Safety: Bill Adds Scrutiny to Accident Investigations 
   President Bush says he would veto a strong mine-safety law because it would interfere with a weak mine-safety law and confuse the coal industry. 
   Bush's logic will produce more widows and orphans in the coal fields. 
   Kentucky's House delegation--the Republicans and the Democrats--should support S-MINER, the Supplementary Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act. 
   The MINER Act, enacted in 2006, was the best that could be gotten from a Republican- controlled Congress. Now with the Democrats in charge it's time to fix the weaknesses in that law. 
   The bill awaiting House action directly addresses the causes of mine fatalities at Darby in Kentucky, Sago and Aracoma in West Virginia and Crandall Canyon in Utah. 
   Of all the objections to S-MINER raised by Bush, the silliest is his claim that independent investigations would dilute accountability for mine accidents. Just the opposite is true. 
   In Kentucky, we've seen firsthand the folly of requiring the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration to investigate itself. 
   After the Darby explosion in Harlan County, in which five miners died, MSHA appeared to be more interested in covering its backside than uncovering all the facts. 
   An MSHA inspector had spent three days in the mine during the week before the explosion. But MSHA refused to let Kentucky investigators or anyone outside MSHA question him. 
   Such conduct puts miners at risk and damages the public's confidence in government. 
   The bill before the House would provide for independent panels to investigate mine accidents that cause multiple deaths, injuries or entrapments. 
   Congress should approve it and Bush should sign it.   
   Mine Safety: Congress Considers Overhaul of Rules and Regs 
   It's a simple, noble, attainable goal, one Utah's underground miners can live with. ``We want to do everything we can to ensure that miners are able to return home safely at the end of their shifts.'' 
   That from U.S. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee and sponsor of the Supplemental Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2007. 
   The bill was drafted in response to another deadly year in U.S. deep mines--25 coal miners and 28 other miners have died to date. It enhances and hastens many of the safety provisions contained in the Miner Act of 2006 and provides for additional rules and regulations in an industry where safety is sometimes sacrificed in the quest for profit. 
   There's a lot to like about Miller's bill, which is co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, and was inspired in part by the tragic accidents at Utah's Crandall Canyon coal mine in Emery County, where six miners and three rescue workers were killed in mine collapses in August. 
   The legislation would establish the Office of Miner Ombudsman, which would receive and track anonymous complaints from miners who are aware of dangerous mining conditions or safety violations, but are afraid to speak up for fear of losing their jobs. It would give the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration absolute authority to supervise and direct rescue and recovery efforts after mine accidents, negating the need for voluntary cooperation of mine owners. 
   And it would provide for more oversight of retreat mining--a dangerous mining method in which coal is scavenged from mine support walls--in mines more than 1,500 feet underground, which are common in the West. 
   The committee forwarded the bill to the full House in a 26-18 vote that fell along partisan lines, with Republicans, including Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah, siding with the mine industry and MSHA in opposition. 
   Bishop, who argued that the Miner Act of 2006 is not yet fully-implemented and probes of the Crandall Canyon tragedies are still under way, says the bill is premature and takes ``everything to an extreme.'' But it's obvious that immediate and extreme measures are needed, because miners are still dying by the dozens. Congress should approve this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, we meet on what is the fourth day of the fifth year of the war in Iraq. It is a war that has gone on longer than the war in Korea. America has been fighting longer in Iraq than we did during World War II--even though that was an international conflict fought on two fronts against some of the most dangerous threats to our national security ever known. 
   Too many Members of this Congress and of this Administration have for years seen what they wanted to see in Iraq, and believed what they wanted to believe. But their conceptions couldn't matter less to the men and women of that nation, or to the men and women of the American military who are fighting there. 
   Civilians and soldiers don't live in the world as politicians say it is. They live in the world as it really is. And they live, every day, with the consequences of the decisions made here in this chamber. 
   During the first 4 years of the Iraq war, they had to live with an Administration and a Congress that either could not, or would not, see this conflict for what it really was: a war that was not being won, that was being fought by soldiers who often did not have the equipment they needed or the care they were owed, that was not improving the security of the Iraqi people, that was depleting our military and, as a result, endangering the long-term security of this nation, and that was based on a flawed strategy that desperately needed to be changed. 
   They lived with the former Secretary of Defense dismissing persistent equipment shortages by telling us that our nation had gone to war with the Army it had. By the time Mr. Rumsfeld had uttered those words, on December 9th, 2004, 1,288 U.S. soldiers had been killed. 
   They lived with predictions that the insurgency in Iraq was in its last throes, a statement made 6 months later. Four hundred thirty-seven more soldiers had lost their lives in those months. 
   And now, they live with more calls for patience from the Administration and its allies, and more denunciations of anyone who would seek a different course in Iraq. 
   As of today, more than 3,200 soldiers have died in this war. The civilian death toll is astonishing, with estimates now running as high as 1 million Iraqi men, women, and children killed as a direct or indirect result of the conflict and the chaos it has unleashed. Millions more have been dislocated, driven out of their homes and into refugee camps. 
   It is long past time for this institution to join with our soldiers and with the people of Iraq in seeing this war for what it really is. 
   The legislation before us today represents the first real chance Democrats have had since 2003 to change the course of the war in Iraq. And we intend to do it. 
   We will do it not because we are conceding anything to those who would do our Nation harm, not because we lack the will to continue the fight, and not because, as some would have you believe, we are giving up. 
   Instead, we are going to change the course of this war because the future of the people of Iraq hinges on it, because a basic level of respect for our soldiers demands it, and because the long-term security of our Nation depends on it.  
   Mr. Speaker, the simple reality is that the situation in Iraq is stagnant at best, and deteriorating at worst. Politically, economic and military goals are not being met there. Faced with such truths, why should this House pass yet another blank check for the war, as past Congresses have done? 
   Instead, this bill is based on a simple and logical idea: it makes America's continued involvement in Iraq conditional on the situation there improving. 
   America's soldiers will no longer be asked to fight in an open-ended war whose goal line keeps moving. This legislation requires Iraqi leaders to make the political compromises necessary to produce a working government that will function for all of Iraq--or else risk losing America's military support. And it will require security benchmarks to be met if American soldiers are to continue sacrificing their own safety for that goal. 
   But what is more, this bill represents the first step Congress has ever taken towards ending the war in Iraq. 
   A clear majority of the American people want this body to take decisive steps toward that end. A clear majority of our global allies want the same thing. A significant number of generals and military officials think that ending this conflict must be achieved sooner rather than later. 
   This bill is a response to their words, and to their counsel. It will not end the war immediately, nor will it end it recklessly. 
   Instead, it rejects the idea of a war in Iraq without end. 
   To continue funding this conflict without requiring any tangible progress to be made in Iraq makes no sense. It would achieve neither peace in that nation, nor security here. 
   But what it would achieve, Mr. Speaker, is the continued depletion and degradation of our military beyond all reason. It would continue to render our armed forces unable to fight in other parts of the world against other threats. And it would continue to force suffering soldiers to return to the battlefield time and again, despite physical and mental injuries. 
   We know the statistics: in addition to the 3,223 soldiers that have died, tens of thousands more have been injured, some permanently. And there are more than 32,000 Iraq veterans--32,000--who 
   who every day suffer silently from the scourge of mental health problems. More than 13,000 of those men and women have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. 
   And yet, they are afforded no relief. The President's escalation of this conflict is forcing more soldiers back into combat sooner, with less rest, with less training, and with less time to heal. There are even reports of men and women being sent back to Iraq who are too injured to wear body armor. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is important not to view these realities in the abstract. I want to share with you a story I recently heard, the story of one young lieutenant currently awaiting his second deployment to Iraq. 
   Though he trained as an engineer, his first tour of duty saw him bravely patrolling dangerous streets north of Baghdad. He returned last December, and was initially expecting a year on base during which to rest and train a new platoon. 
   Instead, he will be heading back months sooner. He says that the soldiers under his command are not going to get the time they need to train properly for their mission. The vehicles and equipment they now use to train for war are failing and often break They are physically weary, with many still suffering from the lingering effects of leg and back injuries. Others are battling more elusive damage, and are in counseling for PTSD. He even told me that the vast majority of the once married soldiers in his unit are now or will soon be divorced. Their lives outside of the war are coming apart. 
   And yet, if you ask him, he will never complain about these difficulties. They are all part of the life of the soldier, he says, a few of the many challenges he and his men will confront every day they are deployed. When those in the military are given a mission, he told me, they find a way to complete it. That creed is the foundation of the strength of our Armed Forces. 
   It is the personification of the word sacrifice, Mr. Speaker. This young soldier and those under his charge are going back to Iraq again, even though they are wounded, and tired, and lacking in training and equipment. They miss their families. They miss their lives back home. But they are going all the same--going simply because this body has given the President the right to send them into battle. 
   But what this soldier did tell me is that our Armed Forces cannot go on like this. He said that if the foundation of our military's strength--its refusal to admit defeat--is misused, then we will end up destroying our system of national defense. 
   We hear the reports of the 82nd Airborne, for decades able to respond anywhere in the world within 72 hours, now struggling to respond to anything besides deployment orders sending its soldiers to Iraq. 
   We see men and women in uniform being sent back for tour after tour after tour, our services desperately trying to find a way to meet new troop requirements. 
   Mr. Speaker, this war represents a dramatic misuse of our military. In the name of our national security, it is undermining the only true guarantor of national security that we have: our Armed Forces. And for 4 years, this Congress let it happen. 
   But not any more. Today, the House will finally recognize that our military is at the breaking point--not because of any inherent weakness, but because it is being asked to complete a mission no army could succeed at. 
   And so, that mission must change. 
   The new strategy this bill sets forth has nothing to do with surrender, Mr. Speaker. Instead, it has everything to do with doing what must be done to work toward a secure Iraq. And it has everything to do with refusing to allow those who would do us harm fool us into defeating ourselves--in the process, attaining a victory that they will never be able to achieve on their own. 
   Let me say as well that this funding bill also respects our soldiers enough to put their needs at the forefront of our national priorities, instead of leaving them behind. From now on, if they are asked to go into battle without being fully armored, fully rested, and fully trained, then the President himself will have to stand before this country and explain why it is necessary to do so. 
   This bill will also provide desperately needed funds for veterans' health care. Our country is seeing more wounded soldiers returning from abroad than at any point in 40 years, and yet for years, our health care system has failed thousands of them. It is unconscionable, and it is long past time that it was changed. 
   Finally, this bill both increases funding for the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and for a variety of other critically important national security objectives. 
   Taken together, it represents the beginning of what will be a responsible and ethical shift in our national security priorities away from a mistaken conflict in Iraq and back toward other concerns--the continued rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan, for example, and the needs of wounded soldiers at home. 
   By changing a flawed strategy that has weakened our military for years without getting us any closer to a stable Iraq, this legislation represents our country's best chance to shake both of our nations free from the shackles of a stalemate benefiting neither. 
   It is an important and historic bill, one that the people of Iraq deserve, that the American people deserve, and that our troops most certainly deserve. I am proud to support it, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. And so do I. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment that will strip $31.5 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   Nearly 12 years ago, the Republicans slashed the 1988 budget nearly in half. In 1992, funding for the NEA reached an all-time high of $176 million. However, 4 years later, just 4 years later, they cut the funding to $99 million. Despite obstacles posed by a lack of adequate funding, the NEA persevered, and under the leadership of Chairman Gioia, instituted national programs to engage all Americans in the arts. 
   Recognizing its accomplishments, Congress began to support it once more and has approved funding increases by voice vote for the last 2 years. That support could not be more deserved, from Shakespeare in American communities to the NEA Jazz Masters, from American Masterpieces to the Big Read, the NEA has made art programs accessible to Americans in every congressional district. 
   Its programs enrich our culture by inspiring provocative community discussions and energizing the Nation's creative spirit. And every year, we hear more good news from the NEA. 
   Innovative programs are bringing arts to our schools, our community leaders and even our military bases, with Great American Voices, and are appreciated. This popular program has brought about 24 professional opera companies to 39 military bases across the country. 
   In 2004, the NEA initiated another program directed to military families called Operation Homecoming. It helped our troops and their families to write about their wartime experiences. The anthology of contributions was published by Random House in September 2006, and I encourage all of my colleagues to read it. The stories of patriotism and courage are truly inspiring. 
   What's more, the arts are improving our economy. This is terribly important. Americans for the Arts has just released a study on the economic impact of nonprofit art organizations. In 2002, the second Arts and Economic Impact Study told us that nonprofit arts organizations created $134 billion annually in economic activity. Just 5 years later, that number has gone up 24 percent to $166 billion. For the small investment we make, we bring back into the Federal Treasury $166 billion a year. That means that while they pump $63 billion into community economies, audiences are spending an additional $103 billion on local hotels, restaurants, parking, souvenirs, refreshments and other associated costs. And these numbers likely underestimate the total economic impact of the arts. New York City and Los Angeles were not even included so as to avoid skewing the national estimates. 
   So what do these figures mean for us? That $166 billion in economic activity  means $104.2 billion in resident economic income. It means $7.9 billion in local government tax revenues. It means $9.1 billion in State government tax revenues. It means $12.6 billion in Federal Government tax revenues, and 5.7 million full-time equivalent jobs. 
   To put that in perspective, over 1 percent of the American workforce is employed in an arts-related industry. That is a greater percentage than the number of Americans who are police officers, accountants, lawyers, firefighters, telemarketers, computer programmers, mail carriers or professional athletes. What community in America could afford to lose those jobs? 
   A generous estimate of the total Federal investment in the arts is $1.4 billion, yet we earn about $12.6 billion. That is a 12-1 return on the Federal investment. No place else, Mr. Chairman, do we see a return like that. 
   Simply put, in every way, investment in the arts is sound public policy. Cutting funding would ignore everything positive we know about it, and it is the wrong policy. 
   I want to thank Subcommittee Chairman Dicks and Ranking Member Tiahrt for funding the National Endowment of the Arts at a level that reflects its important role in fostering creativity and making art accessible to Americans. 
   Mr. Chairman, your leadership and enduring commitment to this issue has been instrumental in keeping arts part of our national priorities. Thank you, and I thank the staff.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chairman, this seems a familiar job for both Mr. Dicks and me and certainly for our cochair, Mr. Shays. 
   For a while, we thought we were over the years of mugwumpery when people thought the National Endowment for the Arts was something that they could kill without any cause. And as has been pointed out several times, the last 2 years, it has passed by voice vote, but it has certainly come back with a vengeance this year. 
   Let me talk about something for a minute that I don't believe has been discussed today, and that is the effect on our school children of art. We know for a fact that every school child in secondary school that has art for 4 years goes up 57 points on their verbal SATs, and we know it is attributable to art. We know that the days that art is in the schools that there is no absenteeism. We know that children that learn to create don't destroy. We know that in developing minds, the effect that art and dance and movement have on that. As a matter of fact, I think the University of California Davis has done extensive study showing the correlation between studying a keyboard and computers, between studying modern dance and math. We have all seen it over and over again. And we worry all the time about, one, how are we going to keep our children in school and, second, how are we going to make better students of them? This is cheap at the price, Mr. Chairman. 
   And Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite was saying that her district didn't get much back. I happen to have the figures here. As of January, 2007, her district is home to 967 arts-related businesses that employ 2,565 people who will be really sorry if she is successful here tonight. 
   Let me repeat again what we have said today because it has gone up exponentially every year. In 1992, we had $36.8 billion coming back into the Treasury. In the year 2000, we had $53.2 billion, with an audience expenditure of $80.8 billion. In 2005, which are the last figures we have, $63.1 billion organization expenditures and $1.31 billion audience expenditures. And if somebody can tell me one other thing that we do in this Congress that costs us less than $200 million that brings that kind of return back into the Federal Treasury, I will be astonished. I have been asking that for years. Nobody has ever come up with anything that is even close. 
   It is so important that we maintain these programs. It is so important that in the small communities that the regional theatres are kept alive. It is seriously important that children in all parts of this country are exposed to education through music and dance, that they are able to develop their own talents. But, moreover, I want to go back to what I said at the beginning. We know the effect of art on the developing brain. It is so important that many governors make sure that babies born in their States go home from the hospital with a CD of Mozart. We should try to make sure that we can continue this. It is important. Even to this day, even with this increase, we will not be up to the amount of money that we had in this budget when I came here in 1987.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. And, reclaiming my time, the return we get on it is enormous, Mr. Chairman, not just in money to the Treasury, which, of course, is important; not just in the myriad of jobs that it creates in every single district because that is terribly important too; but it is important because it says who we are. We work in a work of art, frankly, but it is the artists that have gone before us that tell us who we were, and it is the artists who will tell us who we are now, who we are going to be. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Thank you very much. I appreciate your yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me confess off the top, it is true, I committed an act of honesty in the Rules Committee, something we hadn't seen in over 12 years. 
   I also explained at the time that rules H.R. 5 and H.R. 6 were coming up under the point of privilege with which we started this session. 
   We are working on an agenda that the minority would not or could not do and we are fulfilling our promise to the American people, and all the whining you can do and all that you can produce will not deter us from it. The majority is pleased and gratified by the minority votes on all of these issues. 
   I thought I heard a faint chorus yesterday after the bill on student loans was passed, I thought I heard someone singing, Free at last. Free at last. 
   Obviously, helping the majority to do these bills for the American people has not been any too painful for you. But these have not been addressed for 12 years. We said that we were going to. It was under the beginning rule of the personal privilege. There was nothing amiss there; we were simply being honest.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 157 provides for comprehensive consideration of H. Con. Res. 63. It provides all of the Members of this House with 3 full days of debate on this important matter. It is a momentous day for us, Mr. Speaker. 
   This is the debate that many of us have yearned for for at least 4 years, and our constituents have long suffered the lack of this debate. Every Member who wishes to speak on the resolution will have the opportunity to do so. 
   The rule also, in addition to the time in the rule, allows the majority leader at any time, after consultation with the minority leader, to extend the debate when necessary. 
   On January 10, President Bush announced an escalation of the Iraq war that will put as many as 50,000 more of our men and women in harm's way. Why 50,000 and not 20,000? Because the number of support groups who have to be there to support the troops adds up to nearly 50,000. 
   This body owes them an explanation for why at this moment in history the sacrifice is justified. Democrats and Republicans alike are determined to defend our Nation from harm and are wholly committed to supporting and protecting the members of our Armed Forces. But numerous military officials of the highest ranks, like General Colin Powell, General John Abizaid, and many, many others, have expressed a strong belief that increasing the number of combat troops in Iraq will not improve the situation in the country. 
   Two-thirds of the American people believe that further escalating the war is the wrong path to follow. This morning, 67 percent of them polled said we should get out at once. Even respected Members in the House and the Senate have been quick to state publicly that they oppose any troop escalation. 
   Republican Representative Steve LaTourette best explained this broad bipartisan opposition to the President's plan. Like many Americans, he recently said, I desperately want America to succeed in Iraq and I would welcome a fresh approach, but this is not a fresh approach. This is more of the same. 
   For 4 years, through the deaths of 3,126 American service people and nearly 60,000 Iraqi civilians and 25 to 30,000 grievously wounded, through the forced dislocation of millions of Iraqi families, through numerous troop escalations, and $379 billion appropriated by this Congress, through unbearable strain stretching our National Guard and Army Reserve, their members, and their families to the breaking point, more of the same has never worked. 
   As of last June, only 25 percent of the Iraqis had clean water to drink. The oil production has fallen by nearly half since the war began. The unemployment rate in Iraq as of December ranged between 25 and 40 percent. 
   Sixty-seven more innocent civilians were killed just yesterday in yet another bombing. Eighty-four of our troops were killed last month. Forty-one have been killed in the last 2 weeks alone. My district has suffered six casualties since 2005, and 140 men and women from my State of New York have been killed so far in Iraq. 
   Every piece of evidence suggests that the strategy currently employed by this administration is failing in Iraq. The only argument being used to support an escalation of the war would be one of trust. If we just give the President one more chance, we are told, things will be different. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that the American people and the military leaders who know what war really is and a broad majority of this Congress are tired of giving this administration one more chance and have no reason to give it our trust. 
   The Pentagon Inspector General recently reported that statements made by Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith, during the runup to war, were ``inconsistent with the consensus in the intelligence community and drew conclusions that were not fully supported by available intelligence.'' 
   Mr. Feith joins the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Rice, and many others who made statements which simply misled us into war. So why should we trust the administration's assessments of Iraq? 
   Why should we trust the President to give the new troops that he wants to send the protection that they need to come back home unharmed? Despite all the President's rhetoric in support of our Armed Forces, a second Pentagon report released at the end of January bluntly states that for years in Iraq and Afghanistan ``servicemembers experienced a shortage of force protection equipment and were not always equipped to effectively complete their mission.'' 
   In fact, the report speaks of soldiers having to trade off Kevlar vests because there were not enough for each of them. This is what is happening today, Mr. Speaker. We were aware when we first went into the war that we were ill prepared, but 4 years later it is no better. 
   The Washington Post noted just yesterday that many Humvees still do not have the armor needed to protect them from the bombs that are killing and injuring 70 percent of our troops abroad.     
   While our troops have gone unprotected, corruption exploitation and incompetence has squandered billions of dollars and allowed vital reconstruction projects to be handed to well-connected companies that failed to fulfill their duties. Unbid contracts proliferate. Despite it all, for years the administration treated accountability as if it were a dirty word. 
   And why should we expect that without a radical change, of course, that things will suddenly improve? 
   Mr. Speaker, changing a broken course in Iraq is not going to demoralize our troops or abandon them. Frankly, they must wonder what it is we have been doing here all along. To the contrary, it is the only way to support the troops. 
   Changing a broken course will not provide our enemies with encouragement either. If our strategy is not working, then why would we help our enemies by resolutely adhering to the failing plan? 
   Now, that is a question that needs to be asked again. If our strategy is not working, why would we help our enemy by resolutely adhering to the failing plan? 
   Democrats are insisting on a new level of accountability in Congress, calling 52 hearings since January 4. But we also need a new course in Iraq. We need to oppose this escalation and stubborn adherence to a failing strategy. 
   We need to shift our focus and footprint in the region and to accept what so many observers have known for years: The conflict in Iraq will only be solved politically, not militarily. 
   As strongly as I feel on this matter, Mr. Speaker, I recognize that many of my colleagues in the House have a different perspective. 
   What is needed is a serious discussion conducted by serious people. The first step of such a discussion is a focused, clear and full debate on the question of the escalation itself. We need an unambiguous up-or-down vote on the escalation. We are keeping this rule and  this bill so straightforward in order to best achieve that result. 
   I want to emphasize that this is the first step, and Congress will have many opportunities during discussions of the supplemental funding request, for example, to debate the numerous dimensions of this war and to present new ways forward. 
   But we must first know where we stand. Our goal this week is to establish whether Congress disagrees or agrees with the President's current approach to Iraq. If the answer is no, then we will have the basis for forcing the President to work in a bipartisan way with us to change that approach. 
   The obvious truth is that a failure to achieve such a change will seal the fate of this war as one of the greatest blunders in America's history. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chairman, first I want to give my thanks to Chairman Olver and to Mr. Knollenberg for doing a wonderful job on this bill. 
   I intend to withdraw this amendment, but if I can just take a moment or two to discuss the importance of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control, I would like to do that. 
   The funding is crucial in reaching our goal of eliminating childhood lead poisoning nationwide by 2010. The grants provided by HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control allow cities and States to correct serious lead hazard in low-income and high-risk homes. 
   Make no mistake, Mr. Chairman, this is not just an isolated problem. Lead poisoning affects over 250,000 American children under the age of 5 each and every year. High levels of lead in the blood have been linked to childhood asthma, brain damage, hearing loss, hyperactivity, developmental delays, and in extreme cases, exposure to lead has caused seizures, comas, and even death. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is simply unacceptable. 
   In my district alone, over 2,000 children fall victim to lead poisoning every year. Over half of all the homes in Niagara and Erie counties were built before 1950 and are therefore very likely to contain lead. And just in Erie County, 1,000 children have unsafe lead levels in their blood. 
   The city of Rochester is among the top 10 cities in the United States with the worst lead paint problems. In 2004, 900 children in Monroe County were reported to have high blood lead levels. We have a city ordinance in effect to try to deal with that, but we have not enough money obviously to take action. 
   The grants are so important. They are targeted to help the most vulnerable of our citizens, children under 5 years of age. But in order to be more effective, they have to have adequate funding. Since the bill before us only funds the Office of Lead Hazard Control at $130 million, we wanted to put in this amendment. 
   But I commend the chairman for putting together this thoughtful and solid bill, and I hope we can work together in conference to try to do more. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn. 
   There was no objection.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 1525 provides for the consideration of the Senate amendments to the bill H.R. 1424, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The rule will allow the House to concur in the Senate amendments to this bill and vote on the text of the bill that was adopted in the Senate. 
   Madam Speaker, today, this body meets under dire circumstances as our great Nation stands on the precipice of the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. Our stock market is fluctuating at an alarming rate, and our unemployment rate is soaring. Many of our financial institutions, some of which were deemed too big to fail, have failed or are close to collapse. Credit, even for the most creditworthy, is hard to come by. Our once robust and booming economy is on the brink of disaster, and that is why we have this bill before us today. 
   Like so many Americans, I have absolutely no interest in bailing out any fat cat executives on Wall Street. I stand firm in my belief and in solidarity with the American people when I say that corporate greed should never be rewarded, but the crisis we're facing today is much bigger than the corporate greed. It's bigger than Wall Street. It reaches beyond the Wall Street titans and directly into the lives of hardworking, middle class Americans. 
   Our savings--retirement savings, college savings for our children and investments in our future--are all at risk if this industry fails. The financial crisis threatens our ability to get a loan even if we have outstanding credit. The crisis threatens our jobs. 
   Without decisive action, most experts believe that our economic situation will only grow worse. Credit markets will freeze, and Main Street and all of America will suffer. Families living paycheck to paycheck will see their credit card limits slashed and their interest rates increased. Families won't be able to take out basic home and car loans, and employers may not be able to make their payrolls. 
   Take, for example, earlier this week when the body failed to pass a previous version of this rescue bill, and the country watched in horror as the Dow Jones plummeted more than 750 points. That dive, that single day in the stock market, cost our economy over $1 trillion, but when the stock market crashed, the majority of the $1 trillion that was lost did not belong to Wall Street giants. It came from the pensions of people who have retired or from people who have frugally worked for their entire lifetimes to save a few dollars for their families' futures. 
   It is for this reason that Congress must intervene. The bill before us is intended to rescue Main Street. By rescuing the financial institutions, we rescue the jobs, the savings and the ability to get a loan for each hardworking American. However, as we go ahead with this bill, we must be mindful of the road that led us to this crisis. After all, if we don't know what went wrong, how can we make sure it will not happen again in the future? 
   Like so many Americans, I am deeply disappointed by the Bush administration's reckless deregulation policies that wrecked our once booming economy. This President put incompetent people in charge of the Nation's most critical regulatory agencies. Transparency was lost. Business was allowed to regulate itself, and the total deregulation of the financial services industry ensued. 
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Cox just recently noted ``voluntary regulation does not work.'' I'll say it doesn't. Looking back in history, we saw that, when deregulation occurred in the last century, it led to bread lines and to Hoovervilles. 
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt, well acquainted with the havoc wreaked by deregulation, said, ``We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals. We now know that it is bad economics as well.'' 
   President Roosevelt led our Nation through that crisis by regulating the financial industry. However, deregulation proponents have removed FDR's regulations because, for them, big business comes first and knows everything. 
   That is why, when the administration handed Congress an ultimatum for a $700 billion blank check which lacked the very accountability and transparency that contributed to the problem, Democrat leaders said absolutely not. Over the past 2 weeks, we have insisted that the original rescue package proposed by President Bush and by Secretary Paulson be changed dramatically. As Democrat leaders negotiated plans to rescue the economy, we fought tooth and nail to make sure that any proposal included expanded oversight, transparency and an assurance that taxpayers will be reimbursed in full. That is what the proposal in front of us does today. 
   We have a three-part plan to reinvest, to reimburse and to reform. We will rescue the troubled credit and financial markets to stabilize and to reinvest in our economy, to insulate hardworking Americans, to reimburse the taxpayers for every dime, and to reform how business is done on Wall Street. 
   With this bill, we are standing up for all Americans by ensuring that there will be no help for Wall Street without help for Main Street. We are standing up for taxpayers by requiring strong, independent oversight, transparency and accountability for the money spent. 
   Even the General Accounting Office will be moving into the Treasury Department. 
   We are standing up for the working Americans by limiting excessive compensation for CEOs. We are standing up for homeowners, basically the crux of what happened here, by requiring the government to steer mortgages in danger of foreclosure to loan workout programs to prevent the foreclosures that are driving down home values all across the country. We are insuring more of the hard-earned money saved by families and by small businesses across America by upping the Federal protection of bank deposits from $100,000 to $250,000. 
   I am proud to say that three House committees will begin oversight hearings very shortly. In January, with a new Congress and with a new President, we will be ready to reinstate the regulations so cavalierly removed by an administration which believed that the financial industry could regulate itself, leading us to the dire consequences we face today. 
   Taxpayers should know that we push to ensure that the government receives shares of any company it provides with aid, and after agreeing to rescue AIG from filing for bankruptcy, the government received nearly an 80 percent share in the company. The action was reassuring enough to the market that people are now clamoring to buy AIG assets. 
   By making sure the government gets shares of companies we aid, we are working to revitalize this industry in a way that will benefit the taxpayers who are funding this rescue. By doing so, the New Direction Congress is standing up for swift action to ensure a more sound economic future for all Americans. We are absolutely committed to doing everything possible to ensure that America keeps working and that government is also working for America. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, we have found ourselves again at a junction where we have found ourselves many times in these last few years, at the mercy of the Senate. We have the bill that they passed; and, unfortunately, if we were to open it again, we would probably be here for another 2 years trying to do this bill, because I think both sides have many issues that they would have preferred to see here. But nonetheless, we understand the emergency that we are under, what it is that we have to do. 
   I take great comfort and want to say again that three of the major committees having oversight over financial services will begin very shortly to have hearings not only to determine why we are in this position, but what we can best do in January in the new session to remedy it and make sure that it never happens again. 
   We are expecting very quick action from those three committees. We wish them well. And we want the Nation to know that we are not just leaving town and letting that go, but we will be working on this throughout the rest of this time. 
   With that, I want to urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question. 
   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise with a heavy heart today because last Friday, one of Buffalo's most cherished sons was taken from us Today, I join my colleagues in celebrating the life of Tim Russert, whose contributions to journalism and American discourse will outlive us all. 
   As anyone who watched ``Meet the Press'' knows, Tim Russert never forgot where he came from. He was an unabashed and shameless fan of anything Buffalo, and that was fitting. He embodied the values of the old steel town: honesty, integrity, and hard work. Instead of forgetting them when he came to Washington, as so many do, he brought Buffalo with him. 
   When Tim Russert spoke with someone, he was making a friend, not climbing a ladder. While his career soared, he stood with his feet solidly on the ground. A product of his South Buffalo roots, his character was his trademark and earned him the respect of journalists and politicians and all Americans alike. 
   Tim Russert didn't chase ratings by taking cheap shots. He didn't distort his guests' positions to create a news story. He always asked fair questions, encouraged open debate, and held politicians accountable to the people who  elected them. He was the epitome of a journalist, sorely lacking today, and his show was the gold standard. 
   And I would be remiss if I didn't mention his role in honoring fatherhood. Tim Russert reminded Americans of the important role fathers play in child rearing, both through his books and by sharing stories about ``Big Russ'' and his own son. His admiration for his father and his unconditional love for his son were evident every time he spoke of them. 
   There will be a void on America's television sets every Sunday, and later this fall, the Bills and the Sabers will miss the sounds of cheers from their most loyal fan. But Tim Russert's legacy, his unwavering pride in Buffalo, his devotion to his family, and his indelible mark on journalism will live on. 
   My thoughts are with his wife and son and the rest of the Russert family.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2638, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 473 provides an open rule for the consideration of H.R. 2638, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for 2008. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for those arising under clauses 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The resolution also waives points of order against the bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI regarding legislating in an appropriations bill and appropriating for unauthorized programs. 
   During consideration of the bill for amendment, the chairman of the Committee of the Whole may provide priority in recognition based on whether the Member offering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the Congressional Record. The rule also provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   I am pleased to bring to the floor the first appropriations bill of the 110th Congress under a traditional open rule process. The security of our Nation concerns every American in every State, and it is a priority of every Member of this body. But while the effort to secure our homeland is a bipartisan one, there are clear differences between how the two parties approach it, and the bill demonstrates them. 
   We have before us legislation that provides more than $36 billion in critical funding needed to address security vulnerabilities identified by the Homeland Security experts. It is a fulfillment of commitments made by Democrats in implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007, which passed the House with a bipartisan majority. 
   With this bill Democrats are increasing funding for homeland security by 7 percent, or $2.5 billion, over the amount appropriated for it last year. In fact, we are providing close to $2 billion more than what the President asked for in his request to Congress. These increases aren't excessive. They are, instead, the result of the Democrats' commitment to adequately fund security programs which in past years have been talked about, but not sufficiently supported. 
   These funding increases stand in stark contrast to past Republican decisions to cut money for vital security efforts and to impose unfunded mandates on State governments. My fellow Democrats and I have rejected the Republican proposals for across-the-board cuts in these areas. We feel that they would indiscriminately and unnecessarily sacrifice billions in needed funding for rail, transit, and port security, as well as for first responder grants. And, indeed, the sad truth is that these grant programs have suffered funding cuts every year since 2004. Compare that to the fact that this bill provides over $4.5 billion, nearly double the requested amount, for these critical areas. 
   More specifically, we have provided $400 million for port security, doubling the requested amount. Similarly, $400 million will go towards rail and transit security grants, more than the administration requested. And we will increase spending for firefighter grants by $138 million. The administration had wanted to cut these funds significantly, but we are increasing them. 
   At a time of heightened concern about our border security, the legislation will help to secure our borders by paying the salaries of 3,000 new Border Patrol agents, and it also improves the benefits package for Customs and Border Patrol officers to ensure higher recruitment and retention rates. After years of a lack of accountability and questionable government contracts, this bill promotes both accountability and oversight through reforms of the contracting process, and this is amazingly important. 
   I mentioned our borders a moment ago and I want to return to that subject very briefly. As a representative from western New York, the security of our borders is an issue of great concern to me.     
   Both our northern and southern borders face unique and separate challenges, and the bill addresses each in turn. 
   The 3,000 new agents funded by the bill will mean over 17,800 brave men and women will patrol our borders by the end of 2008. And at the same time, we will increase northern border funding by 33 percent, and 500 new agents will be placed there. As important as this is, border security efforts must never blind us to the deep connection we share with our neighbor to the north. Ours is a 200-year-old relationship that has benefited both of our nations immensely. In fact, I often say  that people of northern border communities don't see Canadian towns and cities as being in another country; instead, we see it as one nation with a river running through it. 
   The travel and trade which cross the northern border every single day between America and Canada are critical to our economy and to the northern economic security. We must never sacrifice our relationship with Canada in a misguided attempt to increase border security. 
   I have long said that economic security and physical security are not mutually exclusive; we can and we must have both. Unfortunately, the approach to northern border security currently advocated by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State is flawed. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, of WHTI, will choke off legitimate travel and trade and sacrifice local economies unnecessarily by imposing onerous border-crossing requirements. WHTI, while well-intentioned, is simply unacceptable in its current form. 
   For 2 years, I have been working with fellow border members and concerned local groups and Canada and their government to fix WHTI, and I am proud to say today represents a major step forward in that battle. With Chairman Price's help, I inserted language into this bill that will withhold $100 million from the funds required to implement WHTI until a series of our demands have been met, demands that will push both DHS and State in the direction that they need to go, that is, away from requiring expensive crossing documents and towards commonsense, low-cost alternatives, and will keep our border closed to criminals, but open to the families and the businesses which make it so vibrant. 
   Additionally, the language will require the completion of a pilot project, which DHS is paying for and has not yet started, involving the State of Washington and British Columbia before WHTI can go forward. We see no point in paying for a project only to ignore it. The project will reveal the feasibility of the passport requirements in WHTI. With the 2008 winter Olympics being held in Vancouver, there will soon be an even greater number of Americans traveling across the border there. And this is a perfect way for us to test the requirements of WHTI before it is put in place nationwide, and we are going to make sure the results of that test are known. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill. It demonstrates the Democratic commitment to smart security, as well as to ensuring that the money spent by this government goes where it is needed most and is spent wisely, efficiently, and effectively. These are our priorities. Our constituents deserve no less, and our security can afford no less. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   A lot of time has been spent today on the open rule and the open amendment process, and I'd like to give you and anybody else who may be watching some idea of what we can expect. 
   Some 94 Republican amendments were filed, 16 Democrats. One Republican is responsible for more than 50 percent of that side. 
   Let me give you a couple of examples of what they are. None of the funds can be used for supporting yoga classes.  None can be used to support art classes. None can be used to support dance classes. None can be used under other programs, any program that offers to support a dance class. And my personal favorite, none of the funds can be used for supporting puppet shows. 
   There isn't anything in the world in any part of this bill having anything to do with these amendments, but nonetheless here we are. We'll be debating this into the night, but I would ask everybody to listen to those amendments and decide which is serious on homeland security. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the resolution.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (CELEBRATING AMERICA'S HERITAGE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1483, a bill amending the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996. 
   The bill reauthorizes already existing national heritage areas. Most important to me and my district, and I think to the country, the bill authorizes the creation of the Niagara Falls Heritage Area. This truly is a monumental day for the city of Niagara Falls, the surrounding communities and the millions of people who visit Niagara Falls each year. 
   Every time I drive across my congressional district, I am reminded how fortunate I am to represent such a beautiful part of the country. From the shores of Lake Ontario to our vineyards and apple orchards, Mother Nature has bestowed some of her finest treasures upon western New York. But none is as widely recognized at home and around the world as Niagara Falls. 
   Every year more than 15 million people travel to Niagara Falls to take in this awe-inspiring natural phenom-enon. It is high time, Mr. Speaker, that the national treasures that are Niagara Falls and the Niagara River be granted the official status they have long deserved, that of a national heritage area. 
   Niagara Falls has always been a source of energy for our region. I don't need to remind you that it is the foremost source of hydroelectric power in North America as well as the birthplace of modern hydroelectric power. 
   This bill will help to solidify Niagara Falls' standing as something more, an engine for the revitalization and promotion of our region's natural, historic and scenic resources to residents and visitors alike. We are not ashamed of that. 
   We have, obviously, one of the areas of the country most devastated economically. As you know, the heritage area designation ties together private and public lands linked by geography and history. With the approval of this designation, the National Park Service  will assist our local and State organizations to develop and implement a plan to conserve and promote Niagara's natural attributes. Niagara Falls is one of the seven natural wonders of the world. We should all cherish it. The benefits are obvious for all to see.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the point of order is about whether to consider the rule and ultimately the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. In fact, I would say this is simply an effort to kill the bill. 
   In the midst of the energy crisis, the bill takes important steps towards increasing domestic energy production, encouraging the development of alternative fuels and cutting down on the corruption between the Bush administration regulators and the oil industry. 
   By expanding access to offshore oil reserves, the bill encourages oil exploration and could lead to increased domestic energy production. 
   By releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the bill will lead quickly to reducing prices at the pump. 
   In light of an Inspector General report showing that Minerals Management Service employees were accepting gifts from the oil companies they regulate, engaging in unethical sexual and drug conduct, this bill would subject the MMS employees to higher ethical standards and make it a Federal offense for oil companies to provide gifts for MMS employees.     
   By promoting energy efficiency and conservation in buildings, through updated building codes and incentives for energy-efficient construction, this bill will lead to reduced energy use and lower utility bills. At the same time, by providing more funding for home heating assistance, we ensure that seniors and other vulnerable populations will not have to choose between food and heating oil.  
   By providing incentives and support for development and deployment of domestic alternative energy technologies, the bill will promote energy security for the United States. Under this bill, power companies would be required to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020, reducing air pollution from power plants and helping to address the threat of climate change. 
   As Americans use more public transportation in the face of high gas prices, this bill will help transit agencies deal with added costs and increased ridership by providing $1.7 billion in grants. At a time of record-breaking oil company profits, the bill will require the oil companies to pay their fair share by repealing tax subsidies that they certainly don't need, and by closing a royalty loophole in lease agreements from 1998 and 1999. 
   In short, the bill is a much-needed compromise approach to a widespread crisis facing our country. This is simply a case today whether we support, with our votes, the oil companies or the consumers and the citizens of the United States. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to consider the rule and reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1433 provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 6899, the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. The resolution provides 3 hours of debate on the bill, controlled by the Committee on Natural Resources. 
   Mr. Speaker, American families and businesses from every city, town and village across our districts are struggling with the skyrocketing gas prices and ever-increasing energy costs, which have obviously gone over into the cost of food and every other commodity that we use. The American people are calling out for relief, which is why we have this comprehensive energy package before us today. 
   In considering this legislation, we must ask ourselves: How did our great Nation get into this terrible place concerning energy in the first place? Eight years ago, two oilmen took the reins of America's energy policy, and they never looked back. They held secret, closed door meetings with Big Oil and energy companies at a tremendous cost to the American people. And the Republican Congress supported them every step of the way. To this day, we do not know about the secret meetings that the Vice President held. 
   Just this past summer, the American people struggled through an excessive speculation crisis when oil prices jumped over $150 a barrel. Of course, when the Democrats threatened to rein in speculators, they pulled over $39 billion out of the futures market. We must address speculation before we leave this session. Because now, the oil prices are hovering over $90 a barrel, and we cannot let that go uncared for. 
   Just last week, we saw the havoc that the Bush-Cheney energy policies have wreaked when the Interior Department's Inspector General reported that administration employees at the Minerals Management Service, who were supposed to be regulating oil royalties, were literally accepting improper gifts and engaging in unethical conduct, such as having sex at parties, using drugs with persons, employees of the oil companies. They were literally, Mr. Speaker, in bed with each other. 
   My colleagues across the aisle say they want to change the energy policy, but their record certainly proves differently. The very same Republicans voted ``no'' to the first new vehicle efficiency standards in 32 years that would have saved $1,000 in fuel costs per car per year. They said ``no'' to recouping the royalties that the oil companies failed to pay to taxpayers. They said ``no'' to curbing excessive speculation in the energy futures markets, and ``no'' to requiring the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres of Federal land that they already control nationwide, and the list goes on and on. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the other party has its way in energy, we will have more of the same Bush-Cheney energy policy written by and for the oil companies. They would help Big Oil to get more public land owned by every American, more American oil, more taxpayer dollars, and continuing record profits while American families and businesses get stuck paying record prices at the pump and heating prices. 
   Mr. Speaker, today this comprehensive bill presents the administration and its allies in Congress with a clear choice on energy. Either side with the American taxpayer, side with the people who sent you here to vote and vote for this, or side with the Big Oil companies who have had the largest profits in the history of mankind and certainly do not need more tax breaks from the American public. 
   Now, there are significant differences between the Bush administration's policy that got us into this mess and the plan before us today. This package is an energy package for a 21st century policy that will help Americans to reclaim a clean energy future. 
   And the choice is very clear, as I said before, which side are you on? The bill addresses America's energy crisis in both the short term and the long term. 
   By releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we will immediately lower prices at the pump for American families struggling with high gas costs. And we will replace the oil at the reserve as the gas prices stabilize. 
   Meanwhile, by investing billions of dollars over the long term in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and mass transportation, we will harness innovation and create good-paying American jobs while strengthening our energy security. 
   By expanding the access to offshore oil reserves and encouraging responsible drilling, the bill promotes more exploration and will lead to increased domestic energy production. 
   By promoting energy efficiency and conservation in buildings, through upgraded building codes and incentives for energy-efficient construction, the bill would lead to reduced energy use and lower utility prices. 
   In light of the Inspector General report from the Interior Department showing that the Minerals Management Service employees were accepting gifts from the oil companies and engaging in unethical conduct, this bill would subject the MMS employees to a higher ethical standard and make it a Federal offense for oil companies to provide them with gifts of any kind. 
   At the same time, by providing more funding for home heating assistance, we ensure that seniors and other vulnerable populations do not have to choose between food and heating oil. 
   Under this bill, we would enact our first national renewable electricity standard. The power companies would be required to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020, reducing the air pollution from power plants and helping address the threat of global warming. 
   As Americans use more public transportation in the face of high gas prices, this bill will help the transit agencies deal with the added costs of increased ridership by providing $1.7 billion in grants. 
   And at the same time, with the record-breaking oil company profits, it requires the oil companies to pay their fair share by repealing the tax subsidies they do not need and by requiring that the Federal Government collect the oil royalties due to the American people. That's one of the reasons why reform at the committee is so important. 
   This comprehensive energy legislation is the result of a serious compromise on the part of this Congress to bring down prices now and to invest in a clean renewable future. It will provide America with the American-owned energy policy that this administration has failed to deliver in the last 8 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are precious few moments in each of our lives where we have a chance to do something that profoundly affects not only our own lives but the lives of future generations. 
   Today, we do have a choice. Do we want to continue on the same dangerous energy policies of the past or do we want to invest in a clean energy future that will help to ease consumer costs in the short term while putting the Nation on a path to a clean energy future that will create a stronger and safer America? 
   Our energy choices will not only affect Americans who are suffering at the pump but profoundly affect the future of life on this planet. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford more of the same when it comes to this administration's energy policy. 
   We are all proud Americans, but it is time we start acting like Americans once again. Our great Nation is known around the world for dreaming big and for reaching those dreams. When President Kennedy set a goal to put a man on the Moon in 10 years, America got to work and did it. It is time to set big goals and work diligently to achieve them, and that's exactly what this bill does. 
   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make history by supporting this comprehensive bill that sets the country back on track to a clean energy future and finally begins to break our dangerous addiction to oil which we have been promising to break for at least the last 30 years. The world deserves nothing less.  
   The GOP Energy Plan: None of the Above 
   Republicans may talk a good game, but their actions speak louder than words. Republicans have voted against the critical solutions that must be part of a comprehensive  New Direction for Energy Independence. They voted against renewable energy and conservation, responsible domestic oil production, short-term measures to bring down prices now and punish those who are manipulating the oil market, and new requirements that oil companies pay their fair share. 
   Instead of working on behalf of American families and businesses, the House Republicans ``all of the above'' energy plan simply rehashes failed ideas on domestic drilling or proposes ideas that Republicans have repeatedly blocked in the past. Their all-out legislative battle in recent years to protect the record profits of oil companies earning record profits has earned them the moniker ``Grand Oil Party.'' Americans paying $4 a gallon thanks to an energy policy literally written by the oil industry cannot afford this the GOP's ``none of the above'' energy plan.

   The resolution that I am calling up on this historic day, H. Res. 5, provides for the consideration of a rules package, H. Res. 6, that we hope will begin to return this Chamber to its rightful place as the home of democracy and deliberation in our great Nation. 
   The resolution we are now debating will allow the House to consider and vote on the Democratic rules package in five separate parts. The first title contains the rules package our Republican colleagues adopted in the 109th Congress, while the second through fifth titles contain amendments that will begin a reformation of this body that is long overdue. 
   I also include for the RECORD at this time a detailed summary of the changes H. Res. 6 will make to the standing House rules of the 109th Congress.

   I understand your pain, I understand the hurt, and I understand that you are not really sure that we are going to be fair and honest. But if you look back on the 40 years here before, and I remember on the Rules Committee, that when a bill was coming up to rules, always the chairman and the ranking member came together. They worked together on everything. If it was an oversight committee, I recall that both the chair and the ranking member signed the subpoenas. There was such a series of cooperation we have never, as far as I know, dealt with retribution or underhandedness or hatefulness. 
   We know we have an awful lot of work to do. We have got a country to save; we have got a reputation to try to get back in the world; we have got the worst deficit we have ever seen; and, we have got to do something about a war. Let me pledge to you, we have no time for vindication or revenge, and it would be so nice if all the Members in this vote for a change would roll in the same direction.

   Mr. Speaker, every Congress has a constitutional responsibility to be good stewards of the money sent to us by the American people. And I am proud to say that we here in the House of Representatives have fulfilled our fiscal responsibility to the American people by passing all of our appropriations bills on time. 
   We, in the new majority, have been absolute in our promise to construct and pass spending bills with broad bipartisan support, and I am proud to say that we have delivered on those promises. 
   Of the 12 fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills that passed the House this year, we have garnered an average of 50 Republican votes. In a spirit of working together, we have successfully pushed ahead our bold and new agenda and passed legislation that prioritize veterans, health care, education and energy independence. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res 677 provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 52, as I said before, for continuing appropriations for the year 2008.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (BREAST CANCER PATIENT PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act and urge its passage. 
   Breast cancer is so pervasive it touches every American family. One in eight women can expect to be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime, and it remains the number one cause of death in women between the ages of 30 and 54. In my congressional district there are almost 1,500 incidences of breast cancer and nearly 300 women die ftom this disease every year. 
   Breast cancer surgery is not easy, physically or emotionally--but all too often women find themselves forced by their insurance companies to leave the hospital before they are ready--sometimes just hours after surgery. 
   One woman ftom New York said: ``I was one of those women that was forced out of the hospital after having a double bilateral mastectomy with four drainage tubes still attached. It was the most barbaric thing ever done to me.'' 
   Rushing a woman through a hospital stay and pressuring her to return to her normal life almost immediately, hampers her recovery at the least and may put her in grave danger. That is why it is imperative that we pass the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act. 
   This bill would help ensure that patients have adequate support after breast cancer surgery by: Guaranteeing a minimum hospital stay of 48 hours for a woman having a mastectomy or lumpectomy, and 24 hours for a woman undergoing a lymph node removal; requiring health plans to include notice of these benefits in their monthly mailing and yearly information packet sent to plan participants; and requiring plans to cover a second opinion should the patient seek one. 
   We must also support research into better breast cancer detection methods. Mammographies miss too many women and cannot suffice as our gold standard. 
   Women diagnosed with breast cancer across this country deserve the best care possible--their lives depend on it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 261 provides for the consideration of the emergency supplemental, the U.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act. The rule provides 4 hours of general debate in the House equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the amendment printed in the Rules Committee report shall be considered as adopted. The rule waives all points of order against the bill as amended and provides that the bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, with a deep appreciation for how critical this bill is, the Rules Committee reported out a rule that allows for 4 hours of what will be a full debate. It allows for the consideration of clear and concise legislation that everyone in the Congress is familiar with. It is a responsible rule, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
   But we are here today to debate much more than procedure, Mr. Speaker. We meet today on the fourth day of the fifth year of the war in Iraq, a conflict that has gone on longer than the Korean War, even longer than the Second World War, that war being fought against the greatest threat to world security. 
   The scenarios painted by politicians here about the war in Iraq don't affect the men and women fighting it or living it. They actually know what the world for them really is. And what is that reality? This is a war being fought by soldiers who often do not have the equipment they need or the care they are owed. And it is not improving security for the Iraqi people. It is depleting our military and endangering the security of this Nation; and that is to this day based on a flawed strategy that desperately needs to be changed. 
   Under such circumstances, for this Congress to support an open-ended commitment to this conflict, passing yet another blank check as past Congresses have done, would be a dereliction of duty. By contrast, passing a bill that has a chance of changing a stagnant situation in Iraq is not micromanaging; it is living up to what we owe our soldiers and the Iraqi people, to give them a fighting chance for success. 
   The supplemental makes America's continued involvement in Iraq conditional on the situation there improving. America's soldiers will no longer be asked to fight in an open-ended war whose goal line keeps moving. The bill would require Iraqi leaders to make the political compromises necessary to produce a working government, or risk losing the American military support. It will require the President's own security benchmarks to be met if American soldiers are to continue sacrificing their safety for that goal. And it will be the first step toward ending the war. 
   Ending this flawed conflict is crucial not just for Iraq, but also for the future of our own military and, hence, to our own national security. 
   This Congress was aghast when it learned of the conditions of Walter Reed. But every day, the men and women of our military are suffering beyond reason. Let me briefly share one story with you that I recently heard, the story of a young lieutenant awaiting his second deployment to Iraq. 
   His first tour saw him bravely patrolling dangerous streets north of Baghdad. He returned last December, expecting a year on base during which to rest and train a new platoon. Instead, with the escalation in place, he will be heading back months sooner. The soldiers under his command are not getting the time they need to train properly for their mission. The vehicles and equipment they use to train for war are failing and often break. They are physically weary, many still suffering from the lingering effects of leg and back injuries. Others are in counseling for post-traumatic stress disorder. Most of the soldiers who were married before the war are now divorced. Their lives outside the conflict are coming apart. 
   This lieutenant and his soldiers personify sacrifice. They never complain. When those in the military are given a mission, he told me, they find a way to complete it. That creed is why our Armed Forces are so strong. 
   But what this officer did tell me is that our Armed Forces cannot go on like this. He said that we are in danger of destroying our system of national defense. We see soldiers being sent back tour after tour, some too injured to wear the body armor. Our services are desperately trying to find a way to meet new troop requirements, sending back the wounded. 
   Mr. Speaker, this war is a dramatic misuse of our military. In the name of our national security, it is undermining the only true guarantor of national security that we have, our Armed Forces. And for years this Congress has let it happen, but not anymore. 
   Today the House will finally recognize that our military is at the breaking point, not because of any inherent weakness, but because it is being asked to complete a flawed mission. And so that mission itself must change. 
   Let me add as well that while our soldiers may stoically bear the burdens of short leaves and shoddy equipment, that in no way means that we in Congress should allow it to happen. 
   This bill respects our men and women in uniform enough to put their needs at the forefront of national priorities. From now on, if they are asked to go into battle without being fully armored, fully rested, and fully trained, then the President himself will have to stand before them, look them in the eye, and explain why he thinks our national safety is worth that level of sacrifice. 
   The legislation will also provide desperately needed funds for veterans' health care. Our country is seeing more wounded soldiers returning from abroad than at any point in 40 years, and yet our health care system has failed thousands of them. It is unconscionable, and it is long past time that that state of affairs is radically changed. 
   And, finally, this bill both increases funding for the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and for a variety of other critically important national security objectives. Taken together, it represents the beginning of what will be a responsible and ethical shift in our national security priorities away from a war in Iraq that we can't end and back towards where it ought to be. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is the first real chance that Democrats have had since 2003 to change the course of the war in Iraq, and we intend to do it. We will do it not because we are conceding anything to those who would do our Nation harm, not because we lack the will to fight for security, and not because, as some would have you believe, we are giving up. With this first step, we will change the course of this war because the future of the people of America depends on it, because a basic level of respect for our soldiers demands it, and because the long-term security of our Nation requires it. 
   This is an important and historic bill, and I am proud to support it. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same thing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, this is an interesting turn of events. They are apparently attaching no importance whatsoever to the Constitution of the United States. But that has not always been the case. I want to read to you a little from the debate in 1998 when Mr. Boehner speaks. 
   Mr. Boehner says: ``Mr. Speaker, it is time for the stonewall tactics to end and the cooperating to begin. Whether it is stalling on basic requests for information or invoking executive privilege, the result is the same: the American people are denied the right to know what is going on inside their White House. In the end, Mr. Speaker, this is what this fight is about, the American people's right to know what happens in their government. 
   ``The government does not belong to politicians in Washington, D.C. This government belongs to the American people, and they have a right to know what happens in Washington, D.C. They have a right to know what is going on in their White House.'' 
   I concur completely with Mr. Boehner on that statement. I want neither Republican nor Democrat President to stonewall the House of Representatives or Congress.

RES. 980, AUTHORIZING COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY TO INITIATE OR INTERVENE IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE CERTAIN SUBPOENAS -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 982 provides that upon its adoption, House Resolution 979 and House Resolution 980 are hereby adopted. 
   House Resolution 979 recommends that the House of Representatives find Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten, the White House Chief of Staff, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with subpoenas duly issued by the Judiciary Committee.     
   House Resolution 980 authorizes the Judiciary Committee to initiate or to intervene in any judicial proceedings to enforce certain subpoenas. 
   Madam Speaker, I've had so many requests for time that I will cut my own time short. I simply want to give some reasons why it's important that we're here today. 
   In my 21 years in the House, I have known that there were Members who came to Congress simply hoping that throughout their career they will always land on the safe square; not wanting to take a vote that might challenge them in any way, not wanting to take a vote that might require explanation. Fortunately, this is the safe square today. 
   What we are doing here today is protecting the Constitution of the United States of America, which all of us are pleased, when we come here, to raise our hand and swear so to do. It is critically important that we protect the powers of the Congress of the United States for future generations. It would be dreadful if a future President, having looked back over the recent events, used it as a precedent. 
   We have a strong case on the merits, is the first point I want to make. The administration's assertions of executive privilege are weak, excessively broad, and unprecedented. We win the executive privilege argument both on legal grounds and our compelling need for requested information. 
   Aside from prevailing on the merits of the executive privilege dispute, enforcing our subpoenas is part and parcel of our current ability to perform effective oversight. If we accept the White House stonewalling in this instance, the House, in the future, will not be able to conduct its oversight. And every future President can view Congress, not as a coequal branch of this government, but as subordinate to the executive. 
   The enforcement of the subpoenas in this investigation seeks to strengthen, rather than weaken, the House's prerogatives by demonstrating that we are serious about citizens resisting the issuance of validly authorized congressional subpoenas. If we countenance a process where subpoenas can be readily ignored, where a witness, under a duly authorized subpoena, doesn't even bother to appear, where privilege can be asserted on the thinnest of reeds and the broadest possible manner, then we have already lost, and we may be in much more danger than even we believe. 
   There's ample precedent supporting the House's prerogative to initiate a civil action. If we pursue this course of action and it proves to be legally incorrect, then we here in Congress, where the laws are passed, can take necessary steps to correct that procedure. If we do not pursue this course of action at all, we, again, have already lost. 
   There are some who believe that the court will say that indeed we have no rights here. If that is the case, if that even should be a possibility, then I think we have to say that if the Justice Department has become that politicized and that weak, then we are in worse shape in this democracy than we know. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Thank you, Mr. Dreier. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 601 provides for consideration of H.R. 3159, the Ensuring Military Readiness Through Stability and Predictability Deployment Policy Act of 2007, under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The rule considers as adopted the Armed Services Committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. The rule provides for one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq has taken us into uncharted territory as a Nation and as a society. During the Vietnam war, 4 percent of the general population served in the military. During World War II, fully 12 percent of our people served. Forms of personal sacrifice and national service were to be found everywhere, planted in victory gardens or held in war bonds. Even during the Civil War, a conflict from a different age, more than one in ten Americans fought. 
   Never in our history has America fought a war of this magnitude, or one that is this difficult, with an entirely voluntary military force composed of only 1 percent of the general population. And while so much of what is going on in Iraq hearkens back to past conflicts, what is occurring within our society does not. 
   It is true that the historically high percentage of National Guard troops fighting abroad has spread the reach of this war farther than some anticipated. But for nearly all Americans the immediacy of the war has been dulled by distance. We have never been asked to sacrifice as people. We have, instead, been told to go about our lives as usual and ask merely to support the troops in a vague sense. 
   Within this mass of normality lies the lives of those Americans who have actually fought in Iraq, the mothers, husbands, sons, daughters and siblings who have been sent there and who have seen things that few of us can relate to or even imagine. They have been asked to fight in a conflict whose architects have largely receded from the public view, but not before the failures of these officials made themselves felt every time a soldier was forced to enter a battle without proper body armor or without a vehicle that would keep him or her safe. In a very real sense, the families of these soldiers have been asked to endure the same reality and forced to live every moment of their deployment with the fear that their loved one will be injured, or worse. 
   Despite it all, despite everything that the members of our military and their families have been asked to bear for year after year, the talk of what is to be done in Iraq is often clinical: We should increase troop numbers; we should lower them; we should place more troops here, send more troops  there. Troops are spoken of as if they were simply another machine to be moved about and to be used at our will. 
   Our soldiers are human beings. They are our fellow citizens. They have dignity. They have rights. They do not deserve to be cast around as the administration stumbles forward seeking to find a solution to a problem of its own creation. 
   Already, a flawed war plan has forced the members of our military to endure not just the brunt of battle but also to make up for miscalculation at home. Tours have been extended and then extended again in an unprecedented way. Previously unknown burdens have been placed on our men and women in uniform as a result. At a certain point, we as a society have to say enough is enough. 
   The legislation before us is supported by men like Senator Jim Webb and Representative John Murtha for a reason: Former soldiers know what current deployment schedules are doing to our soldiers and to their families. It will restore some order to the process by prohibiting the deployment of any active military unit to Iraq unless that unit's soldiers have rested for at least as long as they have fought. It is a simple premise that was followed in virtually every war America has fought. It should be followed again today. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill should not tie the hands of generals. If national security or the safety of our troops would be put at risk by shortened deployment, the bill's requirements can be waived. But the President will have to do so publicly and certify to Congress that his decision is vitally important. With everything our soldiers are asked to do, it is long past time that the President was forced to explain to Congress and to the American people why it is all necessary. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is about who we are as a society and about the values we hold. Our fellow citizens have been sent to fight in this conflict and have asked nothing from us in return. But we certainly owe them everything. We owe them our support, not in a rhetorical sense or in blind allegiance to the administration's claims but in a real sense, by making sure that they are given the proper training and armor, by making sure they are allowed to rest for an adequate amount of time between deployments. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a chance to live up to our responsibilities as a people today. I hope this body is ready to face that challenge. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, despite our great respect and affection for those who brought their amendments to the Rules Committee yesterday, it is well known in this House and in the country that the Democrat majority intends to bring the war to a close as quickly as possible and as quick as it is practicable to do so. 
   To reinstitute the Iraq Study Committee, to refinance it, put it back together, wait for a report would take far longer than we frankly are willing to give. 
   But this bill before us today, the underlying bill before us, is humane. And it says, for goodness sake, don't redeploy troops over and over and over again unless they have had at least as much time at home to rest as they have had in combat. 
   This is a different kind of combat, Mr. Speaker. Soldiers before have always been given recreation and rest after intense combat. Not this time. The soldiers in Iraq and all the military people of Iraq face almost instantaneous death every moment of the day and night without any respite at all. We are seeing the results of that brought home with the posttraumatic stress syndrome which is rising so rapidly. 
   In addition to that, we are demanding at last, because we didn't have the opportunity before by not being in the majority, that these troops be equipped properly. 
   The New York Times said on a front page story recently that 80 percent, Mr. Speaker, of the marines that died in Iraq would have lived, those with upper body wounds would have lived with the proper equipment. How can we live with that?     
   We know now that instead of sending useless Humvees that were of no use at all to them against the IEDs, if we had always sent MRAPs, a technology we have known for 30 years, heaven knows how many of the nearly 4,000 who died would have been saved and how many of the more than 30,000 who have been wounded would have been spared that. 
   That weighs heavily on the conscience of those of us in the House of Representatives, and it angers the people that we represent. 
   We've talked to the parents of those who have been sent back two, three, four times. I have talked to one father who told me as his son was being deployed for the fourth time; if he gets killed, I will kill somebody. The anguish of these parents is palpable; and, as I stated before in my earlier statement, we don't fight this war. The 1 percent of the military people and their families are fighting this war. We've been asked for no sacrifice of any kind. 
   How glib it is for us to stand on this floor and say, leave it to the generals and look how well they're doing. The number of generals who have resigned their commission so that they could speak out against this carnage and this despicable war that was unplanned and planned by people who have left the scene cannot go on any longer. 
   And I will tell you that we have to go and look families in the face, and there are a number of times that I've gone to services, and my position on the war is well-known, and I've wondered if the families, how they would accept my presence. I have never been to a single one where they didn't say to me, bring them home, bring them home. 
   For heaven's sake, Mr. Speaker, if it's not just for that alone, those of us here have that obligation to bring them home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I again want to assure my colleagues that FISA is on the calendar before we go home, which may be the middle of next week. We're not going to leave here without getting that fixed. 
   Let me also state that, in addition to the dreadful, awful loss of our service persons and the terrible wounding and mangled 30,000 or more, there's another cost to this war, Mr. Speaker. A new estimate is that the war in Iraq will cost the taxpayers of the United States $1 trillion. We are spending at the rate of $10 billion a month. Obviously, this is money that we don't have. 
   We're borrowing mainly from four sources, the first one being China, Japan, South Korea; and, Mr. Speaker, as this debt piles up, it will take generations for our children, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren and our great-great-grandchildren simply to pay off. 
   So let me stop as I began, to again express my sorrow to the people of Minnesota and make it clear that the spending on this war, which is rife with corruption, I do need to say, that in addition to 160,000 military persons in Iraq, we have 185,000 contractors, spending tax money at an enormous rate. We are beginning for the first time in 6 years, as we've taken the majority, to really look at where that money has gone and try to ferret out the corruption, the cronyism, the unbid contracts and all of the other scandals that have gone on there. 
   Just this week again we learned that millions of dollars spent in construction to turn things over to the Iraqi people is unacceptable to the people of Iraq because of the shoddy workmanship. This is a scandal of major proportions, Mr. Speaker. It really is important that we bring this to an end and try to clean up and maybe hopefully get our international reputation back to some degree. 
   But the most important thing is that this bill says simply this: Our soldiers need rest. How dare we send people into the battle day after day, night after night, without saying from this House and from this government that what we want for them is what the military always had in the past, an opportunity to rest and renew? It's not only critical for them personally, but it's critical for the units in which they serve that they are in top form. The fact is that we could do that quite simply here just today with this bill and also make certain that we don't ever again send one of them out on one of those roads to patrol unprepared, untrained and unprotected because we failed to spend the enormous amount of money on the right kind of equipment. 
   It's time, Mr. Speaker. We owe it; and I'm ashamed that all these years, that for the past 6 years, no oversight, not any, no hearings, have been held on this war. No hearings have been held on where all of that money has gone, and we're just beginning now to scratch the surface. 
   But the first obligation that we have, far more than money involved, the largest obligation we have is to the men and women that we say would you please set your life aside and go and fight. We owe them everything in the world that we can give them. 
   I'm happy that we have put a lot of money this year on our side into the Veterans Administration, and certainly it's for traumatic brain injury which we see so much of it and that the Veterans Administration is in no way equipped to handle. We have enough money now in the bills so we can send them to the places where they can get the very best help available. But young men and women that are 18, 19, 20 years old, maimed for life. And Mr. Speaker, it is time some intelligence here in the House reigned.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank both my colleagues, Mr. Castle and Ms. DeGette, for their tenacity on this bill. Stem cell research has the potential of reaching every man, woman, child on the planet. And without your tenacity, I am not sure we would still be here today. Thank you for that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today not just as a Member of Congress, but as a microbiologist and a citizen. 
   During recent years in Washington, politics has often stood in the way of the consensus and conclusions of the scientific community. 
   One of the victims of that reality has been funding for stem cell research. I hope that today we can put aside our differences and together, achieve something that not just our scientists believe in, but the American people both want and deserve. 
   New medical technologies are always met with concern, but today many of the technologies are saving lives. Many of you remember the debate about organ transplants, in vitro fertilization, that we should never do that. The same will soon be said about embryonic stem cells, if we want it to be. 
   While all forms of stem cells should be researched, none offer as much promise as embryonic stem cells. An overwhelming body of international scientific research has shown them to be the only cells capable of becoming any element of the body. They are the key to so many of the cures that we have long sought.  
   Let me provide just one example of how powerful this research could be. There is growing evidence linking embryonic cell mutations to cancer, including testicular and breast cancer. As a result, future breakthroughs could one day eradicate many forms of cancer at their source. 
   Because of its potential, 70 percent of Americans support embryonic stem cell research, and we all know someone who has suffered from a disease that embryonic stem cells could one day cure. Why would we choose to deny hope to millions of Americans and people all over the world? 
   I should add that nations throughout the world have embraced embryonic stem cell research. 
   I just want to say that, for all my colleagues who have second thoughts about this bill, let me ask you to step back and think about a loved one who could possibly benefit from this research, a neighbor, a friend. We have all got many of them. 
   Your vote today should be clear. Vote for scientific research to help people.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today not just as a Member of Congress, but also as a microbiologist and a citizen who stands in awe of the life-saving potential we hold in our hands. 
   During recent years in Washington, politics has often stood in the way of the consensus and conclusions of the scientific community. 
   One of the victims of that reality has been funding for stem cell research. The opinions of those on both sides of this issue are both heartfelt and sincere. But I hope that today, we can put aside our differences and unite to achieve something that not just our scientists believe in, but that the American people both want and deserve. 
   New medical technologies have always been met with skepticism and concern. There was a time in America when organ donations were experimental, and blood transfusions were considered too dangerous to consider. And yet today, these procedures are saving lives every hour. 
   The same will soon be said of embryonic stem cells--if we want it. 
   We may hear from some today that adult stem cells, cord blood cells, and amniotic fluid cells are just as promising as embryonic stem cells. But while they all show promise and should be researched, none of them offer as much promise as embryonic stem cells. 
   An overwhelming body of international scientific research has shown embryonic stem cells to be the only type of stem cells capable of becoming any cell type in the body. They are the key to so many of the cures we have long sought after. 
   Let me provide just one example of how powerful this research could be. 
   There is growing evidence linking embryonic cell mutations to cancer. At UC San Francisco, scientists have discovered elevated activity of several embryonic stem cell genes in both testicular and breast cancers. 
   Based on this new finding, scientists are hypothesizing that misregulated embryonic stem cell genes could cause or at least advance cancer. 
   In fact, recent research is showing that up to 20 percent of all breast tumors are now suspected to originate in stem cells. 
   Scientists hope to learn more about the functions of genes in the cells that make up tumors. Their examinations could show why stem cells become cancerous and how doctors can treat them. 
   These breakthroughs could one day eradicate many forms of cancer at their source. 
   Because of its potential, fully 70 percent of Americans support embryonic stem cell research. And that's not surprising. Nearly everyone has suffered from a disease, or knows someone who has, that embryonic stem cell research could one day cure. Who wouldn't want to end the suffering of their son, sister, father, or friend? Why would we choose to deny this hope to millions of Americans? 
   Nations throughout the world have embraced embryonic stem cell research. Their scientists are taking great strides forward. In the end, enforcing restrictive federal research policies will only ensure that the United States will continue to lose many of our best and brightest scientists in this field to other countries. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of history's greatest medical killers now have cures because of scientific research. Tens of millions of lives have been saved as a result. Today, we have the potential to save millions more, and to leave other deadly diseases behind us. 
   I believe people in wheelchairs will one day walk again. I believe that we can bring about an entirely new form of health care in America--one defined by shorter hospital stays, fewer invasive procedures, and increasing benefits to both our patients and our bottom line. 
   The bill before us today presents an ethical solution to research that could potentially benefit almost every American. It gives our country hope--hope that one day we won't have to watch our mothers die of breast cancer, our grandparents suffer from Alzheimer's, and our own children endure Type I diabetes. 
   If we fail to fund embryonic stem cell research, I do not believe that we will be able to look our children and grandchildren, our mothers or fathers, or our grandparents in the eye and tell them we did everything we could to help them live a better, healthier, longer, happier life. 
   I urge my colleagues who have second thoughts about this bill to step back and think of a loved one who could possibly benefit from this research. Your vote today should be clear.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3162, CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding me the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to say that I am enormously proud of the accomplishments that we can credit to the Democratic-led Congress. From education to health care, from national security to increasing the minimum wage, great strides have been taken to make our country stronger, healthier, and better prepared for the future. And there is more to come. 
   But it is with special pride that I rise today, because I feel that what motivated me, and so many of my colleagues, to come to Washington in the first place was the thought that on any day a vote could be held that would improve the lives of millions of people throughout our beloved country.     
   And that is exactly the chance that we have been given today, the chance to vote for a bill that will improve medical care in the country, improve the health of our citizens, and offer new hope for literally millions of children who would otherwise be left with neither. 
   Madam Speaker, I think that everyone listening today recognizes the reality of the situation we face. Addressing the state of health care in our country is one of the most important issues to the American people for one simple reason: Our health care system is failing far too many Americans. Tens of millions of our citizens have no insurance and tens of million more are underinsured. For them, all of the medical wonders in the world that our doctors produce might as well not exist. When they fall ill or, worse, when their children are hurt or have a fever or need care, where do they turn? Far too often the answer is: Nowhere. 
   We need a comprehensive solution to this problem, and the citizens of the country expect and deserve no less. That is a challenge that we must confront together, and it will take time. But today, here and now, we have the chance to make a real dent in one of the most galling and shameful inadequacies of our health care system, and that is the lack of health care for America's children. 
   Congress created SCHIP in 1997 with broad bipartisan support. As a result, 6 million children currently have health care coverage that they otherwise would not have. In my home State of New York, nearly 400,000 children are enrolled, which is the second-highest number in the Nation. 
   There is a reason why President Bush pledged that he would fully fund SCHIP while he was on the campaign trail in 2004: It was because this program is enormously effective and enormously popular with the public. 
   And, yet, there is so much more to be done. Nine million American children still remain without health insurance. It is a situation that remains quite unconscionable. 
   The bill allows us to take an enormous step forward. It will cover 5 million more children, which will make 11 in total. That would be a truly historic change. Such a vast improvement is reason enough to support the legislation, but the bill does even more to strengthen the health of Americans. 
   It strengthens Medicare by expanding preventive benefits, as well as mental health services, a matter of grave importance to many of our citizens. 
   It reduces the costs for seniors and people with disabilities, who also often have low incomes; and it extends the policies that protect access to health care in rural communities, of vital importance to all of us. 
   What is more, the bill would prevent a proposed 10 percent cut in the Medicare reimbursement to physicians, replacing it with an increase for 2 years. We cannot afford to have more physicians say they can no longer afford to have Medicare patients. This is especially important for districts throughout the country, districts like mine where we are having trouble holding on to good doctors because of financial concerns that until now have not been addressed. 
   Finally, this bill will raise the tax on the price of cigarettes by 45 cents a pack, a significant preventative health care initiative in its own right. This act alone is projected to save tens of thousands of lives and billions in future health care costs by preventing more than a million children from taking up smoking. 
   Madam Speaker, in spite of these undeniable benefits and in spite of the overwhelming popularity and accomplishments of this program, SCHIP is under attack. 
   Sadly, the President proposed to greatly underfund SCHIP, a decision which would severely limit its effectiveness; and Republicans on the other side of the aisle agree with this approach. 
   But not content to merely limit the reach of SCHIP, we will today witness an attempt on the Republican side to sink this bill entirely, as, indeed, we have seen already several times this morning. In the face of all of the positive results coming from this program and all that it is set to achieve, the harshest rhetoric is going to be cast against it. 
   Madam Speaker, we all know that my Republican colleagues cannot really believe what they are arguing. Instead, their objective is a different one: to deny the Democrats a chance to talk about yet another legislative accomplishment. They are willing to do it at the expense of the health of the Nation's children, but we will not allow it. And those who argue against passing this bill are arguing in favor of the status quo, the same situation we faced more than 10 years when bold attempts to fundamentally reform our Nation's health care system were subjected to withering attacks. 
   What was the result? Reforms were blocked, and the national situation grew worse and worse with every passing year of Republican control. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and a ``yes'' on this bill, not only just for America's children but for their parents as well.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 20, FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 116 provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 20, the continuing resolution for fiscal year 2007. It may seem strange that we are doing that at this late date. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member on the Committee on Appropriations. The rule also provides one motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, every Congress has a constitutional responsibility to be good stewards of the money given to it by the American people, but the last Congress failed to live up to this duty. Of the 11 appropriations bills it was supposed to pass in 2006, only two were completed. The others were abandoned, left for the incoming Democratic Congress to deal with. 
   My fellow Democrats and I could have approached this responsibility in the way it was approached last year, but we promised to run the House differently, to run it responsibly, and that is exactly what we intend to do. 
   We had a mess to clean up, Mr. Speaker. The budget failures of the past Republican Congress have vastly increased our national debt, but they did more than that. They left agencies, States and localities in limbo for months concerning their future funding. What is more, we have seen an explosion in earmarks over the last 12 years in Washington, earmarks that had greased the wheels of an out-of-control congressional machinery. 
   The number of earmarks approved by the House had, according to estimates by even the most conservative of groups, doubled and tripled in recent Congresses, and for every shameful, unjustifiable bridge to nowhere that was exposed and shouted down by the public, many more questionable earmarks slipped through undetected, a few lines here or there in a large bill, misspending the people's money and taking advantage of their trust. 
   The Democrats have pledged to fundamentally reform the way earmarks are passed into law by this body, to bring transparency to a process that until recently had been deliberately shrouded in darkness. 
   The Rules reform package that we enacted on the first day of this Congress will shed new and much-needed light on the earmarking process. It will require the full disclosure of all earmarks proposed by Members of the House. If a project is worth funding, then the Representative requesting it should have no qualms with standing up publicly on its behalf.  
   But the earmarks in the budget bills left undone by Republicans last Congress did not have any such standards applied to them, and so Democrats have decided to rid this CR of all earmarks. It was a difficult decision and one which we all had to justify to our constituents back home. But in the end, it was a necessary step to bring forth a new day in the people's House. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect, and cleaning up the mess we inherited required difficult choices between bad alternatives. 
   But I am very pleased that despite it all the legislation does contain increases in funding for critical programs affecting the lives of millions of people at home and around the world. 
   Spending on veterans health care is increased by $3.6 billion above the 2006 spending level. Spending on Pell Grants for the first time in 5 years is increased by $615.4 million. The NIH is going to receive an additional $619.6 million. 
   Other increases are going to support public housing, crime and law enforcement, and domestic transportation needs. 
   The bill even has a global focus, granting an additional $1.3 million to expand the efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis internationally. 
   Mr. Speaker, the minority, I predict, will claim that the closed rule under which we are debating this bill is a violation of the spirit of the House and a rejection of the promises Democrats made last year to open up the legislative process. 
   Let me be very clear, extremely clear about the past record of the House. Since 1997, the House has voted on 75 continuing resolutions, and all of them, 100 percent, were considered under a closed rule process with no amendments allowed. What is more, a third of those continuing resolutions contained substantive policy changes. 
   In addition to that extensive precedent, the House has already fully debated and considered eight of the appropriations measures contained here. To do so again would take us all year, and we do not have that luxury, not with the many challenges that confront our Nation at this moment in history. 
   Under the circumstances left for us by the former majority, we have done the best we could. We have produced a bill that will keep the government functioning and a bill that, despite its flaws, is a breath of fresh air compared with how appropriations legislation used to be handled in this Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are ready for a new direction. They have proved that in this country, and that is why they put a new kind of Congress in power. This Congress is going to be defined not just by the way it does business, but by the kind of business it conducts. 
   This Congress is not going to pass the buck, leaving unfinished business for others to handle and leaving problems for others to fix. Democrats are making the tough choices the American people expect us to make and that they elected us to make. 
   At the end of the day, that is what real leadership is all about. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, while I had not planned to be here at this point to debate gas prices, I feel compelled to put a few things on the record. 
   Everybody knows that ExxonMobil announced first quarter profits totaling $11 billion, up 17 percent from last year and just shy of record profits last quarter. BP announced profits increased 63 percent; Royal Dutch-Shell 25 percent, and this increases the 5-year trend of record oil profits. 
   While my colleagues say we have done nothing, the fact is that we've done a great deal and they've almost consistently voted against it. For example, we have tried more than once to take away the Federal subsidies to these oil companies, to the big five, because they are awash in money, and we see no reason for them to get more from the taxpayers than they're already getting at the pump. That has been consistently fought by both the Republican Party and the President. The President calls for the same policies that he has done all along and sort of hopes for the best. For the last 7 years, congressional Republicans and President Bush doled out billions of dollars in subsidies to the big oil companies, instead of working for an energy independence plan for America which was rarely discussed even during their tenure. 
   We're committed to a new direction. Speaker Pelosi has called on President Bush to suspend purchases of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve temporarily. That would go a long way toward helping us with this. We have done this before, but President Bush says he doesn't think it would affect the price. 
   On Friday, the New Direction Congress called on the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the law and to investigate record gas prices and possible market manipulation. Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the FTC has the authority, but will not take it, to exercise the power to protect the consumer from skyrocketing energy costs. That is the Republican administration. 
   The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 also included landmark provisions to make cars and trucks more efficient and to promote the use of more affordable American biofuels. The new fuel standards will reduce our oil consumption by 1.1 million barrels per day by 2020, and it will save American families $700 to $1,000 per year at the pump. That is under the Democrats in Congress. 
   We've also passed legislation in this House to crack down on oil price gouging, to hold OPEC accountable for oil price fixing, and then, as I said, to repeal the subsidies for profit-rich Big Oil so we can invest in a renewable energy future. However, President Bush and the Republicans block these efforts every step of the way. 
   Cracking down on oil price gouging was opposed by 140 Republicans in the House, including all of the Republican leadership except Mr. McCotter. Holding OPEC accountable was opposed by 67 Republicans, including most of the Republican leadership, Mr. Boehner, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Cole, Mr. Dreier, and Ms. Granger. Repealing subsidies to the profit-rich oil companies and investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency was opposed by 174 Republicans, almost unanimously, including all of the Republican leadership. And in every case, the Bush administration threatened to veto the bills. Unfortunately, Republicans in the Senate refused to even let them become bills to go to the President. 
   We have a good and sufficient record here. We have planned to do more. We have done more than was done in the last 7 years to try to do that. 
   With that, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 1156 provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate on the motion with 20 minutes each controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   Madam Speaker, the story of humanity is defined by extraordinary achievements that centuries later are looked upon as having impacted the course of human history. Five years ago, we saw one of these distinguishing achievements: the mapping out of the human genome, a discovery that pries open the door of possibility and presents an opportunity to advance the human race. 
   This breakthrough in the field of genetics joins the ranks of momentous discoveries that have changed the face of medicine and science for centuries to come, like the discovery of the polio vaccine so many years ago. 
   Last week, Senator Kennedy on the Senate floor noted that the mapping of the human genome ``may well affect the 21st century as profoundly as how the invention of the computer or the splitting of the atom affected the 20th century.'' 
   However, Madam Speaker, such discoveries and achievements do not automatically lead to these extraordinary breakthroughs. In order for us to fully reap the benefits, we must ensure that our social policy keeps pace with the advancement of our science. 
   That is precisely why I rise today in support of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. It has been 13 years in the making, and I'm pleased that the House of Representatives is once again considering the bill today, hopefully for the last time, so we may send it to the President to sign into law. 
   While I'm pleased we're taking it up, I'm saddened that so much time has been lost and that the march toward progress and discovery has been slowed. 
   The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is the culmination of a broad and bipartisan effort to prohibit the improper use of genetic information in workforce and health insurance decisions. 
   It prohibits group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to healthy individuals or charging higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to maybe develop a disease in the future. 
   Furthermore, it bars employers from using one's genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement or job promotion decisions. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill has been described as the first civil rights legislation of the 21st century. I think that assessment is correct because, with the exception of trauma, everything that happens to a person's body has a genetic component. From the color of our eyes to our height, to the illnesses and disorders we are susceptible to, everything happens because of our genes. 
   No one, not a single living human being, has perfect genes. In fact, each one of us is estimated to be genetically predisposed to between 5 and 50 serious disorders.     
   The good news is that since the sequencing of the human genome was completed in April, 2003, thanks to Dr. Francis Collins, who I am happy to say is in the gallery today, researchers have identified genetic markers for a variety of chronic health conditions and increased the potential for early treatment and the prevention of numerous genetic-based diseases. There are already genetic tests for over 1,000 diseases, and hundreds more are under development. 
   Let me mention just two of them. Just this week we heard from newspapers that in London and work being done in Pittsburgh, and I believe it's the University of Pennsylvania, has restored some eyesight to people who were disposed to a genetic disease that harmed their vision as children. To be able to restore eyesight is something none of us had ever dreamed of being able to do. But by injecting genetic material into the back of the eye behind the retina, they have received some sight. They believe that once they are able to do this in younger children and be able to increase the dose that the success rate will be extremely high, and that, in itself, is such good news. 
   Also yesterday the New York Times reported that the gene has been isolated for osteoporosis and for fragile bones. I remember when we were fighting for the Office of Women's Health, the statistic we used for osteoporosis was that we spent between $20 and $30 billion a year, and this was years ago, 10 or 15, all that much money to treat osteoporosis. At that point we had no treatment for it. We just tried to do the best we could. We have over time achieved some treatments for osteoporosis, but think what would happen if once we find that gene, we are able to manipulate that gene or change it and prevent osteoporosis altogether? 
   The great thing about this science is the limitless possibility to cure human conditions without long hospital stays, without invasive surgeries, and there are possibilities there for an entirely new way for us to provide health care. 
   Now, consider if these tests we know that can tell a woman if she has a family history of breast cancer, if she has a genetic predisposition. For at least the 10 years, I have been told by women  who are in that condition and also by their physicians that they have recommended to them that until a bill such as the one we are passing today becomes law in this country, they should not put at risk their health insurance, many of them who are the sole provider for health insurance for their families, or their jobs. We believe, the estimates are, that about 22 percent of Americans have already been discriminated against. We have numerous cases of people who have lost their jobs. So the most important thing to show what rank discrimination that has been is that having the gene is only predictive. It does not say that you are doomed to have it. Indeed, it could be 20 or 30 years away, if at all. To deny a person health insurance and employment on that kind of proposition is nothing but discrimination. 
   We know now that numbers of people are going to go out to get the tests that they need to be able to plan for the rest of their lives, constituents that we have all had with Alzheimer's who want to plan for their future. So in addition to improving health care for millions, it's going to give the scientists and our medical researchers invaluable insight on how to combat and even cure diseases in the future. 
   I don't think we're going to realize what a wonderful day this is for us until someone in your family is faced with this and that you can have a cure for them. It is totally remarkable. I honestly believe that, being here in Congress for 22 years, which has meant so much to me and for which I am so grateful to my constituents, that this piece of legislation and what we have done here is the most important thing that I shall ever do in my life and certainly in my time as a legislator. 
   I'm enormously grateful to everybody who has supported this and all the people who have worked on it all these many years, never getting discouraged, always working every 2 years, refiling the bill, getting all the cosponsors, and fighting for passage. That wonderful day now has come. I especially want to give my thanks to my colleague JUDY BIGGERT for all the wonderful work that she has done.  
   Madam Speaker, to give you an idea of the potential that exists, consider that genetic tests can tell a woman with a family history of breast cancer if she has the genetic mutation that causes it long before the cancer develops. 
   Armed with this information, this woman can make important health decisions on when to engage in preventative care and when to seek early treatment. 
   And in doing so, we can cut down on hospital stays and invasive surgeries while allowing medical treatments to be more personalized. 
   Madam Speaker, in addition to improving health care for millions of individuals, genetic testing gives our scientists and medical researchers invaluable insight into how to combat and, perhaps, even cure these diseases in the future. 
   However, for the potential of genetic research to be realized, we need to make genetic testing something that is commonplace, rather than something that is feared. 
   Unfortunately, because no one has perfect genes, no one is immune to genetic discrimination. And the threat of discrimination is holding men and women back from participating in clinical trials that will lead to the medical breakthroughs of the 21st Century. 
   Madam Speaker, their fears are not unfounded. Genetic discrimination is real and is happening today. 
   A 2001 survey of employer medical testing practices found that 1.3 percent of companies test employees for sickle cell anemia, 0.4 percent test for Huntington's Disease, and 20.1 percent ask about family medical history. 
   During the 1970s, many African Americans were denied jobs and health insurance based on their carrier status for sickle cell anemia. 
   More recently, many have heard about the 2002 Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation case where the company paid a $2.2 million settlement after it tested its employees for a genetic marker dubiously associated with carpel tunnel syndrome. 
   In North Carolina, a woman was fired after a genetic test revealed her risk for a lung disorder even though she had already begun the treatments that would keep her healthy. 
   There was even an instance of an adoption agency refusing to allow a woman at risk for Huntington's disease to adopt a child. 
   These abuses have only fed the public fear of genetic discrimination, leading many Americans to forgo genetic testing even if it may help avert premature death. 
   Sixty-six percent of Americans are concerned about how their genetic information would be stored and who would have access to it. 
   Seventy-two percent of the American public believes that the government should establish laws and regulations to protect the privacy of one's genetic information. 
   Madam Speaker, genetic discrimination is wrong on two fronts. 
   First, it is critical to remember that simply carrying a given genetic mutation does not guarantee that one will develop the disorder. It merely confers a level of risk upon the carrier. 
   Given that scientists cannot accurately predict when or whether a carrier will develop a genetic disorder, it is illogical to allow this information to be used by health insurers and employers for discriminatory purposes. 
   Secondly, and very importantly, if individuals do not participate in clinical trials, we will never be able to reap the real benefits of genetic science. 
   In a 2003 editorial, Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Human Genome Research Institute, and James Watson made a persuasive argument in favor of non-discrimination legislation like GINA. 
   They wrote, and I quote: ``Genetic discrimination has the potential to affect people's lives in terms of jobs and insurance, but there is another dimension as well: It can slow the pace of the scientific discovery that will yield crucial medical advances.'' End quote. 
   Madam Speaker, as I have mentioned, this legislation began 13 years ago and has had quite a ride going back and forth between the House and the Senate. 
   I would like to take a moment to speak briefly about the evolution of this bill and the agreements that we have made so that it could end up here today. 
   In order for us to move forward, we addressed some of the concerns about the legislation, specifically about the threat of frivolous lawsuits. 
   Several years back, we made sure that if an employer inadvertently receives a person's genetic information, they could not be sued unless they used that information to discriminate against the employee. 
   Within the past few weeks, we were able to work out a clarification regarding the so-called ``firewall'' issue. 
   This agreement makes both sides happy and still preserves 40 years of civil rights law by ensuring that employers are held accountable under civil rights remedies. 
   In addition, this bill requires that before an individual can go to court, the EEOC has to review their claim and determine if it has merit. 
   I am very pleased that we were able to work together to ensure the success of this critical legislation. 
   And, Madam Speaker, while there have been some opponents to this bill over the years, there have mostly been allies. 
   I hold here in my hand 514 letters of support from a wide spectrum of health, scientific, and medical-related organizations. 
   Here in Congress, we have over 220 cosponsors, both Democrats and Republicans. 
   Just over a year ago, this body passed GINA 420-3, and last week, the Senate once again passed this bill unanimously by a vote of 95-0. 
   Even the White House has come out in support of genetic nondiscrimination legislation. 
   Before I close, I want to take a moment to thank the lead Republican cosponsor of this bill, Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT. Without her and her staffs hard work, today would simply not have been possible. 
   I also want to thank Congresswoman ANNA ESHOO for her strong advocacy on behalf of this bill over the years. 
   I want to thank Senators KENNEDY, SNOWE and ENZI for championing this bill through the Senate. 
   And I especially want to thank Dr. Francis Collins for his support. His testimony last year before three House Committees should have swayed even the firmest nonbelievers that genetics has the potential to change our health care system as we know it. 
   I am so proud to have played a role in making this legislation possible--legislation that not only will stamp out a form of discrimination, but will allow us to realize the tremendous potential of genetic research. 
   By passing this legislation today, we open the door to usher in a whole new era of health care and change the course of human history. 
   Millions of Americans have waited far too long for these protections, but I'm so pleased the wait is almost over. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill once again.  
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I really don't want to do this, because I don't understand this previous question on a bill of this importance, but I do need to say, just for the record, that Speaker Pelosi has brought to the floor three times bills to lower gas prices; to crack down on price gouging, on holding OPEC accountable, and repealing the subsidies for profit-rich Big Oil. Every time, almost unanimously, the Republicans in this House voted against it. She has called to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and she has asked for a study on price gouging. 
   Give us some help, for heaven's sake, so we can get this done. In the previous 7 years there was nothing here at all, except more and more subsidies to Big Oil.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1388 provides for consideration of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule makes in order six amendments which are printed in the Rules Committee report, and the rule also provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, our great Nation recently celebrated the 160th anniversary of the 1848 Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, New York. This groundbreaking convention was dedicated to the key principle in the Declaration of Independence that we are all created equal. Women have had a hard time to recognize that because it took more than 70 years for us to pass legislation giving women the right to vote. 
   But in the years since Seneca Falls, generations of courageous women have made great strides towards equality. From securing a woman's right to vote in 1920 to serving our country in World War II, American women have come a long way. In this Congress alone, we have much to celebrate. Speaker Pelosi is the first woman to lead this esteemed body. And Senator Clinton made ``18 million cracks'' in the Nation's highest glass ceiling as the first woman to run a formidable Presidential campaign. 
   Yet as we celebrate these important milestones and look back on all we  have achieved since 1848, we know full well that our journey toward gender equality is not complete. Despite the strong leadership of several generations of women, we are still struggling to achieve equality in the workplace. Among the most distressing disparities is the significant gap in pay between American men and women as they work side by side doing the very same work. 
   Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago President John F. Kennedy signed into law the Equal Pay Act to address the unconscionable practice of paying women less for the same job. That was 45 years ago and we still struggle. At that time when this bill was signed, women were earning 59 cents for each dollar earned by a man in a comparable job. While the wage gap has narrowed, today the working women in America still earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. In other words, let me put it this way, 18 cents more has been achieved in the past 45 years. 
   According to the Department of Labor, which maintains data on over 300 job classifications, men are paid more in each and every category. This is so important, I'm going to say it again. The Department of Labor says in 300 job classifications, men are paid more in each and every 1 of them. Even in what they call the female-dominated industries where women comprise 70 percent of that labor force, women earn 20 percent less than their male coworkers. 
   Experts estimate that the average woman worker will lose anywhere from $200,000 to $2 million over her lifetime as a result of the wage gap. Over time women earn significantly less than men, and lower wages translate into less income that counts in calculating pensions and in some cases Social Security benefits. Closing the wage gap will have a long-term impact on the women's economic security, especially in retirement. 
   To all the cynics who dismiss equal pay as just another women's issue, I want to point out that the wage gap not only hurts women, it hurts families. It hurts children being raised by single moms who have to work two jobs to make ends meet when one might suffice were she to be paid equally with her male coworkers. It hurts families with two working parents who are struggling as one partner makes 20 percent less than her male colleagues. Currently, single women who are heads of households are twice as likely to be in poverty as single fathers. Again, currently single women who are heads of households are twice as likely to be in poverty as single fathers. That is a fact that we must face here and remedy. And we know that pay equity for women is closely linked to eradicating poverty. For families who live below or near the poverty line, the equal pay for women will make a significant difference to the well-being of American families. And after all, Mr. Speaker, isn't that why we are here? 
   Despite these statistics and shocking data that indicates that men make over 20 percent more than their female colleagues on average, the Supreme Court dealt a blow to working women last year when it decided Ledbetter v. Goodyear. In that case, former Goodyear employee Lilly Ledbetter, an employee of 28 years, sued the company after she left the company after discovering she had been paid significantly less than male employees doing the same job during her nearly two decades of employment. And remember, Mr. Speaker, that the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was in effect at that time. Though Ms. Ledbetter was clearly treated as a second-class employee, although she got wonderful ratings and compliments on her job, the Supreme Court let Goodyear off the hook on what I think is a misrepresentation of the law. 
   The Supreme Court ruled that in order to enforce her right to be paid fairly, Ms. Ledbetter would have had to file a wage discrimination complaint within 180 days of when the discrimination began. Now, imagine that. You're new on the job. You're happy to be there. You're learning your job. And you have no idea what other people are paid or whether you're being discriminated against. That shows you the grave mistake made by the Supreme Court. But since pay practices typically take place in secret, it would be impossible for a woman to discover discrimination within a 180-day window that she has to file a claim. 
   Justice Ginsberg, the only woman serving on the Court, wisely noted that the Ledbetter decision essentially gutted legislative protections against discriminatory pay practices. Again, that would have been the law of 1963. In its Ledbetter ruling, the Supreme Court has all but endorsed gender discrimination in employment by robbing women of a legal remedy to enforce equality. One certainly understands that we need more women on the United States Supreme Court. 
   To overcome these efforts to nullify the Equal Pay Act, we must redouble our efforts to insist that Lilly Ledbetter and the countless hardworking women like her in America are compensated fairly. 
   Earlier this month I was proud to join Speaker Pelosi, Senator Clinton, Rosa DeLauro, Lilly Ledbetter, and many of my colleagues at an event in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act.     
   This legislation we are debating today prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who discuss salary information with coworkers. Can you imagine that in most companies that is against the rules? It puts gender-based discrimination sanctions on equal footing with other forms of wage discrimination by allowing women to sue for compensatory and punitive damages, and it will help prevent future pay disparities by requiring the Department of Labor to expand outreach to employers and to continue to collect and share wage information based on gender. 
   Finally, it creates a grant program to strengthen the negotiation skills of girls and women to help our daughters fight for the compensation to which they are entitled. 
   Today, we have an historic opportunity to stand up for the women of America and say, You deserve equal pay for equal work. Today, we have an opportunity and an obligation to stand up for our mothers and daughters and sisters and nieces who are making less than their male counterparts for the exact same work. 
   Today, even though it is late in the day, we have an opportunity to secure the promise of America so that tomorrow our daughters and sons and granddaughters and grandsons will all have equal opportunity to achieve the American dream. Until we do, we will never reach the gender equality that women and men present at the 1848 Women's Rights Convention aspired to achieve. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is our responsibility to the working women in our lives and to the generations of hardworking women who came before us to support this legislation. It is my sincere hope that this bill will soon become law, and I implore my colleagues to vote for it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I feel compelled to explain to the listening persons and those in our galley why we are here today. 
   The other side has consistently talked as though this is an energy bill, but let me remind all of us that this is an opportunity for the United States to bring into compliance with pay scales, in compliance with the law of 1963 for women who, as my colleague Ms. DeLauro pointed out, comprise 40 percent of the workforce. 
   This legislation cures a wrong that has cost many women between $400,000 and $2 million, not only in the lost wages they should have been paid had there been equality, but also indirectly their pensions and their Social Security in many cases. This hurts families, Mr. Speaker. This hurts single parents who are trying, oftentimes doing two jobs, to try to keep food on the table. 
   All the statistics show, which absolutely astonished me, that more women who are single heads of household than men are under the poverty line. One reason for that is they did not get equal pay. We have to right this wrong. We have to do it today. I can't express enough my gratitude for Congresswoman DeLauro and the Women's Caucus for all the work that they have done. But it has been since 1963, 45 years ago, when the law was passed demanding equal pay. And here we are in 2008, Mr. Speaker, and we still don't have it. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on the previous question, yes on the rule, and, by all means, yes on the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, this week on the floor, the House will provide our Nation with a clear, unambiguous answer to the most important question facing the country: Will this body side with the President's approach to the war in Iraq, or will we demand change? 
   Since Tuesday we have been debating President Bush's plan to escalate the war in Iraq. It is a debate that was long overdue and one which the American people and our troops risking their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve. 
   The simple reality is that two-thirds of the American public, including myself, do not trust the President's judgment when it comes to the war. It is a conflict that has been defined by mismanagement and misinformation since it began, and the results have been devastating for the Iraqi people and for our men and women in uniform. 
   We know that top administration officials, men like Douglas Feith, abused the public trust and misused the work of the intelligence community when making the case for the war. Since then, every piece of evidence suggests that the strategy employed by this administration has failed in Iraq. Sectarian strife in Iraq has not abated, with routine bombings that kill dozens of civilians daily. The unemployment rate in Iraq is as high as 25 percent and 40 percent. Baghdad has only a few hours of electricity per day. 
   Our troops have continued to pay the price of being caught in the middle of  another nation's civil war. 84 troops were killed last month, 48 more have been killed already this month. 
   At the same time, Mr. Speaker, corruption, fraud and lack of oversight have haunted every aspect of our involvement in Iraq. Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, has uncovered $10 billion in reconstruction funding that simply disappeared once it was sent overseas. Projects critical to the rebuilding and stabilization of Iraq society have been handed out to private firms, using no-bid contracts, firms that failed to live up to their responsibilities. 
   To cite one example, the construction of a new Baghdad police college to train Iraqi security officers, a $75 million project of vital importance to stability, was completely undermined by a private construction company. The work was so shoddy that the classrooms it built posed a health risk to the students and had to be abandoned. That same fraud and lack of oversight for years have posed mortal risk to our soldiers. 
   In January of 2006, we learned that 80 percent of the U.S. Marines who had died of upper body wounds in Iraq would have lived if they had had the proper armor. A Pentagon report released last month stated once again that our troops have been sent into battle time and time again without proper armor equipment, a reality which still exists today. 
   This simply hasn't been a case of going to war with the army you have, as Mr. Rumsfeld said. We have faced these shortages in part because the Pentagon contracts were given to companies who weren't up to the job and couldn't meet the demands of the conflict. 
   A legitimate question might be, are we funding the troops or are we funding crooked contractors and Iraqi government officials? Hundreds of dollars have simply disappeared. These are borrowed dollars, ladies and gentlemen, mainly from China. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle made two arguments against the resolution. They have told us that to condemn the President's surge means that this Congress is giving up in Iraq, and they told us that we cannot support the troops without supporting their mission. 
   Our troops have done their job in Iraq and they have risked their lives countless times, but now they are being asked to do something that no army can do, find a military solution to a political problem. If the mission we have given our brave soldiers is the wrong one, and the past 4 years prove that it is, why would we help our enemies by refusing to change course? If that mission is the wrong one, how is supporting the mission that is wrong supporting the troops? If the mission is the wrong one, then how is demanding a change giving up? Giving up means just the opposite, it means insisting on a continuing failing strategy. 
   This escalation of the war is the same failed strategy, all it will do is put more and more of our young men and women in harm's way. That reality has led it to be opposed by a bipartisan majority in this House. A Republican Representative recently said, ``This is not a fresh approach, it is just more of the same.'' 
   The plan has been publicly opposed by numerous high-ranking generals, such as General John Abizaid, General Colin Powell and General James T. Conway, the Commandant of the Marine Corps. He recently said that the Joint Chiefs ``do not believe that just adding numbers for the sake of adding numbers, just thickening the mix, is the necessary way to go.'' 
   We need to stop this escalation and change what we are doing in Iraq. We need to promote a political solution and a diplomatic solution to the problems. 
   I urge the passage of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 878 provides 1 hour of debate on the motion by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations to concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 2764, the Department of State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Act with each of the two House amendments printed in the report accompanying the resolution. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the motion except those arising out of clause 10 of rule XXI, and provides that the Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. 
   The rule directs the Chair to divide the question of adoption of the motion between the two House amendments; and, finally, it provides that the Chair may postpone further consideration of the motion to a time designated by the Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is our constitutional obligation to ensure that our government is running efficiently, from our children who need quality education to our veterans who need the benefits promised to them when they put their lives on the line for their country, and to our senior citizens who need access to health care and affordable prescription drugs. 
   And I am proud to say that we, here in the House of Representatives, have fulfilled our fiscal responsibility to the American people by passing all 12 of our appropriations bills on time. We've also used our time this year to pass all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, to increase the minimum wage, to promote a 21st century jobs and global economic initiative, add much needed funds to the gulf coast following hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and to undertake the largest expansion of college aid since the GI Bill in 1944. 
   We also passed the widely acclaimed landmark lobbying and ethics reforms standards, enacted PAYGO, resulting in no new deficit spending, and passed an unprecedented energy bill that will help our Nation to be more energy efficient, while addressing global warming. 
   We will not soon forget that, of the 12 appropriations bills that we were supposed to have passed in 2006 when Republicans controlled the Chamber, only two were completed. The others were abandoned, requiring the incoming Democrat majority to meet the responsibilities abdicated by an outgoing party that now claims a mantle of fiscal responsibility. Simply put, we were forced to clean up their mess. 
   And according to the Office of Management and Budget, President Bush and the Republican Congress increased Federal spending by nearly 50 percent, turned record surpluses into record deficits, and increased our national debt by more than $3 trillion. And let's not forget that President Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress doubled our foreign debt to more than $2 trillion, more in 7 years, Mr. Speaker,  more in just 7 years than in the previous 224 years of our Nation combined. Listen to that, America. They did more in 7 years to run up the debt than the previous 224 years of our Nation combined. 
   Now, all this among budget failures that vastly increased our national debt, while leaving the agencies, States and localities in limbo for months concerning their future funding. Let me add to that our children's health program. 
   It is simply astounding to me that the President would request an 11 percent increase for the Pentagon, a 12 percent increase for foreign aid, and $195 billion emergency funding for this terrible war, while in the same breath claiming that any increase in domestic programs needed for the citizens is fiscally irresponsible. 
   We all remember the promises of the Bush administration claiming that, at the most, the Iraq war would cost $50 billion. A recent report issued on November 13 states that the total economic cost of the Iraq war through 2008 exceeds $1.3 trillion, with a projected cost of $3.5 trillion; a long way from $50 billion. 
   I believe the New York Times Editorial Board said it succinctly in their editorial published last week when they wrote, and I quote, ``We know what's behind President Bush's sudden enthusiasm for fiscal discipline after years of running up deficits and debt: Political posturing, just in time for the 2008 election.'' 
   But one should not forget the damage that his administration inflicted by shortchanging domestic programs in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy and his never-ending Iraq war. 
   I will submit this editorial for the Congressional Record.  
   Disabled, and Waiting for Justice 
   We know what is behind President Bush's sudden enthusiasm for fiscal discipline after years of running up deficits and debt: political posturing, just in time for the 2008 election. But one should not forget the damage that his administration has also inflicted by shortchanging important domestic programs in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy and his never-ending Iraq war. 
   A case in point is the worsening bureaucratic delays at the chronically underfunded Social Security Administration that have kept hundreds of thousands of disabled Americans from timely receipt of their Social Security disability benefits. 
   As laid out by Erik Eckholm in the Times on Monday, the backlog of applicants who are awaiting a decision after appealing an initial rejection has soared to 755,000 from 311,000 in 2000. The average wait for an appeals hearing now exceeds 500 days, twice as long as applicants had to wait in 2000. 
   Typically two-thirds of those who appeal eventually win their cases. But during the long wait, their conditions may worsen and their lives often fall apart. More and more people have lost their homes, declared bankruptcy or even died while awaiting an appeals hearing. 
   In one poignant case described by Mr. Eckholm, a North Carolina woman who is tethered to an oxygen tank 24 hours a day has been waiting three years for a decision. She finally got a hearing last month and is awaiting a final verdict, but, meanwhile, she has lost her apartment and alternates sleeping at her daughter's crowded house and a friend's place. 
   The cause of the bottlenecks is well known. There are simply too few administrative law judges--1,025 at present--to keep up with the workload. The Social Security Administration is adopting automated tools and more efficient administrative practices, but virtually everyone agrees that no real dent will be made in the backlog until the agency can hire more judges and support staff. 
   The blame for this debacle lies mostly with the Republicans. For most of this decade, the administration has held the agency's budget requests down and Republican-dominated Congresses have appropriated less than the administration requested. Now the Democratic-led Congress wants to increase funding to the Social Security Administration, and the White House is resisting. 
   Last month, Congress passed a $151 billion health, education and labor spending bill that would have given the Social Security Administration $275 million more than the president requested, enough to hire a lot more judges and provide other vital services. But Mr. Bush vetoed that bill as profligate. 
   Democrats in Congress are working on a compromise to meet Mr. Bush halfway on the whole range of domestic spending bills. The White House is not interested in compromise. 
   If the president remains intransigent, federal agencies may have to limp along under continuing resolutions that maintain last year's spending levels. That would likely, among many other domestic problems, crimp any new hiring at the Social Security Administration and might require furloughs, leading to even longer waits. Mr. Bush should back down from his veto threat and accept a reasonable compromise. Both sides should ensure that real efforts are made to reduce these intolerable backlogs.  
   Mr. Speaker, this week's actions by the President is just one thread in the appalling tapestry that this administration has in its misplaced policies. 
   Democrats believe that running this House right is a matter of pride. We believe it's a matter of having fundamental respect for both the institution in which we serve and for the citizens who have given us the privilege to serve here.     
   In the spirit of working together, we Democrats in Congress collectively extended our hand to those on the other side of the aisle, including the President, to reconcile our differences and pass this important spending bill. 
   In return, we received nothing but the same obstructionism that has plagued our body and our counterpart on the other side of the Capitol. 
   And today, those same Members who once enjoyed the splendors of having a majority in the House, the Senate and a Republican President, now chastise the Democratic Congress for trying to solve their own fiscal blunders. But their cries ring hollow, Mr. Speaker. 
   Democrats have crafted this omnibus appropriations bill that invests in the American people's priorities, that protects our troops and invests in the homefront, and restores funding to the President's devastating cuts to medical research, to college assistance, to job training, and education and health care. 
   And when my fellow Members of Congress and I cast our votes on this floor this evening, we seek to reconcile our ideals with what is possible to achieve. We seek to do both what is right in principle and necessary at any particular point in time and pray that the two are one in the same. 
   In this bill, we fund programs for medical research, and we provide 280,000 more underinsured Americans with access to health care. We added extra funds for title I, special education, teacher quality grants, after-school programs, and Head Start, while also adding more for Pell Grants and other student aid programs. 
   We added extra funds above the President's request to help local communities hire and train more local law enforcement, while also adding more in homeland security grants to better secure our Nation. We also have met the guaranteed levels set in the authorization bill while adding funds for our bridges, which sorely need it. 
   We invest in solar and wind energy, biofuels, and energy efficiency, while also promoting scientific investments and conservation efforts. 
   And I would like to stress that this bill provides $3.7 billion in additional funding for our veterans health. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all agree that it is unfortunate we are forced to pass an omnibus to get our work done at the end of the year. This is especially disheartening because we Democrats in the House of Representatives have been absolute in our pledge to fund important programs and help the American people. And this omnibus comes only as a remedy to the obstructionism in the other body. 
   The President should accept this reasonable compromise and sign it into law. It is a crucial bill that will keep us on our course of fulfilling our promises to the American people, and I believe it is a clear demonstration of the Democrats' devotion to being fiscally responsible with the money given to us by our fellow citizens. 
   As I shared a quote from an editorial from the New York Times earlier, I would like to close with another quote published on November 26. It states: ``It is clear that Mr. Bush's threat to veto Congress' proposed spending bills has nothing to do with fiscal discipline. It's all about appealing to his base and distracting attention from his failings, like Iraq. Mr. Bush will no doubt persist in that mode as long as his Republican allies allow him to.'' I could not agree more. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank my partner, Mrs. Biggert, also for the hard work she has done. It has taken us collectively 12 years to get to this point, and I want to say at the outset we are not talking about some population of people who might have bad genes. We are talking about us, because every one of us has bad genes, between 30 and 40. So this protection goes not just to some employee somewhere, but all of us and the people we love. 
   It is with great pride that I rise today. As a matter of fact, I could not stop smiling all day. With the passage of this bill, we are going to stand up for the future health of our citizens and one of medicine's most promising fields, genetic research. 
   It is almost heartbreaking to me to think that we are 10 years behind in genetic research and the people we could have helped up to now, but it is the culmination of a bipartisan effort to prevent the improper use of genetic information in the workforce and insurance decisions. 
   It is no longer simply the work of science fiction writers. 
   There have been many instances of genetic discrimination, from a woman who was fired after a genetic test revealed her risk for lung disorder, to a social worker who, despite outstanding performance reviews, was dismissed because some member of her family had Huntington's disease. 
   Consider the case of Heidi Williams, an individual diagnosed with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In 2004, she testified that a large health insurance company had denied coverage for her two children because they were carriers for the disease. 
   GINA will make these discriminatory practices illegal by prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to a healthy individual because of a genetic predisposition, which means you may never get the disease, might happen. 
   GINA also bars employers from using genetic information for hiring, firing, job placement or promotion decisions. 
   In the 12 years since I first introduced this legislation, the need for it has grown rapidly. Scientific research has advanced so quickly that we cannot possibly afford to wait any longer. 
   It offers immense potential for early treatment and prevention of numerous diseases. 
   Since the sequencing of the human genome was completed in 2003, researchers have identified genetic markers for a wide variety of health conditions, and new progress is being made every day. 
   Fifteen percent of all cancers are found to have an inherited susceptibility. Ten percent of adult chronic diseases, heart disease and diabetes, America's top killers, have a genetic component. 
   Already, over 15,500 recognized genetic disorders affect 13 million Americans, and each and every one of us, as I said before, and it is so important for you to know this, each and every one of us is in that category of carrying between 5 and 50 bad genes, or predicted genes. They may not be so bad. 
   That is exactly why this bill is so important to all of us, not just those with recognized disorders. There is not a single person on the planet that has perfect genes. Every one of us, and let me make that clear again, are all vulnerable to genetic discrimination. 
   To give you an idea of the potential that exists from this research, consider that a genetic test can tell a woman with a family history of breast cancer if she has the genetic mutation that can cause it, long before the cancer might develop. 
   For these exciting scientific advances to continue, for the potential of this technology to be realized, we have to make genetic testing something commonplace rather than something that is feared and kept secret. 
   But sadly, the threat of genetic discrimination and the fear of being passed over for promotion, forced to pay more for health insurance, or even denied coverage, men and women are much less likely to be tested and to take advantage of that potentially lifesaving information. 
   Most importantly, if individuals do not participate in the clinical trials, we will never be able to reap the great benefits of this genetic technology. 
   In a 2006 Cogent Research poll, 66 percent of respondents said they were concerned about how their genetic information would be stored and who would have access to it. 
   I want to thank everybody, first Dr. Collins who sequenced the human genome and testified before Congress at least 12 times, and I cannot imagine anybody would be not be moved by his testimony. He is here with us today. 
   I want to thank all the committee members, certainly Mrs. Biggert who has worked so hard, and her staff; and the three committees who have jurisdiction here who have done so much for us. Mr. Miller, the first thing I think in January he told me this bill was coming to the floor. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman Eshoo for her untiring effort to help bring this, and certainly the member of my staff who has worked so hard. 
   It is a great day. You may not realize it but it also just turns out to be DNA Day. What a wonderful way to celebrate it.  
   Seventy-two percent agreed that the government should establish laws and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals' genetic information. And 85 percent said that without amending current law, employers would use this information to discriminate. 
   Before I close, I want to reiterate the broad support that this bill enjoys. We have over 220 Democrat and Republican cosponsors behind this bill. 
   In past Congresses, the Senate has passed this bill twice with unanimous support. And I would like to thank the President who today issued a statement of administration policy in support of the bill. 
   I want to take a moment to thank the lead Republican cosponsor of this bill, Congresswoman Judy Biggert for her dedication to this bill, along with Congresswoman Anna Eshoo for being a strong advocate for this bill over the years. 
   I also want to thank Dr. Francis Collins for his support. His testimonies over the years should have swayed even the firmest unbelievers that genetics has the potential to change our health care system as we know it. 
   Lastly, I want to thank the advocates from the health and science community. Over 200 organizations including Hadassah support this bill. 
   GINA will do more than stamp out a new form of discrimination--it will help our country be a leader in a field of scientific research that  holds as much promise as any other in history. 
   And it will allow us to realize the tremendous potential of genetic research without jeopardizing one of the most fundamental privacies that can be imagined. 
   Mr. Speaker, today is a momentous day. 
   And, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1591, U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 332 provides for consideration of the conference report for H.R. 1591, making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes. The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration. It also provides that the conference report shall be considered as read. 
   Mr. Speaker, after 4 years of the administration's relentless mismanagement of the Iraq war, mismanagement that has needlessly endangered our soldiers and lost countless Iraqi lives, this new Democratic Congress is determined to exercise our constitutional duty and to change the Nation's course in Iraq. We are hardly alone in our estimation of what must be done there. 
   A growing chorus of opinion has coalesced around the need for a new direction. Virtually all of our generals agree that this fight cannot be won militarily, and General David Petraeus has said that the American mission in Iraq is 20 percent military and 80 percent political, economic and diplomatic. 
   He is joined by the Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, who applauded this debate, saying it will demonstrate to the Iraqi leadership that America will no longer tolerate an open-ended commitment without any benchmarks for success. 
   James A. Baker and Lee Hamilton of the President's own Iraq Study Group have called for the American military to focus on training Iraqi security forces instead of conducting endless security sweeps. 
   Retired generals have joined in as well. Retired Lieutenant General William E. Odom, to name just one, has said that the proposed change in course will, and I quote, ``re-orient U.S. strategy to achieve regional stability, and win help from many other countries--the only way peace will eventually be achieved.'' 
   What of the people of the United States of America? It is their sons and daughters, their husbands and wives, their friends and family who have fought, have been injured and died in this war by the tens of thousands. 
   They, more than anyone else, have demanded that America's mission in Iraq be changed. This bill is a statement that Congress will no longer fund the war as it exists today. 
   With it, Democrats are demanding accountability and requiring that future support be based on tangible progress being made. We are refusing to ask our soldiers to continue fighting an open-ended battle to achieve goals that are constantly being altered. Such a request is not worthy of their sacrifice. 
   Let me say also that while the President said that this bill is nothing more than a political statement, the opposite is the case. Our bill reconciles hard realities with our most fundamental principles. It both protects our soldiers and seeks to give them the best chance to help to produce a secure Iraq. It could not be more sincere, and it will soon be on the President's desk. If he rejects it, that will be his political statement and not ours. 
   Finally, I must add briefly that this legislation also contains $18 billion to be spent on critically needed health care for the veterans injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly for the traumatic brain injury victims, for Katrina recovery operations, for the avian flu vaccines, wildfire prevention, and for health insurance for children, among many other things. Those things are what supplemental bills have always been for, not to fund wars. 
   The President and his allies have chosen to dismiss this spending as unjustifiable pork. They have asked Congress to deliver a clean bill, in their words, but I can't think of programs much cleaner and more worthy of our support than those I just mentioned. 
   The definition of a great nation is one that has the power to define its own destiny and that uses its strength wisely to help others in need. Insurgents who seek to destroy what is left of the Iraq society are abominable, but they can do far less damage to our country than we do to ourselves by pursuing flawed policies that deplete our Armed Forces, undermine our alliances, and lessen our influence and moral authority around the world.     
   Why should we do what they cannot? 
   At the same time, the Iraqi people deserve so much more than the life of fear they now lead. But America can be true to itself; we must have the humility and the vision to recognize what is working and what is not, and to correct our failures when reality demands it. 
   I believe that we are, indeed, a great Nation, Mr. Speaker. We have the ability to choose our own way forward. Starting today, starting here, we can choose to reject a path that is failing our soldiers, our citizens, and the people of Iraq. And we can set a new course that offers a real chance for a better future instead of endless, unfulfilled promises. 
   This bill is the first step on that new course, and I urge everybody in this body and in the White House to see it for what it truly is. It is not an admission of defeat, but it is proof that our country has the courage and the foresight needed to truly act like the great Nation that we truly are. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely hard pressed to see how some people define ``success.'' 
   I read in the New York Times front page that 80 percent of the marines who died of upper body wounds would have lived if only they had the proper equipment. I know that soldiers who serve in the National Guard and Reserve are losing their homes and their jobs, but never mind about that because the stock market is great. Aren't we doing well? It hasn't hurt us a bit. We haven't called for any sacrifice at all from the American people in this. 
   My heart is broken. I am ashamed and chagrined that this business about  the booming economy could be brought into this debate about life and death. My worry is about the young people who go over there and don't get the proper care that they need. 
   I couldn't believe the testimony of Tillman's brother yesterday and Jessica Lynch who said the military lied about them. What are we doing in this country? The country that fought the Second World War to save this world, we've been reduced to this, that we decide as long as the stock market is good, the world is good, and let them go over there and die because we are going to give them some kind of government we don't even know they want? For heaven sakes, to every man and woman in country there comes a moment to decide, Mr. Speaker. This is one of those moments.     
   We either vote for this rule and this bill, and we tell the President of the United States if he vetoes this, he is absolutely continuing on a road to absolute failure and that we are not going to be a party to it. We want to take care of the soldiers. And if he vetoes the money, it is on his head, not ours. But we will continue until we can get those soldiers and marines out of that morass.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Chairman, I am proud today to offer an amendment to H.R. 1585, the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, that will make certain the Niagara Falls Air Reserve base continues to play an integral role in our homeland defense. 
   The Niagara airbase is home to the 914th Air Reserve and the 107th Air Guard. Both units have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and are responsible for patrols over large metropolitan areas and key infrastructure throughout the Northeast and Midwest. 
   The value of the men and women serving at Niagara was clearly demonstrated during the tragic events of September 11th. The 107th was the first Refueling Wing to fly Combat Air patrols over New York City. In addition, a specialized unit of the 914th, trained in identifying and preparing the remains of disaster victims, was instrumental in the 9/11 recovery mission. 
   The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission determined that the airbase would better serve our Nation if the 107th Guard unit became an Associate Air Wing of the 914th Reserve. 
   This is the first time in Air Force history that a Guard unit will associate with a Reserve unit. Predictably, the Air Force is facing a number of unprecedented challenges in attempting to shift assets around in order to meet the BRAC mandate. 
   I and the Western New York Congressional delegation have been working with the Air Reserve and the Air Guard for over a year and a half to determine the optimal allocation of aircraft at the base to ensure that both units can adequately complete their missions. The uncertainty surrounding what comes next at Niagara has created a lot of anxiety for the service members at the airbase and the Western New York community. The Air Force must determine a way forward with Niagara this year to ensure that the base continues to play a key role in protecting our Nation. 
   Accordingly, my amendment simply directs the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services detailing the Air Force's plan for future aviation assets at the Niagara airbase. I want to thank Chairman SKELTON and his staff for working with me to draft this amendment, and I urge the House to adopt it.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1284 provides for consideration of the Senate amendments to the House amendments to the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 2642, Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008. The rule makes in order a motion by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations that the House, one, concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment numbered 1, and two, concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment numbered 2, with the amendment printed in the Rules Committee report. 
   The motion is debatable for 1 hour and controlled by the Committee on Appropriations, and the Chair shall divide the question between the dispositions of the two Senate amendments. 
   Mr. Speaker, the issue to be debated today could not be of greater consequence to the future of our Nation or the citizens of this body and all of this country. For that reason, the Rules Committee has reported out a rule that gives each Member the opportunity to vote his/her conscience on the most pressing issue of our day: funding for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as critical domestic spending to bring relief to the American people and provide our veterans with access to higher education. 
   This legislation meets the spending requirements made by President Bush  with the exception of the $2.65 billion in disaster relief for the aftermath of the tornadoes and floods that hit the Midwest which was added at the President's request. 
   In addition, the bill includes the $5.8 billion that President Bush asked for to strengthen the levees in New Orleans and does not include a single earmark except those explicitly requested by his administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, in order to bring the legislation forward today, the Democrat majority had to make very difficult decisions. However, making difficult choices is appropriate when deciding issues of great importance such as the war in Iraq, a war that has placed unprecedented strain on this Nation.     
   At no time in our history has America fought a war of this magnitude, or one that is this difficult, with an entirely voluntary military force composed of only 1 percent of the general population. And no one in this country has been asked to sacrifice as our troops and their families have. 
   Our soldiers are well aware of what the current situation means for them, two, three, four, sometimes five deployments of duty, while their political leaders casually use words like ``political progress'' to justify their redeployment. 
   However, these extraordinary individuals know full well that they return again and again to a conflict that has taken the lives of over 4,000, almost 5,000 now, of their fellow soldiers and 28 from my district alone. 
   They know that tens of thousands of American men and women are returning home wounded and physically disabled, many suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a host of other mental health issues. 
   They know full well that they are redeployed to a civil war that has left millions of Iraqi men, women and children dead and millions more in refugee camps or fleeing to other countries that will accept them. 
   Our soldiers already know quite a lot, and by that I mean, they've come to learn that terms like ``political progress'' are little more than political posturing and empty rhetoric, and that is not how a Nation shows respect for its military. 
   Unfortunately, such disrespect is what our brave men and women in uniform are accustomed to. Our troops were repeatedly promised that they would have the equipment they needed to do their jobs. Yet we all saw the reports of desperate searches through junk heaps to refit ill-equipped armored vehicles. We all heard the stories of struggling families frantically emptying their savings accounts to purchase adequate body armor for their children going off to war. 
   Our troops were repeatedly promised that they would be taken care of when they came home from combat. Yet once again this administration's promises turned out to be nothing more than rhetoric. Remember the disgraceful images of Walter Reed Hospital, and that is not how a grateful Nation shows respect for its troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with this in mind that we proceed today with this legislation. While some pieces of this bill required difficult decisions before it could be brought to the floor, others were easy to make. 
   The bill provides immediate resources to our troops currently in the field, and nothing is more important than their safety and security. And in addition, the bill keeps our promises to our veterans. 
   Part of the cost of waging war is ensuring that those who fight receive the resources that they need to resume their lives when they return home. Given all the sacrifices that our troops have made for this Nation, it is simply unconscionable to nickel and dime them when it comes time for us to keep up our end of the bargain. 
   The underlying legislation includes a dramatic expansion of the education benefits provided to our veterans. Not only do our troops deserve this benefit, the same one provided to veterans of World War II, but for every dollar we spend on education today, we will see a return that will bolster our economy tomorrow. And frankly, our economy needs bolstering. 
   Far too many hardworking Americans are feeling enormous pressure with skyrocketing gas and food prices, unaffordable health care costs, rising college tuition rates, home foreclosures that are far too commonplace, and a terrible job market. 
   Last month's atrocious unemployment numbers highlight the urgent need for assistance to millions of struggling families calling out for relief. In fact, the number of Americans looking for work has grown by 800,000 over the last year, and the number of American jobs has declined by 260,000 since the beginning of 2008. 
   This bill takes immediate action to extend unemployment insurance for workers who have exhausted their benefits by up to 13 weeks in every State. 
   Furthermore, the American people are feeling the pain as their hard-earned tax dollars finance the rebuilding of a foreign Nation while their country's own economy and infrastructure are falling apart at the seams. To that end, this legislation removes the unfair burden placed on the American taxpayer by requiring the Iraqi government to pull its own weight and match U.S. reconstruction money dollar-for-dollar. 
   In addition, it prohibits, once again--and we have to look out for those signing statements--but it prohibits once more the establishment of permanent bases in Iraq, blocking this administration from saddling the American people with a costly occupation long after their soldiers are home. 
   Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation deals with some of the most important issues of the day, our fellow citizens who have been sent to fight in a conflict far away from home, as well as critical domestic spending that will give relief to the millions of Americans struggling just to survive. 
   The structure of the rule we consider today provides each Member the opportunity to cast his or her vote according to their values and their priorities. I am proud to support the rule, and I ask my colleagues to do the same. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I just want to make one brief remark and that is in answer to what my dear friend and colleague Mr. Dreier said about only the United States of America could afford this war. I'm not sure what kind of bookkeeping allows him to say that. Obviously the fact we are in such extraordinary debt, as one speaker on your side already pointed out today, this is an unprecedented debt. In the history of the Republic we have never been so far in debt and to say that we can afford to continue to do this, not just in money, not just in treasure, but what we are losing in lives and young people whose lives will never be the same because of the life-threatening wounds that they are bringing home.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 742 provides for consideration of H.R. 2102, the Free Flow of Information Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
   I rise to speak today on one of the most critical issues that faces our democracy, the freedom of the press and the sacred historic protection afforded to journalists allowing them not to reveal their sources. 
   Understanding this, in 1799, one of our Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson, said, ``Our citizens may be deceived for a while, and have been deceived; but as long as the presses can be protected, we may trust to them for light.'' 
   Madam Speaker, with the birth of this new Nation came a government that was designed to be open and transparent to its people and held accountable for its actions. America's Founding Fathers established and implemented a system of checks and balances to ensure that one branch of government could not unilaterally impose its will on the others, aggressively overstep its authority, or greedily infringe upon the rights of its citizens. 
   Beyond the checks and balances of government is an often overlooked, but equally important, element of our system: the freedom of the press. Embodied in the first amendment, this right grants active citizens and vocal journalists the power to expose corruption and misbehavior committed by those elected and appointed to office. They serve as protectors of our democracy and work to make up for our system's failings where they exist. 
   Ensuring the free flow of information and providing protection for whistleblowers is vital to a free society. The Watergate scandal epitomized the value of the free press and, with it, the need to protect the relationship between journalists and their confidential sources. 
   For a moment, I would like my colleagues to consider a reality in which journalists could routinely be forced to reveal the names of their informants, and where sources could undoubtedly become reluctant to share important information that is unknown to the public. 
   Think of the scandals that journalists have revealed just in the last few years: The Central Intelligence Agency's clandestine prisons across Eastern Europe; Jack Abramoff's trading expensive troops for political favor from lawmakers; our veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan to dilapidated, unsafe, unsanitary facilities at Walter Reed Medical Center. Make no mistake, confidential sources made these reports possible. 
   And I would be remiss if I did not ask my colleagues, would we rather be unaware of these incidents because shield laws don't exist and our reporters are too afraid of prosecution when doing their jobs? 
   The past 6 years have produced one disturbing reminder after another that the legitimacy of our government and the integrity of our democracy are dependent on the ability of journalists to protect their sources. From uncovering the horrifying incidents of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib to revealing the administration's covert domestic spying program, the press managed to expose illegal actions by the executive branch when Congress refused to do so. 
   The public has long valued this relationship as critical to the functioning of an open and free media. Unfortunately, the court record has been more mixed. 
   In December of 1972, the Supreme Court ruled that the journalist-source relationship is not protected under the Constitution. That ruling has allowed journalists to be forced to testify before grand juries about their sources. In response, individual States across the country enacted their own journalist shield laws to guarantee that a member of the press can continue to maintain their anonymous sources without fear of prosecution. 
   In fact, 49 States and the District of Columbia all provide some form of shield law. But there is still no Federal statute providing uniformity. Now, recent Federal court cases are, again,  challenging the critically important relationship between journalists and their sources, arguing that State interests supersede those of a free press. 
   And according to The Washington Post, in recent years, more than 40 reporters have been questioned about their sources, notes and stories in civil and criminal cases. 
   The Free Flow of Information Act before us today would, for the first time on the Federal level, explicitly protect journalists and their sources from the kind of vengeful legal actions that threaten to keep all those necessary whistles unblown. 
   Unless Congress passes a comprehensive shield law that will guarantee the rights of journalists to speak with anonymous sources and ensure their confidentiality, the freedom of the press will be undermined along with the public good it has the power to defend. Any such bill must, of course, take into account the legitimate needs of our government, and this bill does that. 
   Madam Speaker, should we in any way compromise the freedom of the press, we will deny our citizens their right to be informed about their government and retreat from the true nature of the political system that made our government unique. Our forefathers saw fit to enshrine this belief in the very first sentences of our Bill of Rights, and this Congress must continue to guarantee those rights. 
   And today, Madam Speaker, as we debate extending these protections to the press, we must pause to remind the press of their obligation to the public. 
   I regret to say that, for much of the recent past, some of the press, which was intended to be the watchdog of our government, quickly transformed into nothing more than a mouthpiece, exemplified in its coverage and lack of questions on the Iraq war. 
   Madam Speaker, we saw time and time again the tough questions expected by the American people before and after the invasion in Iraq replaced with nothing more than patriotic propaganda and White House talking points. 
   Embedded journalists were fed information and painted rosy scenarios of our invasion and occupation. Those who were skeptical and challenged this spoon-fed information were discredited and sometimes even fired for so much as questioning the actions of the war and this government. 
   Thomas Jefferson said, again, and I quote, ``The press is impotent when it abandons itself to falsehood.'' 
   With all the wonderful protections of the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the press must not only be vigilant, but it must be courageous. 
   And we all remember that it is the prime directive of the press to inform the people. It is their duty to ask the tough questions when the American people are unable to do so. It is their responsibility to shine light on government actions, secret or mundane, and to hold it accountable. 
   And let me finish by asking this simple question. Will the press pay as much attention to Blackwater as they did to Whitewater? I certainly hope so. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I simply want to say that I did hear my colleague say how concerned we all were about corruption and how much we really wanted to do about it. Unfortunately, for the past 3 years nothing on your side was done about it. It was never looked into, despite the fact that our side brought it up numerous times, trying to get bills to the floor and trying to discuss what was going on in Iraq in terms of the loss of taxpayer money. I regret that that has not been acknowledged. This is the first time that we have literally brought up the actual corruption in the Iraq Government.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1514 waives clause 6(a) of rule XIII which requires a two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee. This waiver would apply to any rule reported on the legislative days of Sunday, September 28, and Monday, September 29, 2008. 
   Waiving the same day is not an uncommon procedure. It has been used routinely by the majority party, both Republicans and Democrats, as an important tool to help expedite important legislation, particularly at the end of a legislative session. 
   It is not as common to have a same day rule that covers any measure reported by the Rules Committee. This is the only time in this Congress that this Rules Committee has reported such a measure. All of the previous same day rules have applied to only those specific measures contained in the rule. 
   However, in the 109th Congress, when my good friend, the gentleman from California, was chairman of the Rules Committee, there were five rules reported from the committee that did what this rule does this evening. 
   I want to emphasize to my colleagues that adoption of this rule does not provide for passage of any other rule or any other bill on its own. Any measure brought before this House pursuant to this rule must pass by a majority vote, just like any other measure considered under regular order. 
   What it does do is to allow the House to consider important legislation in a timely fashion. Hopefully, the legislation to help address our Nation's looming financial crisis will be ready for consideration soon. It is very important that this package is considered and adopted by the House as soon as possible. This rule is an important part of the process to make that happen. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am saddened to say that rarely has this body met under more dire circumstances. Our stock market is a roller coaster and the unemployment rate has soared. Many of our financial institutions, some of which were deemed ``too big to fail'' are on the brink of collapse. Our economy, the biggest and most robust in the world, is at a standstill. 
   This is the greatest financial crisis since Herbert Hoover's administration's lack of oversight led our Nation into the Great Depression. 
   We cannot steer ourselves through this crisis until we fully understand the road that we took to get here. After all, if we do not know what went wrong, how can we be sure to get it right in the future? 
   Like so many Americans and Members of the New Direction Congress, I am deeply disappointed by this administration's reckless deregulation that wrecked our once-booming economy. 
   Since the beginning of his first administration, President Bush has put incompetent people in charge of the Nation's most critical regulatory agencies; but because of this administration, big business always came first. 
   A complete loss of transparency and a reliance on voluntary measures led to the total deregulation of the financial services industry. Yet as SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said this week, ``The last 6 months have made it abundantly clear that voluntary regulation does not work.'' 
   He went on to say the program was ``fundamentally flawed from the beginning, because investment banks could  opt in or opt out of supervision voluntarily. The fact that investment bank holding companies could withdraw from this voluntary supervision at their discretion ``diminished the perceived mandate'' and ``weakened its effectiveness.'' 
   As President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ``We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals. We now know that it is bad economics as well.'' 
   This administration should have heeded Roosevelt's advice and followed his path to economic recovery by reinstituting important regulations on Wall Street. It is shocking and shameful that it took this catastrophe to show the administration that big business cannot be expected to regulate itself in good conscience. 
   A recent survey by the University of Michigan found that 9 in 10 Americans feel that the economy is in a recession. It took a crisis of this magnitude to teach this administration what the American people clearly knew. And every day that Americans see the financial sector falter, they lose confidence in our economy. With many of the country's major financial institutions declaring bankruptcy or on the verge of declaring bankruptcy, we no longer have a choice on whether to offer a rescue package. The alternative, we've been told, is pure disaster. 
   Financial failures help no one and put the savings of every family in jeopardy. Our jobs, our retirement savings, our college savings accounts for our children's future, our investments in our own future are at risk due to the failure of this industry. 
   I have heard from hundreds of my constituents who are enraged at the lack of oversight that caused this mess. Congress is going ahead with this intervention because we've been warned that without it, Main Street could feel as much pain as Wall Street. 
   When deregulation happened in the last century, it led to bread lines and Hoovervilles. Today, the New Direction Congress is working to shield Main Street from all of that and to lead us out of this mess to a brighter and more prosperous future. 
   As FDR said, ``There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still.'' And after much deliberation, we are moving forward with a bill that we hope will benefit all Americans. We believe and hope that this legislation can begin to stabilize our markets and start recovering consumer confidence. 
   One week ago, we were handed an ultimatum for a blank check of $700 billion which lacked the very accountability and transparency--let me repeat that because this is so important--that demand for the bailout lacked the very accountability and transparency that contributed to the problem in the first place. And many safeguards, I'm happy to say, have been added to this bill since that time. 
   We've worked hard to ensure that this package benefits consumers and homeowners more than it does the people who caused the crisis. We vowed that any bill that we passed would include serious oversight and transparency of any funds provided to the Secretary of the Treasury, and that's exactly what this proposal does. 
   As the Speaker said, we have a three-part plan to reinvest, reimburse, and to reform. 
   We will first rescue the troubled credit and financial markets to stabilize and to reinvest in our economy and insulate hardworking Americans; second, we will reimburse the taxpayer for every dime as the plan begins to work; and third, we will reform how business is done on Wall Street with no more golden parachutes for CEOs, trimmed executive compensation, and sweeping congressional investigation and regulations to prevent future abuses. 
   By passing this bill, we're standing up for all Americans by ensuring that there will be no help for Wall Street without this help for Main Street. We're standing up for taxpayers by ensuring that this is not a blank check, and we are standing up for homeowners by taking actions to prevent foreclosures that are driving down home values across America. 
   To help Americans keep their homes, this bill will allow the government to help modify loans by reducing the principal, the interest rate, or by increasing their window of time to pay back the loan. 
   Although the administration's initial proposal called for no congressional or agency oversight, Democrats will require an appointed oversight panel to frequently report to the Congress--monthly--on what the Secretary of the Treasury is doing. 
   In addition, Democrats insisted that the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, the GAO, will have an office inside the Department of Treasury to handle the funds. This will help to ensure any money spent is done in a way that is responsible to the American people. 
   We are committed to using as little taxpayer money as is absolutely necessary, and we are set on recovering every cent. 
   Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman will begin his oversight hearings next Wednesday. And in January with a new Congress and a new President, we will be ready to reinstate the regulations so cavalierly removed by the administration which believed that the financial industry could regulate itself--and it has with very dire results. 
   Finally, Democrats pushed to ensure that the government receives shares of any company that it provides with aid. After agreeing to rescue AIG from filing for bankruptcy, the government received a nearly 80 percent share in that company. The action was reassuring enough to the market that people are now clamoring to buy the AIG assets. By making sure the government gets shares of companies that we aid, Democrats are working to revitalize this industry in a way that will benefit the taxpayers who are funding this rescue until the industry recovers; and by doing so, the New Direction Congress is standing up for swift action to ensure a more sound economic future for all Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, we saw what happens when an administration deregulates industry to a point where insecure companies are expected to police themselves. And that is why this Democrat-led Congress is doing everything possible to ensure that America keeps working and that the government is working for America. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 69, FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 869 provides for the consideration of H.J. Res. 69, a simple, 1-week extension of the fiscal year 2008 continuing resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, every Congress has the constitutional responsibility to be good stewards of the money entrusted to it by the American people. It is one of our most important responsibilities. Voters do not expect us to abdicate that responsibility, or any other, for that matter. 
   I am proud to say that we here in the House of Representatives have fulfilled our fiscal responsibility to the American people by passing all of our appropriations bills on time. We in the majority have been absolute in our promise to construct and pass spending bills with broad bipartisan support, and I am proud to say we have delivered on those promises. 
   Of the 12 fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills that have passed the House this year, we have garnered an average of 50 Republican votes, with one bill collecting as many as 187 votes from the minority. And in that spirit of working together, we have successfully pushed ahead our bold and new agenda and passed legislation that prioritizes veterans health care, education and energy independence. 
   Madam Speaker, we all agree that it is unfortunate that we are forced to pass a continuing resolution. But, it is something that must be done to work out the remaining issues that we have. We all understand it is our prime duty to make sure that the government is running efficiently, from our children who need quality education to our veterans who need the benefits promised to them when they signed up to serve our country, and to our senior citizens who need access to health care and affordable prescription drugs. 
   Many on the other side still fought tooth and nail, with some Members holding up the legislative process, in fighting these bipartisan appropriations bills, but we remained focused and strong and passed our bills on time. 
   It is important to note that continuing resolutions are extremely common, with a CR being enacted for every fiscal year since 1954. Additionally, Congress has averaged five continuing resolutions per year. And I would like to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that over the last 10 years of Republican control, the House has considered 75 continuing resolutions. 
   Madam Speaker, this is an important resolution that will allow us to do the work necessary to fulfill our promises to the American people, and I urge its passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this point of order is not about whether or not to consider the rule on, ultimately, the funding of our troops, and indeed, the entire government, under a continuing resolution. In fact, I would say that it is simply an effort to try to kill the conference report, and on a faulty premise at that. 
   Every single earmark in this conference report has been properly disclosed in conformance with House rules. The blanket waiver against consideration of conference did not include a waiver of either clause 9 of rule XXI or House Resolution 491. 
   This parliamentary ruse won't work. We must consider this conference report, which fully supports our men and women, provides for our wounded warriors by providing for them and for their families, addresses the severe equipment shortfalls facing the National Guard and Reserves, and fully funds a pay increase for all servicemembers. In addition, this measure provides the funds necessary to respond to the wildfires of 2007 and provide continued disaster response and relief efforts. 
   Voting ``no'' on this question of consideration will prevent consideration of a critical package that has strong House and Senate bipartisan support.     
   So despite whatever roadblock the other side tries to use to stop the bill, we will stand up for our troops. We must consider this rule. We must pass this conference report today.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 806 provides for consideration of the conference report for H.R. 3222, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is one of the important parts that I hope will answer some questions here. The rule is the standard conference report rule which waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration and provides that the conference report shall be considered as read. 
   However, I want to point out that although the rule waives all points of order, the conference report does not violate either House Resolution 491 or clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI which require earmarks to be disclosed in the conference report and requiring conference reports to be in compliance with the PAYGO rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, this morning I visited the family of a critically injured soldier at Bethesda Naval Medical Center, and I was reminded once again of a sign that stood outside a VA hospital in my former district, a sign that read, ``The price of liberty is visible here.'' 
   This Monday, we will pay tribute to our brave men and women in uniform and remember that they truly are our country's greatest heroes. We must, therefore, do all we can to make certain that they receive the care and benefits that they have earned and the respect and recognition they deserve, not just today, but every single day. 
   I am proud to bring to the floor the 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations legislation and a continuing resolution, the product of many months of hard work. 
   In that spirit, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a smart and compassionate way to strengthen America's security and provide what is necessary for our troops. 
   We do so by investing in the safety and protection of our service men and women both at home and abroad, while providing them with the tools that are necessary to defend our country. This bill also invests in quality health care for military personnel and works to expand our Armed Forces to meet ever-changing threats to our national security. 
   The bill also determines how we as a Nation will spend our considerable resources, both at home and abroad, in order to best protect our fellow Americans, our shared values, and our common interests. 
   This agreement between the House and Senate prioritizes the preparation and safety of our Nation's men and women in uniform and, thus, honors our commitment to our military. It is a definitive statement that we will properly equip our troops before they deploy, provide them with support as they serve in harm's way, and ensure their dignified treatment upon their return. 
   To accomplish that goal, this bill provides $459 billion for the Department of Defense, a $39.7 billion or a 9.5 percent increase from 2007. The money allows us to invest in equipment, in training, and cutting-edge weaponry. Most importantly, however, it restores balance to our ground forces that are badly overstretched by 5 years of war and multiple extended deployments. 
   Make no mistake, our commitment to our fighting men and women does not end on the battlefield. It is our responsibility to ensure that each one is properly covered upon their return home. And I am proud to say that this bill does exactly that, by adding $70 million to fund programs authorized under the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act and providing $23.5 billion for defense health programs, which I must stress, is nearly $1 billion more than the President's request. And it is long overdue. Far too many veterans are left without the treatment that they need or have to wait far too long. 
   The dual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed an unimaginable strain on our military that will take many years to repair. To help remedy this problem, the conference report helps grow the military, including 7,000 new members of the Army, 5,000 new marines, and 1,300 new Army Guard to begin to help repair this strain. 
   It also fully funds a 3.5 percent pay increase for all servicemembers, and  while that is not nearly enough when low-level Blackwater contractors make as much money as four-star generals, it is a step forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, six U.S. soldiers were killed in three separate attacks across Iraq. Those tragic losses brought the number of U.S. soldiers killed to more than 850 this year, making 2007 the deadliest year of the war in Iraq. Let me repeat that. This year, the fifth year of combat in Iraq, is deadlier than any of the years that preceded it. 
   I would be remiss if I did not mention a New York Times article on a secret Pentagon study that found, and I hope everybody absorbs this, a secret study found that 80 percent of the marines who died of upper-body wounds in Iraq could have survived if they had been deployed with better body armor. 
   I was so deeply troubled by reports like these that I asked the Department of Defense's inspector general to investigate the Pentagon's procurement of both vehicle and body armor. The first report issued in July was heartbreaking in its tales of a manufacturer that was unable to produce the number of MRAP vehicles that it had committed to in its contract with DOD; ultimately, without doubt, costing some soldiers their very lives. 
   As we await the second report from the Pentagon on body armor procurement practices, the former CEO of one of those body armor manufacturers, David Brooks, was indicted on multiple counts of fraud by the United States Attorneys in eastern New York. He is accused of having enriched himself to the tune of over $180 million at the expense of the safety of our Armed Forces. I await the report from the inspector general on how that contract was given. It is unconscionable. 
   I am relieved to say in light of these findings, the conference report fittingly directs $11.6 billion to the procurement of MRAP vehicles and increases funding for the body armor and other protective equipment which I hope will be closely monitored by this Congress which is trying so hard to keep up with some oversight that has been missing for over 6 years. 
   The conference report today also provides all of those deploying, deployed, and returning with the resources that they, their families, and our veterans need to sustain them through a time of war. But all of the body armor in the world, all of the MRAPs, cannot stop the violence in Iraq and prevent the casualties and deaths of our young men and women facing combat in Iraq. 
   It is my fervent hope and desire that we can bring our troops home before next year becomes the deadliest year in this tragic war. 
   As we face troubles abroad, Mr. Speaker, we here at home are constantly reminded of the toll that the war in Iraq is taking on our national security. The dire shortage of National Guard equipment was underscored these past few weeks as America watched with horror the wildfires devastating Southern California. 
   The San Francisco Chronicle reported in May that only half of California's National Guard equipment was available because much of it, almost a billion dollars' worth, had been left in Iraq. 
   In my home State of New York, the National Guard is operating with 40 percent of its equipment and only 35 percent of its trucks and authorized vehicles. Simply put, we cannot afford to continue shortchanging our domestic priorities. 
   To help put our priorities and Nation back in order, Mr. Speaker, today we will provide $500 million to respond to the California wildfires, along with allocating $2.9 billion to FEMA for continued disaster relief efforts and $3 billion for the ``Road Home'' program to assist people who are still searching for homes damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
   Additionally, we add $980 million for the National Guard and Reserve to replenish their equipment which has become so strained due to our conflicts abroad. 
   Mr. Speaker, let us honor the service of our troops, their families, and America's veterans by passing this conference report and fulfilling our commitment to those who sacrifice so much. 
   I hope my colleagues will use the upcoming Veterans Day to reflect on what kind of an America they wish to create for future generations. And it is my hope that we in Congress take the question very seriously in the coming months and years ahead. 
   I have faith in this body, just as I have faith in this Nation, that we will possess the wisdom to do what is right and the courage to right what is wrong. The future of our national security depends on it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (WAIVING CLAIMS TO CERTAIN DOCUMENTS RELATING TO FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to support HR 6669, a bill that will waive and relinquish claims by the United States to certain documents relating to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This legislation would allow the transfer of the Tully/Suckley papers from the Sun Times Media to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library. These papers shed a great deal of light on the FDR era and are the largest collection of FDR documents and memorabilia in private hands. 
   Franklin Delano Roosevelt started his political career in New York State by working vigorously for reform movements that would redefine the role of government, and he never stopped. The programs that epitomized the New Deal had their genesis in Albany. As governor, Roosevelt implemented many of the innovative, progressive policies he would later introduce to the Nation as President. He expanded state assistance to social services and state agencies and eased the hardships on New York's agricultural industry by encouraging tax cuts for small farmers. Upon the onset of the Great Depression, he authorized the New York State Unemployment Relief Act and the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration. 
   In 1928, Roosevelt won the Democratic nomination for Governor at the Naval Armory in my home city of Rochester, New York. While serving as Governor, his successes elevated him to national prominence, and in 1932, he was elected President of the United States for the first of an unprecedented--and never to be repeated--four terms in office. 
   Franklin Roosevelt embraced the unique capabilities of every individual and worked tirelessly to ensure that all Americans would be able to earn a living and build this great Nation. As a result of initiatives like the PWA, the  WPA, and the CCC, the unemployed got jobs, people were able to support their families, and this Nation was able to grow and prosper. I hope that, as public servants, my colleagues will join me in following in his example by supporting honest policies that work to better the lives of American people. 
   Franklin Roosevelt had great regard for public service, and served with a sense of responsibility and honor. His respect for the American people and the value he placed on their well-being and security drove everything he did. President Roosevelt came to embody strength, hope and resolve during some of the most difficult days in our Nation's history. From the economic distress of the Great Depression to the horrifying attack on Pearl Harbor that caused the Nation to enter World War II, Roosevelt's steadfast leadership ignited an economic engine and calmed a frightened nation. 
   The legacy of his policies will certainly outlast my lifetime and will continue to benefit my children and grandchildren for years to come. We owe him an unpayable debt of gratitude. And while only those closest to him realized that he couldn't walk unaided, as former Governor of New York, Mario Cuomo said, ``Franklin Roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair to lift this nation from its knees.'' 
   Today more than ever, we can learn from Franklin Roosevelt's leadership. There is no better way to do this than to study his past. By allowing the transfer of these documents, it will open up the life of Franklin Roosevelt for everyone to enjoy. With the economic distress that our nation is facing today, we would do well to follow President Roosevelt's example. There is little doubt this nation could use some lifting up right about now. 
   This bill makes sense, is non-controversial, and is for the good of the United States. Please support this legislation that would allow this transfer to the FDR Library. It would shed light on one of the most important Presidents of the 20th Century and greatly consolidate the legacy of the Roosevelt era. I am honored to rise today and support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 438 provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 2206, making emergency supplemental appropriations and additional supplemental appropriations for agricultural and other emergency assistance for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes. 
   Mr. Speaker, when my fellow Members of Congress and I speak and debate and cast our votes on this floor, we seek to reconcile our ideals with what is possible to achieve. We seek to do what is right in principle and necessary at any particular point in time, and pray that the two are one and the same.  
   That struggle has formed the foundation of the fight Democrats have waged since January, and it is the basis of what we are doing today. 
   This war was not challenged by the last Congress. It was supported by the last Congress. It was defended by the last Congress. Year after year, the Republican-led House kept this war alive.     
   But the public rightly lost faith in the war and those who would support it unquestionably. We all know what the result was. 
   The first opportunity the new majority had to change course in Iraq came with the first version of this bill. That legislation conditioned any future support for the conflict upon proof that our efforts were bearing some fruit. What is more, it would have ended the war by August 2008 at the very latest. Democrats, and some Republicans, united, and that bill was passed by the House. 
   Democrats in the Senate agreed, and the conference report that was sent to the President was even stronger. The same benchmarks were in place, but the war was to end 6 months sooner, by March of next year. 
   Our position was clear and unequivocal. For the first time since 2003, a majority of the United States Congress supported a new direction in Iraq, and it was a direction which would lead to an end to the war. The President vetoed that bill. 
   Our Constitution requires two-thirds of the Congress to overcome a veto. Two-thirds of the public stood squarely with the Democrats in this Chamber, and a handful of Republicans, who voted to overcome it. But what we needed was significant support from the other side of the aisle, and we did not get it. 
   Since then the President's made it clear that he will veto any legislation which even mentions the word ``timeline,'' and so he left my fellow Democrats and me with a choice. Some would have us ignore his words and simply send him a new copy of our original bill. I certainly relate to those feelings. 
   But as appealing as this may seem, I do not believe that it would be right. The President and his allies in Congress have put our soldiers in harm's way, and Mr. Bush is willing to keep them there no matter how much they suffer. 
   If this Congress delayed funding by continuing to back a bill we cannot pass at this time, we would not force the President to end the war. All indications are that he would leave our soldiers in Iraq, and without adequate funding, they would have to do even more with even less. 
   The Democratic Party is the party that supports our soldiers. We're the party that fights for them to have proper equipment, training and rest. We're the party that demands that they be given a sensible strategy for victory before going into battle. We're the party that demands that they receive proper medical care once they return. 
   We understand the mistaken judgment and obstinacy of the White House, and so we will not prevent any funding from coming forth from this Congress, an outcome which would permit the President to further add to the struggles that our troops endure every day. 
   Ultimately, of course, supporting the troops means ending the war entirely, and the legislation we bring to the floor today goes as far as is possible at this moment to achieving that goal. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone listening to look at the victories that have been won here. The President previously said he would block any bill which contained benchmarks for the war, but now the only legislation the House will deliver to him contains no fewer than 18 benchmarks linking economic aid to improvements in the Iraqi situation. 
   Furthermore, the President and members of the Republican minority derided what they called ``unrelated spending'' during our first debate on this bill. They did so even though Democrats were seeking only to fill the gaps left by last year's failure to give us a budget. 
   But today we will pass a minimum wage increase. We will increase funding for military health care and for veterans' health care, and critically needed funding for agriculture disaster aid, children's health care, and recovery from Hurricane Katrina. 
   What is critical for all of our citizens to understand is that what is missing from this bill, a timeline to end the war, has been neither forgotten nor conceded by the Democrats in the Congress. 
   To the contrary, our path forward is clear. We will fight every day until the world's greatest deliberative body lives up to its billing and actually represents the will of the people its serves. 
   As I said before, at least two-thirds of the American people oppose the President's approach to Iraq and want this war brought to a close. It's time that two-thirds of this Congress wants the same. And we all know where the remaining votes have to come from. 
   Some days in Iraq are worse than others, but all days there are bloody. Four American soldiers died on Monday. Six more died on Tuesday. Three lost their lives yesterday. Three hundred twenty-one civilians have been anonymously murdered in Baghdad just this month, an average of 13 a day. 
   We must not be afraid to speak what is a simple truth. Every day that the Republican minority in this Congress stands by and empowers the President to perpetuate this war, they are saying the day's deaths in Iraq are acceptable. They're saying that those lives lost are part of a price they're willing to let others pay, other mothers, other fathers, other sisters, other brothers and other children, not theirs. 
   But they are alone. Official Pentagon assessments now speak of Iraq's ``civil war,'' meaning the Pentagon itself has broken now from the White House. The generals on the ground are admitting that our whole approach to Iraq must change. That dialogue, even with insurgent groups the President swore he would never talk to, must replace the open-ended warfare, which means the surge has failed. 
   And, of course, the overwhelming majority of the American people are not willing to accept the sacrifices asked of our soldiers and Iraqi civilians not because of a lack of will, but because of an abundance of reason. They correctly see the war as it is being fought today has never and will never yield the intended results, that our soldiers have been given a mission that has failed them and the people of Iraq time and time again. 
   The Democrats in both Chambers of this Congress stand with them. A handful of principled Republicans stand with us as well, but not yet enough. 
   The American people will continue to demand that their voices be heard. They will continue to demand their Representatives no longer willfully ignore their wishes, and my fellow Democrats and I will continue to demand the same. 
   Together we will struggle until our collective ideals becomes one with what is possible to achieve and until this representative Congress actually represents its constituents and forces the President to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   Perhaps my good friend from California has not heard the news. The Pentagon has now said that we are indeed enmeshed in a civil war and we now have a plan B. What we are going to do now is deal with insurgents so that we can try to pacify them and get pockets of peace somewhere, here and there in Iraq, never mind the Iraqi Government we have been holding up all this time. 
   This may be news to him, but as far as I am concerned, the Pentagon has really called it straight, and I consider it a break with what the White House has been telling us. 
   We know the President said time and again he would never negotiate with any insurgents. Well, that was yesterday.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 387 provides for consideration of three bills, including the supplemental appropriations for the Iraq war. 
   It is striking to realize that for 4 years the war in Iraq has been funded by supplemental appropriations measures. From the beginning the White House has refused to plan ahead. Instead it has counted on Congress to accept its demands and pass one supplemental bill and then another time and time again, with no end in sight and no accountability required in return. 
   The American people have rejected a House that blindly accepts the administration's predictions about Iraq, all the while ceding its role in deciding matters of war and peace, the most solemn responsibility given to the Congress. 
   My fellow Democrats and I promised a new way forward. And so the first funding bill that we delivered to the President reconciled our party's conscience with the brutal realities the war presented to us, realities that we, unlike some in the administration, are willing to acknowledge. 
   We sought then, as we do now, to end this war but to do so responsibly, without adding to the suffering the Iraqi people and our soldiers have already experienced. 
   Our first bill provided the President with all of the funding he requested but attached conditions to it. We asked for the President to stand before the Nation and justify the war. We asked him to show how it was meeting the objectives that he himself had set out: the  promotion of political progress in the country and the increase of internal security in Iraq, all of which is his responsibility. And we said the war would not go on forever, that it must have an end, not an irresponsible end but an end. 
   The President rejected our offer out of hand. He told us that while he would never compromise, we had to. 
   Mr. Speaker, stubbornness is not the same as strength. Being obstinate is not equivalent to having conviction. This President famously told the world that he would refuse to alter his policy in Iraq even if, as he put it, nobody stood by him except his wife and his dog. 
   But he is not making decisions that impact only himself. The weight of his decisions are being borne by the American people and the people of Iraq. His decisions are costing American lives and they are costing Iraqi lives. They are overstretching our military. They are undermining the national security of this Nation. And they are not improving the wretched conditions of the Iraqis the war is theoretically helping. 
   The President must not be allowed to ignore everyone: the majority of the generals, the majority of the House, the majority of the Senate, the majority of the Nation, and the overwhelming majority of the world. He must not be allowed to ignore everyone when it is they who are bearing the burden of his war and suffering the consequences of his administration's mistakes. He must understand that his opinion, as sincere as it may be, is not the only one that matters. He must yield. 
   The bill we are considering today will, once again, give him the chance to acknowledge the demands of the citizens of this country. They are demanding a change of direction in Iraq, and this bill delivers it. 
   This legislation will fund military operations in Iraq between now and July. By then the President's surge plan will be in full effect, and its impact, either positive or negative, will be obvious. The President will report to Congress on the state of political and military progress in Iraq, and then we will vote on whether or not to provide the remaining funds that have been requested. Our degree of financial support at that point will be based not on endless promises or rosy scenarios, but on concrete reality on the ground in Iraq. Accountability is being introduced into the conduct of this war. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me also add that during the last debate on this supplemental, the President and his supporters told us the measure was ``unclean,'' that it contained spending unrelated to the war effort. 
   That spending, Mr. Speaker, was for critical projects the last Congress failed to fund by not passing any budget at all for the year 2007, which included funding for veterans care, recovery from Hurricane Katrina, health insurance for children, home heating oil for low-income families, and much more. In other words, there is nothing dirty about it. My fellow Democrats and I refuse to abandon it. We are going to fund these vital and important projects because people are counting on them. What is more, we campaigned on increasing the minimum wage, and this supplemental spending legislation will do that as well. And I hope we don't hear anything more about so-called ``unrelated spending.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for this body to abandon the destructive rhetoric that has labeled this plan a form of ``surrender.'' It is time to stop branding the Democrats, and a growing number of Republicans, who seek to end this brutal conflict as ``defeatists.'' 
   We want our country to be secure. We want our military to be sound. We want the Iraqi people to be able to live with dignity. But we see that this war fought in this way is undermining all of those goals. And we are not alone. We speak for a clear and vocal majority of the American people, and we represent their wishes. For the sake of our citizens, for our soldiers, and the people of Iraq, we will be heard. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do not want to contradict my colleague from California, but we do not know the pain of this war. Members of Congress know it a little better than most people because we try to comfort the bereaved and visit the ones who are maimed, but we don't really know the pain of this war. We can't know about the 35,000 or more young people with life-altering wounds, people 18 and 19 years old who will live with them for the very rest of their lives. 
   We don't know the loss other people have sustained because nothing much is required of us except to pay the bill of $10 billion a month, mostly borrowed from China, so we can finance this war. 
   There is no compelling reason why we should go on forever with this. Nothing that we are asking the President to put on the Internet is anything but classified and who is going to believe it anyway. 
   If the President is running out of money for the troops, it is simply because he vetoed the money that he asked us for that we sent to him. The fault, the blame lies exclusively with him. 
   And with that I ask all of my colleagues to vote for this rule on both sides of the House. Obviously, numbers of them didn't want to come down and talk today. Please vote for this rule. Cleanse your conscience. Let's do a good thing today for those people who count on us in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7321, AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 1354 provides for consideration of H.R. 7321, the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act. 
   Madam Speaker, once again we find ourselves meeting under dire circumstances: a shaky stock market, the highest unemployment rate in decades, the greatest financial crisis we have seen in generations. 
   Of all the industries that contribute to our economy, the automobile industry has been hit particularly hard. The steep decline in auto sales emerged this past summer when gas prices rose to record-breaking levels and the deepening economic recession further reduced consumer demand for automobiles. Now sales have fallen to the lowest rate in 25 years. 
   The global economic crisis has the American auto industry facing an unprecedented liquidity shortfall that threatens their viability. Should this industry continue its stark descent, or in the worst case scenario fail, it would have a devastating effect on our Nation's workforce as well as our overall prospects for economic recovery. 
   Madam Speaker, the U.S. automobile industry is one of the largest sectors of our economy. Auto companies directly or indirectly support over 4 million American jobs and provide nearly 1 million retirees with pension and health care benefits. In western New York alone, the auto industry supports over 12,000 workers and 13,000 retirees, and the failure of major auto companies could cause generations of auto workers to lose their hard-earned pensions and health care while causing the current livelihood of workers to lose their jobs. It would also threaten the auto suppliers, the dealers, and other related businesses, a domino effect that would certainly cripple our economy. Furthermore, if the auto industry collapses, experts estimate the U.S. trade deficit would grow by over $109 billion or 15.6 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, quite simply, America cannot afford to let Detroit fail. The auto industry is the backbone of American manufacturing, and should it unravel, all the government's work towards stabilizing the financial markets would be in vain. It is in our country's best interest, as we work to pull ourselves out of this recession, to ensure that our auto industry remains viable and competitive. 
   For this reason Democrats have met this administration at the table to work toward a solution to stabilize this industry. The bill before us today is an important bipartisan step in helping to address the crisis that is afflicting not only the auto industry but American families from coast to coast. 
   Our goal with this loan package is to strengthen and to restructure the auto industry and to ensure viability before the crisis further impacts Main Street. Since talks began, Democrats have fought for key measures to protect the American taxpayers. When the automakers first requested funding, Democrats told them to come back with a plan to show us how they would restructure the industry in order to achieve the viability necessary to repay the loan. The package before us today now includes several key oversight provisions. By making $14 billion available in already appropriated loans, the bill will provide a needed boost to the overall economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, what happens to the U.S. auto industry affects us all. The three car companies, for example, purchased $156 billion in parts, materials, and services last year. Supporting jobs in all 50 States, the bill preserves the jobs of 355,000 workers in the United States directly employed by auto industry and an additional 4.5 million Americans working in related industries. 
   The bill contains stringent taxpayer protections, including authorizing our government to take equity stakes in the company through stock warrants  so that taxpayers can benefit if the firms profit and if the value of their shares increases in the future. It contains strong, independent oversight provisions with oversight by both the Government Accountability Office and the Inspector General overseeing the TARP financial rescue funds. It prohibits carmakers receiving loans from owning or leasing corporate jets, and it prohibits senior executives from receiving bonuses or ``golden parachute'' severance packages. 
   The bill requires the companies to restructure or repay the loans. To ensure the companies restructure to achieve viability, increase fuel efficiency, and reduce emissions, the car czar can require immediate repayment of the loan if the company has not made adequate progress by February 15 in developing a long-term restructuring plan. Companies will not get Federal assistance if they fail to submit an acceptable restructuring plan by March 31. 
   Importantly, the bill requires shared sacrifice. Auto executives, employees, labor unions, dealers, suppliers, creditors, and shareholders should and will all participate in the restructuring efforts. 
   The end result will be a vibrant and competitive U.S. auto industry that pursues the aggressive production of energy-efficient advanced technology vehicles and thrives in the 21st century global marketplace. 
   By insisting on transparency and accountability, Congress is ensuring that the auto industry is held accountable for this loan and that American taxpayers will get their money back. 
   We are grateful also for the work of Congresswoman Sutton of Ohio and Congressman LaTourette from Ohio, who has presented a good amendment pertaining to transparency to go along with this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation to take action today, not to simply save the automobile industry but to protect the millions of hardworking men and women across America whose jobs depend on it. We have a responsibility to take action for the line worker in Detroit who works hard every day just to put food on the table for his family or her family. We have a responsibility to the retiree who depends on the pension she earned or he earned through decades of hard work and now relies on it to survive. We have a responsibility to countless American families across this great Nation whose livelihoods depend on the auto industry whether they realize it or not. And unless we act, the well-being of millions will be on the line. From plants to parks, dealerships to driveways, and gas stations to grocery stores, what happens in the automotive industry impacts us all. 
   Mr. Speaker, we face some daunting challenges on our path to economic recovery, but this is a necessary step to build a brighter tomorrow. We know all too well the consequences of failure, which is why it's critical that we pass this package to help get U.S. auto manufacturers back on their feet so they can be competitive and viable in the years ahead. Revitalizing American automakers is not only essential to our economic and national security, it is vital to our fragile economy. And that is why the Democrat-led Congress is doing everything possible to ensure America keeps working and that government keeps working for America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 1533 waives clause 6(a) of rule XIII, which would require a two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee. The waiver would apply to any rule reported through the legislative day of December 13, 2008, that provides for consideration or disposition of a measure to authorize financial assistance to eligible automobile manufacturers. 
   This is not an unusual procedure, particularly at the end of a legislative session. I want to point out that my friends on the other side of the aisle in the 109th Congress reported at least 21 rules that allowed for same-day consideration. In fact, five of those rules waived this requirement against any rule reported from the committee. This rule is for a true emergency. It is for one purpose, and that is to help facilitate the prompt consideration of bipartisan legislation that will prevent the collapse of our domestic auto industry. 
   I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will support this rule so we can move quickly to address this economic crisis before the end of the year and the end of this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 774 provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 3963, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided among and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you on the floor this afternoon with mixed emotions. I along with a majority of Members of the House are disappointed that we have to reintroduce a bill, passed by enormous bipartisan support, which would have provided millions of children across the Nation with access to health care. 
   The memory of what took place here on the House floor a week ago today will not soon be forgotten. On that day, we saw a few Members stand in lockstep with the President and with that deny health care coverage for millions of our children. 
   However, coupled with my disappointment, Mr. Speaker, is the consuming feeling of promise. I have hope for those children, along with a belief that those Members who were unable to break away from the President's mistaken rhetoric will stand for what is right today and vote to overwhelmingly pass this vital legislation. 
   I feel strongly that what motivated me and so many of my colleagues to come to Washington in the first place was the thought that on any day a vote could be held that would improve the lives of millions of people throughout our country. And that is exactly the chance that we have been given here today. 
   We are again granted the chance to vote for a bill that will advance medical care in this country, improve the health of our youngest and neediest citizens, and offer new hope for literally millions of children who would otherwise be left without either. 
   I think everyone listening today recognizes the reality of the situation we face. Should we not act, the health care of millions of children will be yanked away on November 16. Not providing health care to millions of children when given the opportunity to do so is appalling, but to strip away benefits from those who currently have them is simply indefensible. 
   Mr. Speaker, in our vote to expand SCHIP last month, we made a genuine dent in one of the most shameful inadequacies of our health care system: the lack of coverage for millions of America's children. 
   Congress created the State Child Health Insurance Program in 1997 with broad bipartisan support, including some of my colleagues who now oppose it. As a result, over 6 million children currently have health care coverage that otherwise would not. In my home State of New York, over 400,000 children are enrolled, the second highest in the Nation. 
   The SCHIP reauthorization bill would preserve access to health care for 6 million children already enrolled in the program, while bringing desperately needed health care coverage to almost 4 million more children. As a result, in my home State of New York, an additional 268,000 children who need it will have health care coverage. That means they will be able to get their immunizations before starting school, or see the dentist when they have a toothache. 
   This new bill also makes changes by phasing out childless adults after 1 year, and also puts in a cap on children whose parents' income are over 300 percent above the poverty level. The bill also requires States to develop plans and implement recommended best practices for addressing crowd-out. 
   Make no mistake, 43 Governors from red States and blue, 69 Members of the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans, 273 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in the House, and 81 percent of the American public, including a large majority of Republicans, support our bipartisan expansion of SCHIP. 
   Yet, presented with this overwhelming support from all sides, the President decided to dust off his veto pen and with it deny millions of children access to health care. In spite of the unquestionable benefits and in spite of the overwhelming popularity and accomplishments of this program, SCHIP is under attack. 
   We saw reprehensible smear attacks on families who were brought into the public eye to showcase the benefits of the program. In the face of the lifesaving chance that was bestowed on the family due to this program, the harshest rhetoric was not cast against the bill, but against this family, including the children. 
   We saw persons go to the home of one of the families and harass them in public, talk radio and blogs made wild and audacious accusations, and we even saw staffers on Capitol Hill who clearly intended to assist this fabricated, coldhearted smear campaign. 
   It is simply beyond comprehension to me that many are willing to score political points by denigrating our Nation's children, particularly those who owe their very lives to this program. 
   But the American people saw through the attacks. They understood that the health of our Nation's children is simply not worth scoring a few political points. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President chastises the $35 billion bill, which is fully paid for, as ``too expensive.'' And with the same breath, he seeks an additional $190 billion for the Iraq war, all of which is at the expense of the taxpayer. 
   This is simply unconscionable when you realize the amount of money it takes to provide the health care for 10 million children for an entire year is what we spend in Iraq in just 41 days. We need to get our priorities straight. 
   I am enormously proud of the accomplishments we have done this year, from education to health care, but nothing means more to us than SCHIP. The American people expect us to tackle this health challenge before us. Last week we fell short of overturning the veto by just 13 votes. To those Members who know that providing health care to vulnerable children is the right thing to do, I say to you: Join with Democrats and Republicans and with the American people in passing the bill today.  
   Healthy children make a healthy Nation, Mr. Speaker. I hope every Member takes a long and hard look at the bill that we are presenting today and sees not just the words and the numbers, but the faces of 10 million children whose fate they hold in their very hands. 
   It is time to put principles before politics. It is time to stand in defiance of misplaced priorities. And it is time to vote with our Nation's children and provide them with the health care they need and deserve. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to defend this bill and the children of America. 
   It has been painful for me to hear the mischaracterizations again of this bill. In the first place, adults will have 1 more year on this bill. And let me remind everybody listening that the only reason adults are on there is because the Bush administration gave States the right to do it. They will all be gone within 1 year. Nobody will be moved off of private insurance onto the Federal insurance. The bill even allows States to give money to private insurance companies to keep the children on those rolls. 
   I've never heard so much obfuscation, even praising tobacco for medical people to try to stop taking care of America's children. A healthy group of children growing up in this country will absolutely redound on every one of us by the benefits that we will get from it. 
   It is a tragedy to me, it is something that none of us should be able to even tolerate the thought of, that there are children in this country that don't have the vaccinations, that don't have the health care they need, that they are prevented from getting doctors appointments because they have no way to pay for them. 
   It is an obligation if ever there was one. We have an opportunity to do it. It is paid for. We're not asking to increase the debt or anything else. It is a bill that deserves the vote of every Member of the Congress, and the President's signature, if ever there was one.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 406, a resolution celebrating the accomplishments of Title IX. I would like to thank Congresswoman HIRONO for introducing this legislation addressing what is an important issue for women's equality. 
   Title IX requires that schools and colleges receiving Federal funds provide female students with athletic opportunities comparable to those of male students. 
   But as critical as this is, we must all begin to realize that Title IX is about more than civil rights. 
   For many young athletes, the scholarship opportunities afforded by Title IX might be the only way they can go to college. What is more, female athletes tend to graduate at higher rates, perform better in school, are less likely to use drugs and smoke, and have a more positive body image, more confidence, and better self-esteem than non-athletes. 
   As a direct result of Title IX, women's participation in intercollegiate sports has skyrocketed, proving that interest follows opportunity. In 1972, about 30,000 women played college sports. Today, that number has increased by more than 450 percent. Similarly, in 1972, about 200,000 girls participated in high school athletics. Today, that number has increased by more than 900 percent. 
   It would be wrong of me to speak about Title IX without taking time to honor my dear friend and beloved colleague, Patsy Mink. In 1972, Patsy helped to enact Title IX and in honor of her valiant work, Congress renamed Title IX the ``Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act.'' She struggled for 30 years to protect educational equity for men and women, and if she were with us today, I am certain that she would be proud of our continued fight to promote equality for all young women around the country. 
   While we celebrate how far we have come, we must also recognize that we still have a way to go. Women remain underrepresented in school sports, with men receiving 1.3 
   million more high school athletic opportunities and $148 million more athletic scholarship money each year. 
   In the face of such realities, I am proud to join my colleagues to support this resolution, a statement of our determination to recommit ourselves to the causes of education, opportunity, and equality in our society.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 533 provides for consideration of H.R. 2956, the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act, under a closed rule. The rule provides 4 hours of debate, with 3 hours equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services and 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The rule waives all points of order against the bill and its consideration except those arising under clause 9 or 10 under rule XX. The rule provides for one motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's be very clear about what we will be told today by the President. We will be told that adequate progress has been made in some areas of Iraq but more work needs to be done in others. What this really means, of course, is that once again security and political benchmarks have not been met, that vast areas in Baghdad that were supposed to be under control by now are not, that a drop in violence in some areas has been met with increases in violence elsewhere, that political compromises are not being made with sufficient speed by the Iraqi leadership, nor is there any available evidence that the situation is going to change, that the escalation will suddenly become more effective next week or next month. Instead, all signs indicate that in September when General Petraeus reports to Congress, he will deliver the exact same message that we are hearing today: to be patient. 
   But patience means nothing when deadlines are constantly moved. In January a leading Member of the minority said that we would be able to tell in a few months if the escalation was working. Now we hear it is still too early to tell. It has been 7 months. Which prediction are we supposed to believe? 
   As time has advanced, an absence in progress has not been met by an absence in tragedy. At the present rates, between now and September, another 200 Americans will be killed, 200 more families changed forever. And hundreds, if not thousands, more innocent Iraqis will have died as well. 
   We will hear today that to change our course in Iraq will signal defeat. But this willfully ignores the entire history of the Iraq War. After more than 4 years of relentless conflict, including recent months of historically high troop numbers, experts tell us that in Iraq al Qaeda is stronger than ever. A military official told ABC News yesterday al Qaeda's ``operational capability appears to be undiminished.'' 
   The conclusion is clear: The American military is not being given a chance to bring peace to Iraq or to fight our enemies, not because our troops are not good enough but because the current mission is inherently flawed. 
   It is not weakness to admit a strategy is not working and to change it. It is the very opposite: a sign of strength. Our leaders corrected failing courses when they arose during the Civil War and during World War II. Why should this war be different? 
   What Democrats are calling for today is not a retreat. It is not a surrender. It is a statement that Congress will not wait for another ambiguous so-called progress report and will not give the administration another chance to move the goalposts. Instead, we will refuse to needlessly sacrifice our soldiers, weaken our military, undermine our national security, and bleed our country in ways that even the worst terrorists could ever dream of. And it is a statement to the Iraqi people that they will no longer have to live as dual victims: victims of violence and victims of a flawed military strategy that is at best failing to bring peace to the country and at worst perpetuating their suffering. 
   The bill will refocus our troops on fighting terrorists. By doing so, the disastrous strain being placed on our Armed Forces will be lifted without sacrificing security objectives, and their healing can begin. 
   Second, it will remove a strategy from the playing field that is certainly not working and throw open the door to new approaches which may actually succeed. For example, the legislation requires the President to report by January on how he is engaging U.S. allies and regional powers in the effort to bring stability to Iraq. Far from abandoning the Iraqis or lessening American security, we will finally make the rehabilitation of Iraq the international priority that it must become. The only thing we will be abandoning, in other words, Mr. Speaker, is this administration's mistakes. 
   And to my friends on both sides of the aisle, yesterday I received an advance copy of a report from the Defense Department's Inspector General that will be made public today. It detailed the work of some of the first companies to make armored vehicles and armored kits for our soldiers in Iraq. They were given sole-source, unbid contracts even though senior defense officials objected, favoring a competitive process instead. 
   I hope people heard what I said. Senior officials at DOD wanted competitive bidding for these machines, but they were overridden by the Under Secretary of Defense. 
   The results were sadly predictable. The companies failed to meet demand and sent critically important equipment late. Some of the armor that our soldiers were sent had cracks that had simply been painted over to try to fool them instead of fixing it. In certain instances two left doors were sent for the same vehicle. Troops already fighting a deadly foe had to use their precious time and energy to improvise and come up with ways to turn useless equipment into something that could protect them. 
   Our soldiers have been asked to endure terrible hardships, as well have their families, some of which, I am ashamed to say, have been the direct result of the practices of this administration, and they are enduring them to this day and at this very hour. For Congress to leave them there, to ask them to continue fighting to survive under the mounting weight of a flawed mission--that, Mr. Speaker, is the true definition of abandonment. And after 4 years, Democrats are tired of this Congress abandoning our troops to a fate they have never deserved. 
   I would ask everyone in this Chamber how they would justify this continued carnage to the families of our soldiers. With all we know now, how can we still say to the children of those killed or to the young men and women maimed for life, your loss was needed?  
   We cannot. What we must say to them is this: You have given enough. It is time to come home. 
   The American people know what must be done and the majority of this Congress knows what must be done. And all that remains is for those of us here who are still opposed to this bill to decide that they too have had enough and that they will join their countrymen in voting not with the President but with the troops, with the people of Iraq, and with the people of the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2956, RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert into the Record an article from the Washington Post this morning entitled, ``White House Isn't Backing Iraq Study Group Follow-Up,'' and points out that the House voted 355-69 last month to reestablish the study group, but the President is blocking it.  
   White House Isn't Backing Iraq Study Group Follow-Up  
   Despite an overwhelming House vote last month to revive the Iraq Study Group, the White House has blocked reconvening the bipartisan panel to provide a second independent assessment of the military and political situation in Iraq, said several sources involved in the panel's December 2006 report. 
   Co-Chairman Lee H. Hamilton, several panel members and the U.S. Institute of Peace, which ran the study group, were willing to participate, according to Hamilton and the congressionally funded think tank. But the White House did not give the green light for co-chairman and former secretary of state James A. Baker III to participate, and Baker is unwilling to lead a second review without President Bush's approval, according to members of the original panel and sources close to Baker. 
   White House support is critical for any follow-up review. ``It is not likely to happen unless the White House approves it,'' Hamilton, a Democratic former congressman from Indiana, said in an interview. ``The group can't go ahead without its concurrence or acquiescence, as we need travel support and access to documents.'' 
   The White House does not want independent assessments to rival the upcoming Sept. 15 reports by Gen. David H. Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, U.S. officials said. 
   The White House indicated that it sees no need for an immediate follow-up to the report, noting that it is implementing a strategy consistent with many of the panel's recommendations. ``The next report due in September by General Petraeus must include an assessment of our objectives as they relate to Baker-Hamilton. September will be the appropriate time to determine how that strategy is progressing,'' said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe. ``We look forward to remaining in contact with members of the group.'' 
   The House voted 355 to 69 last month to allocate $1 million for the U.S. Institute of Peace to reestablish the group of 10 prominent Republicans and Democrats, which included former Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor, former defense secretary William J. Perry and, until his appointment, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. 
   Congressional sponsors called the White House's reluctance a missed opportunity. ``The ISG provides an opportunity to bring the country together. ..... If you had a serious illness, you would want a second opinion. We are at war. You want to have the best minds looking at a problem,'' said Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), who proposed the ISG and co-sponsored the bill to reconvene it. ``Having another independent, bipartisan assessment will take out the venom in the debate.'' 
   Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), another co-sponsor, warned that the White House's move would cost further support among Republicans. 
   ``It's really shortsighted,'' he said. ``It's going to further isolate the president. ..... You can't rely just on Petraeus and Crocker. They are good people, but they're still in the thick of battle and you need the view from the outside. The fact the White House doesn't want it indicates they are afraid of what the ISG might say.'' 
   The White House did not initially embrace the ISG report. But it has gradually adopted key recommendations, including the controversial proposal to pursue diplomatic talks with Iran and Syria, the countries that have most aided or abetted Iraq's insurgents and illegal militias. Last month, 23 Democrats and 34 Republicans co-sponsored a House bill to implement all the ISG recommendations as the way forward in Iraq. 
   But other groups are pursuing independent reviews of U.S. policy and Iraq's performance. The Iraqi Security Forces Independent Assessment Commission--made up of 14 former generals and defense officials--is examining Iraqi military capabilities. The panel, which is mandated by Congress, is chaired by retired Gen. James L. Jones. The group is currently in Iraq; its report is due in October. 
   The Government Accountability Office is doing a separate congressionally mandated study on the 18 benchmarks set for the Iraqi government to meet. And the U.S. Institute of Peace is reconvening many of the experts the ISG originally relied on to discuss Iraq's future.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).

   Let me just state for the record that this time last when he was Chair, we had three open rules. At this time, we've had eight open rules. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and also on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. I certainly thank the gentlelady for yielding and for her exemplary service on the Rules Committee.  
   Mr. Speaker, we know today that we are in a crisis without question. Families all across this great Nation are wondering if they're going to lose their house, what they're going to do next, burdened by a mortgage crisis that we have not seen in a generation, and it makes me angry. 
   As America's families call out for relief, we have this bipartisan bill before us today to try to address it. As we consider this legislation, we have to ask ourselves why are we in this position and how did we get into this situation in the first place? If we don't know the answer to that, we're not going to be sure that the next generation is not going to be asked to bail out the wealthy. 
   Mr. Speaker, the past 7 years brought some of the most egregious financial blunders this country has ever seen. On a daily basis we discover new evidence of incompetence. Americans have been blindsided by the mortgage crisis just as they were blinded by the savings and loan crisis. Due to the lack of oversight by this administration and the previous Congresses believing that most businesses and agencies should simply police themselves, American families are paying the price at the same time as the cost of gasoline and groceries skyrocket and foreclosure rates continue to climb. 
   We're seeing the evidence of this administration's failed policies play out in neighborhoods across the country. From California to New York, from Texas to Michigan, millions of hardworking families, mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, grandmothers, and grandfathers have had their homes foreclosed, their dreams shattered, and many of them find themselves homeless. 
   Mr. Speaker, recent reports estimate that 1.4 million homes will enter into foreclosure this year alone. It was reported in May that there were 157 new mortgage foreclosures filed every day in New York City. In my district in New York, the housing vacancy rate in Buffalo has risen 46 percent over the past 6 years, and soon the city will own one out of every 12 or 13 homes. That is 7,000 to 8,000 homes. 
   Despite these staggering numbers, our President, the optimist, continues to insist that our financial systems are ``basically sound.'' I have to wonder if the Americans who poured their lives and savings into their homes feel the same way. 
   Make no mistake about it, this crisis didn't jump out of the woodwork yesterday. It has been years in the making. But instead of taking meaningful action to protect Americans, their investments, their livelihood, and the American economy, the administration and the previous Congress has insisted the problem didn't exist. They told Americans a story of a healthy robust economy while the reality they were living told them something quite different. 
   Pervasive greed has replaced the public good. This is the administration that led us into war in Iraq, that won't address global warming, and built an energy policy based on the Enron loophole. Insisting upon living in a dreamworld, this administration failed to take any meaningful action to rein in the housing crisis until it was spiraling completely out of control. The failure to accept the reality of the situation has led us to this problem we're in today. 
   Crucial opportunities were missed to investigate the risky lending practices that Americans are suffering the consequences of today. Opportunities to instill safeguards to ensure that Americans are able to afford their mortgages were lost. 
   Mr. Speaker, the mortgage crisis is complex, and there is enough blame to go around. But it is clear that the lack of oversight allowed, if not encouraged, this crisis, and at the same time, the heads of the GSEs were paid millions of dollars in salary and millions of dollars in bonuses every year for not overseeing the work they were hired to do. 
   At the very least, thorough oversight would have uncovered how risky the lending and investment practices at the root of this crisis actually are--serving as a warning sign to the likely participants. Instead of oversight, they encouraged deregulation. Instead of holding hearings, they allowed big business to run rampant over protecting the most vulnerable Americans. Instead of strengthening our critical safeguards, they looked the other way while our Nation entered into a mortgage meltdown. For the past 7 years, this administration has ignored the needs and security of the American people. 
   Should Americans working every day pay the price for this recklessness? Should retired Americans who depend on their homes for their retirement pay the price for their troubling risks? Should future generations lose their shot at the American dream because of this incompetence? 
   Mr. Speaker, the Congress is not going to stand for it. Like President Franklin Roosevelt, who led this Nation out of our last great economic crisis, this Democrat-led Congress is committed to helping families out of this crisis and ensuring the situation never happens again.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Sadly after 1929, all the safeguards that President Roosevelt put on to have no more bank failures in the United States have almost all been removed. He recognized, President Roosevelt did, the strength of a great nation depends on the strength of its working families, and our strength is about exhausted. 
   Everything that he did, as I say, has been done away in the past 7 years, and I think that restoring some of the safeguards that he put on financial institutions would be a start. 
   The legislation we are considering today was forged by bipartisan consensus, and it will take bipartisan consensus to focus on future legislation to address the issues. This is a short-term solution today to a large and long-term problem. In these troubled times, righting the housing crisis is an important first step to getting our country back on track. 
   Quite simply, ladies and gentlemen, we need stronger regulations, we need real teeth, we need oversight, and we have to clean up the mess. I'm happy that Members on both sides are dedicated to doing that. I implore my colleagues to commit to increased oversight. Together we have to make sure this does not happen again.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1092 relates to the consideration of H.R. 5724, the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. The rule suspends the timelines for House consideration that are in the fast track law with respect to consideration of this specific trade agreement. 
   Mr. Speaker, we in Congress have a fiduciary obligation to ensure that the legislation passed through this Chamber represents the best interests of those that sent us here, the American people. To outsource that very basic legislative responsibility is to advocate the duties constitutionally prescribed to our branch and raises questions as to why we are here in the first place. The situation we find ourselves in today deals directly with that issue. 
   The President has attempted to dictate the legislative schedule of the Congress according to his political calendar. Over the objections of congressional leadership, he sent Congress the Colombia Free Trade Agreement in an attempt to force consideration of the measure within 60 days by using a provision known as Trade Promotion Authority, or fast track. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to dispel a few myths about the action that we take today. The rule we are taking up today does not in any way affect the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. It simply removes the timeline for considering it. It gives the House of Representatives the right to schedule when the agreement is undertaken. 
   There are some who have called into question whether Congress has the right to suspend fast track procedures for trade agreements. One need look no further than the Trade Act of 1974, the legislation that establishes fast track, to see that the very statute itself allows that, like any rule of the House, fast track procedures can be suspended. 
   We have also heard some raise questions about what consequences our action here today will have on the Senate's consideration of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The answer is, it will have no effect. 
   The rule today was necessitated by the partisan and irresponsible actions of the President. Instead of working with Congress to reach agreements on this accord, he instead took the unprecedented step of sending the Colombia trade deal to Congress over the objection of congressional leaders. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people have been promised a lot when it comes to trade. However, in a country whose economy has been devastated by ill-conceived trade deals, it can only be expected that the American people will remain wary. The promise of good-paying work on the horizon has consistently been dashed by the reality of job loss. 
   Last Friday's unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, and more jobs, over 80,000, were lost last month alone. It is yet another indicator of the worsening economic situation facing millions of America's families. Each day it becomes clearer that our country is teetering on the edge of economic disaster, and, for millions, financial ruin is just around the corner. It is simply not the right time to move forward with this trade agreement. 
   The American people deserve an agreement that actually responds to the needs of the American worker, not makes promises that will not be met. By passing the rule today, we will no longer be bound by arbitrary deadlines and the House can bring up the agreement at the appropriate time and under the appropriate conditions. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is yet another reason why this free trade agreement is untimely and requires additional consideration moving toward passage. We have been promised time after time in trade legislation that there would be side agreements protecting the life and work of labor, that there would be environmental safeguards, that there would no longer be child labor. None of that has come true. 
   And it certainly makes one suspicious on this trade bill also because of the number of trade unionists who have been murdered. This makes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement hard to justify, given the continued violence against the union leaders, subsistence farmers, indigenous people and Afro-Colombians. 
   While President Uribe has made some progress, systematic killings are still far too prevalent to warrant the passage of this bill. Persecution of trade unionists is well-known because since the beginning of this year, 12 have already been murdered. Rewarding the Colombia Government with this bill under those conditions eliminates any leverage the U.S. Government has to improve the respect for human rights and the rule of law in the future. 
   To push forward at a time of economic insecurity is simply irresponsible for working families at home. To push forward in the midst of gross violations of human rights in Colombia is simply wrong. 
   It is the prerogative of Congress to suspend fast track if the timing necessitates it and only when it is in the best interests of the American people. By passing the rule today, we are reestablishing the House of Representatives as coequal to the President, and, in do doing so, we are standing up for America's working families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. No. I would like to have my time to close. 
   The people who talk today about free trade never mention fair trade. That's been a problem for me for a long time. If it has not affected their economy, they're very lucky. 
   I happen to represent an economy that has been greatly affected by trade policies that did nothing for the American workers, that did nothing to produce more jobs. The idea that we would again continue to follow that failed policy surprised me. 
   But the most important thing today, we are not debating the Colombia-U.S. Free Trade Compact. What we are debating today is whether or not the House of Representatives is going to take back what it is entitled to take back, and that is, responsibility for scheduling matters that come to the floor for consideration. It is a very important point. We are perfectly entitled to do it under the law. It affects the Senate not a whit. 
   And I am proud, frankly, to say again that our prerogatives, which have been slipping away from us for the past 12 years, all the Congress' prerogatives going to the executive department, that has to stop. And I not only want to stop this one, I would like to regain some of the abilities that we have lost already to represent the people who send us here. 
   I urge everyone to vote ``yes'' on this rules change today.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment before us. 
   The Foreign Operations Appropriations measure in its current form will reduce the number of unintended pregnancies globally, curb the deadly spread of HIV/AIDS, and improve infant and maternal survival rates throughout the developing world. 
   I want to commend my friend and colleague, Congresswoman LOWEY, for including a provision in this measure which provides a targeted exemption from the Global Gag Rule. 
   This will allow NGOs to receive U.S.-donated contraception and condoms. 
   For the past 6 years, the global gag rule has jeopardized access to comprehensive health care for women in developing countries. It has denied NGOs the resources they need to provide necessary medical advice and treatments. 
   The intent of the Global Gag Rule was to restrict abortion. However, by denying access to contraception and condoms, the Gag Rule denies women the opportunity to prevent unintended pregnancies in the first place. 
   With population levels rising and efforts to prevent the spread of HIV increasing, the demand for contraception is higher then ever.  
   More than 200 million women around the world want to control when they have children and protect themselves from HIV, but they can't do so because they lack access to condoms and contraception. 
   Since the Global Gag Rule was reinstated, shipments of contraceptives from the U.S. government have been denied to 20 developing countries throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Its effect on healthcare in these nations has been devastating. 
   In the face of this, the Smith amendment would deny access to contraception and condoms to some of our most valuable NGOs reaching at-risk people of all ages. 
   What would the impact of this cutoff be? 
   Consider that access to contraceptives would prevent an estimated 52 million unintended pregnancies each year. 
   That, in turn, would prevent 22 million abortions. It would also prevent 23 million unplanned births; 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths, and 1.4 million infant deaths. 
   Family planning helps women to have their children during the healthiest times for both mother and child. It has proved critical to the reduction of infant mortality in numerous developing countries. 
   Contraceptive access is also critical to disease prevention. According to the WHO, the leading cause of last year's 4.3 million new HIV cases was unprotected sex. Access to condoms is a matter of life and death. 
   And of those millions, how many were parents? More than 13 million children under the age of 15 have lost one or both parents to AIDS. That is 12 percent of all the orphaned children in the world--more than 10 million children. 
   Cutting off the flow of contraceptives would be an enormous step back for the health of the world's women, children and families. The underlying bill before us takes a commonsense approach to global health that will reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion. It will also help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and improve infant and child survival rates. 
   This amendment would take us in the opposite direction. I urge all of my colleagues to vote no on the Smith/Stupak amendment.

<DOCNO>Ms. SLAUGHTER. (COMMITTEE FUNDING RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 219 provides for consideration of House Resolution 202, the 110th Congress committee funding resolution. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate in the House, equally divided and controlled by the Chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on House Administration. 
   The rule makes in order the committee funding substitute adopted by the Committee on House Administration. It also provides for a new Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, the text of which is printed in the Rules report accompanying the rule. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the resolution and provides that the resolution, as amended, shall be considered as read. 
   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us would allow for the consideration of a bipartisan committee funding resolution. It was reported out of the House Administration Committee with the support of both Chairwoman Millender-McDonald and Ranking Member Ehlers. 
   I want to take a moment to say how pleased I am with the way in which this bill embodies the spirit of fiscal responsibility that is so often advocated by this body. 
   The financial pressures on our government are immense. Recent years have left us with an unprecedented amount of foreign debt. At the same time, my fellow Democrats and I are struggling to ensure the safety of tens and hundreds of thousands of troops abroad, while refusing to shortchange vital domestic programs here at home. 
   The resolution reflects that reality. While not all committees have received the budget increases they hoped for, this funding resolution provides a bipartisan approach to ensuring that they can fulfill their duties and obligations without asking Congress to spend money we don't have. It includes only a 2.4 percent increase in funding from last year, one of the smallest increases in committee funding in the last 12 years. 
   As vital as it is to start bringing home some fiscal sanity back to Washington, there is another reason why the legislation is significant. As a result of actions taken by the Rules Committee yesterday, it now contains a provision that represents a profound departure from the approach that recent Republican Congresses have taken toward one of the most pivotal issues of our time, global warming. 
   Global warming is not merely an environmental issue. It is also a social issue and an economic one. It affects all nations and all peoples, and its consequences, if left unchecked, could produce truly dramatic changes to human society the world over. 
   For decades, evidence has mounted that our planet's temperature is rising, and that evidence has become so universally recognized that it is no longer in dispute. President Bush himself even used the phrase ``climate change'' in his State of the Union Address this year, the first time he has acknowledged it. 
   But the question raised today by some is a different one: Is global warming caused by human activity? Or is it merely a natural phenomenon akin to the last ice age, something that we have to adapt to but we cannot affect? 
   Efforts to break the link in the public imagination between human activity and climate change are still ongoing. Doubt is still being seeded in the public mind. Sometimes these efforts are blunt. Despite the President's recent admission, his administration has also been accused of rewriting sections of impartial Federal scientific reports that tie human activity to global warming. 
   Other times, the efforts are more subtle. We hear all the time Members of this body express their desire to, as they put it, ``get to the bottom'' of the problem of climate change so that we may come to understand its true cause. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I on the Democratic side of the aisle do not share this degree of doubt, nor do we seek to disseminate it. We have been convinced by numerous internationally recognized scientific studies, by years of careful analysis and by endless measurements taken around the world. We have been convinced, as have people the world over, by the overwhelming weight of available, impartial and scientific evidence. We have been convinced of a simple idea, that human beings are altering the planet's environment. 
   And, as such, we have committed ourselves to being the party of personal, environmental responsibility. We have pledged to confront this great challenge before it is beyond our grasp, beyond our ability to change even if we wanted to. 
   We have promised a strong path of action, and this bill represents the first steps along that path taken by this Congress in years, if not ever. 
   The resolution will create a fully funded select committee whose sole purpose will be to focus on global warming. The committee will have 15 members, nine from the majority and six from the minority. It will serve as a much-needed congressional forum for hearings, investigations and discussion, and will have the chance to make recommendations concerning climate change. 
   Simply put, people all the world over can breathe easier because the resolution will institutionalize the commitment of the House of Representatives to confronting global warming. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to take a moment to address one of the criticisms of this rule that is likely to be voiced by the minority. We may be told that a hearing and markup process for the select committee did not take place before the rule was authored. 
   But a question like this one, the question of whether or not we should address global warming, has had an ongoing public hearing for a generation. Numerous arguments on both sides of the question have been made. And at the end of it all, the overwhelming consensus, both among the public and among internationally recognized climate scientists, is that global warming is real; it is human influenced; and it is our responsibility to control.  
   The creation of this select committee is a response to that international public hearing. Democrats have called for the need to fight climate change for years, and today we have the chance to turn that call into action, and we don't intend to waste it. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can't forget that, in 1997, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected the Kyoto Protocol, a path-breaking international effort to control global warming. And we must not forget that, back in 2001, one of the administration's first acts of international significance was the dramatic rejection of that same set of principles. 
   It is time for this House to join the vast majority of the world community that recognizes the threat global warming poses and the role that our Nation plays in it. It is time for us to be leaders on this issue and to take responsibility for our actions. 
   I urge the passage of this rule and of the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to enter into the Record a very important piece of information which has just come my way. 
   Printed in the New York Times this morning: ``Internal memorandums circulated in the Alaskan division of the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service appear to require government biologists or other employees traveling in countries around the Arctic not to discuss climate change, polar bears or sea ice if they are not designated to do so. 
   ``In December, the Bush administration, facing a deadline under a suit by environmental groups, proposed listing polar bears throughout their range as threatened under the Endangered Species Act because the warming climate is causing a summertime retreat of sea ice that the bears use for seal hunting. 
   ``It remains unclear whether such a listing will be issued. Over the past  week, biologists and wildlife officials received a cover note and two sample memorandums to be used as a guide in preparing travel requests. Under the heading `Foreign Travel--New Requirement--Please Review and Comply, Importance: High,' the cover note said.''     
   `` `Please be advised that all foreign travel requests and any future travel requests involving or potentially involving climate change, sea ice and/or polar bears will also require a memorandum from the regional director to the director indicating who'll be the official spokesman on the trip and the one responding to questions on these issues, particularly polar bears.' 
   ``The sample memorandums, described as to be used in written travel requests, indicate that the employees seeking permission to travel `understands the administration's position on climate change, polar bears, and sea ice will not be speaking on or responding to these issues.' 
   ``Electronic copies of the memorandums and cover note were forwarded to The New York Times by Deborah Williams, an environmental campaigner in Alaska and a former Interior Department official in the Clinton administration. 
   `` `This sure sounds like a Soviet-style directive to me,' Ms. Williams said. 
   ``Limits on government scientists' freedom to speak freely about climate change became a heated issue last year after news report showed that political appointees at NASA had canceled journalists' interview requests with climate scientists and discouraged news releases on global warming.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, if there was ever a time for this Congress to take up global warming, and if there was ever a question that it was not the position of this administration to ignore it, I hope this puts it to rest.
